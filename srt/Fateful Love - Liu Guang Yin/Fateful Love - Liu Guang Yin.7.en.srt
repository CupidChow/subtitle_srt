21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,740
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
I didn't expect

23
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,670
your riding skills

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
are quite good.

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Maybe I have some talent.

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,990
Your Highness, the King urgently
summoned you to the palace.

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,960
- What's the matter?
- Eunuch Yin said

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,350
the Xiling's envoy will arrive tomorrow.

29
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,200
It might be because of this.

30
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,710
So soon?

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
Didn't they say earlier

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,510
that it took another two or three days?

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,790
The King didn't expect it,

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,400
so he is in such a hurry.

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,760
In that case,

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,100
- you go back to the mansion first.
- Alright.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Your Highness.

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,710
Be careful.

39
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,270
Let's go.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Your Highness.

41
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,470
What's the matter?

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,120
Your Highness, the Fourth Prince
didn't return to the mansion.

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,270
He went directly to the palace.

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,600
Who's there?

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
Stop!

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,320
Stop!

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Chase him!

48
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,710
Hurry!

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
- Stop!
- Hurry!

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,040
- Stop!
- Chase him!

51
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,550
That way!

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Stop!

53
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,430
Who are you?

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,030
How dare you attempt to assassinate me?

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,800
None of your business.

56
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,160
Then you will pay the price.

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,720
That night at Grandeur Palace,

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
was it you?

59
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,030
Grandeur Palace?

60
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,960
You are Han Ziqing.

61
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,750
So it was you.

62
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,880
(Tonight, I will avenge Han Ziqing.)

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,470
Your moves

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,030
are not from the Longyuan Continent.

65
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,960
At least you're not so foolish.

66
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,510
I'll avenge my injury

67
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
with your leg.

68
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,630
Your Highness.

69
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,990
Your Highness. Your Highness.

70
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Are you alright, Your Highness?

71
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,720
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

72
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Your Highness.

73
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,070
Come on.

74
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,630
Han Ziqing.

75
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,680
Why hasn't Her Highness returned yet?

76
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,230
Your Highness. Your Highness.

77
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,280
Your Highness, you are injured.

78
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,000
Quick, help me inside.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,350
Ten, quickly call an imperial physician.

80
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,190
Yes.

81
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,630
Ten, don't go.

82
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
But Miss…

83
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,040
Your Highness, your leg

84
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,890
is so badly injured.

85
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,550
Is it alright not to call
an imperial physician?

86
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,190
I'm fine.

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,310
Go get me a basin of water.

88
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,160
- Yes.
- Bring some medicine.

89
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,190
Do not alert anyone else.

90
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,310
Your Highness,

91
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,880
your injury is so severe.

92
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm fine.

93
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,450
I know what medicine to use.

94
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
But what if His Highness finds out?

95
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,470
You must not tell him.

96
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,750
Yes.

97
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,910
How is it?

98
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
How is the injury?

99
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,440
Your Highness, there's no need to panic.

100
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,680
It's just an internal injury.

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,000
It hasn't affected any vital organs.

102
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,680
But why does it hurt so much?

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,350
It's because the abdomen
was heavily struck

104
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,700
and the internal organs were damaged.

105
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,750
Can it be fully cured?

106
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,680
As long as you take the medicine
on time and rest well,

107
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,790
you will recover completely.

108
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,560
However…

109
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,350
What? Speak up.

110
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,310
During this period,
you must abstain from sexual activity.

111
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,630
Otherwise, it will only
worsen the injury.

112
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,120
Watch your mouth.

113
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,950
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Your Highness.

115
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you.

116
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,680
Your Highness, be careful.

117
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
Luckily, the bones are not broken.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,110
I am a person with iron bones.

119
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,750
How could I be so delicate?

120
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,190
Your Highness, have some tea.

121
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,030
Alright.

122
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,800
Your Highness,

123
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,550
is your leg feeling better?

124
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,120
Much better.

125
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,560
Take it away.

126
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,910
Your Highness,

127
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,510
how did you hurt your leg?

128
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,750
Forgive me.

129
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,160
I will never ask

130
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
those that I shouldn't know again.

131
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,270
Ten,

132
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,280
you should learn from Hongyi's ability

133
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,760
to read the situation.

134
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,840
It will be helpful for you.

135
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes.

136
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,590
Get up.

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Your Highness,

138
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
if His Highness returns and asks

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
how you got injured,

140
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,190
should we say

141
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,360
that you accidentally fell?

142
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,990
If that's the case,

143
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,630
both of you will be punished.

144
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,190
As long as it helps you,

145
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,190
we are willing to be punished.

146
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Forget it.

147
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,720
I won't let you take the blame.

148
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,070
I will make sure he doesn't find out.

149
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,620
(Tianqi)

150
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,400
His Highness is waiting here all day.

151
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,360
He must be very tired.

152
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,400
Chu Tiange is truly ungrateful.

153
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,880
He's here.

154
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,240
Miss,

155
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,990
His Highness has waited so long

156
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,830
with much effort.

157
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,160
Now that the person has finally arrived,

158
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,550
why not go and greet him?

159
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,390
What do you know?

160
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,670
His Highness wants Chu Tiange
to apologize.

161
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,990
He wants the Xiling's envoy
to apologize?

162
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,280
If Chu Tiange doesn't
take the initiative to apologize,

163
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,240
His Highness will not back down.

164
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,040
But can they apologize to us?

165
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

166
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,990
The mountain roads
are difficult to walk.

167
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,190
So our journey was delayed.

168
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,480
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

169
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,670
The King has specially prepared
a welcoming banquet for King Xiang.

170
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,430
Please change your horse

171
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,990
and follow me into the palace.

172
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,040
Very well.

173
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,180
(Tianqi)

174
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:29,740
(Tianqi)

175
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,510
(Jun Beichen didn't come.)

176
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,990
(He must be seriously injured.)

177
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,590
Jingqin.

178
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,630
Mother.

179
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,800
Why didn't Beichen attend?

180
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,190
He said he fell ill last night.

181
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,320
What?

182
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,110
What is going on with you?

183
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,720
How could you not tell me
about such a big matter?

184
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,040
I was afraid you would worry.

185
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,920
Beichen didn't let me
go to Longyin Palace.

186
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,510
He said he wanted some peace.

187
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,350
Mother.

188
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,430
You know his temper.

189
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,750
I can't go against him.

190
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,110
I had Beichen marry you

191
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,960
to strengthen our family ties.

192
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,750
You should be a team.

193
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,160
You should

194
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,510
take good care of him.

195
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,720
How can you just obey him?

196
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,950
Yes.

197
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,920
Your Highness, the Princess
is waiting outside the hall.

198
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,830
Everyone,

199
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,920
the Xiling delegation
has traveled a long way to Tianque.

200
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
I am very pleased.

201
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,840
Fine wine and delicacies
are for my most esteemed guests.

202
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,070
Come on, a toast to you all.

203
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,800
- Cheers.
- To Your Majesty.

204
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,990
To Your Majesty.

205
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,030
Sit.

206
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,990
Your Majesty,

207
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,840
the horses and furs brought
on this mission

208
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,170
were escorted by Princess Feiyan.

209
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,510
So she's here a bit late.

210
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,750
Please forgive us.

211
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,240
Now the Princess is waiting
outside the hall.

212
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,710
Okay.

213
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,950
Express my gratitude

214
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,760
to your father.

215
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,510
Call

216
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,510
Princess Feiyan to come forward.

217
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

218
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,440
Princess Feiyan,
please come into the hall.

219
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,720
Greetings, Your Majesty,

220
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,920
and send you regards
on behalf of my father.

221
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,360
Your Highness.

222
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,390
Princess Feiyan, you may rise.

223
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,920
That bell is a very powerful weapon.

224
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,960
I've heard about it.

225
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,070
- The Princess Feiyan of Xiling
- Princess Feiyan

226
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,640
- dares to bring weapons
- is such a beautiful girl

227
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,000
- to the grand hall of the palace
- with the courage of a male warrior.

228
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,060
- when she's paying respects to another king.
- Today, when I meet you,

229
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,700
you indeed live up to the reputation.

230
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,870
Princess Feiyan, please take a seat.

231
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Your Majesty.

232
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,270
My father once sent a letter to you

233
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,360
and wished to form an alliance
through marriage with Tianque

234
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,420
to establish an eternal bond.

235
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,540
What do you think, Your Majesty?

236
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,940
My father has not received a reply
for a long time

237
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,820
so he instructed me to inquire
on his behalf.

238
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,580
Your Majesty.

239
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,100
You haven't answered yet.

240
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,740
Is it because I am not worthy
of the Fourth Prince?

241
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,180
(Chu Feiyan is quite bold)

242
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,540
(to openly express her love.)

243
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,660
(This drama is quite thrilling.)

244
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,820
(But her taste is not good.)

245
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,500
(What would she like him?)

246
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,100
Princess Feiyan is both talented
and beautiful.

247
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,660
If you are not worthy of Beiyue,

248
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,940
who could it be in this world?

249
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,940
So, does this mean you agree?

250
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,780
Of course, I agree.

251
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,220
To form a marriage alliance with Xiling

252
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,700
is the honor of Tianque.

253
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,620
Beiyue, don't you think so?

254
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,660
Father.

255
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,130
You are right.

256
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,740
But now I'm married.

257
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,260
Wouldn't that

258
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,380
be unfair to Princess Feiyan?

259
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,140
I can only disappoint

260
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,660
Princess Feiyan's kind intentions.

261
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,900
(Impressive.)

262
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,510
(He's trying to make me take the blame.)

263
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,140
(How insidious.)

264
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,940
There is naturally

265
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,220
only one Fourth Princess Consort.

266
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,980
So why not

267
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,540
just depose her?

268
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,540
Do you agree?

269
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,500
Alright, I agree.

270
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,100
If she enters the mansion,

271
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,460
you can never see that dagger again.

272
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,420
Your Highness,

273
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,860
since I married
into the Mansion of Fourth Prince,

274
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,360
I have devoted myself to serving you.

275
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,900
But now you are deposing me.

276
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,220
I do not know what I did wrong.

277
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,200
Please enlighten me, Your Highness.

278
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,680
Your Highness.

279
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,300
His Majesty hasn't spoken yet.
What are you afraid of?

280
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,340
Just now, you have also heard

281
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,460
what Princess Feiyan said.

282
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,820
You

283
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,060
are the Fourth Princess Consort
of Tianque.

284
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,980
The Imperial Edict has been issued.

285
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,300
Who dares to depose you?

286
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

287
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,540
It was just a joke.

288
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,660
Why take it so seriously?

289
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,700
It seems like I'm bullying you.

290
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,980
How about we have a competition?

291
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,850
A competition, huh?

292
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,190
I heard there are both literary
and martial competitions for consorts.

293
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,640
How about competing with me in both?

294
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,190
What do you think?

295
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,460
When the Princess Consort was selected,
she knew nothing about that.

296
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,340
Now Princess Feiyan wants
to compete with her.

297
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,100
How can she handle it?

298
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,720
Han Ziqing,
the Fourth Princess Consort of Tianque,

299
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,140
was appointed by Father.

300
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,900
I think,

301
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,740
there's no need
for any further competitions.

302
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,020
Fourth Prince, you are wrong.

303
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,420
If the Fourth Princess Consort
of Tianque

304
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,340
knows neither literary nor martial arts,

305
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,540
wouldn't she be a laughingstock
to the world?

306
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,860
Yes. Fourth Prince,

307
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,060
I heard that you haven't

308
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,660
held the wedding ceremony yet.

309
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,940
So, the Fourth Princess Consort

310
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,260
still needs to be convincing.

311
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,180
Your Majesty,

312
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,660
what do you think?

313
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,260
I think you have a point.

314
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,740
I see it through

315
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,300
that Princess Feiyan

316
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,540
is deeply devoted to Beiyue.

317
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,060
So, according to Tianque's rules,

318
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,220
Princess Feiyan and Han Ziqing
should have a competition.

319
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,020
The winner
will be the official Princess Consort.

320
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,980
Father,

321
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
wait a moment.

322
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,940
Beiyue.

323
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,420
I am very curious.

324
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,740
This is a family matter of Tianque.

325
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,900
What does it have to do with them?

326
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,380
You don't need to worry.

327
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,340
Even if Ziqing loses,

328
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,540
she would just be demoted
to a concubine.

329
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,230
She will still be with you every day.

330
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,980
As a prince, you should
put the overall interests above.

331
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,700
(Overall interests, uh?)

332
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,540
(Wasn't it you who decreed)

333
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,340
(the title of Fourth Princess Consort?)

334
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,620
(And now you just abolish it?)

335
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,620
(You, the Fourth Prince,
may seem glorious.)

336
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,020
(But you are still
under others' control.)

337
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,540
So,

338
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,860
it is settled then.

339
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,340
Tomorrow morning,

340
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,060
Princess Feiyan
and the Fourth Princess Consort

341
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,060
will have an official contest.

342
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,140
Tomorrow's competition

343
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,180
will be divided into the literary exam
and the martial exam.

344
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,020
Tomorrow

345
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,420
we will start with the martial exam.

346
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,900
Let's go.

347
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,780
Mother,

348
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,700
isn't this karma?

349
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,940
Han Ziqing is ignorant

350
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,740
and she has run into
Princess Feiyan of Xiling,

351
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,060
the Prairie Rose.

352
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,140
Isn't this just asking for humiliation?

353
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,460
If Han Ziqing loses,

354
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,500
the marriage alliance
with the Chancellor will fall apart.

355
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,580
For us,

356
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,980
this is actually great news.

357
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,380
Father, for the Autumn Hunting Festival,

358
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,940
I have invited
a very distinguished guest

359
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,260
to add to the festivities.

360
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,780
Who is it?

361
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,540
I have had the honor
of inviting the world's best qin master,

362
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,180
the owner of the Demon Qin Xuezheng.

363
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,140
The Demon Qin Xuezheng.

364
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,620
- What is that?
- I've heard of it.

365
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,460
It is an extremely precious musical instrument.

366
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,620
Lige.

367
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,620
This is Lige.

368
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

369
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,620
You may rise.

370
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,300
I have long heard
of Mr. Lige's great name.

371
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,180
I didn't expect that Beishen
would be fortunate enough to invite you.

372
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,460
It is a great honor for Tianque.

373
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

374
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,540
Mr. Lige,

375
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,940
please.

376
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,330
This person

377
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,280
looks a bit strange.

378
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
Alright then,

379
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,540
tomorrow morning,

380
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,020
I invite everyone present

381
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,860
to witness Princess Feiyan

382
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,620
and the Princess Consort's competition.

383
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,820
Please.

384
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,140
A toast to Your Majesty.

385
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:09,380
(West Yard)

386
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,420
Your Highness, where are you going?

387
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,740
I came out for a walk.

388
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,100
Your Highness,

389
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,900
what are your plans
for tomorrow's competition?

390
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,140
What plans?

391
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Just take it easy.

392
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,300
Do you plan to concede?

393
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,220
What else?

394
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,420
Fight to the death for a consort title?

395
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,220
Your Highness,

396
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,110
Xiling has been invading our border
for years.

397
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,500
That's an insult
of our national dignity.

398
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,540
And yesterday,
Chu Tiange gave the Fourth Prince a hard time

399
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,100
at the city gate.

400
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,660
This is intolerable.

401
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,740
I didn't expect

402
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,540
you to be so concerned
about the country and the people.

403
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,260
Although Chu Feiyan is known
as the Prairie Rose of Xiling

404
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,260
with great martial arts skills
and knowledge,

405
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,620
you are no pushover either.

406
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,540
What do you mean?

407
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,020
Your Highness,

408
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,220
I know your leg injury
hasn't healed yet,

409
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,380
but this competition is important.

410
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,540
Think about it,

411
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
if you lose to Chu Feiyan,

412
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,980
and she successfully marries
into the Mansion,

413
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,780
she will have the final say here.

414
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,700
According to the rules,

415
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,460
we would all become her servants.

416
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,740
Your Highness, do you want to serve
a Xiling woman?

417
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,460
Do I have to be a servant too?

418
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,300
Yes.

419
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,180
You are such a noble person.

420
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,140
Are you willing to swallow this insult?

421
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,420
You're egging me on?

422
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm just telling the truth.

423
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,180
(I haven't retrieved the dagger yet.)

424
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,660
(Indeed, I can't let Chu Feiyan
marry over.)

425
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,500
(She will cause me trouble.)

426
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,180
Alright, stop following me.

427
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,020
I'll walk by myself.

428
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,060
Yes.

429
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,740
(What should I do?)

430
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,660
Your Highness.

431
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,340
You scared me.

432
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,900
His Highness
is reading the military report.

433
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,020
I'm just wandering around.

434
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,860
I won't disturb him.

435
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,140
Your Highness,

436
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,500
for tomorrow's competition,

437
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,180
I hope you will succeed.

438
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,900
Do you also hope I win?

439
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,420
Of course.

440
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,700
Why?

441
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
If Xiling allies with the Fourth Prince,

442
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,460
the Fourth Prince's power
will inevitably increase.

443
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,940
It should be good

444
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,990
for the Fourth Prince, right?

445
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,260
Could it be

446
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,510
you don't want Chu Feiyan to marry over?

447
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,860
Your Highness,

448
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,120
you only know part of the story.

449
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,380
Tell me more.

450
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Xiling

451
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,180
has always wanted to use
our bordering land

452
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,020
to attack Dongling.

453
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,740
And the bordering land

454
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
is also our territory.

455
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,700
If we lend it to Xiling,

456
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,860
how could they easily return it?

457
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,020
If we form an alliance
with Xiling through marriage,

458
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,500
should we lend the bordering land
or not?

459
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,940
So,

460
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,620
Xiling is using Chu Feiyan

461
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,140
to exchange for the bordering land
of Tianque.

462
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,460
It's quite a good deal.

463
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,300
No wonder he is so reluctant.

464
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
But the King is glad.

465
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,420
Forming an alliance
with Xiling through marriage.

466
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,820
It can not only ensure Tianque's safety,

467
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,420
but also take some

468
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,360
of His Highness' territory.

469
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,740
The King is so glad about that.

470
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,900
Therefore,

471
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,860
even for the sake of our prince,

472
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,580
please try your best, Your Highness.

473
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,020
We cannot let Xiling succeed.

474
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,340
I understand His Highness' thoughts.

475
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,780
He will not yield to Xiling,

476
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,180
nor will he marry Chu Feiyan.

477
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,440
(Last time when we entered the palace,
he specifically sent me away.)

478
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,860
(It seems they were discussing it.)

479
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,700
(It appears)

480
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,140
(the King wants to force this deal.)

481
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,140
(I didn't expect)

482
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,620
(he could be so helpless.)

483
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,420
Really?

484
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,180
Do you think I'm joking with you?

485
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,420
She

486
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,060
wants to kill me.

487
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,540
How did you two become enemies?

488
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,060
I killed Mr. Chen.

489
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,100
I also happened
to visit the Grandeur Palace.

490
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,740
She is convinced

491
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,140
that I am the one
who ruined her reputation.

492
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,220
I will handle this.

493
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,540
It will not affect our cooperation.

494
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,980
You are the world's best qin master

495
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,400
and have traveled across many countries.

496
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,820
You have a lot of military intelligence

497
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,060
that is of great use to me.

498
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,180
Do not betray my trust.

499
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,500
Help me ascend to be the crown prince,

500
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,900
and you will have wealth and honor

501
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,500
as much as you desire.

502
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,980
Tomorrow, Chu Feiyan and Han Ziqing
will compete in horse riding.

503
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,180
You should go and watch it,

504
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,980
and also check the Mansion
of Fourth Prince.

505
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,340
Alright.

506
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,820
Your Highness.

507
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,620
Go quickly.

508
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,620
Your Highness.

509
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,940
Your Highness.

510
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,780
You may leave.

511
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,380
(What is he up to now?)

512
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,740
Your Highness.

513
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,820
Aren't you going back
to the East Yard to rest?

514
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,740
Are you trying to drive me away?

515
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,580
Isn't my intention

516
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,420
clear enough?

517
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,460
Whether it's the East Yard
or the West Yard,

518
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
this is my home.

519
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,020
Where do you want to drive me to?

520
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,620
Tomorrow

521
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,460
if you don't want to compete,

522
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,580
just tell Father

523
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,540
and concede.

524
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,260
If I concede,

525
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,860
do you have to marry Chu Feiyan?

526
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,220
You don't want to marry her,

527
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,740
right?

528
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,500
Of course not.

529
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
But now

530
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,860
the royal will cannot be defied.

531
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,380
No need to defy the royal will.

532
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,740
I just need to win.

533
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,340
You win?

534
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,020
Didn't you say you are not good
at both literary and martial arts?

535
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,060
How will you win?

536
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,340
No need to worry about that.

537
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,020
But Your Highness,

538
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,620
can you promise me one thing?

539
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,340
What is it?

540
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,180
If I win,

541
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,260
give me the dagger.

542
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,620
I'm not asking for it.

543
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,340
I know

544
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,900
that it is a memento left
by your mother.

545
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,420
Just let me see it for a moment.

546
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,580
Alright.

547
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,860
I agree.

548
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

549
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,780
Your Highness, shouldn't you
go back to rest early?

550
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,100
Don't you want me to stay here?

551
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,820
Even if you want me to stay,

552
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,180
I don't have time to accompany you.

553
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,180
You have a competition tomorrow.

554
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,020
You should rest early.

555
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,380
Alright.

556
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,100
Good night, Your Highness.

557
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,940
Good night?

558
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,780
It just means to rest early.

559
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,580
You talk nonsense every day.

560
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,980
Good night.

561
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,660
According to the rules, the martial exam
comes before the literary exam.

562
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,180
The former includes riding and archery,
and the latter is a single test.

563
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,540
Have you all understood?

564
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,100
Your Majesty,

565
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,740
I want to add another stake.

566
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,340
Princess Feiyan's stake

567
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,260
must not be small.

568
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,140
Let's hear it.

569
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,620
If I lose,

570
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,500
Xiling will gift Tianque
10,000 fine steeds.

571
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,860
My goodness.

572
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,940
Xiling only tributes
a few hundred fine steeds each year,

573
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,700
and that is already a great favor.

574
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,300
- Now it suddenly increases to 10, 000.
- 10, 000.

575
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,060
What a big stake.

576
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,460
It is said,

577
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,500
whoever wins Chu Feiyan
wins half of Xiling.

578
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,300
The reputation is indeed well-deserved.

579
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,060
Beiyue,

580
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,220
if you don't marry this princess,

581
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,020
it will be your loss.

582
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,060
Fourth Princess Consort,

583
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,500
since Princess Feiyan
has made such a great stake,

584
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,140
I suppose you also have a counter one.

585
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,580
We can't be outdone, can we?

586
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,300
If the Fourth Princess Consort
of Tianque loses,

587
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,100
what do you want?

588
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,540
I want her hands.

589
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,820
Princess Feiyan really dares to ask.

590
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
It's so cruel.

591
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,020
Indeed,

592
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,660
I think the Fourth Princess Consort
is in grave danger.

593
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,580
What?

594
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,860
Are you scared?

595
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,780
I am not scared,

596
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,760
but unwilling to do that.

597
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,500
Then what other stakes does she have?

598
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,620
Thank you for your protection,
Your Highness.

599
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,260
I am willing to bet with you.

600
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,980
Princess Feiyan,

601
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,820
since you voluntarily added a stake
just now,

602
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,020
I can't dampen your enthusiasm.

603
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,580
How about this?

604
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,540
I will add another stake as well.

605
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,380
Do you

606
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,140
dare to accept it, Princess?

607
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,780
You are just a concubine's daughter
of the Chancellor's Mansion.

608
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,140
What do you have to compete
with me in stakes?

609
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,580
If I lose, I will give you my legs
as well.

610
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,700
Ridiculous.

611
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,140
How much are your legs worth?

612
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,180
What would I do with your legs?

613
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,940
But you were asking for my hands.

614
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,940
Isn't that ridiculous, either?

615
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,940
What exactly do you want to say?

616
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,660
If you lose,

617
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,100
the Xiling Army is not allowed
to step into the bordering land,

618
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
and never to regret.

619
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,700
What exactly do you want to do?

620
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,920
- That's our Fourth Princess Consort.
- She's good.

621
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
Princess Feiyan.

622
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,540
Do you

623
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
dare to accept this bet?

624
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,380
Prince Xiang.

625
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,780
The princess does not dare to accept it.

626
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,790
Do you not dare to accept it either?

627
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,100
Who says I don't dare?

628
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,550
Alright.

629
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,620
If you win my elder sister,

630
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,380
I will agree to your conditions.

631
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,780
Alright.

632
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,220
Your Majesty.

633
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,420
Let's begin.

634
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,700
The competition begins. Beat the drums.

635
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,780
Honey.

636
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,300
Beichen.

637
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,260
That is a purebred Xiling horse
that Chu Feiyan is used to riding.

638
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,700
It's not big, but it's very strong.

639
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,140
Its legs are short but powerful.

640
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,340
It's a good horse.

641
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,140
Your Highness.

642
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,140
"Sweats Blood" Horse.

643
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,420
Beichen.

644
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,080
That is Beiyue's favorite horse.

645
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,560
He never lets anyone else touch it.

646
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,820
I didn't expect him
to let Han Ziqing ride it.

647
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,900
It still remembers you.

648
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,440
Are you sure you want to compete?

649
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,060
Of course.

650
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,620
I want to protect the bordering land
for you.

651
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,740
Don't worry.

652
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,860
Since you've decided to compete,

653
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,020
even if we lose,

654
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,380
I will still assure your safety.

655
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

656
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,260
I will do my best.

657
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,660
Are we waiting until sunset to compete?

658
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,620
Be careful.

659
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,100
Alright.

660
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,700
Can she ride a horse with this leg?

661
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,100
It seems Beiyue is really good
to the Fourth Princess Consort.

662
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,940
He even lends his most beloved horse

663
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,140
to the Fourth Princess Consort.

664
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,260
(Tianque)

665
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,260
Your Highness cares for
the Princess Consort so much.

666
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,580
He even followed along.

667
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,660
Can the Princess Consort's leg
handle it?

668
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,260
I knew she could do it.

669
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,860
So nervous.

670
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,500
I think

671
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,060
there's no need to compete.

672
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,980
Chu Feiyan is sure to win.

673
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,220
Let's see how Han Ziqing explains
to His Majesty now.

674
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,220
Explain what?

675
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,340
She can't even protect herself.

676
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,260
She can only apologize with her death.
