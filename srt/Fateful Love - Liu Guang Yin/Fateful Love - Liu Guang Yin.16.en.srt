(Favorable weather)

Who are you?

24

How dare you to trespass on the island.

25
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,960
I am looking for Lu Jun.

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
How dare you

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,850
to call our Master's name!

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Who are you?

29
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,700
A guest of the Lu Manor.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
If you are a guest,

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,570
do you have a token?

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
No.

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,460
Please tell him

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,180
that I'm Han Ziqing, Nianbei's wife.

35
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,190
Every day there are a lot of people

36
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,770
pretending to be guests
to take advantage of us.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,570
No token,

38
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,210
no entry.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,550
If you had shown the token earlier,

40
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,980
you wouldn't have wasted so much time.

41
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,320
Please come in.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,160
Wait.

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,620
Commander Xu,

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,010
what are you busy with?

45
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,070
Take it out.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
Commander Xu,

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,540
how dare you

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,830
to bring such dubious people

49
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,160
into the Manor!

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,550
Don't you know the island is on lockdown

51
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,460
and no unauthorized persons
are allowed to enter now?

52
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,910
- My mistake.
- (He must be)

53
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,960
- I thought she was the Manor's guest.
- (the Lu Family's son-in-law)

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,650
- So I was careless...
- (that Gu mentioned in his letter.)

55
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,460
Spare me, please.

56
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,820
The Manor has seen no guests recently.

57
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,190
Get out.

58
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,270
Who are you?

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,450
You're not worth

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,010
of knowing my identity.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,650
Looking at you.

62
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,900
You are at most a butler.

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,600
If you don't leave now,

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,180
don't blame me for being rude.

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,800
I would like to see

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,700
how you will be rude.

67
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,520
You really are not afraid of death.

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,360
Stop the nonsense, and call your Master.

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,390
Let me tell you.

70
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,290
I am the Master.

71
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,700
You are the Master?

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,210
What kind of Master are you?

73
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,650
The Young Master

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,040
of the Lu Family?

75
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,270
What are you laughing at?

76
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,190
My identity

77
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,210
is none of your concern.

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
Is that so?

79
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,770
You're even embarrassed
to reveal your identity.

80
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,750
How dare you drive away the guest?

81
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,590
Fine.

82
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,040
I'll tell you.

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Listen carefully.

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,980
My name is Jiang Chen.

85
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,860
I am the Lu Family's eldest
son-in-law.

86
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,300
So you are Jiang Chen.

87
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,490
Exactly.

88
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,600
The Lu Family on Liuxian Island

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
is the top-ranked family.

90
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,420
The Lu Family's daughter
is considered noble.

91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,510
How did she end up
with someone like you?

92
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,700
What do you mean by that?

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,240
No taste.

94
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,200
You shouldn't be called Jiang Chen.

95
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,980
- Change your name to Lu Chen.
- You scoundrel.

96
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,760
This scoundrel

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,510
is causing trouble
on Lu Family's territory.

98
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,000
- Take her down.
- Go.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,490
- Go.
- Help!

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,650
- Senior Brother.
- Help!

101
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,000
Where did they come from?

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,490
Watch her. Don't let her escape.

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Senior Brother.

104
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,170
Ziqing.

105
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,600
Help!

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Baili Weisheng?

107
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,320
Sir, these two

108
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,830
sneaked onto the island
and were caught by me.

109
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,390
- Senior Brother.
- Ziqing.

110
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,640
Help.

111
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,350
Help!

112
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,880
Do you want to die?

113
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,140
- Why are you hitting us?
- You outrageous!

114
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,920
- What are you doing?
- He's hitting us.

115
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,480
A gentleman uses words, not fists.
Don't you know?

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,350
Help!

117
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,040
How dare you cause trouble
at the Lu Manor's dock?

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Who are you?

119
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,830
We have traveled to many states
since childhood.

120
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,830
We have long admired the fame
of Liuxian Island.

121
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,480
We just wanted to pay a visit.

122
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,320
But you...

123
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
But you...

124
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,320
- You stinky feet.
- Help.

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,160
Speak up.

126
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,580
Who exactly are you?

127
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,720
If you keep wasting time,

128
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,140
I'll break your arm.

129
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,920
- Senior Brother.
- We have long admired the island.

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,140
We came to pay a visit.

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,040
The Liuxian Island

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,670
is not a place for a pretentious man

133
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,670
like you.

134
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,820
- Why are you insulting me?
- Someone!

135
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,740
Break his arm and throw him into the sea
to feed the fish.

136
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,580
- No. Help!
- It's murder!

137
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,960
Help!

138
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,440
- You're breaking laws!
- Help!

139
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,540
This is simply outrageous and horrible.

140
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,280
Thank you, Ziqing.

141
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,400
Are you determined to seek death?

142
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
Thank you, Ziqing, for saving my life.

143
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,660
I didn't expect the Lu Family
to have such a family tradition.

144
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,100
Do you just kill people at will?

145
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,600
Anyone who violates the rules
of the Lu Manor

146
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,140
deserves to die and can be killed.

147
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,020
What if I don't allow it?

148
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,230
What right do you have to order me?

149
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,790
- Firstly you are not a young master.
- I...

150
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,170
You are just a freeloader.

151
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,000
I knew it.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,070
- You freeloader.
- Yes.

153
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,350
What are you so proud of?

154
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,110
You're not even as good as us beggars.

155
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,950
Secondly,

156
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,700
with me here,

157
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,040
try touching a single hair on them!

158
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,550
Did you hear that?

159
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,670
- You freeloader.
- Come on.

160
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,610
What do you want to do?

161
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,350
I came here this time

162
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,860
to meet Master Lu specifically.

163
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,440
If you don't want to let me in,

164
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
let's see if you have the ability

165
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
to stop me.

166
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,260
- But let me make it clear first.
- Exactly.

167
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,330
If I hurt you,

168
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,370
or kill you accidentally,

169
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,110
I will not

170
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,260
be held responsible.

171
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,930
You have quite the nerve.

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Come on.

173
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,000
Make your move.

174
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,230
- (This woman is clearly not weak.)
- Come on, make your move.

175
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,390
(If I insist on fighting her,)

176
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,160
- (it won't look good in public)
- I'm talking to you.

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,600
- (when I lose.)
- Make your move.

178
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
(Forget it.)

179
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,320
(I just bear with it for now.)

180
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,160
Miss.

181
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,580
Since you are here to see the Master,

182
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,830
our Lu Manor

183
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,990
always treats guests with courtesy.

184
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,440
I will not make things difficult
for you.

185
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,040
Lu Manor treats guests with courtesy?

186
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,930
Please, go ahead.

187
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,990
You're letting me go just like that?

188
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,950
Just now you were rude.

189
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,420
- You...
- You haven't apologized to me yet.

190
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,320
Exactly.

191
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Apologize.

192
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,820
Apologize, apologize.

193
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,320
You rude man.

194
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,550
- Hurry up and apologize.
- Apologize.

195
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,470
Miss.

196
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
I apologize for my offense.

197
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,330
Please

198
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,420
forgive me, Miss.

199
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,910
Alright.

200
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,760
Since you know your mistake

201
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,050
and sincerely apologize to me,

202
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,140
I will not hold it against you.

203
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,590
Ziqing.

204
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,300
- We, we...
- We, we...

205
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't beat her.

206
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,140
But I can hit you.

207
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,300
You monster.

208
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,350
How dare you insult me.

209
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,190
Look at this.

210
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,500
- Someone!
- Help!

211
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,660
How can you be so cruel, you monster?

212
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,230
Cut off his hand.

213
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
You cruel monster.

214
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,460
Do it!

215
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,790
You're killing a powerless doctor.

216
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,710
Enough.

217
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,550
Release them too.

218
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,590
Let them go.

219
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,400
Quick, quick, release us.

220
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,300
Exactly.

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,110
Senior Brother, slow down.

222
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,280
- Ziqing.
- Senior Brother.

223
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,120
Wait for me.

224
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,210
- Wait for me.
- Give it back.

225
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,210
Look at those useless men.

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,400
Ziqing, your mouth is even sharper
than mine.

227
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
Why are you stalking me?

228
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,030
How can you call it stalking?

229
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,110
That's not right.

230
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,950
I am

231
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,570
working with my business.

232
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,860
Why are you here on Liuxian Island?

233
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,980
Traveling the world
with my junior brother.

234
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,980
I'm telling you, stop following me.

235
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,680
And,

236
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,520
if you get caught again,

237
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,450
no one will save you.

238
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,000
Such a fierce woman, what a waste
of her good looks.

239
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
Exactly.

240
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,420
These beasts.

241
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,980
Have we committed a grave sin?

242
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,890
They not only lock us up,

243
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,210
but tie us up as well.

244
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
Shadow,

245
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,130
stop struggling.

246
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,010
Let's endure these two days,

247
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,910
and we'll be out.

248
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,570
These people are so vicious.

249
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,800
When I get out,

250
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
I will make them...

251
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,540
Be careful. Walls have ears.

252
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,840
For the sake of His Highness,

253
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,890
let's not stoop to their level.

254
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,320
I don't know
how His Highness is doing now,

255
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,300
how can I not be anxious?

256
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,330
About the Blood Spirit Grass,

257
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,500
although we were framed,

258
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,810
we have no evidence.

259
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,980
We can't prove our innocence.

260
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,390
Let's endure it

261
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,080
and get through these two days.

262
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,520
Once we're out,

263
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,870
everything will be easier to handle.

264
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,830
Gu,

265
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,980
you are always so magnanimous.

266
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,960
But they're bullying us.

267
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,500
We have to give in
when we're in their territory.

268
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Shadow,

269
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,400
for the sake of His Highness,
let's endure it.

270
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,100
Now when they keep us locked up here,

271
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,380
it's His Highness who is suffering.

272
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,550
Didn't you volunteer to take care
of the patient?

273
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,860
Why did you leave the patient
and come here?

274
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,450
I'm not a servant or maid.

275
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,420
It's enough to check on him once a day.

276
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,760
I left a servant there to watch over.

277
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,600
Besides,

278
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,100
isn't Jiang Chen there too?

279
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,030
Jiang Chen is a grown man.

280
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,890
Do you expect him to take care
of the patient?

281
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,110
He only said it

282
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,250
to please Mother.

283
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,690
Did you take it seriously?

284
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,200
You've been asking Mother

285
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,910
about Nianbei's identity.

286
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,180
Did you find out anything?

287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Father and Mother are very tight-lipped.

288
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,420
What could I find out?

289
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,960
Not only did I find out nothing,

290
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,060
I even got scolded.

291
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,150
But the more they act like this,

292
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,640
I am becoming more and more convinced

293
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,520
that Nianbei

294
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,810
is Father's illegitimate child.

295
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,940
If he really is Father's illegitimate child,

296
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,330
it will become quite interesting.

297
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,620
How he dare!

298
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,150
The entire Lu Family belongs to us.

299
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,650
He can never get a share.

300
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,010
If he really is Father's illegitimate child,

301
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,320
it won't be just getting a share.

302
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm afraid the entire Lu Family
would be his.

303
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,360
Miss Meiting.

304
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,880
Miss Suying.

305
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,470
Mr. Jiang said

306
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,010
Mr. Nianbei's wife has arrived.

307
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,550
Has Mrs. Lu been informed?

308
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,850
Mr. Jiang has gone there personally.

309
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,390
You may leave.

310
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,330
Let's go and have a look.

311
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,320
Let's go.

312
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,440
Nianbei's wife has arrived?

313
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,110
Mother, it's absolutely true.

314
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,030
I was harshly reprimanded by her
at the dock.

315
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,470
That woman is very fierce.

316
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,650
Mother, what should we do
with her people?

317
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,640
What else can we do?

318
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,840
Your father is not here.

319
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,230
Release them immediately.

320
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,100
Mother, we can't release them.

321
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,200
What are you afraid of?

322
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
They are just two servants.

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,150
They stole from the master's family.
They deserve to die.

324
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,910
Shut up! If it weren't for you,

325
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,640
would this have blown up
into such a big issue?

326
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,670
It's lucky

327
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,880
that your father is out on business.

328
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,710
Otherwise, he would have
skinned you alive.

329
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,620
Release them immediately.

330
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,940
Suying, you go handle it.

331
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
Alright.

332
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
Where is the guest?

333
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,280
She has already arrived.

334
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,810
Alright, I will go to greet them.

335
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,280
- Mother.
- Jiang Chen, look at Mother.

336
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,570
Please, be careful.

337
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,010
That woman is very fierce.

338
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
See?

339
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,880
You cause the trouble.

340
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,400
How can you blame me?

341
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,130
They were the ones who stole from us.

342
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,440
Besides,

343
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,030
they haven't even been locked up
for two days.

344
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,620
Those two servants got off so easily.

345
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,790
Anyway, that Nianbei

346
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,980
hasn't woken up,

347
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,130
and those two servants
are still locked up.

348
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,810
How about…?

349
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,120
What?

350
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,230
As long as they can't speak out,

351
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,380
no one will know.

352
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,010
Are you saying...?

353
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,910
Think about it.

354
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,280
If those two servants

355
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,790
complain to Han Ziqing,

356
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,910
- we won't be able to explain ourselves.
- Exactly.

357
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,470
Our father almost lost his life

358
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,300
trying to save that Nianbei.

359
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,760
It's just two servants after all.

360
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,060
You can do whatever you want with them.

361
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,550
I want to see

362
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,740
what that fierce woman looks like.

363
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,380
Are you Han Ziqing, Nianbei's wife?

364
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,350
Yes, I am.

365
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,620
I'm Han Ziqing from Tianque.

366
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,350
Excuse me,

367
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,130
are you Mrs. Lu?

368
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,670
Yes, I am.

369
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,510
Hello, Mrs. Lu.

370
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,250
Welcome, and no need for formalities.

371
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,400
Unfortunately, the Master just went out
on some business.

372
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,300
Please come inside.

373
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,880
Mrs. Lu,

374
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,690
I would like to see my husband first.

375
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,150
Don't worry.

376
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,380
He's fine.

377
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,110
Come in and have a cup of tea first,

378
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,250
then I'll take you to see him.

379
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
Mrs. Lu,

380
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,690
I'd rather see my husband first.

381
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,470
After I see him,

382
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,130
I'll greet to you and Master Lu.

383
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,440
Alright.

384
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,760
Please follow me.

385
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,600
Alright.

386
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,650
Hello, Butler Li.

387
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,150
What are you doing?

388
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,400
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

389
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,740
- What are you doing?
- You can't do this.

390
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,440
- Let him go!
- What are you doing?

391
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,640
I want to see Master Lu.

392
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
Let him go.

393
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,940
- I want to see Mrs. Lu.
- Let him go!

394
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,300
Sorry,

395
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,590
both of you.

396
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,620
I'm just following orders.

397
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,510
Gu!

398
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,400
Li, don't do anything rash.

399
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
Let him go!

400
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
Shadow, stop chasing them.

401
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,980
Quick, untie me.

402
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,800
- His Highness is in danger.
- Gu.

403
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,860
I need to find out who sent him
to kill us.

404
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,130
Don't you know which is more important?

405
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,280
This Lu Manor is quite large.

406
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,940
That's the room where Nianbei stays.

407
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,670
The East Yard where he stays
has plenty of sunlight.

408
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,030
The room is also spacious.

409
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,000
Nianbei is an honored guest.

410
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,540
He should stay in the best room.

411
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,130
Thank you for your care, Mrs. Lu.

412
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,910
It's nothing.

413
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,250
Miss Han, don't worry.

414
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,000
Your husband is getting better now.

415
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,940
Doctor Gu said

416
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,860
he will wake up soon.

417
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,280
Before you came this time,

418
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,790
my husband and I did not receive
any prior notice.

419
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,670
We did not prepare the appropriate
welcome ceremony.

420
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,110
Please forgive us.

421
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,060
No need for such formalities.

422
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,420
Mrs. Lu, thanks for the caring.

423
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
My pleasure.

424
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,450
It's there ahead.

425
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,960
Mrs. Lu,

426
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,930
please keep our identities a secret.

427
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,740
Sure.

428
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,040
Nianbei is in the inner room.

429
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,880
You may go in.

430
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,880
♪Don't blame me if you can't see me again♪

431
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:58,270
♪And don't blame me for saying nothing♪

432
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,690
♪How should I strive for our love♪

433
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,910
♪To be considered brave♪

434
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,120
♪Even if we part eventually,
there are no regrets♪

435
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,380
His health is no longer a major concern.

436
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,210
Ziqing, don't worry.

437
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,910
Mrs. Lu,

438
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,880
where are the people who came with him?

439
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,230
I thought a wife
seeing her long-lost husband

440
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,980
would cry her heart out.

441
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,070
But who knew Ziqing
is not an ordinary person.

442
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,520
She didn't shed a single tear.

443
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,980
What nonsense are you talking, Meiting?

444
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,980
Who is this?

445
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,070
This is my eldest daughter,

446
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,910
Lu Meiting.

447
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,320
Mrs. Lu,

448
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,860
where are Shadow and Doctor Gu?

449
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,280
Nianbei needs a few medicinal herbs
to recover himself.

450
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,050
Mr. Gu and Guard Shadow went
to the back mountain to gather herbs.

451
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,050
They left a patient behind,

452
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,600
and the two of them

453
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,310
went together to gather herbs?

454
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,520
I said to send a few people to go.

455
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,100
But Mr. Gu was anxious.

456
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,990
He decided to go
and gather it personally.

457
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,830
There are many snakes and insects
in the back mountain.

458
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,590
Guard Shadow was worried about him.

459
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,900
So he went along as well.

460
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,110
Mrs. Lu,

461
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,530
when will he wake up?

462
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,590
We have given him
many nourishing medicines.

463
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,780
Doctor Gu said

464
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,570
he will wake up soon.

465
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,310
It might still take a few days.

466
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,880
It would be best if he wakes up quickly.

467
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,470
For this bedridden person
who's seriously ill,

468
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,470
my father and mother
almost lost their lives.

469
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,800
Meiting, stop talking.

470
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,640
Mother.

471
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,270
Ziqing,

472
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,000
my eldest daughter

473
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,310
has been unruly and unreasonable

474
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,210
since childhood.

475
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,930
Please forgive her offense.

476
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,380
Mrs. Lu, you don't need to worry.

477
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,780
I would like to spend some time alone
with my husband.

478
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,260
Mrs. Lu, could you please give us
some privacy?

479
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,050
Of course.

480
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,030
Let's go, Meiting.

481
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,310
Let's go.

482
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,530
Hurry, let's go.

483
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,380
Mother, Mother!

484
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,860
Where are they?

485
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,570
Didn't I tell you to release them?

486
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,930
Butler Li

487
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,690
was trying to kill them both.

488
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,530
- What?
- But he didn't succeed.

489
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,950
Now

490
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,880
we don't know where they are.

491
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
Master.

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,980
- Master.
- Master.

493
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,920
Madam.

494
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,140
- What's wrong? Get up quickly.
- Madam.

495
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,510
How is he?

496
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
He's fine.

497
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,140
His pulse is stable.

498
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,620
Weren't you going to gather herbs?

499
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,550
It wasn't about gathering herbs at all.

500
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,800
These people

501
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,110
wanted to kill us.

502
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,550
What nonsense are you talking about?

503
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,710
What exactly happened?

504
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,550
Madam,

505
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,070
the Blood Spirit Grass from the Manor

506
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,500
suddenly appeared in our room.

507
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,590
Then Miss Meiting of the Lu Family

508
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,280
insisted that we stole it.

509
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,040
Indiscriminately,

510
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,760
they locked me and Gu up.

511
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,070
We can endure that,

512
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,780
but now they even sent Butler Li

513
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,430
to kill us.

514
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,710
Nonsense!

515
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,350
My mother has always been kind-hearted.

516
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,760
Why would she kill you
over such a trivial matter?

517
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,600
Do you have evidence?

518
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,200
Mother,

519
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,950
these two servants

520
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,470
not only stole from our house,

521
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,070
but now they are also
making false accusations.

522
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,930
We punished them before,

523
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,470
and it was not unjust at all.

524
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,310
Nonsense!

525
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,990
We have been following
Master and Madam,

526
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,920
and have seen all kinds
of valuable things.

527
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,070
Even if it were a precious herb,

528
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,980
and we needed it,

529
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,020
we wouldn't stoop to stealing it.

530
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,830
Madam, you must stand up for us.

531
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,280
How can you prove

532
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,120
you didn't steal it?

533
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,530
What's your evidence?

534
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,040
At that time, the Blood Spirit Grass
was found in their room.

535
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,430
Isn't it evidence?

536
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,570
So,

537
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,350
no one saw

538
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,880
them stealing the Blood Spirit Grass.

539
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,310
What if someone framed them?

540
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,210
Who would bother framing two servants?

541
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,510
Mrs. Lu,

542
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,990
there are doubts about this matter.

543
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,500
Please find out the truth, Mrs. Lu.

544
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,030
Rest assured.

545
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,310
When the Master returns,

546
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,790
he will certainly investigate it thoroughly

547
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,680
and give you an explanation.

548
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,400
Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

549
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,200
And,

550
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,020
even if they made a mistake,

551
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,410
my husband is still ill,

552
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,690
and you have locked both of them up,

553
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,740
leaving no one to take care of him.

554
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,680
Isn't this

555
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,470
a bit inappropriate?

556
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,430
Actually,

557
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,710
my daughter Suying
and son-in-law Jiang Chen

558
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,210
have been attending to him all along

559
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,260
without any neglect.

560
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,870
Jiang Chen?

561
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,290
Is it the Lu Family's eldest
son-in-law

562
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,620
who wouldn't let me into the Manor

563
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,560
and even tried to attack me?

564
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,100
Tell me, what did you do to him?

565
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,360
Nothing much.

566
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,210
He was just rude,

567
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,260
and kept telling me to get lost.

568
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,050
I only made him apologize.

569
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,440
Ziqing,

570
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,710
there might have been some misunderstanding.

571
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,560
My eldest son-in-law Jiang Chen

572
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,280
does tend to be a bit reckless
in his words and actions.

573
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,170
If he has offended you,

574
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,350
please forgive him.

575
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,310
Mother, why are you

576
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,930
wronging your son-in-law
indiscriminately?

577
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,470
Jiang Chen is responsible
for overseeing the dock affairs.

578
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,920
When he met unknown individuals,

579
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,830
it's natural to ask more questions.

580
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,670
Sis,

581
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,410
this is your fault.

582
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,210
After all, Ziqing is Nianbei's wife.

583
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,880
Although she came to the island
without an invitation,

584
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,810
which is indeed impolite,

585
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,000
it doesn't mean she's an unknown.

586
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,840
Whose side are you on?

587
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,320
Shadow.

588
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,230
Here.

589
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,140
You mentioned killing earlier.

590
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,740
What was that about?

591
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,070
Butler Li said

592
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,520
he was acting on orders.

593
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,830
As for whose orders...

594
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,040
You are slandering.

595
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,880
Meiting.

596
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,810
Killing?

597
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,500
Why would Butler Li kill?

598
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,710
I heard from a servant

599
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,070
that it seems like

600
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,160
Butler Li

601
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,230
had some personal grudges
with Guard Shadow,

602
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,560
so he wanted to kill them
and silence them

603
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,380
when they were in their punishment.

604
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,280
But he was overpowered

605
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,740
and feared being punished by Father,

606
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,310
- so he fled.
- You are lying.

607
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,520
I have barely spoken any words
with Butler Li in private.

608
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
When did we develop personal grudges?

609
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,350
This is...

610
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,190
Shadow.

611
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,960
Mrs. Lu,

612
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,170
let's consider this a misunderstanding.

613
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,170
As long as no one is hurt.

614
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,640
Ziqing,

615
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,530
it's great that you can understand.

616
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,020
Take good care of Nianbei.

617
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,800
We'll be leaving now.

618
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,980
- Let's go.
- Wait, it's not over yet.

619
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,560
Tell me, what did you do to my husband?

620
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,710
Did he try to discipline you,

621
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,450
you got upset, and it led to a conflict?

622
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,630
You are mistaken.

623
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,450
Your husband

624
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,330
is not qualified to discipline me.

625
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,280
I wanted to beat him up,

626
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,600
but he was afraid of getting beaten,

627
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,680
so he apologized voluntarily.

628
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,230
Who do you think you are

629
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,110
to show attitude to my husband?

630
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,040
If you two had any skills,

631
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,830
you wouldn't be hiding in our house
for treatment.

632
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,920
If you annoyed me,

633
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,760
I'll drive you all out.

634
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
Meiting!

635
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,110
I don't care.

636
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,040
You and Father are siding
with these unknown people.

637
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,640
Today, I must teach her a lesson.

638
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,520
- Meiting!
- Sis, Sis!

639
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,000
- I'll beat you to death.
- Meiting.

640
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,360
- Meiting.
- Sis.

641
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,440
Han Ziqing.

642
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,640
How dare you hit me.

643
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,710
She hit me.

644
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,110
Quick, take your sister back.

645
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,680
I'll fight her to the end today.

646
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,900
Meiting, go back with her.

647
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,980
You, you...

648
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,360
Just you wait.

649
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,810
Get out quickly.

650
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,170
I have just arrived.

651
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,050
I didn't mean to offend Miss Meiting.

652
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,070
Please forgive me, Mrs. Lu.

653
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,510
Ziqing.

654
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,190
It's my fault
for not teaching my daughter well.

655
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,430
I apologize for the embarrassment.

656
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,560
However, there are laws in the country
and family rules at home.

657
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,280
My daughter offended a guest.

658
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
It was her fault.

659
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,520
When the Master returns,

660
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,040
she will be punished.

661
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,880
Please rest assured.

662
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,110
Mrs. Lu, you are too kind.

663
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,080
Your Highness.

664
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,000
They knew well that His Highness was ill

665
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,350
and couldn't be left alone.

666
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,400
When the Master Lu went away,

667
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,110
they even locked me and Gu up.

668
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,880
Why didn't you expose them directly?

669
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,720
Shadow,

670
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,140
it's enough to understand that

671
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,410
in your heart.

672
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,920
Right now, His Highness is here
for treatment.

673
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,330
We have to maintain some dignity.

674
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,410
Exactly.

675
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,210
But don't worry.

676
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,050
About the grievances you suffered,

677
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,920
I will definitely

678
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,330
seek justice for you.

679
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,170
Thank you, Your Highness.

680
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,510
However,

681
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,000
His Highness's internal strength
has long recovered,

682
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,640
but he still hasn't woken up.

683
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,530
There must be

684
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,560
something fishy about this.

685
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,400
What could be fishy?

686
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,810
Just now, I heard Mrs. Lu say

687
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,740
that when you were not around,

688
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,690
it was Jiang Chen and Lu Suying
who were taking care of him.

689
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,960
It was them!

690
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,800
In the entire Lu Family,

691
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,810
except for Master Lu,

692
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,140
no one is truly loyal to His Highness.

693
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,660
Your Highness, it's odd.

694
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,750
I'm afraid

695
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,980
His Highness has been poisoned.

696
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,800
Beiyue,

697
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,210
long time no see.

698
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,600
Everything is fine

699
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,530
in Tianque.

700
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,600
But

701
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,410
why haven't you woken up yet?

702
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,800
Jun Beiyue,

703
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,980
please

704
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,230
wake up quickly.

705
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,680
Nianbei is my disciple,

706
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,560
and a distinguished guest
of our Manor.

707
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
How dare you neglect them

708
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,410
while I was away?

709
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,870
Moreover,

710
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,950
you were caught in the act
by Han Ziqing.

711
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,930
- Master.
- Look at you.

712
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,290
It was because the Blood Spirit Grass
went missing.

713
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
But the children

714
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,930
went through so much trouble
to get it for you.

715
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,070
They were too anxious

716
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,680
and lost their composure for a moment,

717
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,720
which led to this incident.

718
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,070
Is the Blood Spirit Grass more important,

719
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,310
or is Nianbei?

720
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,740
They couldn't distinguish the priorities,

721
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,000
neither could you?

722
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,950
Master,

723
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,190
you handed over the internal affairs
to Jiang Chen to manage.

724
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,400
He wanted to win everyone's respect

725
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,280
and give everyone an explanation.

726
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,470
Yes,

727
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,400
Father.

728
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,350
I did this for the Manor.

729
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,190
Shut up.

730
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,030
Speak up.

731
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,210
Who instructed Butler Li to do this?

732
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,960
Father.

733
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,880
Butler Li has already escaped.

734
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,190
As long as he doesn't show up...

735
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,030
It's a joke.

736
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,360
Do you think
that if we can't catch Butler Li,

737
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,470
everyone won't know

738
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,290
that it was your fault?

739
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,310
Father, it's my fault.

740
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,980
I didn't manage the Manor well.

741
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,000
Father, how about this?

742
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,920
You have a cup of tea

743
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,900
to soothe your throat first.

744
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,640
No need.

745
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,900
From now on,

746
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,320
you two

747
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,830
move out immediately.

748
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,980
- Don't stay in the main yard.
- Move...

749
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,800
And you, Suying,

750
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,590
write the family rules a hundred times

751
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,570
and reflect on your actions.

752
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,310
Master.

753
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,590
Father,

754
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,190
we didn't do anything wrong.

755
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,860
Why should we move out?

756
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,440
Father,

757
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,020
all the mistakes are mine.

758
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,280
If we can't stay in the main yard,

759
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,560
where should we live?

760
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,760
Master, the children
didn't mean any harm.

761
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,070
You don't need to plead for them.

762
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,150
It's all because you spoiled them.

763
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,980
If Nianbei wakes up,

764
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,530
how will you explain it to him?

765
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,710
And how will we get along

766
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,860
with Han Ziqing in the future?

767
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,070
They didn't expose this matter

768
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,690
to save some respect for you.

769
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,380
We should at least
have some self-awareness.

770
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,510
Father.

771
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,570
Mother.

772
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,400
Why don't you

773
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,440
temporarily stay in the guest room
at the foot of the mountain?

774
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,210
You can come back in a few days.

775
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,280
No. I won't move.

776
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,410
It is not up to you.

777
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,930
If I don't punish you,

778
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,260
how can I reserve the fame
of the Lu Family?

779
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,030
Father.

780
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,520
I think what you care about

781
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
is not the fame of the Lu Family at all,

782
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,690
but there's another hidden reason.

783
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,640
Otherwise,

784
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,160
why would you drive us away

785
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,920
- Stop talking, stop talking.
- for the sake of a guest?

786
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,760
What did you say?

787
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,160
Meiting.

788
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,430
Meiting.

789
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,290
If you don't say it, I will.

790
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,570
Father and Mother always say

791
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,880
that Nianbei

792
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,230
is just your disciple,

793
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,210
but in my opinion,

794
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,560
he is actually your illegitimate child.

795
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,980
- How dare you!
- Nonsense!

796
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,330
Do not speak such rebellious words.

797
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,110
Mother,

798
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,290
Meiting didn't mean it.

799
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,500
All of you remember

800
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,080
that Nianbei

801
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,860
is my beloved disciple,

802
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,260
and a distinguished guest
of our Manor.

803
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,780
From now on,

804
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,150
if any of you

805
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,210
dare to disrespect them again,

806
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,620
don't blame me for being ruthless.

807
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,230
Get out!

808
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,390
Your Highness.

809
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,750
Your Highness.

810
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,040
Jiang Chen and Lu Meiting

811
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,630
have been driven to the foot
of the mountain.

812
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,560
I expected that.

813
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,260
Even if I didn't confront them,

814
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,680
Master Lu

815
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,900
would give us an explanation.

816
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,800
In the entire Lu Manor,

817
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,290
only Master Lu is truly sincere
to His Highness.

818
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,560
He transferred 70 percent
of his internal strength to him

819
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,400
without any hesitation.

820
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,980
It's truly admirable.

821
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,310
What about Mrs. Lu?

822
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,760
Mrs. Lu also sincerely hopes
for His Highness' recovery.

823
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,100
But she's too soft-hearted

824
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,100
and always being led by the nose
by her two daughters.

825
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,560
Physician Gu,

826
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,470
Beiyue hasn't woken up yet.

827
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,520
Are you sure

828
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,760
someone poisoned him?

829
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,600
I'm sure.

830
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,640
I just blame myself
for not being skilled enough.

831
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,880
I've checked countless times.

832
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,040
I just don't know
what kind of poison it is.

833
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,160
His physical strength
has already recovered,

834
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,660
but he just won't wake up.

835
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,000
Protect His Highness.

836
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,840
Yes.

837
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,960
Come out.

838
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,910
What are you here for?

839
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,160
Ziqing,

840
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,950
you bullied their daughter
as soon as you arrived,

841
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,400
and even drove them out of their home.

842
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,620
You are truly impressive.

843
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm glad I didn't marry you as my wife.

844
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,590
If I married you as my wife,

845
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,520
you would drive my parents
extremely mad.

846
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,360
Really.

847
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,410
What exactly do you want?

848
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,140
I'm just passing by.

849
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,390
Passing by?

850
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,690
Passing by on someone's rooftop?

851
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,750
Ziqing,

852
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,220
you offended their daughter
as soon as you arrived.

853
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,840
You've

854
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,900
violated the etiquette of being a guest.

855
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,900
Let me teach you what it means

856
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,160
to be a guest.

857
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,360
Do you want to know what poison
Jun Beiyue was poisoned with?

858
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,570
How do you know Jun Beiyue was poisoned?

859
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,670
Although I am a veterinarian,

860
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,080
I am well-read

861
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
and proficient in pharmacology.

862
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,910
Treating cattle and horses
is certainly not a problem to me.

863
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,150
As for people,

864
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,950
I just took a careful look

865
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,080
from the roof,

866
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,190
and I understood a bit.

867
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,040
Stop rambling.

868
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,880
Just say it.

869
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,970
He was poisoned

870
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,920
with medicine poison.

871
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,160
Medicine poison?

872
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,220
There might be a mole in the Lu Family.

873
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,010
This is Ruodan Grass.

874
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,760
Boil three bowls down to one,

875
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,220
and take it once every  two hours.

876
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,810
It should cure him.

877
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,080
Really?

878
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,100
Believe it or not.

879
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,950
Who exactly are you?

880
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,000
How do you know everything?

881
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,430
Why is your memory so bad?

882
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,600
Didn't I tell you before?

883
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,800
I am Baili Weisheng.

884
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,560
I am well-acquainted with all.

885
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,670
There is nothing I don't know

886
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,940
in the Longyuan Continent.

887
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,560
By the way, there will be
the Qin Gathering on the island soon.

888
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,520
I will come back then.

889
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,620
Don't ask why I'm following you then.

890
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,810
Have you finished the task?

891
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,330
For sure.

892
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,770
I am getting more and more confused now.

893
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,330
We agreed

894
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,040
that once we leave Tianque,

895
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,880
we would find a way

896
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,710
to kill her.

897
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,600
But now

898
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,880
you are helping her.

899
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,560
Tell me.

900
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,900
What are you thinking?

901
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,080
Didn't she save us at the dock?

902
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,290
I always feel like I owe her.

903
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,640
Besides,

904
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,860
do you want me
to be an ungrateful person?

905
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,330
If I were ungrateful,
you'd have starved to death long ago.

906
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,520
Now I understand.

907
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,870
You are just bewitched

908
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,710
by her beauty.

909
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,490
You think I haven't seen
beautiful women?

910
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,630
When you landed on the island,

911
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,600
you kept saying,

912
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,910
"Ziqing."

913
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,560
"You have become more beautiful."

914
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,290
"How do you keep getting prettier?"

915
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,230
You were calling her so affectionately.

916
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,080
If I didn't praise her
and call her beauty,

917
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,560
you would have been fish food.

918
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,400
I...

919
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,950
Think about it.

920
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,910
Anyway,

921
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,470
now for that woman,

922
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,490
you don't even want the bounty.

923
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,150
Tell me.

924
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,600
Why don't you learn something useful,

925
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,040
instead of learning from others

926
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,140
to love beauty over the kingdom?

927
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,360
Besides, do you even have a kingdom?

928
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,800
You can't even support me.

929
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,000
And you talk about beauty.

930
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,280
Can you support a beauty?

931
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,530
How can she survive with you?

932
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,560
Let's not talk about the kingdom.

933
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,670
Let's talk about having a bed first.

934
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,600
Anyway, you don't understand.

935
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,280
A gentleman loves wealth,
but acquires it properly.

936
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,690
As long as I have food,
you won't starve.

937
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,270
There will be money.

938
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,220
Yes, there will be money
in your dreams.

939
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,510
- Sleep, sleep.
- Sleep, right.

940
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,430
Once you sleep,

941
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,460
there will be money.

942
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,520
Once you sleep,

943
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,940
there will be everything.

944
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,880
It

945
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,100
pisses me off.

946
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,100
What a lousy place.

947
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,560
There is not even a big bookshelf.

948
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,430
I told you
not to bring these useless books down.

949
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,330
But you wouldn't listen.

950
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,840
The area down the mountain
is not as spacious as the main yard.

951
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,490
There's no place to put these things.

952
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,870
In my opinion, we might as well

953
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,320
just go back to the Jiang Family.

954
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,280
It's better than suffering

955
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,360
under your father.

956
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,530
How can that be possible?

957
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,390
I won't go back to the Jiang Family.

958
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,800
Your parents can't even bear

959
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,910
to buy meat once in half a month.

960
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,990
Do you want to starve me to death?

961
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,670
Meiting.

962
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,190
Come, come here.

963
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,730
Come on, get up.

964
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,990
Here, sit.

965
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,620
Don't be angry.

966
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,750
I know

967
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,630
you can't

968
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,080
endure hardship.

969
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,700
I don't want you to suffer either.

970
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,050
But now,

971
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,420
we've been forced into this situation.

972
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,870
If

973
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,140
you don't say something,

974
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,940
then what can I do?

975
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,620
What do you mean?

976
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,750
Meiting,

977
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,630
even if your father doesn't like me at all,

978
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,470
so be it.

979
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,120
But you

980
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,630
are still his biological daughter.

981
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,570
How could he bear to let you...

982
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,290
Meiting,

983
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,050
I feel sorry for you.

984
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,860
I feel indignant for you.

985
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,180
But what can I do?

986
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,080
It's all that woman's fault.

987
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,280
If it weren't for her,

988
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,050
we wouldn't be bullied like this.

989
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,330
That woman,

990
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,140
that woman...

991
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,470
I noticed at the dock

992
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,660
she's definitely not a good person.

993
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,120
Think about it.

994
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,360
She dared to act so wildly

995
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,620
on others' home.

996
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,800
Even if we don't move now,

997
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,640
in the future,

998
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,530
can we still have good days?

999
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,250
Forget it, forget it.

1000
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,900
Let's just go back to the Jiang Family.

1001
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,660
I won't go back to the Jiang Family.

1002
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,800
No way.

1003
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,150
We need to think of a way

1004
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,140
to move back to the main yard.

1005
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,750
Meiting,

1006
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,180
if we want to move back
to the main yard,

1007
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,860
we must drive those two people out.

1008
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,390
Lately, I feel

1009
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,470
the relationship between your father
and that Nianbei

1010
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,330
is quite unusual.

1011
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,180
It must be...

1012
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,600
Jiang Chen.

1013
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,560
You can't tell people this.

1014
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,700
I know.

1015
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,050
However,

1016
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,950
even if that person and your father

1017
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,180
have an unusual relationship,

1018
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,940
when it gets out,

1019
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,210
at most, it will just be a joke

1020
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,710
among the major families
on Liuxian Island.

1021
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,660
What's the big deal?

1022
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,530
Why is it

1023
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,570
that your parents reacted

1024
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,860
as if they were facing a great enemy?

1025
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,710
It's as if leaking this information

1026
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,250
is a crime that could destroy the family.

1027
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,290
Could it be...

1028
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,490
Could it be what?

1029
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,000
Could it be that person's identity

1030
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,420
is special?

1031
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,660
Special?

1032
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,880
Forget it.

1033
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,860
No matter who he is,

1034
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,530
our main concern

1035
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,490
is to make sure he doesn't wake up.

1036
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,330
As long as he doesn't wake up,

1037
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,050
he can't threaten our interests.

1038
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,560
Right?

1039
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,530
Right?

1040
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,600
Meiting, you must be tired.

1041
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,460
Come on, take a rest.

1042
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,010
Let me give you a massage.

1043
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,840
Come on.

1044
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,470
Let me see your hands.

1045
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,900
So delicate and tender.

1046
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,430
How about it?

1047
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,530
Your Highness, please.

1048
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,280
That's right, Your Highness.

1049
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,360
From a pharmacological perspective,

1050
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,660
this Ruodan Grass
is most likely the antidote.

1051
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,280
Now that His Highness' pulse
has greatly improved.

1052
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,430
With ample nourishment,

1053
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,010
he'll wake up soon.

1054
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,600
That's wonderful.

1055
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,560
Baili Weisheng

1056
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,460
is truly amazing.

1057
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,430
But he only gave me

1058
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,760
two plants of this herb.

1059
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,040
Should I go down the mountain now

1060
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,430
to buy more from the pharmacy?

1061
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,270
Wait.

1062
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,050
The fact that Beiyue was poisoned

1063
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,710
and is about to wake up

1064
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,140
must not be known to anyone.

1065
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,760
Your Highness, this Ruodan Grass

1066
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,320
is not hard to find.

1067
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,390
If I go up the mountain,

1068
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,380
I can definitely find it.

1069
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,530
Once His Highness wakes up,

1070
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,320
he will surely find out
who poisoned him.

1071
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,000
At that time, he will also find out
who framed us

1072
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,830
with the Blood Spirit Grass
and bring them to justice.

1073
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,910
No need for His Highness to speak.

1074
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,470
We already know who it is.

1075
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,840
When we were locked up,

1076
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,280
only Jiang Chen, their eldest son-in-law,

1077
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,150
and Miss Suying were here.

1078
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,560
But we don't have evidence now.

1079
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,620
We can't alert the enemy.

1080
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,160
Physician Gu,

1081
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,570
you just said,

1082
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,730
although His Highness is in a coma,

1083
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,600
he still has consciousness,

1084
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,440
right?

1085
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,150
His Highness

1086
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,190
is now under semi-consciousness.

1087
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,340
Although he is not fully awake,

1088
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,080
he has some awareness.

1089
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,330
So he knew that I came

1090
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,040
and if I talk to him,

1091
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,140
he can hear it too?

1092
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,400
He can hear it.

1093
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,080
Your Highness,

1094
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,530
I will go gather herbs now.

1095
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:54,970
Gu, I will go too.

1096
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:20,710
Jun Beiyue,

1097
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,330
wake up quickly.

1098
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,970
If you don't wake up soon,

1099
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,460
I might not be able

1100
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,860
to resist flattening the Lu Manor.

1101
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,900
You don't want to see me wreak havoc,
do you?

1102
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,860
Don't blame me then.

1103
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,360
Jun Beiyue,

1104
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,150
we haven't fulfilled our promise yet.

1105
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,290
You can't go back on your word.

1106
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,810
All you think about is the promise.

1107
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,560
What did you say?

1108
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,560
Say it again.

1109
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,990
Jun Beiyue.
