21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,560
To offer her a toast

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
is your courtesy.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,360
If she doesn't accept it,

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,310
she is the one being rude.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,260
- Yes, indeed.
- Moreover,

26
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,180
if you go to make peace,

27
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,900
Beiyue will see it.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,440
How could he
not understand your intentions?

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,980
You go to give her a toast.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,900
If she still disrespects you,

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,340
just splash it on her face.

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,820
It will at least vent your anger.

33
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,700
Yes, you're right.

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,100
Go ahead.

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,020
Brother Beiyue,

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,940
I want to drink a toast to Ziqing.

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,900
You don't mind, do you?

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,020
You should apologize
to your sister-in-law.

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,220
Ziqing.

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,900
A toast to you.

41
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,180
I am young

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,860
and immature.

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,100
Sorry

44
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
that I have been rude.

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,100
Please forgive me.

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,540
I think your sister-in-law

47
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,380
doesn't need to drink it.

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,500
Xin'er,

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,860
you drink it yourself.

50
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,700
Why?

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,140
Han Ziqing,

52
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,060
you don't receive my toast?

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,660
Fourth Princess, what an attitude.

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,430
You are so disrespectful.

55
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,060
Xin'er,

56
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,580
I can't drink alcohol.

57
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,660
I'll ask you one last time.

58
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,420
Will you drink it

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,820
or not?

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,220
No.

61
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,220
Your Highness.

62
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,300
Your Highness,

63
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,220
are you alright?

64
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,420
Situ Haonan!

65
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,540
Can you control your sister?

66
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,860
- Let go of me.
- Ziqing, I'm sorry.

67
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,060
Please forgive her.

68
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,900
Don't be angry.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
Apologize to Fourth Princess now.

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,900
What did I do wrong?

71
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,540
I tried to give her a toast
but she didn't accept it.

72
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,380
Shut up.

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,980
Your clothes are dirty.
Let's go to change the clothes.

74
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,740
Go.

75
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,260
- Let go of me.
- Go.

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,100
Let go of me.

77
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,780
Let go of me.

78
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,180
Let go.

79
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,580
Let go of me.

80
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,340
Your Highness, please sit down.

81
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,780
Is this dress okay?

82
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,900
Do you have a handkerchief?

83
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,420
Here, please clean yourself first.

84
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,740
Situ Xin'er went too far.

85
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,020
She dared to splash wine
on you at the palace banquet.

86
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,860
That's outrageous.

87
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,060
I won't be angry at her.

88
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,060
But your makeup is smudged.

89
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,940
Bring me a basin of clean water.

90
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,180
I'll wash my face.

91
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,020
Yes.

92
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,540
- Are you Hongyi?
- Yes, I am.

93
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,980
This is the rouge Fourth Prince
asked me to deliver.

94
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,820
It's the best quality.

95
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,980
Fourth Princess can use it
to touch up her makeup.

96
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,180
Fourth Prince asked you to bring it?

97
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,300
His Highness also instructed

98
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,940
that I must give it to you only.

99
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,580
That's wonderful.

100
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,140
Give it to me.

101
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,740
Your Highness,

102
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,100
look how considerate Fourth Prince is.

103
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,580
He prepared the rouge for you.

104
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,990
Let me help you touch up your makeup.

105
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,500
Is it necessary?

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,500
Since His Highness has prepared it,

107
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,460
we should use it.

108
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,180
It's from His Highness?

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,940
Yes, just now when I went out,

110
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,860
there was a maid at the door.

111
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,800
She said His Highness asked her
to bring it over specially.

112
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,580
And I have already checked it.

113
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,780
It is indeed the best rouge.

114
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,020
Why would he prepare this?

115
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,860
So it's true

116
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,940
that His Highness

117
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,820
is very considerate to you.

118
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,260
Was it delivered inside?

119
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,860
Yes.

120
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,580
Ziqing, you...

121
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,380
What happened to your face?

122
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,100
(Oh no.)

123
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,180
(I can't let them see my face.)

124
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,020
This rouge is usually fine to use.

125
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,140
But once it gets contact with alcohol,

126
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,420
it has a special effect.

127
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,300
And she won't feel anything at all.

128
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,760
(I need to leave here immediately.)

129
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,500
Did Fourth Prince just leave like that?

130
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,060
Shouldn't he give everyone
an explanation?

131
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,860
Follow him.

132
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,100
Yes.

133
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,750
Your Highness, slow down.

134
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,900
Your Highness!

135
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,620
Hongyi!

136
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,620
Let go of me.

137
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,740
What are you doing?

138
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,060
Help!

139
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,700
Hongyi?

140
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,700
Hongyi.

141
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,940
Hongyi.

142
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,420
- Your Highness.
- Where is Ziqing?

143
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,580
She has been taken away.

144
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,500
Who took her?

145
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,980
Not sure.

146
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,900
Let's go.

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,340
Your Majesty,

148
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,210
just now in the garden...

149
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,860
We have an assassin in the palace.

150
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,900
Alright, alright, stop dancing.

151
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,780
Your Majesty,

152
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,820
I think

153
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,460
Fourth Princess is a family member.

154
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,380
So today's matter

155
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,980
is our family affair.

156
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,100
Since it is a family affair,

157
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,020
how can we allow others
to speculate and comment on it?

158
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,900
The situation is still unclear.

159
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,500
If those with ill intentions used it

160
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,560
and maliciously slandered us,

161
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,220
it would be detrimental
to our Royal Family.

162
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,260
Therefore, I request Your Majesty
to issue an order immediately.

163
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
Prince An is absolutely right.

164
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Convey my decree.

165
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,020
Anyone who attended
the palace banquet today

166
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,540
is not allowed to disclose
what they saw or heard here.

167
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,460
If anyone leaks it out,

168
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,740
they will be killed without mercy,

169
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,300
and their entire family
will be exterminated.

170
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,660
Yes.

171
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,340
Alright, everyone may leave now.

172
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,820
We take our leave.

173
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,700
Guards!

174
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,940
What are you trying to do?

175
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,160
How dare you block the way here?

176
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,220
Long time no see, Second Prince.

177
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,260
Chu Feiyan?

178
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,660
In the middle of the night,

179
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,740
where are you going?

180
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,220
I have important work to do.

181
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,060
Judging by this route, it seems
you are heading to Nanzhao.

182
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,220
Mother ordered me to go to Nanzhao

183
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,700
to deliver some items to my aunt.

184
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,540
What are you delivering?

185
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,540
It's not convenient to disclose that.

186
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,260
I hope you will understand.

187
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,700
I am returning to Nanzhao now.

188
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,620
I can help you.

189
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,060
Mother instructed

190
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,300
that I must deliver it personally,

191
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,540
so I won't trouble you.

192
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,060
That is not up to you.

193
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,780
I insist on helping you with this.

194
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,540
I have no enmity with you.

195
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,900
Why make things difficult for me?

196
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,340
You dare to touch Jun Beiyue's wife,

197
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,990
yet you fear I will
make things difficult for you.

198
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,820
Move.

199
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,220
Chu Feiyan.

200
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,820
Someone, take her away.

201
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,020
Yes.

202
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,900
Xuanyuan Lige,

203
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,220
it has nothing to do with you.

204
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,880
For your own good, you should
leave immediately.

205
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,980
Stop!

206
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,740
Look at Ziqing.

207
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,340
Ziqing.

208
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,020
Take them all away.

209
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,780
Yes.

210
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,140
Beiyue,

211
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,270
you are a prince.

212
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,180
You must consider the bigger picture.

213
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,100
Don't worry, Uncle.

214
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,140
I know what I'm doing.

215
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,980
Your Highness.

216
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,820
Alright then.

217
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,840
In that case,

218
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,620
I will take my leave.

219
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,460
Beiyue, we have searched the palace
and even the whole city.

220
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,990
We still haven't found any trace
of Ziqing.

221
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,500
It seems that the person behind this
must have planned it meticulously.

222
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,740
We must do it in secret.

223
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,340
Gather the troops

224
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,990
and we will go out of the city
to search for her.

225
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,020
Yes.

226
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,340
Count us in as well.

227
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,100
Who are you?

228
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,540
We are Fourth Princess' private troops.

229
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,020
- Has he woken up?
- Yes, he has.

230
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,900
It's been almost two hours.

231
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,180
Why did you capture me?

232
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,060
I didn't want to capture you.

233
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,300
But you meddled in my affairs.

234
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,700
Where is Ziqing?

235
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,420
Don't do anything rash.

236
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,980
Otherwise,

237
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,140
I'll make you pay for this.

238
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,180
What kind of trick did she use?

239
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,380
All you men are protecting her.

240
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,260
Let me tell you.

241
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,060
I will go against her

242
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,220
and torture her to a living death.

243
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,500
You poisoned me.

244
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,740
Don't worry.

245
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,020
This poison won't kill you.

246
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,660
It just makes you too weak to resist me.

247
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,540
Where exactly is Ziqing now?

248
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,380
What will you do to her?

249
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,580
I want her dead.

250
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,700
But not as simple as killing her
with one stroke.

251
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
I want to cut her flesh piece by piece

252
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,420
and make her life worse than death.

253
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,980
You dare.

254
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,860
Watch me.

255
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,220
You two are now my prisoners.

256
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,740
Let's settle both old and new scores
together.

257
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,260
Sleep a bit more.

258
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,140
Noisy.

259
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,500
Give him the medicine.

260
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,980
Yes.

261
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,580
Don't touch me.

262
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,860
Look at your face first.

263
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,300
After you've seen it enough,

264
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,500
we'll talk slowly.

265
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,820
So beautiful.

266
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,140
Shameless.

267
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,780
What do you want?

268
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,580
You are already a prisoner,

269
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,620
but still so arrogant.

270
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,860
Come on,

271
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,860
take a look.

272
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,580
You have this thing on your face,

273
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,580
so you're an Islander.

274
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,660
I want Jun Beiyue

275
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,800
to take a good look at your face.

276
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,300
Look at what kind of ugly monster

277
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,300
the woman he is determined to marry is?

278
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,220
You are truly pitiful.

279
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,780
For a man,

280
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,780
you're jealous to this extent.

281
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,460
Do you believe I'll kill you right now?

282
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,300
Go ahead. Kill me.

283
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,300
Even if you kill me,

284
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,140
Jun Beiyue won't look at you any.

285
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,300
It is not important anymore.

286
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,980
What matters is,

287
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,140
from now on,

288
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,860
he will never see you again.

289
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,190
Is that all the strength you have?

290
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,260
Are you just scratching an itch?

291
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,580
Keep hitting.

292
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,180
Come on.

293
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,300
Do you believe I'll kill you right now?

294
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,700
Stop.

295
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,100
Killing her would ruin my plans.

296
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,900
I have to say,

297
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,860
this woman is so pathetic now,

298
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,500
and with that thing on her face,

299
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,660
she looks quite interesting.

300
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,020
You can't possibly still be interested

301
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,060
in her at this point, can you?

302
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,420
She is no longer a woman in my eyes.

303
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,060
She is a bargaining chip.

304
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,060
With her in our hands,

305
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,060
aren't we able to control Jun Beiyue?

306
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,140
We had an agreement.

307
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,380
No matter what conditions
Jun Beiyue offers,

308
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,980
this woman belongs to me.

309
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,180
I want to skin her alive,

310
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,020
and cut her flesh.

311
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,780
I've told you,

312
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,420
this woman is of great use to us.

313
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,740
Why don't you understand?

314
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,140
She's just an Islander.

315
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,980
What use does she have?

316
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,100
Think about it.

317
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,020
Why did Nanzhao go to such lengths

318
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,500
to capture the Islanders?

319
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,340
There must be some secrets behind it.

320
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,580
Are you saying,

321
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,860
besides using her to control Jun Beiyue,

322
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,140
you want to uncover the secrets
behind the Islanders?

323
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,140
Don't you?

324
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,820
Do you just want to be a concubine

325
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,260
of the King of Nanzhao forever?

326
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,020
It's all because of this woman.

327
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,380
I can't let her go no matter what.

328
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,940
But I can promise you,

329
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,300
before sending her back to Xiling,

330
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,300
I won't touch her.

331
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,540
Have you planned out the route

332
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,600
to transport her back to Xiling?

333
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
Follow me.

334
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,860
Your Highness, it's the Second Prince.

335
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,300
Your Highness, there's
still one alive here.

336
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,180
Whom did you fight with?

337
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,620
It was Chu-Chu Feiyan.

338
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,300
His Highness wanted to take
Fourth Princess to Nanzhao,

339
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,980
but she was intercepted
by Chu Feiyan halfway.

340
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,820
Where did they go?

341
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,660
Greettings, Prince Xiang.

342
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,020
Princess Zhaoxi?

343
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,060
What's going on here?

344
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,940
I invited her.

345
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,900
I think for the sake
of your brother's life,

346
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,940
you should be willing to make a deal
with us.

347
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,900
My brother is reckless

348
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,140
and often stands up for others.

349
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,340
He has offended you two.

350
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,340
I apologize on his behalf.

351
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,700
No need for formalities.

352
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,580
Actually, during our trip to Nanzhao,
we became friends.

353
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,060
If it weren't for the case,

354
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,260
I wouldn't capture your brother.

355
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,700
My brother has been a worry
to our mother since childhood.

356
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,300
He always causes trouble
when he goes out.

357
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,340
Our mother is quite worried about him.

358
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,540
But Dongling cannot do
without my brother,

359
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,460
so his life is very important.

360
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,660
I'm willing to apologize on his behalf,

361
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,980
and hope you two will spare him.

362
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,420
When can you do things
without causing trouble?

363
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,180
Isn't it just kidnapping?

364
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,780
Why make it so public?

365
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,500
Xuanyuan Lige is the Crown Prince
of Dongling after all.

366
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,620
Can we kill him easily?

367
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,220
So I invited Princess Zhaoxi

368
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,300
to discuss a strategy.

369
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,900
Yes, Prince Xiang,

370
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,740
you don't need to worry.

371
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,820
As for Han Ziqing,

372
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,740
my hatred for her

373
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,500
is no less than Consort Yun's.

374
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,820
It's all because of her

375
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,100
that my brother is blinded by lust

376
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,300
and always does ridiculous things

377
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,940
to harm the interests of Dongling.

378
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,980
I am willing to cooperate with you two

379
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,500
to make this plan flawless.

380
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,990
How do you plan to cooperate?

381
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,260
This place

382
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,500
is the territory of Tianque.

383
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,180
I suppose at this moment,

384
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,860
Jun Beiyue has already sealed
all the exits.

385
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,220
To safely transport a living person out

386
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,820
is not an easy task.

387
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,500
However,

388
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,700
I can help you.

389
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,980
How can you help?

390
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,460
If you don't want Jun Beiyue
to know your whereabouts,

391
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,260
the safest way now
is to take the sea route

392
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,420
and detour through Yaoshun Island.

393
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,340
Yaoshun Island in the East Sea?

394
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,580
The East Sea is Dongling's territory.

395
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,980
As long as we board a large ship
from Dongling,

396
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,140
even Jun Beiyue can't do anything to us.

397
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,100
So, if you cooperate with us,

398
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,700
what do you want in return?

399
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,780
I don't care how you deal with
Han Ziqing,

400
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,380
as long as you give me the antidote

401
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,420
and release my brother,

402
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,060
I will ask for nothing else.

403
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,460
In the current Tianque,

404
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm afraid not even a fly can escape.

405
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,940
Using Dongling's sea route
is the best option.

406
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,580
Since the major issue is settled,

407
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,020
would it be convenient for you two

408
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,180
to take me to see my brother

409
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,580
and the Fourth Princess of Tianque?

410
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,540
Let's go.

411
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,460
Brother!

412
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,740
Xuanyuan Lige.

413
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,620
Xuanyuan Lige.

414
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,100
- Princess Zhaoxi
- Xuanyuan Lige.

415
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,700
truly has deep feelings for her brother.

416
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,260
In the face of royal power,

417
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,980
will there be any sibling affection?

418
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,340
In Dongling, women have always
held power,

419
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,300
but in terms of talent,

420
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,460
Xuanyuan Lige is ten times more capable
than Xuanyuan Zhaoxi.

421
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,470
Xuanyuan Lige,

422
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,060
wake up.

423
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,240
Xuanyuan Zhaoxi is just unwilling

424
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,780
to let go of her brother
as a stepping stone.

425
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,680
Zhaoxi?

426
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,260
And Han Ziqing

427
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,140
has become her stumbling block.

428
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,540
Why are you here?

429
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,460
If I didn't come, how would I know
you caused trouble again?

430
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,980
Why are you associating
with those people?

431
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,380
What exactly do you want to do?

432
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
What do I want to do?

433
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,780
I want to save you.

434
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,940
I don't need you to save me.

435
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,780
Hurry up and leave.

436
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,100
Xuanyuan Lige.

437
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,780
I'm afraid you have no choice.

438
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,940
If you have the guts, kill me.

439
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,620
Otherwise,

440
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,260
everything you did to Ziqing today,

441
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,780
I will repay you double.

442
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,740
Xuanyuan Lige,

443
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,580
you are a dying man.
How dare you to threaten me?

444
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,380
Prince Xiang,

445
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,460
didn't you say you would
take me to see Han Ziqing?

446
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,860
Bring her in.

447
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,140
Xuanyuan Lige,

448
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,560
the woman you have been protecting
with all your heart

449
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,140
now looks like this.

450
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,100
Do you still like her?

451
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,740
Will you still
give up the entire Dongling for her?

452
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,620
Shut up.

453
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,660
Shut your mouth.

454
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,620
If you take one more step,

455
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,820
do you believe I will kill her?

456
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,820
How dare you!

457
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,820
Oh?

458
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,940
Just try me.

459
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,180
- Stop!
- Enough!

460
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,140
Princess Zhaoxi,

461
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,840
you have seen them.

462
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,980
Now we should discuss the main business.

463
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,780
We will use Dongling's ship

464
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,100
to transport her to Xiling.

465
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,100
You can cry later.

466
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,020
Ziqing,

467
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,780
I will

468
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,660
save you out.

469
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,300
So what should we do now?

470
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,820
Since Han Ziqing's face

471
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,140
really has this totem,

472
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,500
doesn't that prove

473
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,460
she is indeed an Islander?

474
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,100
We can't be completely sure.

475
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,540
To ensure everything is foolproof,

476
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,660
we still need to verify

477
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,260
whether she is truly immune
to all poisons.

478
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,900
How do we verify that?

479
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,660
Of course, by using poisons.

480
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,820
If she dies after being poisoned,

481
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,020
it will be her good fortune.

482
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,660
If she doesn't die,

483
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,460
it proves she is indeed an Islander.

484
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,540
She will be of great use to us.

485
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,180
(Yaoshun)

486
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,060
(Yaoshun Island)

487
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,060
(Yaoshun Island)

488
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,940
- And over here.
- Alright, alright.

489
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,820
Is it beautiful?

490
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,540
Your Highness.

491
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,020
Father,

492
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,980
Jun Beichen has kidnapped
my princess consort.

493
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,940
I demand an explanation.

494
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,180
Beichen

495
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,380
has kidnapped Fourth Princess?

496
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,460
Your Majesty,

497
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,030
Fourth Prince is slandering Beichen
without any evidence.

498
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,260
How dare he!

499
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,700
Your Majesty.

500
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,460
Has the Judicial Office arrived?

501
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,750
They have arrived.

502
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,620
Greetings, Your Majesty.

503
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,980
Beichen.

504
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,540
Beichen.

505
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,360
Beichen.

506
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,620
Beichen, wake up.

507
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,500
Beichen, what's wrong?

508
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,020
Jun Beiyue!

509
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,020
Why did you kill Beichen?

510
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,780
Come on.

511
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,460
Reveal your identity.

512
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,060
I am Second Prince's personal guard.

513
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,140
Second Prince

514
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,940
was killed by Chu Feiyan.

515
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,140
Why did Chu Feiyan kill Beichen?

516
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,220
You should

517
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,340
know it well.

518
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,420
Speak!

519
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,100
We acted

520
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,300
on Second Prince's orders

521
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,700
to kidnap Fourth Princess
and take her to Nanzhao.

522
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,300
We encountered Chu Feiyan halfway.

523
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,580
Chu Feiyan kidnapped Fourth Princess.

524
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,100
Second Prince was...

525
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,860
Beichen.

526
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,380
Beichen!

527
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,660
Queen,

528
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,610
Beichen always listened to you.

529
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,860
Tell me,

530
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,540
did you instruct him
to kidnap Fourth Princess?

531
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,620
Yes.

532
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,900
I poisoned the rouge

533
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,180
to ruin Han Ziqing's face.

534
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,620
Then I had Beichen kidnap her.

535
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,060
I did all of this, so what?

536
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,260
My son Beichen was dead.

537
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,340
What hope do I have left?

538
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,940
Jun Beiyue!

539
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,820
It's all your fault.

540
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,140
You block Beichen's path.

541
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,260
You and your wife control the power
in Tianque's court.

542
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,820
You leave no chance for my son to rise.

543
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,660
It's you!

544
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,100
It's all of you!

545
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,380
You all deserve to die!

546
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,700
Father,

547
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,140
now that we have both witnesses
and evidence.

548
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,740
Please make a decision.

549
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,580
Beichen.

550
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,180
Beichen.

551
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,540
Beichen.

552
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,500
Beichen,

553
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,700
I have come to find you.

554
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,860
Are you still worrying
about your beloved?

555
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,540
Don't worry.

556
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,300
I won't harm her life for now.

557
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,980
How

558
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,180
is Ziqing now?

559
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,140
Do you really want to know?

560
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,260
Then I'll take you to see her.

561
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,220
Bring him with me.

562
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,420
Do you smell it?

563
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,250
Poisons.

564
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,620
That's right.

565
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,350
We are testing the poisons on her.

566
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,260
What did you say?

567
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,660
Testing if she is truly immune
to all poisons.

568
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,900
Do you think Jun Beiyue will spare you?

569
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,340
Are you using Jun Beiyue
to threaten me?

570
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,780
It's ridiculous.

571
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,780
Ziqing.

572
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,060
Ziqing.

573
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,500
Take a good look.

574
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,500
No, no.

575
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,340
No.

576
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,300
No!

577
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,340
Ziqing.

578
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,550
Ziqing.

579
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,420
I will kill you.

580
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,780
I will kill you!

581
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,780
Do you feel hurt?

582
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,260
Don't worry.

583
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,300
If she is truly an Islander,

584
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,940
these poisons won't kill her.

585
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,020
They will only make her suffer.

586
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,180
Moreover,

587
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,780
the more heartbroken you are,
the happier I am.

588
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,340
I just love seeing you men

589
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,300
broken heart for her.

590
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,300
Ziqing.

591
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,540
- Ziqing.
- Have you seen enough?

592
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,980
I still need to discuss the sea route
with Zhaoxi.

593
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,660
Take him away.

594
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,780
Ziqing.

595
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,660
Ziqing!

596
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,860
Chu Feiyan.

597
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,540
Chu Feiyan,

598
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,620
I will kill you!

599
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,500
Ziqing.

600
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,940
Ziqing.

601
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,460
Ziqing.
