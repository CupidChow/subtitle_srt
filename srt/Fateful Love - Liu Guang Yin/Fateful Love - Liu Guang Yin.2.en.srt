21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,490
Miss Ziqing, what are you looking for?

22
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,330
A dagger.

23
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,440
Do you know?

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,410
My mother had a dagger.

25
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,610
It's about this long.

26
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,720
There is a green bead on it.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
No.

28
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,690
I have never seen it before.

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,640
Such things are not allowed

30
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,240
in a lady's boudoir.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,080
Where are my mother's belongings?

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,410
They were thrown away
by Madam Han long ago.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,330
- Have you forgotten?
- All of them?

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Yes, indeed.

35
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,050
Miss Ziqing,

36
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,210
don't be angry.

37
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,690
(That dagger should be the key.)

38
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,240
(Maybe I can go back)

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,330
(if I can find it.)

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,080
Miss Ziqing,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,290
why are you so different today?

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
What was I like before?

43
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,160
You never

44
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,050
raised your voice before.

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,770
If others look down on you,

46
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,410
should you also belittle yourself?

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,690
Why can't I speak loudly at home?

48
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,410
My mother's belongings were thrown away.

49
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,250
It's so lame.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Miss Ziqing.

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Yun Xi,

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,440
can you do something for me?

53
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,340
Whatever you say.

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
Can you help me find out

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,520
where my mother's belongings

56
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,640
were discarded?

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,640
And the dagger.

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
That dagger is exquisite.

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,690
People who have dealt with it
must have an impression.

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,000
Help me find them.

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,720
I'll get on it later.

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,290
Stand up straight.

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
Don't be a pushover.

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,600
My maid

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
should be tough.

66
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,640
But Miss Ziqing,

67
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,720
you can do whatever you want here.

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,050
But when you're out there,
you'd better keep it in check.

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,290
Try not to offend Miss Xi'er.

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,440
Why?

71
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,600
After all, you're going to marry Chen.

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,320
Without the support of your natal family,

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,450
you'll have a hard time.

74
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,040
Who says I'm marrying Chen?

75
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,130
Everyone in town knows about it.

76
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,890
If you're not, what else can you do?

77
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,570
I heard that the Chen family
is not well off either.

78
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,800
I hope the Master will give you a dowry

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,880
for the sake of your mother.

80
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,130
(I have to find out who Chen is.)

81
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,520
(And what Han Xi'er is trying)

82
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,920
(to pull off behind my back.)

83
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,200
Find out

84
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,450
where the Chens live.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,290
I'm glad you've come around.

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,480
Come here.

87
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,970
Got it?

88
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,970
Iron chains and sticks?

89
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,800
What do you need that for?

90
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,290
No more questions. Just go.

91
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,130
Hurry up.

92
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,940
(Chancellor's Mansion)

93
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,480
Not reaction?

94
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,970
It was fine at first.

95
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,890
But now it's not moving.

96
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,130
It's useless when we need it the most.

97
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,040
This isn't the first time

98
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,130
it has tricked us.

99
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
It's never accurate.

100
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,290
I think we should call it a day.

101
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,730
It's getting late.

102
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,320
Let's just find an inn

103
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,450
and settle in for the night.

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,320
Wait.

105
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,450
It's reacting.

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,990
Let's trust it one more time.

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
We've come this far already.

108
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,440
That way. Let's go.

109
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Please!

110
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,920
My Lord, no, please!

111
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,290
Please forgive me!

112
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,480
I was instructed

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
by Han Xi'er and Chen,

114
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,240
the owner of Grandeur Palace.

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
I was just getting paid to do this.

116
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080
Please.

117
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,450
But I didn't get to do it that night.

118
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,570
I was knocked out

119
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,880
before I could get close to Miss Ziqing.

120
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,360
The back of my neck is still swollen.

121
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,690
If it was not you, then who was it?

122
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,480
I don't know.

123
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,450
I woke up

124
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,080
the next morning

125
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,640
and sneaked out.

126
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,010
But it was

127
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,360
all over town already.

128
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm afraid Miss Xi'er would blame me.

129
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,730
That's why I agreed to do it.

130
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,130
So, Han Xi'er did put you up to this?

131
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,760
Yes.

132
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,080
I wouldn't dare lie.

133
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,850
- Fine.
- (So that's what happened.)

134
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,080
I have here a confession,

135
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,610
accusing Han Xi'er of instructing you

136
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,520
to dishonor Han Ziqing.

137
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,760
Put your fingerprint on it

138
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,290
and we'll spare your life.

139
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,240
But I...

140
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,290
I didn't do it to Miss Ziqing.

141
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,040
- (They are targeting the Chancellor's.)
- Okay, okay.

142
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,640
All right. I'll do it.

143
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,180
(Chen)

144
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,880
Is it done?

145
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,880
We've got the confession.

146
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,810
It was instructed by Han Xi'er.

147
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,370
Did you take him out?

148
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,850
Master, rest assured.

149
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,930
We killed him.

150
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,610
He stays silent now.

151
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,120
(Why is this man incriminating Chen?)

152
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,170
(Could he be...)

153
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,610
(I'd like to see)

154
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,520
(who you really are.)

155
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,250
Who's there?

156
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,990
So the ancient people
were so skilled in martial arts.

157
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,770
Who are you?

158
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,720
Why are you stopping me?

159
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,760
Don't ask for trouble.

160
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,930
Is it going to help us find our target?

161
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,050
Of course. It works like magic.

162
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,320
Wait up.

163
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,970
- No one's here?
- Where are we now?

164
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,400
Little guy,

165
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
where is it?

166
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,480
Where is it?

167
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,010
This thing

168
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,120
fooled us again.

169
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,680
It never worked.

170
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,760
Can't we just try?

171
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,120
If it were that easy to find,
we would have been rich long ago.

172
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,560
You idiot.

173
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,450
Looks like

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,930
a woman.

175
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,510
Follow her.

176
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,200
I shouldn't have been a bounty hunter.

177
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,010
Mother.

178
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,560
Beichen, you're here.

179
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,160
Mother.

180
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,090
Leave us.

181
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,050
Mother, the two men
who went with me yesterday

182
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
went missing.

183
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,720
What?

184
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,880
They went missing?

185
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,250
How is that possible?

186
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,810
What happened last night?

187
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,370
I think I was being followed.

188
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,370
I had just come out

189
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,880
when a person in black attacked me.

190
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,120
I was worried that things would be exposed

191
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,520
and hastily returned to report to you.

192
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,000
Those two men fought

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
with the one in black.

194
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,770
But

195
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,490
they haven't come back yet.

196
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,290
Bad move.

197
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,080
Why do you always mess things up

198
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,410
when I ask you to handle something?

199
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,250
If...

200
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,730
If this implicates us...

201
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,680
Mother, please rest assured.

202
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,080
Those two are from the inner court

203
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,250
and have nothing to do with us.

204
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
And even if they were caught,

205
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,320
they wouldn't dare to mention us.

206
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,320
Their family is still in my hands.

207
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,290
However,

208
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,370
it's urgent to find them.

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,290
Dead or alive.

210
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,520
We can't stand loose strings.

211
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,010
You're right, Mother.

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,490
What about the confession?

213
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,330
Keep it for now.

214
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,930
It'll be of use later.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
Your Highness.

216
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,640
Those two in purple were from the palace.

217
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,560
When I caught up with them,

218
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,970
they seemed to be afraid of being exposed.

219
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,810
Seeing that they couldn't defeat me,
they committed suicide.

220
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,820
I checked their swords

221
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,080
and they were from the palace.

222
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,690
Where are the bodies?

223
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,880
Buried outside town.

224
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,080
What's the situation outside

225
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,850
after Chen died?

226
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,290
The authorities have been informed,

227
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,850
and the streets are buzzing with it.

228
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,560
Han Ziqing's marriage

229
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,490
naturally came to an end.

230
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,490
Did you find out

231
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,730
- about Han Ziqing?
- Yes.

232
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,320
Nothing suspicious.

233
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,200
Her mother, named Muzi,

234
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,670
was the second wife of the Chancellor.

235
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,970
She encountered bandits and jumped off a cliff

236
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,660
on her way to a temple in the mountains.

237
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,200
Han Ziqing grew up in the Chancellor's Mansion

238
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,080
and seldom went out.

239
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,880
No different from other noble girls.

240
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,610
Is that so?

241
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,930
Does an ordinary girl have such skills?

242
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,560
That's strange.

243
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,880
There have been rumors among their servants,

244
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,170
saying that after Miss Ziqing's ordeal

245
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,320
at Grandeur Palace,

246
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,760
her temperament has drastically changed,

247
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,200
as if she is a completely different person.

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Keep checking.

249
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,650
Miss Xi'er,

250
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,080
I heard that Chen died.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
Why did he die

252
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,250
at this critical moment?

253
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
Now that he is dead,

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,250
Miss Ziqing won't be able to marry him.

255
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,050
Does this mean
she might have a chance in the selection?

256
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,730
- Today is the day for selecting the consort.
- Silence.

257
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,930
Everyone knows about her affairs.

258
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,730
How shameless is she to go to the selection?

259
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,370
Does she think that with Chen dead,

260
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,250
she now stands a chance?

261
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,520
(Where is that dagger now?)

262
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
Miss Ziqing.

263
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,440
Have you heard?

264
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,730
Chen was killed last night.

265
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,570
I know.

266
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,320
What will you do now?

267
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,050
What do you mean?

268
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,170
What does it have to do with me?

269
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,610
Miss Ziqing,

270
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,520
it's getting late.

271
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
You should get changed.

272
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
For what?

273
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,080
You are also on the list
for the consort selection.

274
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,610
Now that you can't marry Chen,

275
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,660
according to the rules, you should
attend the selection at the palace.

276
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,370
What consort selection?

277
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,210
I'm not going.

278
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,050
Ziqing,

279
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,370
why make things difficult for the maid?

280
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,170
Why are you here?

281
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,970
Spit it out or get lost.

282
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,880
I came to tell you

283
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,640
that Chen is dead.

284
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,730
Are you happy now?

285
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,050
What does his death

286
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,930
have to do with me?

287
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,810
Don't say that.

288
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,290
You were his betrothed.

289
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,410
Now that he's dead,

290
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,730
I bet you're thrilled

291
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,120
that you now have a chance to be selected.

292
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,850
Why are you waiting for?

293
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,250
Help her change.

294
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,890
The selection is about to begin.

295
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,610
If she attends dressed like this,

296
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,010
people will think she's our maid.

297
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,850
Ziqing,

298
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,560
you're no longer Chen's betrothed.

299
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,280
You'll be late if you don't get ready.

300
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,120
Imagine how

301
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,700
the Fourth Prince would react

302
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,510
if he knew one of his potential consorts

303
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,490
had just lost her betrothed.

304
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,250
Am I right, Ziqing?

305
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,370
Han Xi'er,

306
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,250
instead of preparing yourself,

307
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,800
you come here to provoke me.

308
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,920
Are you afraid that I'll go to the selection

309
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,400
and take your place as the Princess Consort?

310
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,770
Ridiculous.

311
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,560
You were never qualified for the selection.

312
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,970
I was just

313
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,650
teasing you.

314
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,730
This is a cover-up.

315
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,570
You're afraid.

316
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,650
It's written

317
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,970
on your face.

318
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,810
Nonsense.

319
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,080
Do you think

320
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,130
you still have a chance?

321
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,890
Let me remind you,

322
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,850
I am the legitimate daughter of the Chancellor.

323
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,490
My mother was born into nobility.

324
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,490
But you?

325
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,370
Your mother was a lowly woman
from a music parlor.

326
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,250
You could never be my equal.

327
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,090
Say that again.

328
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,560
I said your mother

329
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,560
was a lowly woman from a music parlor.

330
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,130
Do you know what a music parlor is?

331
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,730
It's a place where men go to be entertained.

332
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,760
If you slap me again,

333
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
I will tell my father.

334
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
Go ahead.

335
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,730
Han Xi'er,

336
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,890
you are scheming against me

337
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,280
because you're afraid I'll go to the selection.

338
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,370
If you are so afraid of that,

339
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,080
then I must go.

340
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,800
- Don't you dare.
- Just watch me.

341
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,040
Hurry.

342
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
Take her clothes away.

343
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,400
Don't let her change.

344
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,240
Quickly.

345
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,250
Even if I don't wear your clothes

346
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,530
or put on makeup,

347
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,250
- I can still outshine you.
- I...

348
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,490
Come on, Yun Xi.

349
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,330
Let's go to the palace.

350
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,400
Yes, Miss.

351
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,280
Come back.

352
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,890
Don't go and disgrace our family.

353
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Miss Xi'er,

354
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,730
we need to hurry.

355
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,040
Let's go get prepared.

356
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,320
You can deal with her
when you're the Princess Consort.

357
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,970
Hurry.

358
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,490
Let's go.

359
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,680
Steamed buns!

360
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,400
Hot steamed buns!

361
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,090
Miss Ziqing.

362
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,040
What is it?

363
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,800
I've known you since we were kids,

364
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,530
and I understand you well.

365
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,130
But what you've been doing

366
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,370
these days

367
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,490
just doesn't seem like you.

368
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,250
Miss Ziqing,

369
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,530
I'm really glad to see you

370
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,610
standing up for yourself

371
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,440
and not letting anyone push you around anymore.

372
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,130
But everyone in the mansion

373
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,890
is talking about how much you've changed.

374
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,010
I'm worried someone might try
to use this against you.

375
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,530
Please, try to keep your temper in check
and protect yourself.

376
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,120
Don't worry.

377
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,890
I won't be pushed around anyway.

378
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,770
But you're right.

379
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,680
I'll be careful and look out for myself.

380
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,490
Thank you,

381
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,640
Yun Xi.

382
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,730
Did you find out

383
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,560
what I asked you to?

384
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,370
I did.

385
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,250
Your mother's belongings

386
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,530
were packed up by Nanny Feng,

387
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,370
who served Madam Han.

388
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,890
Later, Nanny Feng fell gravely ill

389
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,990
and was sent out of the mansion.

390
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,080
I heard that she passed away.

391
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,650
As for the dagger,

392
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,650
I asked the other maids,

393
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,370
but they all said they didn't remember it.

394
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,160
That can't be right.

395
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,400
That dagger was so unique.

396
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,440
Your Highness, all set at the Imperial Garden.

397
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,330
Your Highness,

398
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,040
although His Majesty has betrothed
Han's daughter to you,

399
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,920
we still need to go through the motions.

400
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,530
The daughters of noble families

401
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,630
will all be presented

402
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,990
in the Imperial Garden for the selection.

403
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,490
The time approaches.

404
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,650
Please prepare yourself.

405
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,650
Han's daughter?

406
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,400
Fine.

407
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,810
Let's go and see.

408
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,730
This is...

409
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,080
It's my daughter.

410
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,490
Just

411
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,920
to see what happens.

412
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,760
Lord Wang,

413
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,040
have you heard?

414
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
The Fourth Prince's marriage
to the Chancellor's daughter

415
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,610
was His Majesty's decision.

416
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,490
Indeed.

417
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
I heard

418
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,650
that the selection

419
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
is just a formality.

420
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,680
Chancellor Han's elder daughter

421
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,040
has already been chosen.

422
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,770
The Chancellor's daughter

423
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,130
is talented and beautiful.

424
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,440
- Yes.
- Your daughter is also lovely.

425
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
She has a good chance too.

426
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,080
Our Xi'er is so beautiful.

427
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,530
- Enter the ladies.
- Of course.

428
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,520
Here they are.

429
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,080
That one is the most outstanding.

430
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,850
The first one is Han's elder daughter.

431
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,490
Good, good.

432
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,080
Dear, you raised her well.

433
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,280
Of course.

434
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,080
That's my girl.

435
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,400
Is that Han's younger daughter?

436
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,400
Ziqing.

437
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,760
Ziqing.

438
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,760
Why are you here?

439
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,610
- (This is what a consort selection is like.)
- Why is she here so late?

440
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,560
- Look at her.
- (Truly extravagant.)

441
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,850
She disgraces our family.

442
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,970
(Even more lavish than that on TV.)

443
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,610
Why are you

444
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,650
arriving so late

445
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,660
- and with no sense of decorum?
- Where should I stand?

446
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,690
In the back.

447
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,130
Such a lack of manners.

448
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,040
Please make some space.

449
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,850
How presumptuous.

450
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,400
The Fourth Prince arrives.

451
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,760
Your Highness,

452
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,280
today is a joyous day for you.

453
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,920
Congratulations on finding a good match

454
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,490
and sharing honor together.

455
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,770
Thank you, Chancellor.

456
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,370
I hear that your daughter...

457
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,440
Bow.

458
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,600
...is among the candidates today.

459
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,040
Rise.

460
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,000
Indeed, Your Highness.

461
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,560
(Why do I find his eyes so familiar?)

462
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,920
(As if I've seen him somewhere before.)

463
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,610
Xi'er, greet His Highness.

464
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,440
Your name is Han Xi'er?

465
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,000
Yes.

466
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,610
Xi in my name means "evening tide."

467
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,010
Han Xi'er,

468
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,440
what talents do you possess?

469
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,610
Your Highness,

470
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,970
I learned from renowned masters
since I was young.

471
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,320
I am versed in the four arts.

472
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,370
She is asking what you can do.

473
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,250
Four-line poems

474
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,250
with five or seven characters,

475
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,200
guqin,

476
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,040
ci poems...

477
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,130
Can you kill?

478
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,610
Kill...

479
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Your Highness,

480
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,490
I was raised in a noble family

481
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,200
and have never even seen a chicken killed,

482
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,530
let alone killing a person.

483
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,440
I was kidding.

484
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,610
Ziqing,

485
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,320
greet His Highness.

486
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

487
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,650
Your Highness,

488
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,800
this is my younger daughter, Han Ziqing.

489
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,080
She is a bit nervous in your presence

490
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
and has lost her composure.

491
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,490
Please forgive her.

492
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,280
Is she the one at Grandeur Palace and was...

493
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,530
Why is she here?

494
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,850
Is she making a fool of herself?

495
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,610
Han Ziqing,

496
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,280
what talents do you possess?

497
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,130
I have none.

498
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,850
How about poetry?

499
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,880
Can you recite

500
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,210
Ode to the Plum Blossom?

501
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,560
Ode to the Plum Blossom?

502
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,570
Old what?

503
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,010
If not literature,

504
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,400
what about martial arts?

505
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,850
No, not that either.

506
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,650
(Oh well, if I can't be the Princess Consort,)

507
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,860
(that girl won't have a chance either.)

508
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,400
Your Highness,

509
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,560
my younger daughter is less accomplished

510
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,440
than her sister, Han Xi'er.

511
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,200
Xi'er is more talented.

512
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,730
Whether it's music, go, calligraphy,
painting, martial arts,

513
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,250
flower arrangement, or cooking,
you must be good at something.

514
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,970
Not at all.

515
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,650
Your Highness, she is ignorant
and has offended you.

516
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,970
Please forgive her.

517
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,040
Han Ziqing,

518
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,650
I choose you.

519
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,610
How can that be?

520
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,450
She was...

521
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,370
(What the hell?)

522
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,080
Your Highness.

523
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,970
Your Highness.

524
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,040
Your Highness.

525
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
Your Highness.

526
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,850
This cannot be, Your Highness.

527
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,730
Eunuch Yin,

528
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,450
what is the problem?

529
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,160
Your Highness, this Han Ziqing...

530
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
Speak.

531
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,880
Your Highness,

532
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,080
the selection of the Princess Consort
concerns the honor of the kingdom.

533
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,200
The chosen must be of noble birth

534
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,480
and possess both virtue and talent.

535
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,400
However, Han Ziqing has a scandal

536
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,680
at Grandeur Palace,

537
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
known throughout the city.

538
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,530
Please be discreet, Your Highness.

539
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,520
A scandal?

540
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,200
What scandal?

541
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,370
Was it by her own will?

542
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,610
Well...

543
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,250
If it was not by her own will,

544
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,850
how can it be called a scandal?

545
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,120
Your Highness,

546
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,200
if you insist on this choice,

547
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,850
you will become the laughingstock
of the kingdom.

548
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,570
Will you

549
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,010
laugh at me?

550
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,490
Or will you, Eunuch Yin, laugh at me?

551
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,040
Your Highness, I wouldn't dare.

552
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Your Highness,

553
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,530
even if Han Ziqing is a maiden,

554
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,130
she was born to a concubine,

555
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,650
unfit to be the Princess Consort.

556
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,560
If Your Highness insists on this,

557
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,010
it would be breaking tradition,

558
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,990
- and that is something you must not do.
- Breaking tradition?

559
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,040
If I choose her today,

560
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,560
then later go back on my word,

561
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,610
that would be breaking tradition.

562
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,320
If Your Highness persists,

563
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,370
I shall have to report to His Majesty.

564
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,440
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

565
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,650
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

566
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,440
Breaking tradition angers His Majesty,

567
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,130
and that would be no small matter.

568
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,130
Your Highness,
Han Ziqing was once betrothed.

569
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,010
If this were to become known,

570
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,130
the reputation of Tianque's
royal family would be in jeopardy.

571
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,730
She was betrothed?

572
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,280
Were betrothal gifts exchanged?

573
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,490
I haven't heard of any.

574
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,080
But she's affianced.

575
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,920
Where is the man?

576
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,650
Unfortunately, it is said that

577
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,440
that man suddenly died yesterday.

578
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,370
The authorities are investigating.

579
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,040
Since that man is dead,

580
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,160
it was nothing but a verbal agreement,

581
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,130
which holds no weight.

582
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,130
I have chosen her,

583
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,120
and that is final.

584
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,890
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

585
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,560
Please reconsider.

586
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,920
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

587
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,660
(What are they arguing about?)

588
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,800
(I don't want)
(to be a Princess Consort anyway.)

589
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,850
Hear me, all of you.

590
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Since I have chosen her today,

591
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,560
she shall be my Princess Consort.

592
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,680
From this day forth, she shall
share in my honor and disgrace.

593
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,010
If you

594
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,080
insult her,

595
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,530
it is as if you insult me.

596
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,920
Do you

597
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,690
understand?

598
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,160
Yes, we understood.

599
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,280
Yes, Your Highness.

600
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,280
Yes, Your Highness.

601
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,730
(That's strange.)

602
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,370
(Why is this dagger with him?)

603
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,320
(If I get this dagger,)

604
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,440
(could I return home?)

605
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,160
What is the matter?

606
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,210
Nothing.

607
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,440
You did not expect me to choose you, did you?

608
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,650
I was worried you wouldn't choose me.

609
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,720
Han Ziqing,

610
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,600
are you willing to leave with me

611
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,840
of your own accord?

612
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,090
(It seems I have no other choice for now.)

613
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,250
(I need to get close to him to get the dagger.)

614
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,680
Of course, I am willing.

615
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,680
I heard the Fourth Prince

616
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,730
chose Han Ziqing.

617
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,120
But Han Ziqing is a woman of lost virtue.

618
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,680
Well, it's...

619
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,390
I heard it was in the Grandeur Palace.

620
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,810
Bravo.

621
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,680
Mother, hurry up.

622
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,880
There's a performing monkey over here.

623
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,840
- All right.
- Monkey.

624
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,770
Slowly.

625
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,770
So funny.

626
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,810
Jump, jump.

627
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,410
Higher.

628
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,570
Come on.

629
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,650
So cute.

630
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,640
Hey, stop looking around.

631
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,160
Look how cute the monkey is.

632
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,000
Look.

633
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,290
This monkey is cared for

634
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,880
better than I am.

635
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,330
(The dagger is on him.)

636
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
(If I strike now,)

637
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,730
(I might catch him off guard.)

638
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,120
What evil are you planning?

639
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,640
(He's quite alert.)

640
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,370
Nothing.

641
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,930
Your Highness,

642
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,050
why are you staring at me?

643
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,010
Is there something

644
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,650
on my face?

645
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,570
You are now the Princess Consort

646
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,940
of the Fourth Prince of Tianque.

647
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,570
You should refer to yourself

648
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,610
properly.

649
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,010
(Properly?)

650
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,120
(This act is becoming all too real.)

651
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,360
(How is it that she survives)

652
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,050
(after taking the Moxun Poison?)

653
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,570
(What is going on here?)

654
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,360
Where are we headed?

655
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,330
To my mansion.

656
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,090
By the way,

657
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,200
are you

658
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,810
feeling unwell at all?

659
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,200
(Could it be that he wants...)

660
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,090
Your Highness,

661
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,890
to be honest,

662
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,530
I haven't been feeling well lately.

663
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,250
How?

664
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,270
I have my period now.

665
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,860
It's something

666
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,200
women experience every month.

667
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,050
I must avoid raw, cold, and salty foods.

668
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,730
Most importantly, I need to rest

669
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,870
and avoid physical activity.

670
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,250
(Could this poison be affecting her mind?)

671
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,280
Your Highness,

672
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,650
I'm curious

673
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,130
why did you choose me?

674
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,880
Everything is relative.

675
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,000
Compared to the others,

676
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,880
you are more interesting.

677
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,700
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

678
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:09,950
Your Highness,

679
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,040
His Majesty summoned you

680
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,530
to the palace.

681
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,490
Why is Father in such a hurry

682
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,410
to see me?

683
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,460
I'm not entirely sure, Your Highness.

684
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,600
You'll know once you get there.

685
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,240
Hongyi.

686
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,280
Your Highness.

687
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,600
Make sure the Princess Consort is well settled.

688
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,890
Princess Consort?

689
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,240
Your Highness,

690
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,250
His Majesty's decree has not yet been issued.

691
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,770
To address her that way now

692
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,470
might be inappropriate.

693
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,970
I've overstepped.

694
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,490
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

695
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,570
You dare speak to me like this now?

696
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,930
I wouldn't dare.

697
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,770
Without my orders,

698
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,400
no one is allowed to take the Princess Consort

699
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,640
out of my mansion.

700
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,650
Understood.

701
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,650
Let's go.

702
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:07,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

703
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,880
Get down now.

704
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,010
What are you waiting for?

705
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,740
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

706
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,490
(This girl changes her face)

707
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,120
(faster than flipping a page.)

708
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,010
(What a nice place.)

709
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,840
(Seems like he enjoys life quite a bit.)

710
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,120
Miss Han, this way.

711
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,290
I'll have a room prepared for you.

712
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,330
You can stay here for now.

713
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,010
Thank you.

714
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,490
Strangely enough,

715
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,920
I've been in the mansion since I was seven,

716
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,290
so I know His Highness's habits best.

717
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,330
He never uses anything

718
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,970
that someone else has touched,

719
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,250
not even a cup,

720
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,160
let alone a person.

721
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,370
Sorry.

722
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,360
I'm not familiar

723
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,640
with his relationship with cups,

724
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,010
so no comments on that.

725
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,640
Although you live here for now,

726
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,970
it doesn't mean you can survive easily.

727
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,570
You'd better watch out.

728
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,570
The fortune-tellers
always said I have a strong fate.

729
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,440
I don't need you to worry about me.

730
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,170
Cui'er.

731
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,290
(West Yard)
Clean up the West Yard

732
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,600
and let Miss Han stay here for now.

733
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,330
But hasn't the East Yard already...

734
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,170
That's what I said.

735
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,370
Understood.

736
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,490
Miss Han,

737
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,730
please rest for now.

738
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,970
Try to stay put.

739
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,330
If you trigger any traps

740
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,290
or go somewhere you shouldn't,

741
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,440
no one will be able to save you.

742
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,550
(Since I'm here, I should make the best of it.)

743
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,530
(I'll try to get the dagger first.)

744
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,100
Miss Han, please.

745
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:30,060
(West Yard)

746
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,480
Senior,

747
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,640
are we making our move tonight?

748
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,730
That girl's posture suggests

749
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,050
she knows martial arts.

750
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,680
We're too unprepared

751
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,170
for this.

752
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,880
Let's return for now,

753
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,720
regroup,

754
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,330
