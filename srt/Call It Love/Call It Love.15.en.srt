EPISODE 15

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,800
(somber music playing)

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,344
DONGJIN: The will.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,723
I have it.

5
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,349
HEEJA: Dongjin!

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,893
Do you want to see me die?

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,439
(stuttering)
That's mine. It's ours.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:26,818
(whimpering)
Dongjin, your mom can't live without that.

9
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,614
You have to live without it.

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,130
-(sighs, panting)
-(patting)

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,384
(calling beep)

12
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,178
(sighs)

13
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,806
DONGJIN (in flashback): That's why
I didn't address you as Mother.

14
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,434
(groans)

15
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,187
DONGJIN:
There were times I really wanted to.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,272
(Heeja panting in distress)

17
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,320
DONGJIN: But I restrained myself.

18
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,408
(hanging-up beep)

19
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,243
(sighs)

20
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,161
(loud punch)

21
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,247
I'm telling you…

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,751
that I was unhappy.

23
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,799
I'm telling you
that I've never been happy.

24
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,219
(sighs)

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,809
(sniffles, exhales)

26
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,063
(somber music continues)

27
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,627
SENDER: SIM CHULMIN

28
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,388
(hopeful music playing)

29
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,764
(music fades)

30
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,518
(tapping on keypad)

31
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,148
(calling beep)

32
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,734
(faint ringing tone)

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,658
-(picking-up click)
-(sighs)

34
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,743
Mom.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,994
HYUNJU: What?

36
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,211
There's a will that Dad left to us.

37
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,048
He left…

38
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,551
that house to us.

39
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,223
I found out today.

40
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,643
That woman had been hiding it.

41
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,020
If we want to get the house back,

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,316
we have to report her to the police.

43
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,069
But then, what about him?

44
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,405
She's his mom.

45
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,536
He said that his mom was his weakness.

46
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,083
I feel sorry for him.

47
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,879
It kills me how sorry I am for him.

48
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,589
HYUNJU: Woojoo.

49
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,968
WOOJOO:
I don't want him to suffer anymore.

50
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,262
(mellow music playing)

51
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,139
I just wish he could live
peacefully from now on.

52
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,144
I want him to be happy, Mom.

53
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,740
We can be happy without the house, right?

54
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,579
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,210
(hanging-up beep)

56
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,720
(melancholy music)

57
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,543
(intro theme music playing)

58
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,136
(music fades out)

59
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:33,518
CALL IT LOVE

60
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,112
(Dongjin breathes deeply)

61
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,782
What's on your mind?

62
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,789
I'm wondering how much you heard.

63
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,208
And if you did hear,

64
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,086
where should I begin explaining it all?

65
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,715
Maybe I shouldn't
tell you anything until you ask.

66
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,760
So that…

67
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,181
I could spend
the whole night out here with you.

68
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,102
That's what's on my mind.

69
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,859
Why are you here?

70
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,904
You're not the type of person
to just show up without a reason.

71
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,367
(inhales)

72
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,288
I have

73
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,832
the will.

74
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,459
(tender music playing)

75
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,961
It seems my mother hid it

76
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,756
before your father passed away.

77
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,764
(sighs)

78
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,516
You can

79
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,269
get the house back.

80
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,691
I'm sorry it took so long
to return it to you.

81
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,943
(unzipping)

82
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,070
(envelope rustling)

83
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,341
I don't want it.

84
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,560
Don't think about anything else.

85
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,813
Just take this will…

86
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,817
and go back to where you used to live.

87
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,913
It certainly felt like
I was in hell mere moments ago.

88
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,752
But when you said
you wanted me to stop suffering

89
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,673
and wished I would be happy,

90
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,262
that made me feel much better.
(chuckles slightly)

91
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,432
Don't settle for
being happy without the house.

92
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,978
Go back to that house…

93
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,398
and be happy.

94
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,443
I think…

95
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,239
only then I could be happy too.

96
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,078
(sentimental music playing)

97
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,080
(suitcase stops rolling)

98
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,466
(sighs)

99
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:37,887
(mug thumps in sink)

100
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,806
(gloves crumpling)

101
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,064
(dish clinking)

102
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,191
-(sink water running)
-(metallic clattering)

103
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,234
(sentimental music continues)

104
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,951
Did you stay late at work
by yourself again?

105
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,955
I took some time off.

106
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,957
Why?

107
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,129
Is it that surprising?

108
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,340
It's just unexpected.

109
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,514
Back when I was working at Shinwoo Fair,
I used to use up all my leave days

110
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,017
around the holidays twice a year
and go camping for eight days.

111
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,865
WOOJOO: I thought about it,

112
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,451
and I found my hobby.

113
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,789
It's walking.

114
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't like running
because it gets me out of breath.

115
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,255
But when I'm walking, I can think.

116
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,844
Thoughts from a walk are easily forgotten.

117
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,931
And that's why I like to do it.

118
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,397
I just felt like I had to say something.

119
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,173
(Dongjin inhales)

120
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,925
I'll get in contact with the people
who are buying the house.

121
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,847
Go home and tell your family.

122
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,017
Don't leave anything out.

123
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,195
(Dongjin smacks lips)

124
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,821
I'll get going.

125
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,699
Get home safely.

126
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,036
Okay.

127
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,758
(Dongjin shuddering with mixed feelings)

128
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,192
(music fades out)

129
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,861
(indistinct chatter on television)

130
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,959
What's up? You're late.

131
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,752
Get some rest.

132
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,672
I have something to say.

133
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,014
(clicking on mouse)

134
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,307
DEPOSIT: 50,000,000 WON
RENT: 700,000 WON

135
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,726
(sighs)

136
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,437
(clicking on mouse)

137
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,564
(door opens)

138
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,693
(door slams)

139
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,028
(clicking on mouse)

140
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:23,946
(treading)

141
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,828
What is it?

142
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:39,336
CHULMIN: The testator, Sim Chulmin,
under clear and sound mind and body,

143
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,298
without any influence from another person,

144
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,050
with my own free will and intent,

145
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,720
hereby make and publish
the following will.

146
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,889
-(sobbing)
-(somber music playing)

147
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,683
The Yeonhui-dong real estate property
under Sim Chulmin's name

148
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,352
is to be bequeathed
to the eldest daughter, Sim Haesung,

149
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,688
and all the rights
regarding this real estate property

150
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,649
will be owned equally among the siblings.

151
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,527
(wailing)

152
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,575
(Haesung continues crying)

153
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,587
CHULMIN:
This will is to take effect upon my death.

154
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,883
Testator, Sim Chulmin.

155
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,010
(Haesung continues crying)

156
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,015
(muffled wailing)

157
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,186
(Haesung continues crying)

158
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,408
(Haesung continues crying)

159
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,080
(Haesung sniffling and coughing)

160
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,176
HAESUNG: I cried because
I've been wanting to cry for a while.

161
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,053
I didn't cry because I was sad.

162
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,597
What made you want to cry?

163
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,307
I felt sorry for myself.

164
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,603
There's so much to feel sorry for.

165
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,482
I felt sorry for myself that we had
to move when we didn't have money.

166
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,485
And I felt sorry that you were
turning and tossing every night

167
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,363
and couldn't fall asleep.

168
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,866
I've been…

169
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,287
resenting Dad this whole time.

170
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,916
But I feel sorry that he left us the house

171
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,876
and that we have to be grateful for it.

172
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,588
I feel sorry for myself
that all those things are happening.

173
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,883
(inhales)

174
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,719
I was going to take revenge on Dad.

175
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,975
I couldn't fling myself
onto Dad's car like you did…

176
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,771
but I had been planning
something for a while.

177
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,900
I heard that husbands
who get into an affair and leave home

178
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,153
tend to come back

179
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,449
to their children
once they get old and ill.

180
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,785
So if something like that were to happen,

181
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,913
I decided that
even if he came back sick and half-dead…

182
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,460
I wouldn't shed a single tear.

183
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,213
I wouldn't even blink and say,

184
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,799
"We don't need you anymore."

185
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,303
I'd tell him harshly.

186
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,348
I thought that'd be my revenge.

187
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,395
I probably wouldn't have done it though.

188
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,524
(under breath)
You know yourself.

189
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,777
Well…

190
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,864
it would have been a miracle

191
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,409
if I didn't greet him like,
"How have you been?"

192
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,748
Is that why we had our house stolen?
Because we're so naive?

193
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,460
What do you…

194
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:08,962
want to do now?

195
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,466
I don't know.

196
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,222
I don't know what I should do
so that everything will be okay.

197
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,353
Will everything be okay
if we just reclaim the house?

198
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,399
I have no idea what to do.

199
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,780
(somber music playing)

200
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,714
(security keypad beeping)

201
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,424
(door unlocks)

202
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,221
(door shuts)

203
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,431
(security system buzzes, beeps)

204
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,170
(somber music continues)

205
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,137
DONGJIN (in flashback): And…

206
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,473
I was relieved.

207
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,354
I was like, "Thank God."

208
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,567
Because there was nothing
I took after you.

209
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,196
I'm telling you

210
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,448
that I was unhappy.

211
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,660
I'm telling you
that I've never been happy.

212
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,304
(can opener snaps)

213
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,768
(gulping)

214
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,485
(smacks lips)

215
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,369
(door opens)

216
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,454
(footsteps incoming)

217
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,414
N-No.

218
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:54,002
I'm telling you
I'll vacate the house right away.

219
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,254
(grunts)

220
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,422
(straining)
Moving up the moving date up by a week

221
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,676
isn't that big of a deal, you know.

222
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,177
(panting)

223
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,890
Well then, the money.

224
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,476
Just give me the money at least. Okay?

225
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,395
I mean, you planned
on giving it to me anyway,

226
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,729
so you must be ready, right?

227
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,815
(indistinct chatter on phone)

228
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,985
(loudly) We've already put our signatures
down at the realtor's office.

229
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,653
How could this be a fraud?

230
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,531
-What kind of person do you think I am?
-(caller screams)

231
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,950
How dare you say something like that?

232
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,577
-(hanging-up beep)
-Wait… Hello?

233
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,621
Hello?

234
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,291
(scoffs in disbelief)

235
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,002
(irritated breathing)

236
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:39,464
SEOUL YEONHUI POLICE STATION

237
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,135
(car alarm beeps)

238
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,097
(approaching siren blaring)

239
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,726
(queuing system chiming)

240
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,734
GENERAL CIVIL SERVICE OFFICE
SUE, REPORT, REQUEST

241
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,777
(suspenseful music playing)

242
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,494
HEEJA'S CUSTOMER: Excuse me.

243
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,122
Are you the one who called?

244
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:13,957
Yes.

245
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,709
How are you?

246
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,004
-HEEJA'S CUSTOMER: You're her son?
-DONGJIN: Yes.

247
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,050
HEEJA'S CUSTOMER: I mean, think about it.

248
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,303
She suddenly called and demanded
that we move up the moving date.

249
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,598
When I told her I couldn't do that,
she asked for the money first.

250
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,309
It's not like
we're buying groceries at a store.

251
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,728
It's all the money
we mustered to buy a house,

252
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,396
we'll live in for the rest of our lives.

253
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,648
Of course, we'd be alarmed.

254
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,567
I understand.

255
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,653
If it's tied to an inheritance issue,

256
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,448
wouldn't that require a court trial?

257
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,077
We'll just give up the house.

258
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,870
Just pay us back the principal
and the penalty fee.

259
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,039
If you send that money within this month,

260
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,124
we'll just cancel
the contract and settle it.

261
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,001
Thank you.

262
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,795
It's nothing to be thankful for.

263
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,671
(sipping on drink)

264
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,924
I'll contact you
as soon as the money is ready.

265
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,426
(Heeja's customer sighs)

266
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,765
JUN PHARMACY

267
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,183
I can go alone.

268
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,102
I'm going with you because I want to know.

269
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,895
I don't want to wait all day
for your call.

270
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,980
Let's go. Haesung's waiting for us.

271
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,567
(footsteps fading)

272
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,365
(soft resolute music playing)

273
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,951
CLOSED TODAY FOR PERSONAL MATTERS

274
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,540
(footsteps approaching)

275
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,804
Let's head in.

276
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,395
(attorney hums)

277
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,605
WILL
TESTATOR: SIM CHULMIN

278
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,524
Why don't you press charges?

279
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,026
Pressing criminal charges
saves the most time

280
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,487
and is the easiest way
to get the house back.

281
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,408
We'd have to look further
into the actual facts,

282
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,076
starting with the theft of the will,

283
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,412
and then breach of trust,
embezzlement, fraud…

284
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,998
There are many offenses to look at.

285
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,916
Fraud?

286
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,794
She concealed the will, deceived you all,

287
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,796
and transferred the ownership,
so it's fraud.

288
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,345
Is there any other way?
Like a civil suit or settlement.

289
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,557
We could try filing a civil lawsuit,

290
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,101
but we'd only be
giving her time to prepare.

291
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,104
Did Ms. Ma Heeja say
she'd settle with you?

292
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,485
JUN: Well…
(sighs)

293
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,070
We'll discuss this among ourselves
and then give you a call.

294
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,697
ATTORNEY: Sure, okay.

295
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,908
(music fades out)

296
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,369
(pensive music playing)

297
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,413
(messenger vibrating)

298
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,627
DONGJIN: Can we meet up in the evening?

299
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,300
MR. HAN DONGJIN:
CAN WE MEET UP IN THE EVENING?

300
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,064
(footsteps approaching)

301
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,819
(inaudible)

302
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,321
(exhales)

303
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,864
(ice rattling in drinks)

304
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,118
Thanks.

305
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,914
Thanks for coming with us.

306
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,957
(snorts)

307
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,500
Don't mention it.

308
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,252
(sips)

309
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,380
(exhales, smacks lips)

310
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,840
Yes, we went to speak with the lawyer.

311
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,426
We went to a few places.

312
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,512
They all say we have to press charges.

313
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,680
HYUNJU: How's Woojoo?

314
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,933
She seems okay.

315
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,478
I'll call you back, Mom.

316
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,855
Okay.

317
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:08,900
(hanging-up beep)

318
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,587
I know you're not saying
anything because of me.

319
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,715
It's not that.

320
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,635
It's not easy to press criminal charges
against someone.

321
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:41,516
Anyway, we now have a way
to get the house back thanks to Mr. Han.

322
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,352
Even if you two weren't in a relationship,

323
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,187
I'd still take the time to think.

324
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,524
She's right. You should just relax.
That's better for everyone.

325
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,276
(inhales)

326
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,528
I've decided to meet up with him.

327
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,241
It's not like that.

328
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:04,372
I'll meet him and ask him
to persuade his mother.

329
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,043
If that doesn't work,
let's take legal action

330
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,253
and go to court to get our house back.

331
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,507
I think that would be
the right thing to do.

332
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,349
(Haesung sighs)

333
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,351
When you see him,

334
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,603
tell him I said thank you.

335
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,732
I mean that.

336
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,776
(mellow music playing)

337
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,784
WOOJOO: I have something
to tell you as well. See you then.

338
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,328
(exhales deeply)

339
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,330
Where is he?

340
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,666
(whispers)
In your room.

341
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,801
Hey, I was surprised to hear you're here.
(chuckles)

342
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,052
Why all the fuss?

343
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,805
A man on leave suddenly shows up.
Of course I'd be surprised.

344
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,183
Are you done? Are you coming back to work?

345
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,693
You have…

346
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,153
something to tell me.

347
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,785
(inaudible speech in office)

348
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,453
(somber music playing)

349
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,383
I don't know what to say.

350
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,970
I feel bad for both of you.

351
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,142
(sighs deeply)

352
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,688
Sunwoo.

353
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,899
I'm quitting the company.

354
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,484
Help me with the paperwork.

355
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,195
What?

356
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,530
With my severance pay

357
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,575
and my company shares,
I'd be able to match the money owed.

358
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,536
Can we get that done within the month?

359
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,874
Dongjin…

360
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,208
I'm asking you.

361
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,129
And…

362
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,841
I want to use this
as an opportunity to rest.

363
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,934
(somber music continues)

364
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,187
(slow footsteps)

365
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,823
HAN DONGJIN

366
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,295
What do you need from the store?

367
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,881
JIGU: We have some vegetables,
so just flour.

368
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,965
What does he want?

369
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,425
HAESUNG: Flour.

370
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,052
I'll go get it.

371
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,058
JIGU: Haesung, I'll be home late today.

372
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,269
You told us to get groceries
so we'd have dinner together.

373
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,730
JIGU (groans): With everything going on,

374
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,525
I just wanted you
to make some sujebi with Jun.

375
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,984
You like sujebi.

376
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,363
Keep your spirits up, okay?

377
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,157
You can do it, Sim Haesung.

378
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,493
I'm hanging up.

379
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,497
Haesung, do you need something?

380
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,249
Just say it, and I'll go get it all.

381
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,125
You're overly enthusiastic.

382
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,218
(tender music playing)

383
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,732
(shoelaces rustling)

384
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,444
(plastic bag rustling)

385
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,207
JUN: I haven't told you

386
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,002
how I became friends with Woojoo, have I?

387
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,337
HAESUNG: Tell me.

388
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,591
JUN: She and I

389
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,510
used to take the same bus every day,

390
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,470
but we never really spoke.

391
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,514
But one day,

392
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,768
we were both running late
and got on the bus late together.

393
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,230
And both happened to see

394
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,568
a boy and a girl from our school
walking into an ob-gyn clinic together.

395
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,487
We both looked at each other.

396
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,781
And I thought to myself,

397
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,118
"This news will definitely spread
throughout the school."

398
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,828
But the news didn't spread.

399
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,290
Neither of us told anybody about it.

400
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,167
How loyal.

401
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,251
JUN: I know.

402
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,171
That's how we became friends.

403
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,882
She was pretty loyal.

404
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
(snorts)

405
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,225
What's your point?

406
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,895
Tell me in a way that I can understand.

407
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,731
Don't be jealous.

408
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,652
Yesterday…

409
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,948
I heard you crying from outside the house…

410
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,784
I wanted to barge in and hold you tight.

411
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,997
I was worried about you all night.

412
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,834
That's my answer.

413
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,588
(begins to cry)

414
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,678
(Haesung sniffles)

415
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,055
(Jun smacks lips)

416
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,726
(female vocals singing)

417
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,494
-Hey.
-What do you mean, "Hey"?

418
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,458
Just stop crying.

419
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,383
I'm not crying.

420
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,655
Let's go home.

421
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,407
(sniffles)

422
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,496
HAESUNG: I'm hungry.

423
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,957
JUN: Hmm…

424
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,710
I'll make you some sujebi.

425
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,670
HAESUNG: Really?

426
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,921
JUN: Yes.

427
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,507
HAESUNG: Okay.

428
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,968
(song continues)

429
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,409
(door chimes jingling)

430
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,627
(song ends)

431
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,214
(pouring)

432
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,055
OWNER: Here are your noodles.

433
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,820
(stirring)

434
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,075
I'm going to miss this place.

435
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,165
WOOJOO:
You don't have to avoid coming here.

436
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,210
Come eat here whenever you feel like it.

437
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,255
I'll be the one avoiding it.

438
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,301
I'm going to be moving.

439
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,221
I won't take a bus
just to eat noodles here.

440
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,771
(sentimental music playing)

441
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,067
(chopsticks tapping)

442
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,408
(slurping)

443
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,496
(slurping, munching)

444
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,879
WOOJOO: My sister says thank you.

445
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,883
I told my family about everything.

446
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,968
Even my mom.

447
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,220
She must have been quite startled.

448
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,639
It was probably nothing.

449
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,143
(sighs) There's nothing left
that could startle her.

450
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,188
(gulping)

451
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,739
We spoke with a lawyer.

452
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,824
I did too.

453
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,826
You don't have to say more.

454
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,081
The problem with the house
being sold will get resolved soon.

455
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,125
I'll let you know when it's all done.

456
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,502
Okay.

457
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,005
And…

458
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,426
As for my mother…

459
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,053
(shudders)

460
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,180
…I'll try to persuade her first.

461
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:06,974
If that fails,

462
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,310
do as your lawyer tells you.

463
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,563
(breathes deeply)

464
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,196
(gulping)

465
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,918
I think I knew all along.

466
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,590
If I had explained the situation to you
as soon as I met you,

467
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,594
you would have done everything you could

468
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,972
to help me get the house back
just like you are doing now.

469
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,767
I should have just told you.

470
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,979
I was so foolish.

471
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,564
I disagree.

472
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,819
How could I have done the same thing?

473
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,947
No matter how nice anybody could be,

474
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,782
it wouldn't have been the same.

475
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,707
This is all just an excuse.

476
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,042
(shudders)

477
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,504
An excuse for me
to be able to see you and talk to you.

478
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,569
WOOJOO: I wish winter would never come.

479
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,116
I really don't like the cold.

480
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,351
(music fades out)

481
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,902
(control button clicks)

482
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,113
(faint indistinct chatter on television)

483
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,744
(doorbell chimes)

484
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,586
(picks up and dials on intercom)

485
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,129
(stutters)
Who is it?

486
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,131
HYUNJU: Open up.

487
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,550
Who are you?

488
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,761
You know who I am. Open up.

489
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,471
(gasps)

490
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,764
(slams handset)

491
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,231
(trembling)

492
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,941
(opens lipstick)

493
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,778
(gate unlocks)

494
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,512
(somber music playing)

495
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,850
(pot smashing)

496
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,978
(heavy footsteps leaving)

497
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,573
(breathes heavily)

498
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,542
(water pouring)

499
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,626
(pouring stops)

500
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:06,964
(glass thuds)

501
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,802
(scoffs)

502
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,180
(shudders)

503
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,639
I only have water to offer you.

504
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,149
As you would know, if you read the will--

505
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,776
The man living with you came by.

506
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,488
-What?
-He asked for 30 million won,

507
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,740
saying he could help me
get the house back.

508
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,785
Do you know the first thing I asked him?

509
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,871
You live with Heeja, correct?

510
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,456
(bold music playing)

511
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,541
I first wanted to know

512
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,253
what kind of person you were living with.

513
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,174
"So she ended up with someone like that."

514
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,926
I was relieved.

515
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,553
Sim Chulmin's life

516
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,474
must not have been so peachy
all the time while living with you.

517
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,726
It must have been pure hell.

518
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,269
(shouts)
Hey!

519
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,606
What are you trying to say?
(scoffs)

520
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,108
Stop pretending to be classy.

521
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,027
Just yell at me instead.

522
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,612
Would you like to yank my hair?

523
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,530
Sit down.

524
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,073
(sighs dumbfoundedly)

525
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,534
I won't yell at you,
and I won't grab your hair.

526
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,745
If my anger could be calmed
by screaming and being aggressive,

527
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,039
I would've come
and burned this house or something.

528
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,916
(scoffs)

529
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,382
I'm going to remain classy and graceful
till the end, so sit down.

530
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,136
(scoffs)

531
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,222
(thumps on seat)

532
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,682
(exhales exasperatedly)

533
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,394
All those years
you visited my house selling cosmetics,

534
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,355
you never mentioned that you had a son.

535
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,110
So I always thought
you didn't have a child.

536
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,946
That means he wasn't raised in your care.

537
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,906
He grew up by himself.

538
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,075
(snorts)

539
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,868
He seemed so pitiful.

540
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,621
You should…

541
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,291
really thank your son.

542
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,336
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be letting you leave so nicely.

543
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,797
I would've dragged you
to the police myself.

544
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,883
Leave this house quietly.

545
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,260
If you do that,

546
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,346
I won't take this issue to court.

547
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,349
Let's settle our past like that.

548
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,275
(music crescendos and stops)

549
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,192
HEEJA: Hey!

550
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,572
Did you put my son on his knees?

551
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,574
(tense music playing)

552
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,993
(trembles)

553
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:41,952
(shouts)
Tell me!

554
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,039
Did you put my son on his knees?

555
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,292
Who are you to pity my son?

556
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,836
Why would my son be pitiful?

557
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,881
(panting angrily)

558
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,973
(groans)

559
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,142
(screams)

560
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,518
(door clicks hard)

561
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,356
(door slams)

562
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,534
(footsteps continue)

563
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,125
(gate bolt turning)

564
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,210
(gate bangs open)

565
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,631
(gate clicks shut softly)

566
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,012
(breathes deeply)

567
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,017
(melancholic music playing)

568
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,362
I'm sorry.

569
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,869
I apologize on behalf of my mother.

570
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,082
I'm sorry.

571
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,764
(door opens)

572
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,276
(Dongjin smacks lips)

573
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,350
(music fades out)

574
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,727
(messenger vibrating)

575
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,939
(picks up phone)

576
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,651
(tapping)

577
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,320
THIS IS INSPECTOR LEE JINHO
FROM THE YEONHUI POLICE STATION…

578
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,201
(phone vibrating)

579
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,916
(nervously)
Hello?

580
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,501
JINHO: Is this Ms. Ma Heeja?

581
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,170
Yes.

582
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,922
JINHO: I'm calling from
the Yeonhui Police Station.

583
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,760
HEEJA (recorded): This is outrageous!
The will doesn't mention my name anywhere!

584
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,888
I've done more than enough
for him as a wife,

585
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,349
and he couldn't bother
to even leave me a penny!

586
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:37,145
The only asset he has left is that house,
and even that is left to his kids.

587
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,063
Darn it.

588
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,773
I'm so mad right now!

589
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,944
What would have happened
if I hadn't found this?

590
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,280
NAMIL (recorded):
So what will you do now?

591
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,740
HEEJA: I'm going to keep this hidden

592
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,909
and wait till he dies.

593
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,160
(stops playback)

594
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,497
Wait, Mr. Kang Namil.
So you knew about this as well?

595
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,499
What? Yes.

596
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,086
After a couple of days,
I started to think it wasn't right.

597
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,087
So I tried to stop her.

598
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,007
But she'd already hidden the will by then.

599
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,842
I didn't even get to see it.

600
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,386
JINHO (on phone):
Mr. Kang Namil has reported you

601
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,597
on account of the theft
of Mr. Sim Chulmin's will.

602
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:16,310
So you must come on the specified date
and cooperate with our investigation.

603
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,895
(trembles)

604
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,855
(dire music playing)

605
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,907
(music fades)

606
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,080
(taxi door opens)

607
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,882
JUN: Hello, ma'am.

608
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,641
HYUNJU: I was right.

609
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,519
It doesn't make me feel better in any way.

610
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,605
It just can't.

611
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,735
The pain wouldn't go away
just because I took revenge.

612
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:10,989
Mom,

613
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,325
did you meet her?

614
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,747
After all…

615
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,834
That man, Sim Chulmin,
is the worst of them all.

616
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,712
If he felt any guilt
for abandoning his kids,

617
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,756
he shouldn't have left the house this way.

618
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,843
Don't take any legal action.

619
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,513
What?

620
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:37,933
I don't want to see you kids
going in and out of the courthouse.

621
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,186
For me, it was harder
visiting the courthouse

622
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,189
than seeing your dad having an affair.

623
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,652
I also spoke with Heeja's son

624
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,863
in a way he would understand.

625
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,375
I don't want to take any legal action.

626
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,421
Can I trust you to handle it?

627
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,215
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,136
(pensive music playing)

629
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,851
(door opens)

630
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,520
-(footsteps emerging)
-(door shuts)

631
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,063
(security system beeping)

632
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,483
(heavy footsteps)

633
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,912
(calling beep)

634
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,706
(ringing tone)

635
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,253
(phone vibrating)

636
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,469
(footsteps approaching)

637
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,602
(short exhale)

638
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,187
SIM WOOJOO

639
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,981
(door opens)

640
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,107
(vibrating stops)

641
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,904
AUTOMATED VOICE: The person you're calling
is not available at the moment.

642
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,072
Please call at…

643
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,628
(shudders)

644
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,215
I've spread the bedding in the room.

645
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,595
Let's go to the police together tomorrow.

646
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,057
Goodnight.

647
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,226
HEEJA: Dongjin.

648
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,938
I wanted…

649
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,858
to live a good life.

650
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,736
On some days,

651
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,616
I just wanted to throw out
all of my sordid past…

652
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,162
and live a clean life.

653
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,747
(contemplative music playing)

654
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,748
But…

655
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,709
(trembling)
…it was difficult.

656
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,754
I think I've lived…

657
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,386
a bad life for far too long.

658
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,313
It's not too late.

659
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,901
You can…

660
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,113
live a good life again.

661
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,451
HEEJA: Yeah.

662
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,415
Thank you.
(shudders)

663
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,792
(sighs)

664
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,379
And I'm sorry.

665
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,846
(door opens)

666
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,475
(door shuts)

667
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,315
(sniffling)

668
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,164
(messenger vibrating)

669
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,922
DONGJIN: My mother came over.

670
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,674
I'll call you later.

671
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,777
(security system beeping)

672
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,988
(sighs deeply)

673
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,367
(coffee pot clicking)

674
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,717
Did you give it some thought?

675
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,095
I thought you were joking.

676
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,763
I'm the CEO of a company.

677
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:31,017
It's never a joke
when I ask someone to work with me.

678
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,145
We haven't done any art fairs before,
and you're an expert

679
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,522
when it comes to paintings.

680
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,566
Let's draw up a project contract
and give it a try.

681
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,986
I wasn't the one to bring this up.

682
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,488
Ms. Baek suggested it first.

683
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,658
I'll think about it.

684
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,165
I don't think Dongjin is

685
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,127
coming back to the company.

686
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,463
It's only been ten days since he quit.

687
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,464
(inhales)

688
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,924
But it feels like it's been a year.

689
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,010
(chuckles)

690
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,847
Maybe it's because I'm at work
instead of relaxing on a weekend.

691
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,515
(laughs awkwardly)

692
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,812
Stop thinking about it…

693
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,065
and let's just work together.

694
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,859
You should…

695
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,529
move on with your life now.

696
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,455
MINYOUNG: Why are you being so nice to me?

697
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,790
I don't deserve this.

698
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:40,545
You know how bad of a person I am.

699
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:42,756
Yes.

700
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,300
I knew you'd be like this.

701
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,261
Minyoung.

702
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,473
Why would you say you're a bad person?

703
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,309
Do you know
how many bad people are out there?

704
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:59,814
There are plenty of those who hurt
their loved ones and live shamelessly.

705
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:03,860
But you…

706
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,113
You came back a mess out of guilt.

707
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,700
Back then…

708
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,203
I liked that about you.

709
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,997
That's why I wanted to be nice to you.

710
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,923
(soft bright music playing)

711
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,092
(feet dragging)

712
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,845
(stepping down)

713
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,346
(door opens)

714
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,184
(door shuts)

715
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,228
(soft bright music builds)

716
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,857
(fryer sizzling)

717
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,610
(plastic gloves rustling)

718
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,369
(music fades)

719
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,372
(slurps and munches)

720
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,709
Let me taste it.

721
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,128
-HAESUNG: Hmm.
-(spoon clinks)

722
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,089
(blowing)

723
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,717
(slurps and munches)

724
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,677
Is it salty?

725
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,012
It's bland.

726
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,598
Add some soy sauce.

727
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,349
Okay.

728
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,392
(spoon clinks)

729
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,353
(lid thuds)

730
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,482
(chopsticks clinking)

731
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,525
(fryer continues sizzling)

732
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:15,074
HYUNJU: No matter what it is,
everything passes in a blink of an eye.

733
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,118
It may sound harsh,

734
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,038
but that's all I can tell you.

735
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,748
(sentimental music playing)

736
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:22,999
(under breath)
I know.

737
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,836
But tell him to come by
and have a meal with us

738
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,588
when everything is settled.

739
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:34,093
Tell him I'd like to cook him
a nice warm meal.

740
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,225
I really mean it.

741
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,770
Go tell him that.

742
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,868
-(sentimental music continues)
-(fryer continues sizzling)

743
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,331
(chopsticks clicking)

744
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,215
(plastic gloves rustling)

745
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,176
HAESUNG: By the way, where's Jigu?

746
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,220
JUN: He went out to meet someone.

747
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,181
-With who?
-I have no idea.

748
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,183
HYUNJU:
Tell him to come back home on time.

749
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,227
JUN: Okay. I'll call him in a bit.

750
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,229
(plastic gloves rustling)

751
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,986
(music playing on guitar)

752
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,216
(under breath)
Gosh, it sounds amazing.

753
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,218
-(inhales)
-It's good.

754
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,975
Excuse me. Instead of this guitar,

755
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,519
could I try the one in that room too?

756
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,021
-CLERK: Sure.
-JIGU: Okay, thank you.

757
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,023
No, we'll just get this one.

758
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,316
Dongjin.

759
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,317
(whispers)
You don't have to do this.

760
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,402
Just get that one.

761
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,613
(chuckles awkwardly)

762
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,864
(chuckles confidently)

763
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,324
(rustling in pocket)

764
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,326
(bright music playing)

765
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,333
Dongjin, it's not like I'm a professional.

766
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,001
I don't need something this nice.

767
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,211
I just need something to practice with.

768
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,088
I want to get it for you.

769
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,134
(cash register beeping)

770
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,177
(printing receipt)

771
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,389
When I get to have a concert someday,
I'll play this guitar.

772
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,434
(chuckles)
Sure.

773
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,062
You won't change your number, will you?

774
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:54,734
I hope I'll be able to send you
a New Year's greeting once a year.

775
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,654
-I won't change it.
-(chuckles)

776
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,126
(music fades out)

777
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,544
I'll go on ahead.

778
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,421
Take your time.

779
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,551
(song with male vocals playing)

780
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,141
(bouquet wrapping rustling)

781
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,126
(song continues)
