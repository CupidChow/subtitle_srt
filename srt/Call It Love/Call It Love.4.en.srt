1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,961
(intro theme music playing)

2
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,764
(music fades out)

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,977
CALL IT LOVE

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,936
(sighs)

5
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,319
WOOJOO: You've been caught.

6
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,325
So if you really want to ruin
this company, then try harder.

7
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,539
JUN PHARMACY

8
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,749
PIZZA DELIVERY MAN: Enjoy.

9
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,543
(motorcycle box shuts)

10
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,545
(mellow music playing)

11
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,631
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

12
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,057
It's nothing, so just listen as you work.

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,226
It better be really about nothing.

14
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,521
That woman came by the office today.

15
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,483
Mr. Sim Chulmin's mistress…
And also that guy's mom.

16
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,738
When I saw them separately,
I thought they looked nothing alike.

17
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,117
But when I saw them together,
they really were mother and son.

18
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,828
-They looked alike.
-What?

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,996
She even had a new boyfriend.

20
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,249
I'm not taking any sides here.

21
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,585
(sighs) But it hasn't even been
that long since the funeral.

22
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,463
She seems to have gotten over it already.

23
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,048
Get to the point.

24
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,925
Is everything in the open?

25
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,177
No.

26
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,891
I made her coffee and even talked to her,
but she didn't recognize me.

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,981
I just look too different
from when I crashed the funeral.

28
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,898
(Jun scoffs)

29
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,359
But still, she didn't recognize you?

30
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,403
That's what I'm saying.

31
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,240
How can she not recognize me?

32
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,451
I remember her voice…

33
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,578
(Heeja laughing)

34
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,037
…the shoes she wore,

35
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,374
and even the way she walked.
I remember it all.

36
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,171
But she forgot everything and has been
living as if nothing had happened.

37
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,009
I was the only one carrying
that disgusting memory this whole time.

38
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:58,970
You tell me.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,348
Should I still have not done anything?

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,435
Am I really not allowed to do anything?

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,524
(sighs, clicks tongue)

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,861
No.

43
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,782
You did well. Woojoo.

44
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,039
Whatever you did,
it was the right thing to do.

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,544
You suffered all your life
because of your father.

46
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,504
So just consider it even.

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,007
And that guy too.

48
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,053
He got the money from his mom.
He deserves what's coming.

49
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,180
But,

50
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,599
don't get involved anymore.

51
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,353
Just end it here.

52
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,897
-Okay?
-(shudders)

53
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,657
Yeah, it'll take about 20 minutes
if I get in a cab now.

54
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,200
I'll be right there.

55
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,993
SUNWOO: There's no need.

56
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,122
Director Kim's not home. He really must
have gone on that trip for work.

57
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,124
Did you check thoroughly?

58
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,629
You know I don't work often,
but when I do, I do a good job.

59
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:20,093
And why would he avoid us?
That doesn't make sense.

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,054
I mean, even if
he backs out of the contract now,

61
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,014
he would have just as much to lose.

62
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,310
Where would he advertise
all the new products from this season?

63
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,939
SUNWOO: So let's stop acting like
we're the underdogs here.

64
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,857
No one cares.

65
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,946
I mean, it would have been great
if Director Kim signed the contract

66
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,157
before going on this business trip,
considering he knows how desperate we are.

67
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,410
Or at least answer our call.

68
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,913
SUNWOO: This is just
another one of his power trips.

69
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,459
(clicks tongue)

70
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,462
I didn't tell you to visit him
because of the contract.

71
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:01,175
I know, man.
I know what you're worried about.

72
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,637
But people who stomp on others
because they only care about themselves

73
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,849
quickly find their way out of the mess.
But it's the sore losers like us,

74
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,560
who can't say anything
and just writhe in pain.

75
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,482
Just go check again in the morning.

76
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,278
Okay. But you have to listen to me.

77
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,948
Don't crawl back to the office again.

78
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,078
Go hang out with friends.
If you meet a woman, even better.

79
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,999
What good is it to live like a monk?

80
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,877
I'm hanging up.

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,253
No, I'm hanging up first.

82
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,254
(cell phone beeps)

83
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,225
(straining)

84
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,152
(sighs)

85
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,205
(soft guitar music playing)

86
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,632
(indistinct chatter)

87
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,555
(indistinct chatter grows louder)

88
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,060
(ringing tone)

89
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,066
(scoffs) This must be fate.

90
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,860
WOOJOO: Fate? What fate?

91
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,779
Why did you call me?

92
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,658
Both you and Jun shouldn't come anywhere
near the pub by the intersection.

93
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,992
I'm warning you.

94
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,869
(cell phone beeps)

95
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,756
Why doesn't she want us
to come to the pub?

96
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,675
She must have gotten dumped again.

97
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,886
She was beside herself yesterday
saying she was asked out by a young guy.

98
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,558
I was like, "No. A young man wouldn't
do that. You're not all that,"

99
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,394
to myself.

100
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,603
(inhaling through the teeth)

101
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,147
Why didn't I just say that out loud?

102
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,399
(smacks lips)
I'd better go tell her in person.

103
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,776
You go drink with her.

104
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,986
What?

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,029
No way, you have to come too.

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,115
You can't go home sober
on a day like this.

107
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,158
Come with me!

108
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,583
Hello.

109
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,835
Come on, you can't just walk past me.

110
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,879
(music stops abruptly)

111
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,720
Oh, you must not remember me.

112
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,432
I work at the bank.
You gave me your business card.

113
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,058
DONGJIN: He wouldn't have my number.

114
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,561
Yes. Hello.

115
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,896
(laughs) Hello.

116
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,900
We met so briefly last time, right?

117
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,110
Let me introduce myself properly.

118
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,907
I'm Sim Woojoo's sister, Sim Haesung.

119
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,825
I see…

120
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,076
(chuckles)

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,121
I saw you two earlier
walking together all close.

122
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,790
Is something going on
between you and my sister?

123
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,795
We just work at the same company.

124
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,589
Co-workers then…

125
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,801
Wait, no. You're the company's CEO, right?

126
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,388
Oh, awesome.

127
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,600
-Would you like to have a beer with me?
-No, thank you.

128
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,521
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
hitting on you or anything like that.

129
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,690
It's with pure and noble intent.

130
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,362
Think of it like a parent
meeting the teacher of their children.

131
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,656
(breathing deeply)

132
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,282
-I'm in a hurry--
-You're not giving me

133
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,034
those cliché excuses
like you're in a hurry.

134
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:55,952
(chuckles)

135
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,205
I saw you walking slowly
from all the way over there.

136
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,667
And it's so obvious.

137
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,128
That you're going home
to drink a beer with some instant noodles.

138
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,423
Don't drink all alone and sad.
Drink with me.

139
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,135
Just one beer, no more, no less.

140
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,471
-I'm in!
-(gasps) My gosh.

141
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,432
(sighs)

142
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:24,397
Hello. I am this woman's little brother.
As you can see, I look nothing like her.

143
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,898
(sighs deeply) I see.

144
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,150
So who is he?

145
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,860
Neil Armstrong.

146
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,322
The first man to ever woo the moon.

147
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,118
Oh, oh. He grew up abroad?

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,370
Be quiet and go home.

149
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,999
Let's go in. Don't mind him.

150
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,544
Yes, please go in. Don't mind her.

151
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,340
(pensive music playing)

152
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,051
(sighs)

153
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,890
(playful music playing)

154
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,314
Excuse me, three pints over here, please.

155
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,233
I scared you a little back there,
didn't I?

156
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,986
I usually don't make a fool
of myself like that,

157
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,195
but I was so glad to see you.

158
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,657
JIGU:
You can't lie to someone you just met.

159
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,783
(crunching)

160
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,411
She specializes in making a fool of
herself and drama is her life.

161
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,371
Tell him now, so he's not surprised later.

162
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,458
Why don't you open your mouth
only to drink beer?

163
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,836
I'm sorry. I need to go make a phone call.

164
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,797
Sure. Come back soon. You should
drink your beer while it's cold.

165
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,097
(giggles)

166
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,101
(squeals) He's a CEO.

167
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,189
-JIGU: Gosh, he's so tall.
-(laughs) And handsome.

168
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,691
(ringing tone)

169
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,703
(ringing tone continues)

170
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,418
JUN: That young guy
isn't right in the head.

171
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,045
What would he see in Haesung?

172
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,297
WOOJOO: He probably likes her
because he's not right in the head…

173
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,174
(ringing tone continues)

174
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,176
(indistinct chatter)

175
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,392
-JUN: She should get married, you know?
-WOOJOO: I don't want her to get married.

176
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,394
-I wish she'd just stay single.
-(cell phone beeps)

177
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,857
I'm going to the bathroom.

178
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,984
-WOOJOO: I'll order us some beer.
-Hey!

179
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,118
JIGU: Hey.

180
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,746
What's this? Why did you come?
I told you not to come.

181
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,915
You're not by yourself?
(exhales)

182
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,792
Drinking alone is boring.

183
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,627
So I snagged a man walking by.

184
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,798
And he happens to be a guy you know too.

185
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,350
(tender music playing)

186
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,608
Please sit over here.

187
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,694
(breathes nervously)

188
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,572
(Dongjin drawing seat)

189
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,493
(blows)

190
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,789
JUN: What? You're here too?

191
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,000
(muffled) Yeah, I was walking by
and decided to mooch off her.

192
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,084
(lighter clicking)

193
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,879
Take it easy with smoking.
It'll stunt your growth.

194
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,297
Sure. Wait, Jun.

195
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,341
Woojoo's boss looks really young.

196
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,760
He's got a thick head of hair too.

197
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,846
How do you know he's got a thick
head of hair? Have you seen him?

198
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,514
Yes, you'll see him soon too.

199
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,691
I've been calling you
and even called out to you outside.

200
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,613
(exclaims)

201
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,451
What are you staring at?
You've never seen a handsome man before?

202
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,164
(hesitating)
Why are you sitting over there?

203
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,001
HAESUNG (scoffs): I told you.
I snagged him off the street.

204
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,087
(trembling)
Haesung, do you know who this is?

205
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,466
JUN: Hey, Woojoo.

206
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,887
(exhales)

207
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,808
(breathes hurriedly)

208
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,309
Mr. Han. Get up.

209
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,023
We need to talk.

210
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,654
(heavy footsteps leaving)

211
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,037
(exhales)

212
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,957
To see Woojoo holding a man's hand.

213
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,500
(scoffs)

214
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,210
I think I'm going to cry, seriously.

215
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,294
(exhales sharply)

216
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,673
That didn't look like
the type of genre you're thinking of.

217
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,928
You're the worst, Haesung.

218
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,683
(heavy footsteps)

219
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,397
(breathes deeply)

220
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,650
You knew my sister?

221
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,571
I found out she's your sister
just a few minutes ago.

222
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,032
How did you know her before that?

223
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,450
From the bank.

224
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,204
I'm just checking,
so don't take this the wrong way.

225
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:39,211
Mr. Han. Did you date Sim Haesung…
I mean, my sister?

226
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,967
(sighs)

227
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,218
The look on your face says no.

228
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,638
We first met at the bank,
and today is the second time.

229
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,349
She said she saw you and me
together earlier today.

230
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,101
(exhales sharply)

231
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,605
(sighs) Then it's fine.

232
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,149
You didn't tell her anything, did you?

233
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,026
(snorts)

234
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,698
Like what? What do you mean?

235
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,497
I met her five minutes ago,
and we haven't talked much.

236
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,958
(sighs in relief)

237
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,878
So could you just leave then?

238
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,591
Let's say my sister dragged you
in there so you couldn't stop it.

239
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,928
But if you happen to run into her again,
please just avoid her.

240
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,430
Why should I do that?

241
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,682
I don't like it.

242
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,769
You being around my family.

243
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,987
I was sitting there because
I couldn't think of an excuse to leave.

244
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,323
I'll get going.

245
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,496
(seething)

246
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,455
By the way,

247
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,708
does it feel good to just say
whatever is on your mind?

248
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,381
To you, it may seem like people hold
themselves back because they're dumb.

249
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,258
But if you say everything
that's on your mind,

250
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,011
you have to watch others
get hurt by what you say.

251
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,432
Some people find it harder
than holding back,

252
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,311
so they try hard not to say anything.

253
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,441
(trembling breath)

254
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,485
(mellow music playing)

255
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,532
I'm leaving.

256
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
Please give my bag back to me tomorrow.

257
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,714
(sighs)

258
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,722
-(electronic music playing)
-Yoon Jun! What did you just say to me?

259
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,640
Do you just jump on every guy you see?

260
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,226
You had your hair all pulled out
at the bank not even a month ago.

261
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,477
It's just pathetic.

262
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,732
-I said it loud. Didn't you hear?
-I did.

263
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,859
So who are you to talk to me like that?

264
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,487
What do you think?
I've been your friend for over ten years.

265
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,824
Do you realize I was the one who
took care of you every time you got dumped

266
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,826
apart from your sister, Woojoo?

267
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,537
Right. He is the landlord
who gives us a discount on rent.

268
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,913
He's got every right to talk.

269
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,582
(both in unison) Shut it.

270
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,793
Stop overreacting.

271
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,213
I told you already I didn't grab
that guy outside to ask him out!

272
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,549
And when have you dated anyone normal?

273
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,801
Just admit it.

274
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,636
You're lousy at judging men

275
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,264
and you're bound to have
a bad relationship no matter who you date.

276
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,893
Stop getting into so much drama.
That's how you'll help everyone out.

277
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,772
Shut it. You jerk.

278
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,732
What?

279
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,864
I'm warning you for the last time.

280
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,658
Or what?

281
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,536
You better not show me
those front teeth of yours.

282
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,332
You might lose them all at once.

283
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,633
(thuds)

284
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,553
Ugh, I hate undercooked noodles.
(inhaling through the teeth)

285
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,847
I can see your front teeth.

286
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,016
Just start eating.
They'll soften up as you eat.

287
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,520
(Woojoo sighs)

288
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,272
Haesung. From now on, don't even
say hi to him if you run into him.

289
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,692
We don't have anything going on
nor will there be anything in the future.

290
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,111
We'll see.

291
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,238
(loudly) See what?

292
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,243
I saw you two
walking together earlier today,

293
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,495
and I had a sudden realization.

294
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,789
(bicycle bell ringing)

295
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,125
(romantic music playing)

296
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,592
(bicycle bell ringing)

297
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,397
HAESUNG: A woman standing
next to a handsome man

298
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,315
automatically becomes beautiful too.

299
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,988
I didn't consider a guy's looks
in my past relationships.

300
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,079
(romantic music continues)

301
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,132
(music stops)

302
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,968
(laughs)

303
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,681
Even if you end up breaking up,
at least try dating him.

304
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,891
There's no harm in trying.

305
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:44,850
No way.

306
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,644
It won't happen,
not even over my dead body.

307
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,812
(munching)

308
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,565
Why not?
It's not like he's our sworn enemy.

309
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,154
Haesung, do you want some more?

310
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,867
(smacks lips, muffled)
You can barely see my teeth.

311
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,580
I mean, he's not married
nor has a girlfriend,

312
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,582
so at least give it a try.

313
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,792
Did you ask him?

314
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,004
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I didn't have to ask.

315
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:14,963
(slurping)

316
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,091
His hair, the suit he was wearing,
and everything else.

317
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,844
He's been alone for at least a few years.

318
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,305
If you're not sure,
I'll ask him next time.

319
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,308
Go ahead if you'd like to see me die.

320
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,601
(breathes sharply)

321
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,270
It is odd how much you're overreacting.

322
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,064
(sighs) It's just…

323
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,693
I'm a high-school graduate
and a lowly part-timer.

324
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
-And he's the CEO.
-(scoffs)

325
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,697
It's preposterous.

326
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,866
(Haesung slurps)

327
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,578
If that cheesy reason is why,
don't you even worry about it.

328
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,289
He definitely has feelings for you.

329
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,089
Your CEO has this dark aura
about him, like a street cat.

330
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,131
(mellow music playing)

331
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,466
I'm sorry. Maybe next time…

332
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,803
There is no next time. A chance
like this won't come around again.

333
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,638
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,267
By the way, Woojoo will be here soon.

335
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,313
HAESUNG: But that street cat

336
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,233
quickly lowered his tail
once he heard your name.

337
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,943
(paper rustling)

338
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,820
Like a well-loved puppy.

339
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,946
(Jigu inhaling deeply)

340
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,158
Well, how about seasoned whelk
with noodles to go with the beer?

341
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,662
They make good fried chicken here.

342
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,708
(both in unison) Check.

343
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,378
Oh, we're fine.
But Woojoo doesn't like to hang out

344
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,256
with someone
who has different food preferences.

345
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,009
JIGU: Mm-hmm. This place does
indeed make good fried chicken.

346
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,511
If you wanted to eat the seasoned whelk,
oof, we'd have walked out.

347
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,679
(laughs)

348
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,431
JIGU: We'd like fried chicken, please!

349
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,977
HAESUNG: I honestly didn't think
he'd follow me in.

350
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,979
He was an open book though.

351
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,398
"I'm actually very lonely."

352
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,692
"I've been waiting for someone
to talk to me."

353
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,736
(toothbrush scraping)

354
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,034
(sighs) Everyone is lonely.

355
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,411
Forget it. I don't want to talk about him.

356
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,246
(toothbrush scraping)

357
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,625
I bet you anything.
When a fine man like him is that lonely,

358
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,337
it's 100% because
his heart was broken by a woman.

359
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,423
(inhaling through the teeth)
He got hurt pretty badly.

360
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,845
I even let my girlfriend
cheat on me for a year.

361
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,889
(toothbrush scraping)

362
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,392
Plus, I happen to be an expert
when it comes to having a broken heart.

363
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,312
(sighs)

364
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,153
DAEHONG: Gosh.
(clears throat)

365
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,239
(indistinct chatter)

366
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,867
BOY: Youngjun, wait up.

367
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,788
(children laughing)

368
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
(heavy footsteps)

369
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,257
DAEHONG: You're leaving already?

370
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,302
Yes. I think
there will be less traffic now.

371
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,764
DAEHONG: Isn't it that you want
to get away from these loud people?

372
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,682
You got me.

373
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,186
(Daehong grunts)

374
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,400
You know, you remind me
so much of Dongjin?

375
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,609
(dishes clinking)

376
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,362
I've been coming here for days on end,

377
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,031
and you never once asked
what was going on with me.

378
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,411
I'm going to stop coming here now.

379
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,080
I have to stop being so pitiful.

380
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,873
I can't stay like this forever.

381
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,210
Stop avoiding him and just meet him.

382
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,506
Beg for forgiveness or have a fight.
Just meet him in person.

383
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,803
You sound like you know more than
you're letting on. That hit the bullseye…

384
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,139
If there's one thing I know about Dongjin,

385
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,057
it's that he would
never give someone trouble.

386
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,602
(frame rattling)

387
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,832
UNCLE DAEHONG

388
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,710
DAEHONG: Lots of firewood. Come use them.

389
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,386
(paper fluttering)

390
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,390
(dreamy music playing)

391
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,503
I hear there's a hiking trail.
Do you want to go for a walk?

392
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,213
MINYOUNG: No.

393
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,845
Let's get going before we hit traffic.

394
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,518
(objects clinking)

395
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,019
MINYOUNG: I want to break up.

396
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,021
(clinking slows down)

397
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,946
(objects rattling)

398
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,448
You know I love camping, right?

399
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,954
It's the one hobby this boring guy has.

400
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:45,085
If you break up with me here,
I won't be able to go camping ever again.

401
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,131
Let's talk about it at home. Not here.

402
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,759
(objects rustling)

403
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,644
I'm getting married next month.

404
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,857
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,112
I'm really sorry,

406
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,116
but that's how it is.

407
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,122
Hey, Minyoung…

408
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,125
MINYOUNG: It will be a small ceremony
in the States, with just our parents.

409
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,211
No one else knows yet.

410
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,882
But you have to know.

411
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,889
Why are you doing this to me?

412
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,478
I let it slide for you.

413
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,399
I pretended not to know.

414
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,741
Then you shouldn't have done this to me.

415
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,538
(wind blowing)

416
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,081
I'll get back to Seoul on my own.

417
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,125
DONGJIN: If you leave now,
it's really over.

418
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,044
I won't let this one slide.

419
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,338
Don't drive by yourself.

420
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,758
Call Sunwoo and drive back home together.

421
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,801
(wind continues blowing)

422
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,854
(wind continues blowing)

423
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,654
(scraping)

424
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,531
(melancholic music playing)

425
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,412
(groans)

426
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,169
-(scraping)
-(Dongjin winces)

427
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,964
(pencil thuds)

428
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,970
(melancholic music continues)

429
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,491
MINYOUNG: I'm getting married next month.

430
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,119
I'm sorry.

431
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,705
I'm really sorry,

432
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,208
but that's how it is.

433
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,794
(tree leaves rustling)

434
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,873
(rumbling engine leaving)

435
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,710
(clanging)

436
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,766
STRAWBERRIES

437
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,061
FROM APARTMENT 2702

438
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,780
(doorbell chiming)

439
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,754
(security keypad bleeping)

440
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,547
(security system chiming)

441
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,715
(door unlocks)

442
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,094
(door clicks shut)

443
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,281
Gosh.

444
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,245
Hey, is this a movie or what?

445
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,789
Why did you call me all the way out here?

446
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,916
I'm nervous that
CEO Han apparently knows everything.

447
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,378
I'm quite impressed by Han Dongjin.

448
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,421
So he could throw
a sucker punch like that?

449
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,633
I think you have to hurry this up.
Otherwise, we might get hurt.

450
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,429
-It's all done.
-What?

451
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,140
Why are you surprised?

452
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,225
2022 OUTDOOR CAMPING FAIR

453
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,310
SUNGMAN: Director Kim is on board with us.

454
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,897
What are you trying to do here?

455
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,693
It's exactly twice as big as Best Fairs.
And it takes place three days before.

456
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,697
They will probably go all-in with B2C,
but we're going to aim for B2B

457
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,659
as well as foreign buyers
and high-profile campers too.

458
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:14,247
Come on. This is just
pure marketing, Director.

459
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,251
I just want to help you get promoted
to vice president faster.

460
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,130
They're finally going to find out, right?

461
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,758
What it feels like to get stabbed
in the back by someone you trust.

462
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,647
Don't avoid me and just come in.

463
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,568
I just need to pour my cup,
and I'll leave after that.

464
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,322
Who said I was avoiding you?

465
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,369
Did you bring my bag?

466
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,415
I'm sorry. I forgot.

467
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,045
Bring it tomorrow, please.

468
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,471
Ms. Sim.

469
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,350
Are you mad at me or something?

470
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,603
No, it's nothing like that.

471
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,064
Then did you do something wrong?

472
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,191
No.

473
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,209
I think I've gotten used to how you talk.

474
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,381
I thought for sure that I'd be upset.

475
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,803
But somehow, it felt okay.

476
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:03,231
So, if you're avoiding me because
you feel sorry, I'm telling you it's okay.

477
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,359
Hey, Sunwoo.

478
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:08,903
Yeah?

479
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:25,753
Yes, I did come here again
because of your nagging.

480
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,215
But it's not like I'm some undercover
detective. What am I doing here?

481
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,592
DONGJIN: Just do it for one more day.

482
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,265
I still get confused every time
I come here. Which building is it?

483
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,186
What?

484
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,899
I'm sure he saw me. Our eyes met.

485
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,756
You need to stop coming to my place.

486
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,346
Didn't you go on a business trip?

487
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,516
You guys are really relentless.

488
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,311
You should have taken
the hint by this point.

489
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,689
Forget about the contract.

490
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,774
Sir.

491
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,153
What's the reason?
Couldn't you at least tell me that?

492
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,197
Do I really have to explain
things like that?

493
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,408
Anything can happen
when you're doing business.

494
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,120
Tell Dongjin that I'm sorry.

495
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,330
What…

496
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,601
Should I at least ask him
if he wants to come with us for lunch?

497
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,770
No, let's just go eat.

498
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,396
Let's go.

499
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,535
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

500
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,136
Suho. You're going to lunch, right?

501
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,346
Great, let's go eat together.

502
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,640
What do you like?
Korean, Chinese, or Japanese?

503
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,599
I like eating alone.

504
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,394
-What?
-I like eating alone.

505
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,479
Enjoy your lunch.

506
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,530
Did you see that?

507
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,742
I saw, and I heard.

508
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,079
Are you hitting on him
knowing how old he is?

509
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,747
Why would I ask that?

510
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,708
It's not going to do anything in my favor.

511
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,168
What's your problem, seriously?

512
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,502
Because I like him.

513
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:17,091
Whatever he does or says,
I like him. So I'm hitting on him.

514
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,635
So I can have him if he leans into it.

515
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,517
By the way, you can tell
my story of getting rejected just now

516
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,687
to a radio show for all I care,
but just don't tell Jun.

517
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:31,856
It's embarrassing.

518
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,734
Give me the bag.

519
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,154
I really hate eating alone! Eat with me.

520
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,824
Gosh, seriously…

521
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,500
QUICK SERVICE
047

522
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,310
Hey, Dongjin.

523
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,436
DONGJIN: Where are you?

524
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,855
You know.

525
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,608
SUNWOO: I'm nearby.
I'll be in the office in the afternoon.

526
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,109
You were talking about Director Kim.

527
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:23,741
Yes, apparently he had
a busy trip and couldn't call you.

528
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,202
So he says he's sorry.

529
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,456
That silly man acts like he's
the busiest person in the world, right?

530
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,626
-(chimes)
-FEMALE VOICE: Customer number 47…

531
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,545
SUNWOO: Hey, Dongjin. That's what I wanted
to tell you. I'll talk to you later.

532
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,388
SMALL-TO-MEDIUM BUSINESS LOAN

533
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,642
Do I really have to sell my baby?

534
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,071
-What are you doing over there?
-Gosh. You startled me.

535
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,240
Make a noise, will you?

536
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,541
Eat up. You must be starving.

537
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,211
Gosh, that's so thoughtful of you.

538
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,222
That was good.

539
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,017
You'll have some coffee, right?

540
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,352
Who says I'm getting coffee?

541
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,522
Darn it.

542
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,274
Can you ring us up, please?

543
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,908
Anyway, just let me handle Director Kim.

544
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,828
Let me save face
in front of the employees for once.

545
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,165
I'm still a co-CEO of the company,
and I look like I don't do any work.

546
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,209
Are you sure there's nothing going on?

547
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,547
Just believe me when I say it's all good.
Have you been lied to your whole life?

548
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:12,266
You. Stop swearing at me
with your eyes like that. I can hear it.

549
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,121
Will you give me the bag now?

550
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,125
Gosh, you see him every day.
Do you miss him already?

551
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,337
Stop it. It's not like that.

552
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,341
Just let me ask you one last time.

553
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,135
Why don't you like your CEO?

554
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,930
I just don't like him.
Why do I need a reason?

555
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,808
I don't like him because he's Han Dongjin.

556
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,770
Woojoo, come on.

557
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,690
If you really think about it,
I'm sure there's a reason.

558
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,820
If you answer me now, I'll stop asking.

559
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,655
Don't give me that crap.

560
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,906
I'm serious.

561
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,951
Well… I'll bet you my allowance.

562
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,581
Why don't you like him?

563
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,186
His back.

564
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,397
His back?

565
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,066
You don't like how he looks from behind?

566
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,654
The way he looks so lonely
and bored from behind.

567
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,489
That back is the worst part about him.

568
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,118
So what if he's handsome?

569
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,412
He's carrying his grim feelings
on his back.

570
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,165
I hate that it looks dumb.

571
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,085
Dumb…

572
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,045
My goodness!

573
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,267
Hi, Ms. Sim. Did you have a nice lunch?

574
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,855
Gosh, check out this weather.
I guess spring really has arrived.

575
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,608
How much did you hear?

576
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,614
I think I heard from the back part.
Dongjin, how about you?

577
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,826
-We weren't trying to eavesdrop.
-It doesn't matter.

578
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,205
Doesn't matter even if you heard it.

579
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,208
Saying you look pitiful is no big deal.

580
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,588
Give him his bag. I'm leaving.

581
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,882
What? Oh, well…

582
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,842
I'll see you back at the office.

583
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,139
Here. I took it yesterday.

584
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,266
I can't do this.

585
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,602
Sim Woojoo. Wait up!

586
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,521
CEO Han, I'll see you around.

587
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,981
I'm also the CEO.

588
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,695
Hey, she is way too nice and cheerful
for them to be sisters, don't you think?

589
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:13,989
All right.

590
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,242
Darn it.

591
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,994
Why aren't you drinking?

592
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,789
If I drink again,
I might end up at a police station.

593
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,750
Okay.

594
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,297
Let me know if you end up there.
I've been so curious.

595
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,299
If it looks just like it does on TV.

596
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,177
Let me have the same
but in a bottle instead of a glass.

597
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,387
Yes, sir.

598
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,307
Is everything all right with the company?

599
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,731
You're asking
if Dongjin is all right, aren't you?

600
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,414
Sir, I'm heading out.

601
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,208
-Bye.
-Have a good evening.

602
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,961
I'll see you tomorrow.

603
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,630
-See you.
-Bye.

604
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,506
Has Mr. Cha left already?

605
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,425
I think he went to take care
of some business.

606
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,321
You're here.

607
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,418
This is my way
of saying thanks, so eat up.

608
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,215
You don't like Japanese food?

609
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,553
You said you had something
important to discuss. What is it?

610
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,638
Well, it's nothing major.

611
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,599
I wanted to tell you to find another job.

612
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,853
I can even introduce you
to a few places if you want.

613
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,942
Best Fairs is going to go under soon.

614
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,782
I was going to let them at least host
the camping fair, but you let me know.

615
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,286
That CEO Han knows about
CEO Shin and I working together.

616
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,913
So I've decided
to execute the plan sooner.

617
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,666
We can't get sucker punched this way.

618
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,001
We'll be the ones punching.

619
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,849
I wasn't…

620
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,644
able to tell Dongjin about Director Kim.

621
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:23,071
That guy invited Dongjin even
to his brother's restaurant opening party.

622
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,283
When his wife had an affair
and ran out on him,

623
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,328
Dongjin looked for her everywhere
on his behalf and drank with him.

624
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,664
What was the reason?

625
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,626
There's no reason
when it comes to an affair.

626
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,669
That's why it's an affair.

627
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,299
Not that.

628
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,509
Oh, right.

629
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,763
Why did he back out from the fair?

630
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,556
That's

631
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,142
what I'm going to find out now.

632
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,771
Did you look into CEO Shin?

633
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,484
You know CEO Shin?

634
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,111
You told me about him.

635
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,113
You said he made things
difficult for the company.

636
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,450
I must have told you all kinds of things.

637
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,335
The driver is almost here, so wait up.
I'll give you a ride.

638
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,171
No, it's fine.
It's a short walk home from here.

639
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,466
You'll cross the river on foot
this late at night?

640
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,551
You'll freeze to death…

641
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,269
Where do you live now?

642
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,947
The place I used to live in
before I went to the States.

643
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,722
(doorbell chimes)

644
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,443
Who is it?

645
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,460
DONGJIN: Ms. Sim Woojoo?

646
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,300
SECURITY GUARD: Apartment 2702!
Get up! There's been a complaint.

647
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,302
Apartment 2702!

648
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,311
Do you know the man in 2701?

649
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,775
You do. You know him.

650
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,114
(romantic music)

651
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,873
STRAWBERRIES

652
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,230
FROM APARTMENT 2702

653
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,370
Minyoung.

654
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,715
I haven't asked you this once
all this time.

655
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,885
But why did you come back?

656
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,930
Why did you suddenly come back?

657
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,312
Okay.

658
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:07,939
Don't answer me.

659
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,153
And I'll pretend
I don't know you live here.

660
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:18,366
Whatever it is,
you two need to sort it out.

661
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,702
I'm sorry.

662
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:31,922
Sunwoo!

663
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:40,472
Hey, I was just about to call you,
and here you are, right on time.

664
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,268
Did you drink?

665
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,647
I drank something expensive,
but sadly, I'm all sober now.

666
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,691
You didn't drive, did you?

667
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,069
Come on.

668
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,990
What kind of a man do you think I am?
The driver is still in the car.

669
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,742
Why are you here?

670
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,913
I just felt like it.
Do you have some beer at home?

671
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,250
What?

672
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,380
Have the driver park your car.
I don't want you driving right now.

673
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,800
So much nagging. I get it.

674
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,133
-Good morning, everyone…
-WOOJOO: What is that plan?

675
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,011
What?

676
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,764
How are you going to ruin Best Fairs?

677
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:51,311
You can tell me, can't you?
Aren't we on the same team?

678
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,148
This is a big secret though.

679
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,744
-Hello.
-Hello…

680
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,498
YOUNGMIN: They seem to be happy thinking
that once the camping fair goes well,

681
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,874
things will get back to normal.

682
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,669
But they won't even
get to have the fair at all.

683
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,922
CEO Shin and I are
recruiting the clients separately.

684
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,840
DESIGN AND ACCOUNTING TEAM

685
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,343
If a fair that costs the company
its every penny gets ruined,

686
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,178
that will be its end for it all.

687
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,933
This is all because they worked
for the wrong boss.

688
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,376
YURI: Mr. Han didn't come in today.

689
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,086
He didn't come to work?

690
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,714
That's odd. He left the house a while ago.

691
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,966
YURI: He told us he's meeting
with Director Kim.

692
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,593
What?

693
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,971
He didn't tell me, but Ms. Baek…

694
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,517
This fool never listens to me. Darn it.

695
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:30,660
(approaching footsteps)

696
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,380
We don't need tea. He'll be leaving soon.

697
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,306
You didn't get word from CEO Choi?

698
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,225
I told him I can't sign that contract.

699
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,398
You and I go way back, so I tried my best.

700
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,735
But you don't do business
out of friendship.

701
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,613
Director Kim.

702
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,075
You don't have to sign our contract.

703
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,538
I've taken enough
sucker punches like this.

704
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,209
But if I beg you right now,

705
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,754
I think I would really hate myself.

706
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,387
I'm sorry.

707
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,353
You should have apologized sooner.

708
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,817
Then I'd have believed you.

709
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,572
DONGJIN: I was worried.

710
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,492
…AND KANG MINYOUNG

711
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,537
DONGJIN: I thought about dying every day.

712
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,125
Each time, I drank.

713
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,838
And I thought I'd just die.

714
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,217
But if I had actually died,

715
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:16,141
I was afraid that
people would gossip about why I died.

716
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,814
So I wished for the very ground
I was standing on to just cave in.

717
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,111
When the girlfriend I had been seeing
for a long time left me,

718
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,450
that's all I could think about.

719
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,799
Don't drink too much
and take good care of yourself.

720
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,774
FATIGUE REMEDY

721
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,920
SUNWOO

722
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,137
OPERATOR: The number you have dialed is
unavailable at present. Please try again--

723
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,105
SUNGMAN: This is the next step
in Shinwoo Fair's plan.

724
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,358
I had reason to be discreet
in recruiting companies for the fair,

725
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,318
but now it's time to be open about it.

726
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,405
And I've already signed
the contract with Jet Camping.

727
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:39,909
You know that the company is
a major player in this business, right?

728
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,414
I'm not trying to rush you,

729
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,375
but when would you be able
to deposit the investment funds?

730
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,881
What…

731
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,445
Come with me.

732
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,547
This…

733
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,969
To think this would happen today.

734
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:31,933
Look.

735
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,187
You can't show up
in front of me like this.

736
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,776
Even if you run into me on the street,

737
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,487
you should be running the other way.

738
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,534
That's the least bit of respect
you could show me.

739
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,786
The least bit of darn respect.

740
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:03,589
If you get it, then go.

741
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,094
I moved back to where I used to live.

742
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,931
I felt I had to tell you.

743
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,354
I'll avoid you.

744
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,399
I haven't been seen by you until now,

745
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,235
but today, I was just in a hurry…

746
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,868
I guess people really don't change.

747
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,453
That's so like you.

748
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,512
Sir, leave it. I'll clean it up.

749
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,265
I'm sorry.

750
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,743
Please answer.

751
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,877
Hello?

752
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,882
Dongjin! Where are you?

753
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,677
When did you find out?

754
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,599
When did you…

755
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,187
find out where Minyoung lives?

756
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:29,360
-Where are you? I'll come to you.
-DONGJIN: You damn bastard.

757
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:36,409
When I keep quiet about something,
it's for a reason.

758
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,830
You just have to make me say these things.

759
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,509
A wedding invitation.

760
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,302
…AND KANG MINYOUNG

761
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,388
DONGJIN: From the girl I dated
for seven years.

762
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,561
From the girl that
I had in my arms just the day before.

763
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,443
I received a wedding invitation
from a girl like that.

764
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,368
Who would I tell this to?

765
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,876
No one would ever forget that.

766
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,385
SUNWOO: I'm sorry.

767
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,028
My life is…

768
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,535
really pathetic.

769
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:21,972
Are you crazy?

770
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,815
You scared me!

771
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,526
Are you completely out of your mind--

772
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,948
(soft music)

773
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,440
(soft music continues)
