1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:05,547
(sighs)

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,178
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,096
(sighs)

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,306
TRAINER (in video):
Now, when you play this chord…

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,227
(thuds)

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,147
(chair rattles)

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,606
Woojoo.

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,151
Did you see a ghost?

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,364
I was startled because it wasn't a ghost.

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,408
(groans)

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,785
I get it.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,370
Jun ratted me out, didn't he?

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,663
(yells) Watch what you say!

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,877
-Woojoo, I'm getting paid to work here.
-(switch flicks)

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,754
(exhales disapprovingly)

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,716
(rustling in bag)

17
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,092
One hour.

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,552
(cash register drawer opens)

19
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,762
If you run, you're dead.

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,519
You can go to Room Happy Rock, ma'am.

21
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,023
(sighs deeply)

22
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,489
-(sighs)
-(door opens)

23
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,659
(Jigu hums)

24
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,702
Let's talk here.

25
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,038
Don't yell at me outside.
It's embarrassing.

26
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,082
-(yells) Hey!
-Look, you're already yelling.

27
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,541
(sighs)

28
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,586
I won't say this twice.

29
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,715
Get your things from where you're staying
and come back home.

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,717
(sighs)

31
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,887
You just took a breather.
Find another study hall and cram school.

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,805
Do you understand?

33
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,936
I said, do you understand?

34
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,273
You said it in Korean.
Of course I understood.

35
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,652
But you know what?

36
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,572
I understood what you said,
but that doesn't mean I'll do as you say.

37
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm going to sing.

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,077
(sighs disapprovingly)

39
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,956
Even if I pursue singing,
I won't live like Dad.

40
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,082
If that's your concern--

41
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,458
(tambourine jangling loudly)

42
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,212
Do you think I'm against this
for a pathetic reason like that?

43
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,005
That's not it.

44
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,882
Then what is it?

45
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,844
You need to tell me so I can understand
or try to persuade you.

46
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,934
(tambourine jangling loudly)

47
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,729
Woojoo.

48
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,608
(sighs) I don't want to sound pathetic,
so I won't say it.

49
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,651
(lamented sigh)

50
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,573
Okay then. We can both live how we like.

51
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,367
(door opens)

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,286
(Woojoo exhales)

53
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,831
JIGU: Are you really not going to tell me?

54
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,547
(sighs deeply)

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,261
(loudly) At least you should
have a decent job,

56
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,347
so it won't be as embarrassing
when Haesung gets married.

57
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,265
And you…

58
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,476
You have to at least get paid regularly

59
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,354
so you can get a lease
on a house and move.

60
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,481
Will you bring
your future fiancée to that tiny place?

61
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,736
No matter how much I try,
this is all I can do for you.

62
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,864
Aren't you going to be
embarrassed about this later?

63
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,908
(exhales)

64
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,910
So that's your reason?

65
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,455
Is that it?

66
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,708
Jeez.

67
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,712
You're making me sad.

68
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,090
Seriously, I'm so sad.

69
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,594
I feel so down.

70
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,850
Why are you trying to shoulder everything?

71
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,315
(mellow music playing)

72
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,028
-SUNWOO: Thank you for the food.
-MALE VOICE: Thank you.

73
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,034
SUNWOO (slurred):
Oh, uh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

74
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,119
I'll be going then, Dongjin. Thanks.

75
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,204
-Okay.
-Gosh.

76
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,290
I'm sorry, sir.

77
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,377
I remember everything.

78
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,003
I'm totally awake.

79
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,797
Come on, he's waiting.

80
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,965
(faint sighing)

81
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,342
If you're swaying, it's game over.

82
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,760
You need to confess.

83
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,303
I'm not doing that.

84
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,473
This is why I don't want to
tell you anything.

85
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,394
I'm only doing this because I'm so happy.

86
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,147
Okay. Fine.

87
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,818
Don't come in too early tomorrow, okay?

88
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,028
-Okay.
-I'm going for real.

89
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,071
DONGJIN: Go.

90
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,281
SUNWOO: I'm sorry.

91
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,123
(tires screeching)

92
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,584
SUNWOO: Dongjin!

93
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,505
If you don't want to be dating,
then at least be in love.

94
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,175
The weather is too nice
to not do anything.

95
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,678
(blows kiss)
I'm off.

96
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,055
I'm sorry, let's go!

97
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,773
(breathes deeply)

98
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,835
(Jigu sighs, inhales)

99
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,504
I'll get my things and go straight home.

100
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,300
There's nowhere for me to run anyways.

101
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,012
The friend I'm living with
might feel uncomfortable.

102
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,766
I won't go inside. I'll just wait out.

103
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,434
(groans in relief)

104
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,651
(phone beeps)

105
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,737
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The number you dialed is turned off.

106
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,030
-(groans)
-Please record--

107
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,540
(music fades out)

108
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,420
Hey.

109
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,256
Where exactly is your friend's house?

110
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,012
(Jigu sighs nervously)

111
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,808
To be honest, he's not a friend.
He's an older guy.

112
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,607
Yes, that's right. It's Dongjin.

113
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,985
We're living together.

114
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,404
(yells) You crazy idiot!

115
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,905
Are you insane?

116
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,740
Did you just swear at me?

117
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,204
I was going to leave soon,
but then he made me stay.

118
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,081
He gave me pocket money and everything.

119
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,416
I could sense it.

120
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,419
He doesn't want to be alone. He's lonely.

121
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,214
That house is big,
but there's nothing in it.

122
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,591
Just like him.

123
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,345
(groans frustratedly)

124
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,389
(melancholic music playing)

125
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,517
(groans) Just go home.

126
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,644
What about you?

127
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,480
WOOJOO: I'll go after I see him.

128
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,691
(heavy footsteps)

129
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,287
DONGJIN: Did you drink?

130
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,541
Good for you.

131
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,586
I don't really have the right to say this…

132
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,380
but stop drinking.

133
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,759
You've punished yourself enough.

134
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,806
DONGJIN: Bye.

135
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,877
(melancholic music builds)

136
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,381
-(footsteps approaching)
-(sighs)

137
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,101
SUNGMAN: Those two were working together.

138
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,522
Trying to ruin me.
(inhales angrily)

139
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,814
Damn them.

140
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,568
(running footsteps)

141
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,613
(music stops abruptly)

142
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,201
(intro theme music playing)

143
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,087
(music fades out)

144
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:53,175
CALL IT LOVE

145
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,805
(sighs)

146
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,609
(sighs)

147
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,944
You…

148
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,240
You were with them as well?

149
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,200
Not with Youngmin?

150
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,119
Leave quietly.

151
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,954
Don't make a scene here.

152
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,123
All right.

153
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,667
I don't have the energy
to deal with you right now, so move.

154
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,835
I'm not moving.

155
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,589
Don't touch Han Dongjin.

156
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,092
You'll pay for it if you do.

157
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,188
(contemplative music playing)

158
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,954
(feet stomping)

159
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,089
(elevator chiming)

160
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,965
(elevator door opens)

161
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,554
(elevator door shuts)

162
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,056
(keypad beeping)

163
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,350
Sorry about earlier.

164
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,104
I'll go in now.

165
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,191
Do you have medicine for a fever?

166
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,403
You have a fever.

167
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,405
Do you have medicine at home?

168
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,033
I don't.

169
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,954
I'll bring you some, go inside and wait.

170
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,668
(door clicks shut)

171
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,295
(security system beeping)

172
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,217
(door clicks shut)

173
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,931
(contemplative music continues)

174
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,951
(cabinet clicks open)

175
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,167
(cabinet clicks shut)

176
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,176
(music fades out)

177
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,844
Don't take it on an empty stomach.

178
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,929
Thanks.

179
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,184
Come in for a bit.

180
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,773
At least have some tea.

181
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,613
Can't you?

182
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,826
Even if it wasn't you,

183
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,329
I would've brought the medicine.

184
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,334
I don't have feelings for you.

185
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,377
(somber music playing)

186
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,887
I don't know if you know it,
but you're sick.

187
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,849
Stop pretending you don't know
and go see a doctor.

188
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,645
And when you're better,

189
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,190
then we can go get tea
or drinks or whatever.

190
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,485
Not now.

191
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,951
Get better.

192
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,455
(door slams)

193
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,541
(quick heavy footsteps)

194
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,840
(lips smacking)

195
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,762
(inaudible laughter)

196
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,559
(breaking into tears)

197
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,569
(sniffles)

198
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,743
(sobbing and sniffling)

199
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,551
(music fades out)

200
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,852
JIGU: I'm texting you
in case you're waiting for me.

201
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,520
I moved back home.

202
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,856
Thank you for letting me live with you.

203
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,609
I'll become successful
and buy you a nice tent.

204
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,069
Please send my things through Woojoo.

205
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,499
(dialing)

206
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,543
(phone beeps)

207
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,718
MR. HAN DONGJIN

208
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,762
(phone vibrating)

209
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,100
(phone continues vibrating)

210
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
(vibrating stops)

211
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,777
(phone vibrates briefly)

212
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,529
(contemplative music playing)

213
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,159
DONGJIN: Give me a call
when you see this text.

214
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,827
I'll be waiting.

215
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,870
(phone vibrates briefly)

216
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,043
DONGJIN: Sorry I didn't tell you
about your brother.

217
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,842
WOOJOO: Thank you.

218
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,934
Okay.

219
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,901
DONGJIN: Do you want to meet right now?

220
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,825
(music turns uplifting)

221
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,924
(bottle cap rattles)

222
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,554
(gulping)

223
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,736
PART-TIMER SIM WOOJOO

224
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,699
WOOJOO: I'm tired.

225
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,497
(music subdues, turns calm)

226
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,630
-(egg splats)
-(pan fizzles)

227
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,216
There are so many side dishes.
Why are you frying an egg?

228
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,219
JUN: It's for the boy who came back home.

229
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,679
Hurry up and come out!

230
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,058
I was waiting for you to call me.

231
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,351
You crawled back in sooner than I thought.

232
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,103
JIGU: I wouldn't call it
"crawling" back in.

233
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,646
(stirring)

234
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,447
(sighs) I'll say one thing.

235
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,283
From now on, solve your problems at home.

236
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,952
If you run away again,
I'm going to make you crawl back in.

237
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,120
-Okay
-Okay?

238
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,914
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

239
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,333
Go and get us some rice.

240
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,585
What? Do you know me?

241
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,421
Actually, I do feel like
I've seen you around quite a lot.

242
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,092
Ah! Aren't you the pharmacist
with a blabbermouth?

243
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,135
You snitched on him, didn't you?

244
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,013
It was about time he came in,
so I just gave her a hint.

245
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,808
So, from yesterday,
your speed dial number isn't one.

246
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,018
You're downgraded to 6, for 666.

247
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,521
Don't be stingy
and keep pushing it to lucky seven.

248
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,689
(scoffs) You think I'd fall for it again?

249
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,192
I'll never give
Son Heungmin's number to you.

250
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,610
-Get the rice.
-JIGU: Okay.

251
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,780
(utensils clinking)

252
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,285
(munching)

253
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,591
WOOJOO: About singing,

254
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,803
I said I'd think about it.
I didn't give you permission.

255
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,473
(munching)

256
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,599
(tapping with spoon)

257
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,434
Give me some as well.

258
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,352
(snorts)

259
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,478
Use your chopsticks.

260
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,648
Let me do it for you, Moksung.

261
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,941
Do you want the braised beef?

262
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,402
No. Fried fish cake.

263
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,654
What? Sim Moksung?

264
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,114
Is that a new nickname?

265
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,408
It's a pet name between us.

266
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,368
Moksung,

267
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,412
you didn't forget
that today is D-Day, right?

268
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,291
Just let everyone know, why don't you?

269
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,294
Don't worry. No one cares about you two.

270
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,129
Even if you two kissed, I wouldn't care.

271
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,798
-JUN: Don't say something so horrible.
-HAESUNG: Do you have a death wish?

272
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,179
Say something.

273
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,348
-I'm done, I'm going to work first.
-Huh?

274
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,350
(footsteps)

275
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,398
(groans)

276
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,858
-(door shuts)
-(clicks tongue)

277
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,651
Even if I was having a tough time,

278
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,904
I shouldn't have stayed with Dongjin.

279
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,824
Who's Dongjin? A school senior?

280
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,577
No, the CEO of Woojoo's workplace.

281
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,121
You punk, are you crazy?

282
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,915
JIGU: Did you just swear at me?

283
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,750
Why you little…

284
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,834
How could you…

285
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,338
You're even more of a nutjob
than your sister.

286
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,797
A nutjob?

287
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,174
You brat…

288
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,091
JIGU: Brat?

289
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,345
You brat, why did you go there?

290
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,307
(yells) Why are you making a fuss?

291
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,861
(sighs)

292
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,948
(mutters) How did he even think
about staying there?

293
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,704
(hisses) Does this color look weird?

294
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,582
Isn't your family pretty conservative?
Should I wear something else?

295
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,541
(foot thumps)

296
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,003
Should I change or not?

297
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,214
It's pretty.

298
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,298
It really suits you.

299
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,676
Your skin is fair,
so yellow looks nice on you.

300
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,386
Really? (exhales)

301
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,388
But maybe for your parents…

302
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,515
Who cares?
What matters is that you look pretty.

303
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,308
You don't have to impress them.

304
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,227
You're very eloquent today.

305
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,520
JUN: See you later.

306
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,439
Hey, you need to at least tell me
what I should do today.

307
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,066
(whimsical music playing)

308
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,444
(groans) Oh, right.
I forgot to tell you about that.

309
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,867
Don't do less.
Uh, it would be even better if it's more.

310
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,078
Just be your normal self.

311
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,706
You don't have to act shy.

312
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,457
When we're eating,

313
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,378
talk a lot about meaningless things
just like you normally do.

314
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,047
You like drinking with your meals.

315
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,466
Make sure you order a drink
while we're eating.

316
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,176
My father can't drink at all.

317
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,345
He'll probably hate it.

318
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,306
And what else?

319
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,557
And…

320
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,978
Mention that you were born
in the Year of the Horse.

321
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,895
Emphasize your age.

322
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,647
That should be enough.

323
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,192
Ah, so that's your plan.

324
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,611
-Dropping a bomb?
-That's right.

325
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,530
I'm counting on you.

326
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,449
Stop trying to act cute.

327
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,994
I said I got it,
but I didn't say I'd cooperate.

328
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,037
What? You're not coming?

329
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,581
Yes, I'm coming.

330
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,624
For sure.

331
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,209
See you later.

332
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,503
You have to come.

333
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,756
HAESUNG: I got it.

334
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,059
(sighs)

335
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
(strained breathing)

336
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,067
SUNGMAN:
Things are a bit complicated here,

337
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,151
but I'm sure of one thing.

338
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,152
(pensive music playing)

339
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,862
You know everything, don't you?

340
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,616
You don't even need
an explanation of why I'm here.

341
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,951
It's starting to make sense
as I'm speaking.

342
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,828
(scoffs, hisses)

343
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,956
Youngmin knows your number, right?

344
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,752
We'll talk about the details
over the phone during the day.

345
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,799
Make sure to answer.

346
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,847
-SUNGMAN: This is a game to them.
-Damn it.

347
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,475
SUNGMAN: The three of them are
putting up a game to screw us over.

348
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,352
I don't think that's it.

349
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,897
Were you even listening
when I was speaking?

350
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,733
I mean, maybe you're right
about Kang Minyoung.

351
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,402
But I don't think Han Dongjin
and Sim Woojoo

352
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,736
were together from the beginning.

353
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,197
I'm sure about that.

354
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,329
(water pouring)

355
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,085
YOUNGMIN: Good morning, Mr. Han.

356
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,934
YOUNGMIN: Their relationship was
not great in the beginning.

357
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,769
They never even made eye contact.

358
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,572
(pouring)

359
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,658
Are you having coffee?

360
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,917
(pensive music builds)

361
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,801
YOUNGMIN: She wasn't the nicest person
to begin with,

362
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,053
but I could always sense
some kind of hostility.

363
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,641
SUNWOO: Who came into where?

364
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,186
YOUNGMIN: When she was suspected
of being the spy,

365
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,606
-she got fired straight away.
-Mr. Kang, Ms. Kim. Come into my office.

366
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,483
Shouldn't we first hear
the part-timer's story too?

367
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,775
For what?

368
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,486
Ms. Baek.

369
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,654
YOUNGMIN: Back then,

370
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,198
he didn't like her one bit.

371
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,789
Things can always change
between a man and a woman.

372
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,000
Anyways, now it's certain

373
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,377
that she's not on our side, right?

374
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,216
But just call her up.

375
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,717
And ask her about everything.

376
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,720
Like what's the relationship between
Kang Minyoung and Han Dongjin,

377
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,097
and how Best Fairs is doing.

378
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,308
And then what?

379
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,101
What?

380
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,313
I don't know if she'll tell me,
but even if she does,

381
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,815
we don't have the money
to sabotage Best Fairs.

382
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,693
We should take care
of our camping fair now.

383
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,820
Should we just sit here and take it then?

384
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,824
(screams)
They fooled me and screwed me over!

385
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,326
I can't.

386
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,537
I just can't let this slide.

387
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,955
Do you understand?

388
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,916
And you, don't question me
and call her if I tell you to! (yells)

389
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,842
(phone vibrating)

390
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,428
CHA YOUNGMIN

391
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,894
(cabinet doors shutting)

392
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,567
(sighs)

393
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,571
Did you come
to fetch his things yesterday?

394
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,782
No, I didn't.

395
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,955
When are you coming?

396
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,087
Should I bring it to you?

397
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,007
I'll come over after I clock out.

398
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,010
All right.

399
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,803
(footsteps approaching)

400
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,222
-MALE STAFF 1: Hello.
-FEMALE STAFF: Hello.

401
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,646
(contemplative music playing)

402
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,655
MAN (on video): So it cost me
about 11,150,000 won to build this RV.

403
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,408
That includes the second-hand car itself,

404
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:02,495
as well as the parts that I added.

405
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,167
This here looks like
an armrest on a couch,

406
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,711
but it has a really cool secret function.

407
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,172
-SUNWOO (laughs): Seriously…
-MAN: I can keep it covered up,

408
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,675
but when I want to use it,
plug it in and pull it down.

409
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,470
Then it becomes a normal armrest.

410
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,890
Next is this slide-out table.

411
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,643
I put it right in between the cabinets.

412
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:29,731
I can pull it out like this,
and use my laptop or have a meal.

413
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,194
Once I'm done,
I can just push it right back in.

414
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,740
The most important thing to remember
when building your own RV is…

415
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,660
This is good. Can we work with them?

416
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,078
We've contacted them.

417
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,788
And some of them seem to be on board.

418
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,872
I see.

419
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,749
(smacks lips)
But it really is incredible.

420
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,460
(loudly) Thinking of building
a camping car by themselves.

421
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,838
How can they be so passionate?
I'm jealous.

422
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,175
For now, let's count this one
as a candidate for the exhibition.

423
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,259
SOOHEE: Yes, sir.

424
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,762
(blinds rattling)

425
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:03,973
SUNWOO: Uh…

426
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,775
How far are we with the project proposal?

427
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,237
I think it'll be done in about three days.

428
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,365
This week, we have to hand in
the tech support application

429
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,574
and get the booth floor plan.

430
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,660
YURI: We have a lot on our plate.

431
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,788
-(smacks lips) I'll do it.
-You will?

432
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,750
Then perhaps Woojoo can help you.

433
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,587
It's just categorizing data,
so it shouldn't be too difficult.

434
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,257
(loudly) Yes, let's do that then.

435
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,719
I want to do it myself,
but I'm a bit busy with sales.

436
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,530
(music ends)

437
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,240
(pouring)

438
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,452
Well done back there.

439
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,829
(whispering)
The thing with Dongjin and Woojoo.

440
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,706
(closes lid)

441
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,958
What?

442
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,918
Why did you put them together
if you didn't know?

443
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,087
Ms. Sim has an eye for detail,
and she's smart.

444
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,174
Gosh, I thought you knew about it.

445
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,802
Just leave them be and don't interfere.
It'll be better for him that way.

446
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,220
(inhales)

447
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,639
With a character like that,
he'll run away if you push him.

448
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,224
I get it already.

449
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,810
Are Mr. Han and Ms. Sim really dating?

450
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,103
(gasps)

451
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,314
-I can't believe it.
-Uh…

452
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,233
It-It's not like that.

453
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,819
What I'm trying to say is, uh…

454
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,948
Didn't you know they live
in the same neighborhood?

455
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,618
They live really close to each other.
Only a ten-minute walk.

456
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:51,164
You know how it's scary
to go home alone after working late?

457
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,916
So I was asking if she knew about that.

458
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,917
That's all.

459
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,794
I see.

460
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,715
W-What?

461
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,218
Aren't you getting coffee?

462
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,765
(both mouthing)

463
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,849
(vessel thuds)

464
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,937
YURI: I saw Mr. Cha a few days ago,
at the cafe near the office.

465
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,105
It was as if he was waiting
for one of us to walk in.

466
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,983
How dare he even come near this place?

467
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:19,901
What did he say?

468
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,861
He just asked what I expected.

469
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,197
"How's the company?
Are you busy?" Stuff like that.

470
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,615
Anything else?

471
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,408
And…

472
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,369
He asked if Ms. Sim is still working here.

473
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,246
(grunts) That's so random.

474
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,206
What, is he trying to take
our part-timer now?

475
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,708
Our Ms. Sim would never join them.

476
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,752
Our Ms. Sim?

477
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,213
(footsteps approaching)

478
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,214
(gasps)

479
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,512
I'm going out to work.

480
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,142
(phone vibrating)

481
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,897
(sighs)

482
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,609
SUNGMAN: You know everything, don't you?

483
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,696
You don't even need
an explanation of why I'm here.

484
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,114
I met CEO Shin.

485
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,575
I wanted to find out what he was up to.

486
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,451
I pretended to be an investor.

487
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,414
(phone vibrating)

488
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,548
(phone continues vibrating)

489
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,014
I don't know anything,

490
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,974
and I have nothing to tell you,
so don't call me.

491
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,852
(hanging-up beep)

492
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,064
(sighs exasperatedly)

493
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,694
(music fades out)

494
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,329
HAESUNG: Are they here?

495
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,914
JUN: Probably.

496
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,041
They're the type to come 30 minutes early.

497
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,293
Let's go inside.

498
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,462
I was just joking this morning.

499
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,591
Just focus on eating.
Don't worry too much about them.

500
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,051
We're late.

501
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,513
I'll show you what it means
to get a golden pass.

502
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,557
(footsteps leaving)

503
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,896
WAITRESS: This room, please.

504
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,856
(knocking on door)

505
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,650
(sliding door rolls)

506
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,574
Nice to meet you. I'm Sim Haesung.

507
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,202
We should have come earlier.

508
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,083
(all audibly chewing)

509
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,469
(stifled cough)

510
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,851
(gulping)

511
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,312
(glass thuds)

512
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,654
(Jun's father clears throat loudly)

513
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,824
(utensils clinking)

514
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,037
(call buzzer chimes)

515
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,914
(sliding door rolls open)

516
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,874
WAITRESS: How may I help you?

517
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,210
Clear our table
and give us some tea, please.

518
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,379
WAITRESS:
Would you like coffee or green tea?

519
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,964
JUN'S MOTHER: Four green teas, please.

520
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,048
WAITRESS: Right away, ma'am.

521
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,427
(footsteps leaving)

522
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,721
(sliding door rolls shut)

523
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,807
(silence)

524
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,692
(gulping)

525
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,111
(cup clinks)

526
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,906
(cup clinks)

527
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,368
Are you leaving, sir?

528
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,164
-Your father will pay for this.
-Okay.

529
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,000
Thank you for the food.

530
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,168
There's traffic.

531
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,003
I'm coming.

532
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,758
(sliding door rolls open)

533
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,092
Yellow wasn't the right choice.

534
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,219
I'm sorry.

535
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,930
I'll see you again.

536
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,683
Yes, have a safe trip back.

537
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,812
(footsteps leaving)

538
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,527
So your father is a military man.

539
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,947
And rather than me getting a golden pass,

540
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,283
it's more like they're passing on me.

541
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,745
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

542
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,623
(soft mellow music playing)

543
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,250
Haesung, do you remember
that skit in Gag Concert

544
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,419
called "We Need to Talk"
from when we were young?

545
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,755
Jang Dongmin, Kim Daehee,

546
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,340
and who was the mom again?

547
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,927
-Shin Bongsun?
-Yes, that was really popular.

548
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,512
But for me…

549
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,807
I never laughed while watching it.

550
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,851
Why? Because my family was worse.

551
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,190
In that stiff family atmosphere…

552
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:17,907
I was a nosy and chatty child,
so imagine how much of an oddball I was.

553
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,910
My brother and sister…

554
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,913
probably still don't know
that I'm so chatty.

555
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,914
(chuckles)

556
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,374
(mellow music builds)

557
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,001
Although it was just you there…

558
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,087
(smacks lips)

559
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,672
-…that was embarrassing.
-(scoffs)

560
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,550
If we were to have a competition

561
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,343
on who had the most
embarrassing experience,

562
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,803
then…

563
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,179
(chuckles)

564
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,889
…you'd never beat me.

565
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,183
So just drink quietly.

566
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,936
(pouring)

567
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,813
I find that so comforting.

568
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,898
Good. (giggles)

569
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,191
(glasses clinking)

570
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,611
(gulping)

571
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,904
(glass thuds)

572
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,947
(Jun's refreshed exhale)

573
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,118
My dream used to be…

574
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,037
a verb, not a noun.

575
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,541
It wasn't a job, like a pharmacist.

576
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,419
I wanted to live
as rowdy a life as possible.

577
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,549
I thought I'd never achieve it,
but I did recently.

578
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,803
Thanks to the three horrifying siblings.

579
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,971
(chuckles)

580
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,307
I mean, how can there be
so much drama every single day?

581
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,310
And you guys make trouble
one after another.

582
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,895
I could almost call it teamwork.

583
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,356
And it's really annoying
whenever I see that.

584
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,568
But then again, I don't hate it.

585
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,736
(chuckles)

586
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,862
Am I odd or what?

587
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,239
(chuckles) Gosh.

588
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,492
(smacks lips)

589
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,535
(bottle starts pouring)

590
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,329
Let us, for as long as we can…

591
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,372
(bottle clinks)

592
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,540
…live as loudly…

593
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,500
(bottle thuds)

594
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,586
…as possible.

595
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,796
-(tender music playing)
-(inhales)

596
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,964
Sure.

597
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,090
(glasses clink)

598
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,344
(gulping)

599
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,387
(phone vibrating)

600
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,935
SUHO

601
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,686
(phone continues vibrating)

602
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,485
(phone thuds)

603
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,072
(automated voice speaking indistinctly)

604
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,031
What?

605
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,616
(phone thuds)

606
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,351
(computer beeping)

607
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,075
WOOJOO: I sent the file to your email.

608
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,244
I'll go over next time
to fetch my brother's things.

609
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,259
(phone vibrating)

610
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,724
Yes.

611
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,183
Where are you?

612
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,686
The first floor.

613
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,104
DONGJIN: Then wait there for a moment.

614
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,064
You need to get his things, right?

615
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,232
Let's go together.

616
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,067
(Woojoo sighs deeply)

617
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,737
WOOJOO: I'm getting sick of
hearing about his things.

618
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,322
(music fades out)

619
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,865
Okay. Come down.

620
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,533
(hanging-up beep)

621
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,708
(bright music playing)

622
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,855
(door opens)

623
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,338
(breathes deeply)

624
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,757
(Woojoo inhales sharply)

625
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,803
(sighs)

626
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,891
(Dongjin inhales)

627
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,732
What is it now?

628
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,279
Is it because of your brother?

629
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,865
(shudders)

630
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,576
I go back and forth all the time,

631
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,537
so just deal with it.

632
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,127
Are you the best at
just putting up with everything?

633
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,215
You never even once gave a cold look
to your lover who abandoned you.

634
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,010
But were you that upset

635
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,430
because a mere part-timer
gave you some mood swings?

636
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,226
You should've just let me go home.
Why did you call me?

637
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,690
And the thing with my brother as well.
You should've told me first.

638
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,483
Why do you have to do things
behind my back?

639
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,236
(female vocals singing)

640
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,535
DONGJIN: It's a sickness, right?

641
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,372
That you can't stop speaking
once you explode.

642
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,418
That's right.

643
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,878
I'm upset.

644
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,713
I got angry.

645
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,675
You once said
that I should have a comfortable life.

646
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,390
But you're the one
who makes me most uncomfortable.

647
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,058
Did you know that?

648
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,730
The person who fixed my button
when I didn't even ask

649
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,440
is suddenly turning a cold shoulder on me.

650
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,443
No matter how hard I think about it,

651
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,446
I don't think I did anything wrong.

652
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,536
I was going to ask today,
but you kept avoiding me.

653
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,917
(inhales deeply)

654
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,460
Did I do something wrong?

655
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,723
Can't we just…

656
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,979
try to get along like friends?

657
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,486
(mutters)
Don't you have any other friends?

658
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,487
Why be friends with me?

659
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,079
So are you going to
keep that face on at work too?

660
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,832
Whatever. This is who I am.

661
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,807
Let your brother fetch his things.
That will be better.

662
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,908
(footsteps leaving)

663
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,218
(breathes deeply)

664
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,015
(traffic lights beeping)

665
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,990
(traffic lights continue beeping)

666
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,000
(traffic lights continue beeping)

667
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,794
(traffic lights stop beeping)

668
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,979
(song fades out)

669
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,031
(heavy footsteps)

670
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,125
(lock clicking)

671
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,049
SOOHEE: I'll go have a look.

672
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,977
(office phone ringing)

673
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,659
(door opens)

674
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,244
SUNWOO (shouts): Look who's here!

675
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,371
When did you arrive? You should've called!

676
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,580
DAEHONG: Be quiet.

677
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,834
SUNWOO (laughs): So you didn't get
any casting offers on your way here?

678
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,503
-You could be an actor.
-You're still as loud as ever.

679
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,587
(both men laughing)

680
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,922
SUNWOO: Give it here.

681
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,632
Sorry, I got too excited.

682
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,717
Get back to work, guys.

683
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,718
(chuckles nervously)

684
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,802
Uncle Daehong.

685
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,345
(chuckles)

686
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,306
Come in.

687
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,767
(Sunwoo hums)

688
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,812
SUNWOO: And this…

689
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,230
Take care of this, please.

690
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,607
I thought Mr. Han's father passed away.

691
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,402
Who could it be? Do you know?

692
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,949
(laughs) It hasn't changed at all, right?

693
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:44,908
(both laugh)

694
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,119
-Have you eaten yet?
-Not yet.

695
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,746
It's been a while since you came,

696
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,831
so we should have
something nice to eat, okay?

697
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,250
-Sure.
-Dongjin, you'll have to treat him.

698
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,210
-(laughs)
-Thank you.

699
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,213
Ah, this is good.

700
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,840
What brings you to Seoul?

701
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,301
I have an alumni meeting in the evening,

702
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,428
so I thought I might
as well come and see you.

703
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,681
Gosh, so you're different
from Dongjin after all.

704
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,892
I didn't think you'd go to things
like alumni meetings.

705
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,394
A businessman never misses
a social gathering.

706
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,979
How's work?

707
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,898
It's tough. (chuckles)

708
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:19,401
Looks like all the youngsters
who like camping are coming to my place.

709
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,029
Sometimes, I spend an entire day
just carrying firewood.

710
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,655
(laughing)

711
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,325
Then you'll become rich very soon.

712
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,827
If you want it,
one of you can inherit it or something,

713
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,745
so I can rest.

714
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,539
Much appreciated, but I'll pass.

715
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,374
Just give it to your "son" over here.

716
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,794
Do you want it?

717
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,754
(giggles bashfully)

718
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,051
Ah, it's been so long
since we've seen you.

719
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,762
What would be the perfect food
for the special occasion?

720
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,848
What about braised hairtail?
(claps)

721
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,392
-DAEHONG: I'm good with anything.
-Or Chinese. Whoa.

722
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,021
Are you going to the post office?

723
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,815
Yes.

724
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,859
Then why don't you eat with us?

725
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,362
You're on your way out,
it'll be nice to eat together.

726
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,197
Leave her. Let's eat by ourselves.

727
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,826
-But why?
-DONGJIN: Let's go.

728
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,869
-Come on.
-SUNWOO: Okay.

729
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,417
(Sunwoo mumbling)

730
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,092
DOMESTIC BUSINESS TEAM

732
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,059
(rough breathing)

733
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:34,977
Where's CEO Shin?

734
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,187
(sighs) Never mind.

735
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,524
Ugh, damn it.

736
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,652
MALE STAFF 2: Mr. Cha,

737
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,112
I think you should go have a look.

738
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,572
At what?

739
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,241
Who says I don't have money?
I just don't have time.

740
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,493
Of course.

741
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,913
It's going very smoothly,
so don't worry about it.

742
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,707
Yes, of course.

743
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,833
(door bangs open)

744
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,668
(yells) Hey, Shin Sungman!

745
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,755
-Director Kim.
-JUHO: Why you…

746
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,383
Why didn't you tell me
the exhibition hall was canceled?

747
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,427
Do you know who told me that today?

748
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,845
My boss!

749
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,931
Aside from being humiliated,
I'm about to lose my job.

750
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,017
(inhales sharply)
What are you going to do about this?

751
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,769
(screams) How are you
going to take responsibility?

752
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,770
SUNGMAN: Sir, I will…

753
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,105
Sir, let's talk this out.

754
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,857
(Juho exhales exasperatedly)

755
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,819
Hey, weren't you working for Dongjin?

756
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,239
(Juho scoffs)

757
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,869
Did you start this
just to sabotage Dongjin's business?

758
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,623
(shouts) Are you a scumbag or what?

759
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,833
My employees are outside.
I'll explain everything,

760
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,501
-so why don't we sit--
-JUHO: Just stop.

761
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,588
I'll just take the blame for choosing you.

762
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,258
So just give me back my company's money.

763
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,260
(loudly) Or else I'll sue all of you.

764
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,055
Did you understand?

765
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,891
(tense music playing)

766
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,726
Answer me.

767
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,398
You got 50 booths
with less than eight million won.

768
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,151
So shut it and know your place.

769
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,444
(scoffs)

770
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,030
The reason I'm completely ruined…

771
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,865
(screams)
…is that you kept driving the price down!

772
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,158
What?

773
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:14,952
What did you say?

774
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,204
Have you lost it?

775
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,123
Sir, you should go and calm down…

776
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,793
I'll tell you once again.

777
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,838
Give me back my company's money.

778
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,424
You damn scumbags.

779
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,010
-Darn it!
-YOUNGMIN: Sir…

780
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,304
(door shuts)

781
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,932
-(sighs)
-(footsteps stomp)

782
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,393
(groans)

783
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,978
(phone vibrating faintly)

784
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,145

ACE CAMPING PRESIDENT KIM SEUNGHAK

786
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,529
(phone cover closes)

787
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,200
(chuckles disappointedly)

788
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,332
(music fades out)

789
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,795
You should take a taxi.

790
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:12,342
I came to see what Seoul folks are like,
so why would I?

791
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,183
(mellow music playing)

792
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,661
I'm not having such a hard time anymore.

793
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,540
The company isn't doing too badly.
Everything's good.

794
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,792
That's good, then.

795
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,844
That place had really good food.

796
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,056
I think I'll miss it when I go back.

797
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,725
Come back soon. Let's eat there again.

798
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,144
What we ate just now,

799
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,646
was it fried chili chicken
or sweet and sour pork?

800
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,946
I don't remember.

801
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,158
(scoffing)

802
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,452
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

803
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,125
If the rumors were true
that all you do is work,

804
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,211
I was going to bring you with me
for real this time.

805
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,213
I guess I'll let you stay.

806
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,967
I'll come visit
when I'm done with my current project.

807
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,803
For real, this time.

808
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,805
Not just a visit. I'll make you work.

809
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,723
There's a lot to do.

810
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:42,933
Okay.

811
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,142
(chuckles)

812
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,644

813
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,972

AUTOMATED VOICE: The person
you're trying to reach is not available.

825
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,052
Please record a message after the beep.

826
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,808
(melancholic music playing)

827
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,561
DONGJIN: And when you're better,

828
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,148
then we can go get tea
or drinks or whatever.

829
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,525
Get better.

830
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,034
(inhales)

831
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,413

(elevator dings)

834
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,614
I was sure that you'd renew your contract.

835
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,493
(sighs)

836
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:10,163
It's not a common offer,
but we're not a big company anyway.

837
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,458
We wanted to hire you
as part of our planning team.

838
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,794
Everyone knows you're good at your job.

839
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,588
No, thank you.

840
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,769
I don't want to do that.

841
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,190
I'll work until the end of this month,
as per the contract.

842
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,445
(Donghan yawns)

843
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,409
YURI: Are you not going home?

844
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,451
NAHYUN: I am.

845
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,495
YURI: Ms. Baek, it's time to go home.

846
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,497
SOOHEE: You can go ahead.

847
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,498
YURI: Okay.

848
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,061
SOOHEE: She has less than three weeks
left on her contract.

849
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,440
I offered her a full-time position,

850
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,525
but she said no.

851
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,279
What should we do?

852
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,784
-Let her do what she wants.
-Sir?

853
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,038
Why bother her
if she doesn't want to stay?

854
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,667
I understand. I'll go now.

855
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,089
(footsteps leaving)

856
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,132
Ms. Baek.

857
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,093
I'm sorry.

858
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,346
SOOHEE: There's no need, sir.

859
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,639
Don't worry about it.

860
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,403
(music fades out)

861
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,448
(bottles thump)

862
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,665

863
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,048

(taxi whooshing)

865
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,477
DRIVER: Sir, we're here.

866
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,188
Sir!

867
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,599
-(heavy footsteps)
-(bottles rattling)

868
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,022
(bottles clanking)

869
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,193
(bottles clattering)

870
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,738
(tense music playing)

871
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,116
SUNGMAN: Why did you do it?

872
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,120
Did Dongjin tell you to avenge him?

873
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,457
(inhales and sighs)

874
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,335
I thought he was the type
that would just take a beating.

875
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,797
Was I wrong about him?

876
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,177
But you see…

877
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,265
no matter how much I think about it,
I'm certain you did this all on your own.

878
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,933
That's why I'm here.

879
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,312
To take revenge on you.

880
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,898
Let's talk when you're sober.

881
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,567
-When you're not drunk.
-(shouts) You!

882
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,487
You underestimated me.

883
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,700
WOOJOO: Stop.

884
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,045
If you throw that,
that'll be the end for you.

885
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,714
There's no going back.

886
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:33,176
(shouts) My life is already finished
because of that woman!

887
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,260
(tense music builds)

888
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,095
When you took all of his employees

889
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,015
and blew all his hard-earned money,

890
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,517
Han Dongjin didn't hunt you down.

891
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,145
Didn't he give you an opportunity?

892
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,107
To end this need for revenge
and let you just live your own life.

893
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,111
Are you going to blow it all
with that rock?

894
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,657
Drop it before
you do something you'll regret.

895

(footsteps approaching)

902
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,343
