1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,003
(intro theme music playing)

2
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,430
(music fades out)

3
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,977
CALL IT LOVE

4
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,689
EPISODE 10

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,774
(thudding)

6
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,986
(song with female vocals playing)

7
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,295
SUNWOO (on phone): Are you working?

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,463
DONGJIN: I'm in the office.

9
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,052
SUNWOO: She said not to tell you,
but how could I not?

10
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,597
CEO Shin caused some trouble.

11
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,642
He went to see Minyoung
about the investment funds,

12
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,436
and Ms. Sim got hurt.

13
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,234
DONGJIN: Who got hurt?

14
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,027
SUNWOO: Sim Woojoo.

15
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,988
She got hit by a rock instead of Minyoung.

16
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,826
I'm on my way to the hospital,
so you should come too.

17
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,828
(ambulance siren howling)

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,921
(heavy footsteps approaching)

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,551
Hey.

20
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,388
(ambulance siren howling)

21
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,975
SUNWOO: Hey, hey, hey, calm down!

22
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,935
-Let me go!
-SUNWOO: Calm down.

23
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,770
-Come on…
-(screams) What?

24
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,064
SUNWOO: We're at a hospital. Not now.

25
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,567
How much more should I let slide? Huh?

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,277
(yells) How much more?

27
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,241
I didn't want to get back at you
like you did with me.

28
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,202
(shouts) And I certainly didn't want
to stoop down to your level!

29
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,705
(panting)
That's why I didn't even deal with you.

30
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,166
(exhales)
But I let it slide too much, didn't I?

31
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,459
(yells) How could you
throw a rock at someone?

32
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,504
What kind of grudge
could make you do something like that?

33
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,422
Huh?

34
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,008
I have no excuses.

35
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:55,967
(seething)

36
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,219
(shouts) Of course you don't!

37
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,929
(shouts) Hey, stop it!

38
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,848
Just calm down!

39
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,475
(Dongjin breathing angrily)

40
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,144
SUNWOO (panting): I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,230
(panting heavily)

42
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,067
(breathing exasperatedly)

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,778
Just look at his face.
Does he look like he's all there?

44
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,697
(breathing angrily)

45
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,533
SUNWOO: I'm not telling you
to let it slide forever.

46
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,912
Let him come to his senses,
then go pick a bone with him.

47
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,039
(sighs)

48
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,000
(breathes frustratedly)

49
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,964
You rushed all the way here
worrying about her,

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,674
so why waste your energy on him?

51
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,010
How badly is she hurt?

52
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,096
Thankfully, there is nothing wrong
with her eye.

53
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,600
But above the eyebrow here,

54
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,685
she got five stitches.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,856
Go see her.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,441
I'll take care of this.

57
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,245
(puffs in relief)

58
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,045
(sighs) Well, you were incredibly lucky.

59
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,046
(stomps)

60
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,381
(sighs exasperatedly)

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,341
You know what?

62
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,302
I told her to sue you for assault.

63
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,888
But Ms. Sim says she doesn't want to.

64
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,849
WOOJOO: I'm not going to sue him.

65
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,977
SUNWOO: But, why not?

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,770
(chuckles nervously)

67
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,773
I don't think you understand,
but you're quite hurt.

68
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,526
(weakly)
It's enough that he didn't run away.

69
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,070
I've checked everything
that I needed to check.

70
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,114
(distant siren blaring)

71
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,493
SUNWOO: She says, having seen
how you couldn't even run away

72
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,371
and how you were trembling
even more than her,

73
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,082
she could tell
that you are not a bold man.

74
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,751
And that you probably
couldn't even try to take revenge…

75
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,044
No way.

76
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,172
What about all those years
Dongjin and I suffered from you?

77
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,632
(sighs)

78
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,927
I don't agree with her,

79
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,179
but I just said okay.

80
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,889
So come on!

81
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,809
Let's just end this
cursed relationship already!

82
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,187
We shouldn't be
running into each other anymore!

83
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,733
If there's a lawsuit,
we'll have to see each other again.

84
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,903
(smacks lips)

85
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,238
Just go.

86
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,075
Leave now and let's never
see each other again.

87
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,955
(Sungman sighs, inhales)

88
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,968
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,012
(somber music playing)

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,976
I've been living

91
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,813
like a crazy person
as if I was possessed by something,

92
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,691
and I ended up coming this far.

93
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,657
I wanted to stop, but…

94
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,413
I didn't know what else to do with life.

95
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,837
(sniffling)

96
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,964
I'm so terribly sorry.

97
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,468
(sobbing)

98
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,265
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,853
(Sungman sniffling and whimpering)

100
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,815
(sobbing)

101
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,487
(sniffling and sobbing)

102
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,410
(somber music continues)

103
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,961
(music fades out)

104
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,069
(tender music playing)

105
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,920
(softly) Does it hurt?

106
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,715
Not really.

107
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,391
I mean, I was an athlete.

108
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,726
(inhaling deeply)

109
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,227
I didn't dodge it on purpose.

110
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,272
I thought this needed to happen to end it.

111
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,028
If it didn't,
I thought he'd cause a bigger scene.

112
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,909
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,871
For what?

114
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,709
Everything.

115
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,928
But…

116
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,141
when I said I wanted you
to live a comfortable life,

117
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,602
I really meant it.

118
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,858
I went there to tell you that.

119
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,945
It was my bad.

120
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,661
(inhales) Ms. Sim.

121
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,498
The rock…

122
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,378
It struck you in the head, right?

123
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,797
(sighs incredulously)

124
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,966
When did you learn how to joke?

125
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,968
I'm not joking.

126
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,264
You should get it checked again.

127
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,813
Of course, it's a joke.

128
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,485
Let's just…

129
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,280
have an ordinary conversation.

130
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,075
About nothing too special.

131
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,537
And crack a few jokes too.

132
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,750
And stop saying sorry.

133
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,754
I'm sick of it.

134
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,382
I've said it too many times,

135
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,720
and I've heard it too many times.

136
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,474
I'm hungry.

137
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,814
You said we should have
an ordinary conversation.

138
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,155
(music fades out)

139
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,784
(vehicle passing by)

140
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,086
(slurping)

141
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,548
(inhales deeply)

142
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,134
What are you going to tell your family?

143
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,388
I'll just tell them that I fell.

144
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,767
They wouldn't really believe me,

145
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,144
but they'd know
that I don't want to tell them.

146
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,896
And that I'll tell them
when the time comes.

147
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,106
They'd let it slide like that.

148
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,614
We pretend like we don't notice things
about each other and just let it go.

149
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,741
(smacks lips)

150
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,621
It became a habit at some point,
so we don't have deep conversations.

151
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,093
Can I…

152
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,765
Can I go fetch my brother's things?

153
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,354
Should I just send Jigu?

154
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,365
You don't have to do that anymore.

155
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,327
Feeling people out, I mean.

156
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,625
If you want to come, you can come anytime.

157
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,839
I'll be waiting.

158
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,135
(bright music playing)

159
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,636
I'll contact you.

160
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,032
(Woojoo smacks lips)

161
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,952
(slurping)

162
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,457
(bright music continues)

163
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,675
DONGJIN: You can go.

164
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,969
I'll stay here.

165
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,764
You should go.

166
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,277
(music pauses)

167
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,113
-(music resumes)
-Stop drinking.

168
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,825
DONGJIN: And when you're better,

169
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,664
then we can go get tea
or drinks or whatever.

170
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,503
(phone vibrating intermittently)

171
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,218
SUNWOO

172
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,222
(vibrating stops)

173
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,105
(messenger vibrates briefly)

174
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,904
SUNWOO: Where are you? Did you go home?

175
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,198
(sighs)

176
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,122
MINYOUNG: I'm about to sleep.

177
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,712
SUNWOO:
You must have been shocked. Rest well.

178
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,548
And don't drink.

179
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,434
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SHOCKED.
REST WELL. AND DON'T DRINK.

180
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,780
JUN: Hey, what happened to you?

181
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,159
What happened to your face?

182
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,620
I was distracted by my phone and fell.

183
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,248
(Jun hisses)

184
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,291
Man…

185
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,169
You fell and tore up your skin?
There's a bruise too.

186
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,005
Did someone hit you?

187
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,756
Who would hit me?

188
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,383
How should I know?

189
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,596
Come on, just let it slide.
Don't ask anymore.

190
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,972
(sighs)

191
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,058
Something definitely happened,

192
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,227
but you won't say anything?

193
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,899
It's about that guy then?

194
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,484
Hmm? What happened?

195
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,446
Did he find out who you are
and throw a rock at you or something?

196
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,032
He's not like that.

197
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,410
He's nice and gentle.

198
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,330
He's a good person.

199
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,499
Are you trying
to turn me into a walking bomb?

200
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,918
Hmm?

201
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,045
If you keep on doing this,

202
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,881
there's no telling who I'll explode on.

203
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,382
Then don't explode.

204
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,510
Don't do anything, like right now.

205
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,804
And just wait.

206
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,599
I'll sort it out on my own
when the time comes.

207
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,518
There are just things that cannot happen!

208
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,187
Get a hold of yourself!

209
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,024
What can't happen?

210
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,154
Why does she need to get a hold…

211
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,198
What?

212
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,033
What's with your forehead?
Did you get hurt?

213
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,993
I fell.

214
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,915
Did you go to the hospital?

215
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,541
JUN: Exactly.

216
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,377
Go to…

217
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,754
Go to the hospital.

218
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,048
The pharmacy can't handle everything.

219
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,717
Okay, I'll do that.

220
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,552
(water pouring)

221
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,138
I'm sure this wasn't the context.

222
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,475
What is it, you two? What's the secret?

223
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,645
If you're curious,
ask your amazing sister.

224
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,897
(sighs)

225
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,692
(heavy footsteps)

226
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,361
HAESUNG: He seems angry for real.

227
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,572
Is it something serious?

228
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,116
No.

229
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,660
All right then.

230
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,579
I don't know what it is…

231
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,497
(chopsticks thud)

232
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,959
…but don't bottle it up
and make up with him soon, okay?

233
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,261
(knocking on door)

234
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,430
JUN: Aren't you going to work?

235
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,682
Hurry up and eat.

236
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,354
I'm not crossing the line
that you're thinking of.

237
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,773
I can't cross it.

238
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,443
So don't worry too much about it.

239
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,281
(sighs)

240
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,549
(gate opens)

241
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,884
(sighs frustratedly)

242
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,885
(gate shuts)

243
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,555
Whatever.

244
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,432
(contemplative music playing)

245
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,142
Just trust her.

246
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,937
You have no choice but to trust her.

247
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,960
(bright music playing)

248
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,148
(phone clatters)

249
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,027
DONGJIN: I'll be out on an errand.
Let's get lunch together.

250
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,328
(phone vibrating)

251
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,458
WOOJOO: It's on me.

252
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,963
(bright music continues)

253
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,147
(music fades out)

254
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,907
(footsteps approaching)

255
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,789
They're both going to be back
in the afternoon.

256
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,375
(sighs)

257
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,172
JUHO: Tell them to hurry back.

258
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,258
Hey, over here!

259
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,227
You were in a meeting,
and I was getting back from Ilsan,

260
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,729
and then I got a call from Ms. Baek.

261
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,772
She says Director Kim is in the office.

262
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
You get it?

263
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,318
As soon as CEO Shin
shut down the exhibition,

264
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,652
he apparently ran straight here.

265
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,322
He must have grilled him so much.
He got all his money back.

266
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,115
They're number one in the industry,

267
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,576
so the promotion will
definitely be decent.

268
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,579
There's no downside for us.
Honestly, it's good.

269
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,331
(smacks lips)

270
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,832
It just doesn't feel good.

271
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,294
(inhales)

272
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,254
We should take the offer, right?

273
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,381
Did you have lunch?

274
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,218
Not yet.

275
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,887
Then go and eat first. I have plans.

276
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,680
What are you talking about?

277
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,058
What about Director Kim?
He's been there since morning.

278
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,602
Let him wait.
It doesn't matter if he leaves.

279
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,646
Hey, Dongjin…

280
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,609
(heavy footsteps)

281
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,693
SUNWOO: Jeez.

282
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,282
(mellow music playing)

283
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,874
(breathes deeply)

284
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,547
(munching)

285
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:05,847
I've waited in front of
Director Kim's office for five hours once.

286
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,684
I just suddenly remembered that.

287
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,644
(inhales deeply)

288
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,937
I did that out of spite.

289
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,108
(snorts)

290
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,734
Is it petty?

291
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,278
(spoon clunks)

292
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,743
You have two hours and 30 minutes to go,
to make it a full five hours.

293
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,998
A neighborhood granny used
to say this like a broken record.

294
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,418
"People have to die
to experience the afterlife."

295
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,586
There's no way of knowing it before.

296
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,636
He has to experience the agony
to understand what it feels like.

297
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,555
Let him suffer.

298
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,810
So it wasn't my fault
for stupidly waiting for him?

299
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,187
It's definitely not your fault.

300
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,315
(bright music playing)

301
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,569
Let's have some coffee
and take a walk, too.

302
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,170
DONGJIN: Two iced Americanos, please.

303
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,773
(music fades)

304
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,072
You said this before.

305
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,867
I make it easy for them,

306
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,161
so I get sucker-punched.

307
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,332
And what else did you say?

308
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,960
This is why you get stabbed in the back.

309
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,796
You always make yourself look easy.

310
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,090
So why did you stupidly put up
with it for a whole year?

311
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,800
So what if he's handsome?

312
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,511
He's carrying his grim feelings
on his back.

313
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,055
I hate that it looks dumb.

314
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,103
I'm not blaming you or anything.

315
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,896
I just remembered that.

316
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,276
(inhales)

317
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,278
I should go now.

318
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,034
There's still an hour left.

319
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,996
This is enough. Let's go.

320
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,499
Don't do it if you don't want to.

321
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,713
I'm not telling you
to give back as much as you suffered.

322
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,049
Don't force yourself to do it.

323
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,051
Do whatever your heart tells you.

324
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,180
You don't have to do it
if you don't feel like it,

325
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,390
but if you want to, do it.

326
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,267
That's the right thing.

327
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,522
Hmm?

328
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,117
(frustrated breathing)

329
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,246
(sighs)

330
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,875
(scoffs) They've lost their minds.

331
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,710
(snorts)

332
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,253
Darn it.

333
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,089
(grumbles)

334
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,641
(stifled laugh)

335
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,560
(cackling)

336
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,232
Gosh, I always thought
the dormant Baekdusan Mountain

337
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,610
would erupt faster than you.

338
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,820
You beat Baekdusan Mountain today.

339
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,490
-Sorry.
-Hey.

340
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,908
I didn't want it either.

341
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,743
I was just going along with it
because of you.

342
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,665
By the way, are you really Han Dongjin?

343
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,084
Do I seem different?

344
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,628
Yeah.

345
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,465
Then I guess not.

346
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,091
(laughing)

347
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,353
(Jun clears throat)

348
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,530
TO MS. SIM WOOJOO
TO MS. SIM HAESUNG

349
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,074
I see you went by the house.

350
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,700
It must be one of the two.

351
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,871
Either my son is a pushover
or the sisters have dirt on you.

352
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,041
Do you have to be so…

353
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,170
I didn't want to live alone,
so I asked them to live with me.

354
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,006
I tell them they don't have to,

355
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,260
but they insist on paying rent
and living expenses every month.

356
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,680
If you want me to believe
what you're saying,

357
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,640
then you need to answer one question.

358
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,850
Is it the younger one you call a friend,

359
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,978
or is it the older one
that you lied to us about?

360
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,021
Which one of the two are you seeing?

361
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,899
If that's not the case,
it doesn't make any sense.

362
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,026
That's what you think.

363
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,281
Don't you even think about
giving me neither as an answer.

364
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,283
It's neither.

365
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,160
Actually, I've never
thought of them like that.

366
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,078
To me, they're just…

367
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,706
They're just like air.

368
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,040
I can't survive without them,

369
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,959
and it feels natural
for them to be around.

370
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,045
And you probably don't know this,
but I get lonely easily.

371
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,797
I don't like being alone.

372
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,051
You can think of it like I'm suffering
from lack of affection or something.

373
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,430
Who do you take after
to be so sentimental about everything?

374
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,141
If you don't want to be alone,
get married.

375
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,684
Or look into going on arranged dates.

376
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,353
-Your sister and brother--
-You can stop there.

377
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,481
I completely understand
what you're trying to say,

378
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,067
so I'll think about it
seriously from now on.

379
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,527
About which one of them I like.

380
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,072
There's nothing more to say, right?

381
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,462
There's a place where they rent out
school uniforms near the subway station.

382
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:15,216
Uh, it's the weekend though.
Won't there be a lot of people?

383
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,094
If we dress like this and
post the pictures on our couple's account,

384
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,554
it'll be a total blowout.

385
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,930
(chuckles)

386
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:21,890
I bet it will.

387
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,517
Do you not want to?

388
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,518
What?

389
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,686
(stutters)

390
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,355
It's not that I don't want to.

391
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,231
I mean…

392
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,736
Let's do it. I think it'll be fun.

393
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,743
(bell chimes)

394
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,702
Huh?

395
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,665
Don't we have to go a bit further?

396
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:48,833
Let's just get off.

397
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,418
Huh?

398
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,467
(doors open)

399
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,476
(doors shut)

400
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,560
Suho.

401
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,901
Suho.

402
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,824
Are you mad at me?

403
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,162
I'm really not mad at you.

404
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,456
Can't you just tell me honestly?

405
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,711
You don't like theme parks.
You think they're childish, right?

406
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,964
(inhales deeply and sighs)

407
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,841
Then let's go where you want to go.

408
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,343
Don't pretend to
like the things that I like.

409
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,345
No, it's not that.

410
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,514
I wasn't pretending at all.

411
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,270
Are you angry?

412
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,273
Let's take the next bus and go.

413
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,527
Let's go and put on school uniforms.
And should we wear headbands too?

414
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,321
You're doing it again.
You pretend to like it.

415
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,407
Just stop it.

416
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,743
Haesung, every time you do this,

417
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:06,995
it all feels fake.

418
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,623
What do you mean?

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,836
(smacks lips) I don't know.
I just said that out of frustration.

420
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,922
But I think I do mean it.

421
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,427
Your laugh and happy face all seem fake.

422
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,596
It's confusing.

423
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,152
KANG

424
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,653
KANG: Uncle Daehong has gotten old.

425
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,042
STAFF: Here's your coffee.

426
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,229
The stitches are out.

427
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,523
If I take good care of it,
it won't leave a scar.

428
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,318
I can go to the hospital on my own now.

429
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,906
(sipping)

430
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,325
WOOJOO: You don't have to do it
if you don't feel like it,

431
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,743
but if you want to, do it.

432
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,578
That's the right thing.

433
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,831
Do whatever your heart tells you.

434
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,502
Do you want to go camping with me?

435
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,591
I'll spend the night
and come back tomorrow.

436
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,806
If you're uncomfortable,
we can come back at night.

437
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,268
I don't mind spending the night there.

438
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,439
It's camping,
so we should spend the night.

439
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,866
(soft music playing)

440
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,912
(engine rumbling)

441
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,548
I think it's my first time
seeing you drive.

442
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:26,926
You don't remember?

443
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,596
It's the second time.

444
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,724
(sighs)

445
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:38,354
When I took you to CEO Shin's company,
and I suspected you as a spy.

446
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,523
Oh.

447
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,859
It seems so distant.

448
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,570
For me, it's not.

449
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,158
Maybe that's because I've never had
someone read me like a book before.

450
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,620
It's so vivid for me.

451
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,331
WOOJOO:
You'd like me to admit it, wouldn't you?

452
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,416
It'd be less painful to be betrayed
by the part-timer

453
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,959
who's worked for only three months

454
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,755
than to be betrayed
by the people you've trusted for years.

455
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,230
I haven't gone camping in a while.

456
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,650
Has it been three years?

457
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,196
There was a time when I would go
whenever I had the chance.

458
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,156
Whether it was the weekend or the weekday.

459
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,493
We broke up at the camping site.

460
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,670
DONGJIN: I knew she had someone else.

461
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,549
I don't know
why we ended things like that.

462
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,351
Come to think of it,
it didn't help either of us.

463
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,523
That was the day…

464
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,694
I hated myself the most.

465
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,948
So I couldn't go camping again.

466
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,078
If I went,
I would have to face my worst self.

467
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,296
Why are you going today?

468
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,556
(chuckles faintly)

469
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,481
I wanted to go with you.

470
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,240
(delightful music playing)

471
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,816
(music subdues)

472
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,993
(indistinct chatter)

473
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,672
(delightful music plays up)

474
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,647
DAEHONG: Han Dongjin.

475
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,243
(music ends)

476
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,501
SUHO: One iced Americano,
and a regular Americano, please.

477
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,928
(mellow music playing)

478
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,146
JUN: I like that face.

479
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:52,859
What face?

480
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,444
The face you make
when you're not making any effort.

481
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,531
Make that face more often.

482
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:03,369
Don't smile when you don't feel like it
or pretend to be happy.

483
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,039
You'll be comfortable then.

484
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,583
(smacks lips)

485
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,002
If you're uncomfortable,
you can't call it dating.

486
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,004
That's just work.

487
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,260
(shudders)

488
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,846
This is my first time
saying something like this,

489
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,391
so I don't even know where to begin.

490
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,604
I'll be brave and try to say it.

491
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,149
The theme park is not the problem.

492
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,443
I am.

493
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,740
I don't really feel comfortable

494
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:46,537
in a place that's closed off and crowded.

495
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,793
If I take medicine, it does get better.

496
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,422
But I wasn't sure
if I'll feel okay the whole time.

497
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,676
It's been two months
since I started having these symptoms.

498
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,678
Was it…

499
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,599
Yes.

500
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,142
(clamoring)

501
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,186
Ma'am, please calm down,
and let's just talk.

502
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,647
HAESUNG: You could say
that getting hit in front of people

503
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,191
and being humiliated

504
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,401
is not a big deal…

505
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,778
(inaudible speech)

506
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,946
But you only see that on TV.

507
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:24,659
Not a lot of people
actually experience that.

508
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,206
I'm the only one who experienced
something like that, that I know of.

509
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,667
(giggles)

510
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,753
You don't have to smile.

511
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,347
Okay.

512
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,726
It was difficult.

513
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,687
(music fades out)

514
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,025
It was enough to keep me awake
for many nights.

515
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,195
(somber music playing)

516
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,324
HAESUNG: Every time I thought about it,
I felt ashamed.

517
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,248
(whimpering)

518
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,457
To be honest…

519
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:20,673
(whimpering)
I hit on you, determined to make you mine.

520
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,383
(laughing in tears)

521
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:28,014
I hoped that if I meet a new person
and started dating again…

522
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:34,061
it would make people think
that the whole thing wasn't a big deal.

523
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,482
(sniffling)

524
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,109
I used you.

525
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,487
I'm sorry.

526
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,244
(shuddering)

527
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,787
I had no idea…

528
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,916
I must have seemed like a child to you.

529
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,754
No.

530
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,756
You're a man.

531
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,467
Not a child.

532
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,511
(sniffling)

533
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,602
(whimpering)

534
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,283
(sniffling)

535
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,538
(sizzling)

536
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,127
DAEHONG: How's it coming along?

537
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,004
DONGJIN: It's good. (chuckles)

538
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,840
Ms. Sim.

539
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,468
Just leave it. I'll do it.

540
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,095
Yes, just relax.

541
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,265
I'm not used to just relaxing.

542
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,809
I feel more comfortable doing things.

543
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,188
(Daehong inhales)

544
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,242
(inhales)

545
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,203
-(barbecue sizzling)
-(smacks lips)

546
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,121
Were you surprised?

547
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,165
I was, briefly.

548
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,167
Now I'm feeling great.

549
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,127
(chuckles)

550
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,882
Your tent is still there as it is.

551
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,801
I didn't put it away.

552
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,470
I mean, I did clean it once in a while.

553
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,515
(sentimental music playing)

554
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,811
I really hoped you'd come back one day
since you loved it so much.

555
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,439
And you're finally here.

556
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,107
(giggles)

557
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,155
Dust them off today and air them out.

558
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,448
They must've been suffocating.

559
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,991
All right.

560
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,034
(barbecue sizzling)

561
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,873
(soft music playing)

562
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,739
(puffs)

563
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,306
Do you need a hand?

564
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,018
Don't you need to just take it off?

565
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,438
No, I can do it on my own.

566
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,957
-Hello.
-MAN: Hi.

567
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,874
(chuckles)

568
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,127
(indistinct chatter)

569
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,465
(happy breathing)

570
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,926
WOOJOO: Over there too?

571
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,927
Yeah.

572
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,345
(chuckles)

573
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,063
(munching)

574
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,734
(crunching)

575
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,694
(giggles)

576
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,028
Should we order more?

577
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,446
I'm full.

578
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,823
You didn't eat much, though.

579
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,575
No, I had enough.

580
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,452
(giggles)

581
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,872
Actually, I already feel full
without even eating.

582
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,125
(phone vibrating)

583
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,418
(placing chopsticks)

584
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,795
-SUHO: I'll be right back.
-HAESUNG: Okay.

585
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,298
(Suho smacks lips)

586
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,174
(door opens)

587
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:18,679
(sighs)

588
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,515
(giggles)

589
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,891
(utensils clatter)

590
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,812
THE BATHROOM IS OUTSIDE ON THE LEFT

591
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,231
(switch clicks)

592
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,570
Today's not good.
Are there a lot of people there?

593
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,198
No.

594
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,994
My girlfriend told me about
her being sick today.

595
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,164
So I can't really tell her
that I'm going to go gaming.

596
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,874
(chuckles)

597
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,334
She's not that sick.

598
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,795
You know how some people look healthy,
but they take meds?

599
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,047
Something like that.

600
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,799
So you guys go first.

601
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,302
I'll finish this up
in an hour and join you.

602
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,054
(somber music playing)

603
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,013
(grunts)

604
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,807
I only need one hour.

605
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,272
(angry breathing)

606
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,661
(rustling in bag)

607
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,372
(banknotes flicking)

608
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,634
(door shuts)

609
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,195
(calling chime)

610
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,072
(ringing tone)

611
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,032
(phone ringing)

612
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,672
(phone continues ringing)

613
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,894
(phone continues ringing)

614
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,654
(ringing stops)

615
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,324
(sad song playing)

616
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,045
(female vocals singing)

617
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,762
(ringing tone)

618
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:09,600
AUTOMATED VOICE: The person
you're trying to reach is not available…

619
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,479
(ringing tone)

620
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,695
(hanging-up tone)

621
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,239
Hey.

622
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,366
Good timing, I wanted a drink.

623
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,052
(sobbing)

624
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,517
What happened?

625
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,060
(sobbing)

626
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:53,977
JUN: What?

627
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,481
(whimpering)

628
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,860
You need to tell me so I can comfort you.

629
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,529
You know that's my specialty.

630
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,614
(sobbing)

631
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,659
It was…

632
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,287
my first time telling anyone

633
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,998
about me taking medication.

634
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,626
(sniffling)

635
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,045
And he told his friend…

636
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,173
as if it's nothing.

637
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,804
(sniffling)

638
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,141
What a jerk.

639
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,477
Jun.

640
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,855
(tearing up)

641
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,606
I feel so humiliated.

642
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,280
(sobbing, weeping)

643
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,037
It's all right.

644
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,039
(Haesung sobbing)

645
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,251
JUN: It's okay.

646
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,379
(weeping)

647
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,883
There, there. It's okay.

648
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,093
(weeping)

649
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,474
(weeping)

650
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,074
(sobbing)

651
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,666
(sobbing)

652
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,639
(song fades out)

653
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,198
WOOJOO: Is this fun for you?

654
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,786
Setting it up and taking it down.
It just looks like work.

655
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,540
DONGJIN:
There are people who do this for fun,

656
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,710
and there are people who do it to rest.

657
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,713
(firewood clattering)

658
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,343
I started camping
because I wanted to rest.

659
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,345
(mellow music playing)

660
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,764
I have so many thoughts
running through my head

661
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,433
when I lie in bed wanting to rest.

662
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,813
But when you're camping,

663
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,233
nothing gets done
if you don't move your body.

664
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,487
You have to build a shelter,

665
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,198
and you have to make food.

666
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,994
When you make yourself busy like that,

667
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,080
you can rest from your thoughts.

668
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,165
Your mouth can rest,

669
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,669
and your eyes can rest too,
looking at nature.

670
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,881
For me,

671
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,926
there was no rest quite like this.

672
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,393
In Seosan,

673
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,731
there's a campsite
with a long forest trail.

674
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,191
That's my favorite place.

675
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,361
Let's go there

676
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,822
together another time.

677
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:36,867
We'll see.

678
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,497
I didn't say I like camping yet.

679
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,254
Well, it's pretty nice so far.

680
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,020
(gulping)

681
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,875
You could've come up.

682
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,919
SUNWOO: No need for that.

683
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,838
Take this. It's porridge.

684
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,256
I didn't say I was sick.

685
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,469
(chuckles) Like you didn't pick up
the phone and talk like you were dying.

686
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,639
Don't drink on an empty stomach,
at least eat some porridge.

687
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,556
Here.

688
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,852
You should be telling me not to drink.

689
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,607
Hey, I can't tell you to stop drinking.
I'm just your friend.

690
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,984
Not your family or your boyfriend.

691
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,613
So just this is appropriate,
don't you think?

692
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,117
-Thanks.
-SUNWOO: All right.

693
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,077
(awkward breathing)

694
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,960
That's abalone rice porridge, king-size.

695
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,461
Make sure you eat it all.

696
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,629
(chuckles)

697
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,881
Go on up. I'll go.

698
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,094
-Take care on your way back.
-All right.

699
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,593
(phone vibrating)

700
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,809
(solemn guitar music playing)

701
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,979
(phone vibrating)

702
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,293
SUHO

703
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,252
(inhales)

704
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,300
POWER OFF

705
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,303
(phone thuds)

706
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,456
(inhales and smacks lips)

707
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,215
(snorts)

708
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,014
JIGU

709
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,768
-The person you're trying to reach…
-What?

710
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,604
(calling chime)

711
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,441
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The number you dialed is turned off.

712
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,070
Please record a message after the beep…

713
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,656
(loudly) Why isn't anyone picking up?

714
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,199
MOM

715
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,411
I just arrived in Seoul.
Let's have dinner, so hurry back home.

716
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,954
This is driving me crazy, seriously.

717
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,331
(somber music playing)

718
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,673
Gosh, they're driving me crazy.

719
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,145
They should've told me
they changed the lock.

720
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,865
Excuse me. Who are you?

721
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,534
And why are you asking that?

722
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,703
Because you're standing
in front of my house.

723
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:35,332
What nonsense are you talking about?
Are you drunk?

724
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,792
How is this your house? This is my house.

725
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,379
-Do you have a heatstroke?
-Just keep walking, will you?

726
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,964
Look here, lady…

727
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,174
JIGU: Mom!

728
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,432
Mom, wait. We need to talk.

729
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,060
This isn't our house anymore.

730
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,657
(inaudible dialogue)

731
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,084
(somber music continues)

732
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,550
(inaudible speech)

733
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,054
(running footsteps approaching)

734
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,516
(panting)

735
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,645
HAESUNG: She said not to come in.
She said she'd kill us.

736
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,772
(Jigu groans)

737
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,983
You should've answered your phones.
What were you doing?

738
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,111
If we had, would it have changed anything?

739
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,240
Gosh.

740
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,034
(music fades out)

741
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,918
(running footsteps approaching)

742
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:02,836
HAESUNG: Mom.

743
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,088
JIGU: Mom, I'll carry it.

744
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,756
(plastic clattering)

745
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,800
(Hyunju breathing angrily)

746
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,224
(angry breathing continues)

747
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,149
(calming down breathing)

748
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,483
Let's just go home.

749
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,158
(footsteps leaving)

750
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,492
(sighs)

751
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,954
Hurry up.

752
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,376
(song with female vocals playing)

753
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,188
HYUNJU: You three.

754
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,482
You're orphans from now on.

755
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,525
Consider me dead.

756
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,405
Mom…

757
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,450
We're sorry.

758
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,119
(sobbing)

759
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,163
We'll never do something like that again.

760
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,539
We're sorry.

761
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,791
I'm sorry.

762
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,171
(Haesung sobbing)

763
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,674
(sniffling and breaking into tears)

764
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,349
(sobbing)

765
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,813
(sobbing)

766
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,286
(footsteps approaching)

767
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,596
WOOJOO: You know how sometimes
you can tell a lot about someone

768
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,139
just by the way they walk?

769
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,392
I can tell you won't
go down no matter what.

770
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,355
There are so many stories there
that are way worse than yours.

771
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,065
I just wish

772
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,069
you could live comfortably
in your own place.

773
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,322
It's definitely not your fault.

774
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,700
Don't do it if you don't want to.

775
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,785
Do whatever your heart tells you.

776
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,371
You don't have to do it
if you don't feel like it,

777
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,872
but if you want to, do it.

778
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,542
(snorts)

779
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,259
(gentle wind blowing)

780
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,308
(messenger vibrating)

781
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,455
DONGJIN: I put away the tent that I'd
abandoned like an island for a long time.

782
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,081
(exhales deeply)

783
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,334
I feel light-hearted.

784
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,847
If I hadn't met you,

785
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,684
I would've still been trapped
on that island.

786
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,897
Thank you for helping me escape.

787
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:04,118
…THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME ESCAPE

788
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,751
(sniffling)

789
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,338
(sobbing)

790
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,813
(whimpering)

791
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,691
(sniffling)

792
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,660
(exhales)

793
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,580
(exhales)

794
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,492
(sniffling and sobbing)

795
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,418
(sniffling)

796
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,465
(whimpering)

797
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,384
(song ends)

798
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,599
(sobbing continues)

799
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,102
(outro theme music playing)
