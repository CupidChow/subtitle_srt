00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:03,503
CALL IT LOVE

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:07,382
WOOJOO: The deed of our house got
transferred to a total stranger overnight.

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:12,012
I've lived there for 20 years,
and I got kicked out of there in 2 days.

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,930
(contemplative music playing)

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,724
Isn't that messed up?

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,771
You don't seem interested.
Don't care about other people's business?

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,652
WOOJOO: Aren't you curious
about the backstory?

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,239
If you ask now, I'll tell you everything.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,993
Along with how I plan
on getting the house back.

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,042
EPISODE 7

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,419
DONGJIN: I'm not interested
in other people's misery.

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,969
(doorbell rings)

13
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,721
(door opens)

14
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,930
HEEJA: Come in.

15
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,559
Looks like you didn't have much trouble
finding this place. (laughs)

16
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,227
Yes, come on in.

17
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,817
Don't just stand there.

18
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,906
I have something to ask you.

19
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,450
About this house…

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,246
What about this house?

21
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,625
How many times do I have
to tell you this house is mine?

22
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,627
If you really can't believe it,

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,004
check the registration
at the district office.

24
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,509
What happened to the people
who were living here before?

25
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,054
You're killing me.

26
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,182
How would I know that?

27
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,893
I'm sure they are doing fine somewhere.
(chuckles)

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,104
You really don't know?

29
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,732
I have no idea. I swear!

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,360
(sighs)

31
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,115
I was wondering why you came here.
And this is what you wanted to ask?

32
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,454
(clicks tongue)

33
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,790
Give me their number if you have it.
I'll give them a--

34
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,751
(yells) How would I know the phone numbers
of the kids I kicked out?

35
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,879
Then what? Should I live with them?

36
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,466
Was I supposed to rent out a room
and charge them rent?

37
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,427
(scoffs)

38
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,595
(tense music playing)

39
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,223
What's with that look?

40
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,433
Once again…

41
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,645
I'm the one who's vulgar, aren't I?

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,483
You didn't ask anything when I said I'd
sell this house and give you the money.

43
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,279
You weren't curious then,
so why are you curious now?

44
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,407
That's why I'm being punished now.

45
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,367
What?

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,081
You're just like your father.

47
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,669
Looking at me with contempt
in your eyes and blaming everything…

48
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,629
on me.

49
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,839
(shuddering)

50
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,632
You're no different than him.

51
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,551
(tense music builds)

52
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,430
I'll go.

53
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,265
(stammers)

54
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,516
Han Dongjin!

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,310
AUTOMATED VOICE: The cooking has finished.

56
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,311
(shoes thud)

57
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,770
(stammers)

58
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,731
At least have a meal before you go!

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,357
-Son!
-(door slams)

61
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,653
ESTATE AGENT: It's bad enough
to steal someone's husband,

62
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,573
let alone take the house
and drive the kids out.

63
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,745
The ladies in the neighborhood
say it couldn't possibly be that bad,

64
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,247
but I know.

65
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,334
The mistress is really living
in that house.

66
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,627
(grunts)

67
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,463
Anyway, there are three children.
(sniffles)

68
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,548
And I think the second? Or the first one?

69
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,760
I think it must be the second child.
Anyway, I see her from time to time

70
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,011
in this neighborhood.

72
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,518
ESTATE AGENT:
And of course she'd come around.

73
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,604
She's lived here since she was a toddler.

74
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,649
She's coming back
because she misses her home.

75
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,575
By the way…
(chuckles)

76
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,285
Who are you to be asking about that house?

77
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,122
I'm the son…

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,209
of the woman that moved into that house.

79
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,253
ESTATE AGENT: Huh?
(coughs, sniffles)

80
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,004
Oh, my goodness.

81
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,635
If you ever happen to see her again,
could you give me a call?

82
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,928
At least…

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,180
-(rustling in pocket)
-(sighs)

84
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,724
Please give her my business card
and tell her I'll be waiting.

85
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,602
Well, that's not difficult to do, but…

86
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,230
Please do that for me.

87
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,857
(doorbell rings)

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,652
ESTATE AGENT:
But why would you want to meet her?

89
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,029
It's not like she'd be glad to see you.

90
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,907
I hear that girl is quite tough.

91
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,867
(doorbell rings)

92
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,078
DONGJIN: I'm counting on you, please.

93
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,706
This is Han Dongjin.

94
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,083
ESTATE AGENT:
This is Golden Country Realty.

95
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,294
Come over quickly.

96
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,338
That daughter you'd been looking for
is on her way here.

97
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,341
You know, you asked me
to call you if she comes.

98
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,719
Just now, the girl's aunt came,

99
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,555
and it looks like she found out today
your mom moved into that house.

100
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:13,313
ESTATE AGENT: Her niece is coming this way
too, so hurry up and get over here, okay?

101
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,274
(doorbell ringing faintly)

102
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,194
(sing-songy) I'm coming.

103
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,782
-Who is it?
-WOOJOO: Open the door.

104
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,201
-What?
-WOOJOO: I said open the door.

105
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,078
(screams) Open this door!

106
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,248
This isn't your house!

107
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,793
-Open up! Open the door!
-(banging on gate)

108
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,004
-(gasps)
-(Woojoo grunting)

109
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,505
WOOJOO: Open the door!

110
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,552
You should have just sold it off.
Why are you living in this house, why?

111
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,553
(banging)

112
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,804
(gasps, shudders in panic)

113
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,642
-(doorbell ringing)
-(groans, shudders)

114
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,228
Gosh.
(trembling)

115
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,939
(Woojoo grumbling)

116
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,107
WOOJOO: Open up.

117
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,818
Open the door before I tear it down!

118
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,320
(screams)
Come out here!

119
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,404
(trembles) Goodness…

120
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,948
Gosh, she's going to embarrass me.

121
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,658
Wait.

122
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,369
(urgent music playing)

123
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,830

ESTATE AGENT: Now you show up.

126
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,721
Hurry up and go to the house.
Maybe you'll be able to catch her there.

127
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,933
(urgent music builds)

128
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,855

00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,595
(sighs)

136
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,653
POLICEMAN: Ms. Ma Heeja, the owner
of the house, has personally reported you.

137
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,863
(Woojoo sighs)

138
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,989
POLICEMAN: For trespassing.

139
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:30,867
My identification?

140
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,799
I never thought I'd see the inside
of a police station thanks to my niece…

141
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,302
You insolent brat, I'm talking here.

142
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,012
(yells) Hey! Sim Woojoo!

143
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,141
You're not thinking of going back
to that house, are you?

144
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,268
I bought these to throw at her,
so I have to go.

145
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,187
(dumbfounded laugh)

146
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,730
Oh, I give up.

147
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,941
It's up to you whether you throw
or cook those eggs.

148
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,359
But first, listen to me.

149
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,904
(sighs)

150
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,323
By the way, aren't you going to thank me?

151
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,949
I never asked for your help.

152
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,579
Okay. Then perhaps I should have just
called your mom over in Tongyeong, right?

153
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,331
What, should I give her a call right now?

154
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,252
Gosh, your eyes look just like your dad's
when you stare at me like that, you know?

155
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,004
-(shouts) Aunt!
-W-What?

156
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,298
Stop barking at me and take this.

157
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,716
Here.

159
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,722
What about it?

160
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,391
I guess you remember
whose business card it is.

161
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,809
Well, at least you're smart.

162
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,022
If you're curious
how I came by this again…

163
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,235
Apparently, that woman's son personally
left it with the realtor not too long

164
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,986
after you kids moved out.

165
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,906
He wanted to apologize
to you kids on his mother's behalf.

166
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,033
(hisses, exclaims)

167
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,953
I have no idea
how such a nice son came out of Heeja.

168
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,831
Anyway, apparently,
he came by the realtor a lot.

169
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,293
He said, it might be difficult,
but he was going to persuade his mom

170
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,836
and return the house too.

171
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,093
Why are you telling me this now?

172
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,345
Why?

173
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,556
Hey! I only found out today too.

174
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,101
(yells) Why did you find out only today?

175
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,228
(exasperated sigh)

176
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,021

00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,874
(somber music continuing)

178
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,733
ENERGY DRINK

179
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,247
WOOJOO: So,

180
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,250
you're living comfortably.

181
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,421
So if you really want to ruin
this company, then try harder.

182
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,423
Why do you keep saying sorry?

183
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,924
You don't even know
what it means to be truly sorry.

184
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,427
(music crescendos, pauses)

185
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,263
AUNT: He wanted to apologize
to you kids on his mother's behalf.

186
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,058
He said, it might be difficult,
but he was going to persuade his mom

187
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,809
and return the house too.

188
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,853
(somber music resumes)

189
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,037
(music fades out)

190
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,044
-Hey.
-SUNWOO: Hey, did you meet her?

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,047
-No.
-SUNWOO: Then come back to the office.

192
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,840
The magazine company folks are coming.

193
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,467
What time should I be there?

194
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,760
(door opens)

195
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,229
Okay, I'm on my way.

196
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,648
(hanging up bleep)

197
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,608
(blows)

198
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,492
(door shuts, security system chiming)

199
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,348
(indistinct chatter)

200
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,064
Uh, any word from Ms. Sim?

201
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,234
I've called her several times already,
but she's not picking up.

202
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,321
(silence)

203
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,783
I've sent her text messages too,
so she'll respond soon, right?

204
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,661
-SOOHEE: Let's go in and talk about it.
-Let me know as soon as she responds.

205
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,580
Even during the meeting?

206
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,956
(footsteps approaching)

207
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,874
Thank you in advance.

208
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,169
SOOHEE: Sir, here are the guests
from the magazine company.

209
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,212
-Hello, please come in.
-GUESTS: Nice to meet you.

210
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,261
-(ringing tone)
-(groans)

211
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,809
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your call could not
be connected. Please leave a message…

212
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,227
(cell phone slaps, thuds)

213
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,854
(sighs)

214
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,897
No answer again?

215
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,815
How are we doing on sales?

216
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,026
Now we just have to receive
the down payments.

217
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,279
But it's not much. Perhaps we went
a bit too low with the prices.

218
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,949
Try to secure those payments first
at least. I'll handle the rest.

219
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,410
And that part-timer
you were talking about.

220
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,330
I mean, the one
that tipped you off at Best Fairs.

221
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,999
Find out if she's still working there.

222
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:12,917
Why?

223
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,921
Try to do a little thinking
before you ask.

224
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,756
Can't you use your head?

225
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,383
I'm sorry, sir.

226
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,260
(mutters) Darn.

227
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,596
Get out of here.

228
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,516
(mutters) Darn it.

229
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,852
(ringing tone)

230
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,896
(sentimental music playing in background)

231
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,981
(cell phone buzzing intermittently)

232
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,199
SHINWOO FAIR CEO SHIN

233
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,242
(sighs)

234
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,036
(groans)

235
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,294

237
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,633
(Jun groans)

238
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,847
-The person you are trying to reach…
-Why isn't she picking up all day?

239
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,101
(groans)

240
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,276
Jeez.

241
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,172
(shouts) My goodness!

242
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,258
(sighs)

243
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,262
-Who are you? Are you a ghost?
-Yoon Jun.

244
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,223
You should have made a sound or something.
I thought you were a ghost.

245
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,643
Turn on the lights, will you?

246
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,230
(sighs)

247
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,030
(exhales in relief)

248
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,200
This is coffee. Do you not drink coffee
in the evening because it has caffeine?

249
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:14,204
You have to speak a little more politely.
I told you to watch your tone with me.

250
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,292
And you should have asked me
before buying these.

251
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,004
Goodness. I am sorry, teacher.
I'll do better next time.

252
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,089
(chuckles)

253
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,009
What? You are a teacher, Mother.

254
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,554
You act like a teacher to your son,
and you are a teacher at school.

255
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,014
JUN'S MOTHER:
Enough with the nonsense.

256
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,266
Here.

257
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,688
I registered for you.

258
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,941
You just need to download
the app on your phone

259
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,818
and enter the code that's in the manual.

260
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:50,407
They said you can have
up to ten blind dates, so start next week.

261
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,453
Gosh, you must have spent a lot of money.
Do they give refunds?

262
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,955
Because I'm already seeing someone.

263
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,250
Are you talking about that tomboy friend
who used to do archery?

264
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,046
I believe you already used
that excuse two years ago.

265
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,010
No. I broke up with her a long time ago.
It's someone else.

266
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,428
What does she do?

267
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,390
Name, age, and job.
Give it to me in one breath.

268
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,808
(smacks lips)

269
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,310
Install the app.

270
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,438
She was born
in the year of the horse, age 33.

271
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,191
She's a bank teller,
and her name is Sim Haesung.

272
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,568
She's older than me.

273
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,322
Then bring her over one day.
Tell her I'd like to meet her.

274
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,786
If you're lying this time too,
your father says you should move back in.

275
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,829
Do you understand?

276
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,793
Cheers!

277
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,129
(squeals)

278
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,882
What's up with the beer here?
Did they put honey in it?

279
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,300
It's so sweet.

280
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,803
Take it easy. You'll get drunk.

281
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,267
Suho, you don't like women when
they're drunk? Should I stop drinking?

282
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,019
It's not that I don't like drunk women.

283
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,979
I don't want you to have a hard time.

284
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,274
You not only look nice,

285
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,110
but you talk so nicely too.
It's wonderful.

286
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,069
(chuckles)

287
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,905
Did you see him smile?

288
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:16,201
Seriously, doesn't he
just melt your heart?

289
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,828
(snickers)

290
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,414
Oh, yes. We all saw that.

291
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,915
-Now let's drink some, okay?
-NARAE: Cheers.

292
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,001
-JIHYUNG: Cheers.
-HAESUNG: I have to drink slowly.

293
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,753
JIHYUNG: Come on.
(snickers)

294
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,674
(refreshed exhale)

295
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,592
By the way,

296
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,095
I don't know
if I can ask something like this.

297
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,182
People who say stuff like that
always ask questions like this.

298
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,601
"Suho, what do you like about Haesung?"

299
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,227
(women laugh awkwardly)

300
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,855
If you ask him something like that…

301
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,025
I'd be very much happy to hear it.

302
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,401
I knew it.

303
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,654
Hmm…

304
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,870
JIHYUNG: If you can't answer right now,
things will get very awkward.

305
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,917
I just like her
because she's not too heavy.

306
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,543
Because she's light.

307
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,882
Are you saying you like her
because she's slender?

308
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,384
-I mean, she is really skinny.
-JIHYUNG: Right. She is.

309
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,302
(women giggle)

310
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,637
SUHO: That's not what I meant.

311
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,264
I mean I like her
because she's not serious.

312
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,939
That's right. I once was
known to be kind of easy.

313
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,856
(laughs awkwardly)

314
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,149
So you liked that?

315
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,068
Maybe?

316
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,196
SUHO: After all,

317
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,324
at first, she did come at me like someone
who was so desperate to date.

318
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,663
I usually liked women that were like cats,
but she's kind of like a puppy.

319
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,416
And we have a big age gap.
I've never dated an older woman before.

320
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,752
(laughs awkwardly)

321
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,339
W-Why are you so straightforward?
You're making it awkward for them.

322
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,299
(laughs awkwardly)

323
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,177
But…

324
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,850
she was the first woman to shatter
everything I look for in a woman.

325
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,017
(tender music playing)

326
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:08,605
Ms. Sim Haesung.
Your hands are as fine as your name.

327
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,901
I'd like to have your phone number,
and I wonder if you could give it to me.

328
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,489
(sighs)

329
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,243
HAESUNG: You can ask loan-related
questions by calling the office number.

330
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,327
That's the quickest way.

331
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,498
(paper sheets rustling)

332
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,375
(paper sheets flipping)

333
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,384
(exhales)

334
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,012
SUHO: She's scared out of her wits
on the inside

335
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,139
and she's always
conscious of other people.

336
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,391
And she thinks about a lot of things
but pretends not to…

337
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,395
Because I'm not ashamed about that at all.

338
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,022
It's not that she's shallow or easy.

339
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,942
She tries to act like that
to make people feel comfortable.

340
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,112
(music fades)

341
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,280
That's why I like her.

342
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,700
(tender music resumes)

343
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,916
(panting)

344
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,635
(plastic rustling)

345
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,514
(deep sigh)

346
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,768
(mutters) How many times do I have
to walk around the neighborhood?

347
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,657
(music fades out)

348
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,837
(footstep)

349
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:20,487
I took a chance to see if you'd show up,
but I didn't expect to actually see you.

350
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,991
It wasn't a normal breakup.

351
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,370
If you made an already lonely guy
even more lonely by cheating on him,

352
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,164
all the more reason
you shouldn't have dared to live here.

353
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,959
-Excuse me.
-When Dongjin found out you lived here,

354
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,005
he lived out of a motel.
Did you know that?

355
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,926
If you knew, then you're a real scumbag.

356
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,470
If you didn't know, you're even worse.

357
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,098
(sighs)

358
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,727
Whatever. Move out right away.

359
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,023
If you don't want to see me here
every day, pack up and move out.

360
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,610
I'm warning you. Don't take me lightly.

361
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,613
Because even I can't handle
my own craziness.

362
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,244
What's your name?

363
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,497
I'm Kang Minyoung.

364
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,419
I need to know your name
since I'll be seeing you every day.

365
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,756
-Are you kidding me right now?
-Then did you really think I'd say yes

366
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,342
to something a random
stranger tells me to do?

367
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,887
If I were that nice,
I wouldn't have cheated.

368
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,556
Sim Woojoo.

369
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,018
My name is Sim Woojoo.

370
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,854
Now you know, so move out.

371
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,440
Do you drink?

372
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,817
If you do, follow me.

373
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,406
(mellow music playing)

374
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,741
(sighs)

375
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,753
(mellow music builds)

376
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,650
SOOHEE: Ms. Sim Woojoo just called.

377
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,569
She'd like to use the leave she earned
from working overtime last week.

378
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,905
-Is it a sick leave?
-I didn't ask that.

379
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,158
And she's not the type
to answer that even if I asked.

380
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,661
Okay.

381
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,165
She sounded fine though.

382
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,979
PART-TIMER SIM WOOJOO

383
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,950
(fuel pump clicking)

384
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,619
(Sunwoo clicks tongue, grumbles)

385
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,079
(smacks lips)

386
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,089
Are they walking together, or not?

387
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,053
DARTS BAR

388
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,640
They were walking together.

389
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,394
But why are they together?

390
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,396
(stew burbling)

391
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,691
(knife scraping)

392
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,909
JIGU: You're here. Dinner will be ready
once the doenjang stew is done.

393
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,035
(smacks lips)

394
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,830
(snorts)

395
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,625
(pensive music playing)

396
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,141
JIGU: I can totally just go to a sauna.

397
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,354
(smacks lips)

398
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,481
Come with me.

399
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,412
(smacks lips)

400
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,416
It's too much trouble,
so you don't need to prepare dinner.

401
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,044
No, I'm grateful for even staying here.
It's the least I can do.

402
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,170
Please eat.

403
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,510
Well…

404
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,221
I do have something to tell you
before you start eating.

405
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,682
Could you talk more casually to me?

406
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,893
I may not look it, but I was raised
among some tough older sisters,

407
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,770
so you can call me anything really.

408
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,065
Okay, I got it. Let's eat.

409
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,525
(exhales) Thank you.

410
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,985
Please eat up.

411
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,530
(slurping)

412
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,241
It's good.

413
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,325
(smirks)

414
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,413
JIGU: Wow.

415
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,749
So why were you staying at a motel
when you have such a nice place?

416
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,088
I was being nosy.

417
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:31,840
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,051
Thanks to you,
I found a reason to come home.

419
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,262
So, thank you.

420
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,558
(deep breath)

421
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,478
Maybe this is why Woojoo likes you.

422
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,066
You know, you just look
like you have a story,

423
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,611
and that makes me want
to look after you and stuff. (chuckles)

424
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,738
Do you want some beer?

425
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,239
No, I'm doing voice care right now.

426
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,086
-Have you talked with your sister?
-You didn't tell her I was here, did you?

427
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,047
No, I didn't.

428
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,340
Oh, thank goodness.

429
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,425
Of course, I didn't either.

430
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,553
If she found out I was here…

431
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,056
Gosh, I don't even want to imagine that.

432
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,141
(scoffs)

433
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,604
Mmm.

434
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,190
(thuds)

435
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,400
(music playing in background)

436
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,280
(dart hits)

437
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,332
Would you like to try it?

438
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,711
Just tell me when you'll move out.
That's why I followed you here.

439
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,006
-You really are a nutjob.
-What did you say?

440
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,678
If you get a higher score than me--

441
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,638
-Move out.
-No, not that.

442
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,100
I'll ask Dongjin one last time.

443
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,563
If I ask him one more time
and he wants me gone, then I'll move out.

444
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,066
Let's settle it at that.

445
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,488
I won't be moving
just because you told me to.

446
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,578
Keep your promise.

447
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,291
(darts clattering)

448
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,046
I don't want to be cheap, so I'll do this.

449
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,341
I did archery until high school,

450
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,802
and I'm right-handed,
but I'll use my left to throw.

451
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,512
Just keep that in mind.

452
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,394
(thumps)

453
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,689
(darts hitting)

454
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,657
JIGU: I went camping just once
when I was little, with my father.

455
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,784
He passed away.

456
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,995
Anyway,

457
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,998
my father was kind of good at singing.

458
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,502
When he played his guitar and started
singing, people started to gather around.

459
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:21,634
When his song was over,
people started applauding him.

460
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,804
(grunts) That applause…

461
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,600
It was only five or six people,
but the sound of their applause

462
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,479
(exhales) made me feel really good.

463
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,438
(hisses)

464
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:37,484
"I want to hear that again.
I want to hear it again…"

465
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,781
And that's what drove me
to want to become a singer.

466
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,616
(clicks tongue)

467
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,701
Why do you like camping?

468
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,204
It's nothing extraordinary.

469
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,748
But I'd still like to hear it.

470
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,875
It's just…

471
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,836
Camping was something that I got to do

472
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,756
with an adult for the first time.

473
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,385
And I just happened to
really like that day.

474
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,181
Mm…

475
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,850
That's very touching.

476
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,436
I can feel a deeper story.

477
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,480

DAEHONG (on phone): Hello?

487
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:20,920
DONGJIN: It's me.

488
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,506
Have you eaten yet?

489
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,258
DAEHONG: How about you?

490
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,385
Stop eating stuff like ramyeon.

491
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,429
I had proper food.

492
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,638
DAEHONG: That's good.

493
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,808
I'm sorry I don't call often enough.

494
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,312
I heard things are tough right now.

495
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,982
I figured you'd call
once things got a little better.

496
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,692
Are you better?

497
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,362
A little.

498
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,532
(song continues playing)

499
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,744
I wonder who revived you.

500
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,288
WOOJOO: You won't go down.

501
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,832
I can tell you won't go down
no matter what.

502
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,959
I know for sure.

503
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,090
I'll come over soon, to camp out.

504
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,638
You're welcome to come alone,
and even better if you bring someone.

505
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,015
DAEHONG: I'll be waiting for you.

506
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,433
Good night.

507
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,691
(male vocals begin singing)

508
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,622
(panting)

509
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,921
(Minyoung's labored breathing)

510
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,925
WOOJOO: I should just leave you here
and let you freeze to death.

511
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,970
(song subdues)

512
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,054
(sighs)

513
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,348
What's your door lock code?

514
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,268
Hey, what's your door lock code?

515
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,396
The door lock code.

516
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,111
(sighs)

517
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,617
(plastic rustling)

518
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,702

519
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,081

520
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,043
(gulping)

521
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,342
(guitar music continues)

522
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,422

I didn't say anything.

527
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,774
Right.

528
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,067
You didn't.

529
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,111
(Jun sighs)

530
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,823
(Jun clears throat)

531
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,911
You seemed like you were having fun
outside the house.

532
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,370
What?

533
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,998
Oh, that…

534
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,001
(exhales) So you saw.

535
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,588
Thanks for not saying anything then.

536
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,382
It was nothing.

537
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:54,717
HAESUNG: Hmm.

538
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,806
You sure look so happy when you eat.

539
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,559
It's not so easy to eat bibimbap
and look so classy at the same time.

540
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:11,734
I'm just saying you look good.
Really. It's a compliment.

541
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,238
You must have a difficult favor to ask,
judging by your flattering.

542
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,158
If I told you, would you do it?

543
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,453
Let's hear it first.

544
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,207
-(Haesung laughing)
-(comical music playing)

545
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,922
What's so funny?

546
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:38,052
I mean, how did my name
pop up at that moment?

547
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,263
Do you really have
no other women around you?

548
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,016
Gosh, you really live
a boring life for your looks.

549
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,351
I'm just living a simple life.

550
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,436
Will you do it or not?

551
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,855
What am I, an actress?

552
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,775
I can't do that.
It makes me sick just thinking about it.

553
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,862
Just go and have some blind dates.

554
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,488
That's the best option.

555
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,240
It's not because I don't want blind dates.

556
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,701
I'm just afraid that
one of them would want to marry me.

557
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,871
I'm against marriage.
I don't want to marry anybody.

558
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,164
(clicks tongue)

559
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,249
Don't ask too much into it though.

560
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,250
(smacks lips)

561
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,878
It's not something so lighthearted
as to discuss in broad daylight.

562
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:17,216
I also… have some things that
I'd like to keep buried in here.

563
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,677
I see. Your acting has gotten better.

564
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,636
Just forget it.

565
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,558
Where are you going? Do the dishes.

566
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,143
(groans) Come on.

567
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,520
I'm just going to eat and then leave.

568
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,356
You take care of the rest.

569
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,027
(Jun sighs)

570
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,197
Haesung.

571
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,159
Do you need any vitamins?
You can grab anything from the store.

572
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,952
Just do the dishes.

573
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,787
(loudly) You don't have to tell me.
I'll just do it.

574
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,624
That's the way I am.
It'll be done even before you ask.

575
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,168
-Don't worry.
-How impressive.

576
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,671
JUN: Goodness.

577
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,548
(faucet water running)

578
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,093
Right. I forgot to tell you.
Woojoo didn't come home last night.

579
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,386
Isn't that crazy?

580
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,347
-(faucet stops)
-What's crazy? I didn't hear you.

581
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,515
Woojoo stayed out last night.

582
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,645
That girl must finally be dating someone.

583
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,894
(groaning)

584
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:55,898
(sighs)

585
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,826
(gulping)

586
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,785
(sighs)

587
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,247
We were both out of our minds.

588
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,429
(can rolling)

589
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,932
(mellow music playing)

590
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,976
(door shuts)

591
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,729
(security system bleeping)

592
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,863
(groans)

593
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,493
(distant rustling)

594
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,833
(distant rustling)

595
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,794
(intercom bleeps)

596
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,171
(rustling on speaker)

597
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,848
(cans clattering)

598
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,023
(inaudible chatter)

599
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,290
ELEVATOR VOICE: First floor.

600
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,096
(music fades out)

601
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,347
Hurry up and get off.

602
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,939
(tender song playing)

603
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,035
(female vocals singing)

604
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,750
So…

605
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,044
where did you sleep?

606
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,131
(snorts)

607
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,094
Ms. Sim.

608
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,012
At Ms. Kang Minyoung's place.

609
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,225
I drank so much that I couldn't go home.

610
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,605
Why did you come back? I saw you
leaving before coming downstairs.

611
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,449
Wait here. I'm going to get
my cell phone and come back.

612
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,704
Don't go anywhere.

613
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,914
Then…

614
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,502
can I explain things
after having something to eat?

615
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,546
My stomach is killing me.

616
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,012
(chewing)

617
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,765
(munching)

618
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,728
(spoon clinking lightly)

619
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,816
Don't be nervous. Just eat.

620
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,278
I won't ask anything while you're eating.

621
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,698
Who says I'm nervous…

622
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,991
(slurping)

623
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,659
So eat.

624
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,290
(slurping)

625
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,128
(sighs)

626
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,425
(Woojoo munching)

627
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,564
(slurping)

628
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,201
(gulping)

629
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,378
(sighs)

630
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,421
She's so nice it's annoying.

631
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,142
Let's go grab some coffee.

632
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,612
We have to hurry if we want
to have coffee before work. Come on.

633
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,875
(Dongjin slurping)

634
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,714
(song ends)

635
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,052
I didn't run into her by chance.
I was waiting for her.

636
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,224
I happened to find out
that she lived across from you.

637
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,894
You're living out of a motel,

638
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,939
and she's sleeping comfortably
at her place. That pissed me off.

639
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,360
So I told her to move out right away.
And that I'd come every day if she didn't.

640
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,699
Why would you do that?

641
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,078
Because I can.

642
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,251
I don't know about anything else,
but that's something I can do for you.

643
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,047
(mellow music playing)

644
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:05,017
I just wish you could live
comfortably in your own place.

645
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:14,860
By the way, when will the company be okay?

646
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,945
I have something to say then.

647
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,114
Tell me now.

648
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,117
I can't tell you now.

649
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,662
That's what I decided.

650
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:35,047
Then, that camping something or whatever,
when is that happening?

651
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,258
The camping fair.

652
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,973
I know that. I knew it already, but just
couldn't recall it for some reason.

653
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,977
(chuckles)

654
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,946
(slurping)

655
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,500
(mellow music continues)

656
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,583
TAERANG BUILDING

657
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,084
(music fades out)

658
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,008
You can go in first.

659
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,813
(heavy footsteps)

660
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,202
I'll explain everything.

661
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,331
Where did you sleep last night?

662
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,293
I swear to you, it's not what you think.

663
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,920
I just ran into him this morning.

664
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,509
Forget it, then.
I have nothing to say to you.

665
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,178
Talk to me! Just tell me.

666
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,389
Hey, would you even listen
when I say anything to you?

667
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,060
If you did, I wouldn't have closed
the pharmacy and be here at this hour.

668
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,814
(shouts) Stop! Just leave him alone!

669
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,195
(groans)

670
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:07,157
Hey, do you even understand
what you're saying right now?

671
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,870
(sighs)

672
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,914
(gloomy music playing)

673
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,207
(sighs)

674
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,667
You do.

675
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,546
I'm going to end everything.

676
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,521
Hey, Woojoo. I think
I've underestimated you all this time.

677
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,024
You weren't just a nutjob.
You're a lunatic.

678
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,278
(sighs in frustration)

679
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,367
(groans)

680
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,040
(drawer handles clacking)

681
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,710
Darn it…

682
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,295
(drawer thumps)

683
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,174
(rustling)

684
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,635
SPA MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT

685
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,554
Oh, come on…

686
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,598
(sighs)

687
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,605
(groans) Where did she hide it? Darn it!

688
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,522
(doors slam)

689
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,318
(mutters) Jeez.

690
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,031
(contents clattering)

691
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,407
Not here either, darn.

692
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,743
HEEJA: Baby! Get me a towel!

693
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,827
(stammers)

694
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,537
HEEJA: Never mind. I found one here.

695
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,705
(sighs in relief)

696
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,249
(doors shut)

697
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,250
(mutters) Darn it…

698
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,293
(objects clacking)

699
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,210
Coffee…

700
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,545
(refreshed exhale) That felt nice.

701
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,588
(patting)

702
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,013
Did you go through my things?

703
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,265
NAMIL: Uh, that was just…

704
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,225
You know that gold watch I have?

705
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,270
You know, the one
you bought me for my last birthday.

706
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,147
I just can't seem to find it anywhere.

707
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,609
How many times do I have to tell you
it's inside the closet drawer?

708
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,152
Is that right? Okay.

709
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,655
You asked me that last time too.

710
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,741
(chuckles) My memory blinks on and off.

711
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,409
-Huh?
-NAMIL: It's like a traffic light.

712
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,370
(both laughing)

713
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,456
(Heeja continues laughing)

714
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,092
Baby, you know the written will, right?

715
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,593
(stops laughing)
Huh?

716
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,053
What did you say, baby?

717
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:37,808
You know that will your late husband
left you. Where did you put it?

718
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,019
(sighs)

719
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,064
I thought we weren't going
to talk about that again.

720
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,108
I'm just worried. That's all.

721
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,236
You said that your late husband's daughter
came by the house and caused a scene.

722
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,445
I burned it.

723
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,072
What? You really burned it?

724
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,866
(chuckling wryly) Of course not.

725
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,619
Anyway, it's as good as gone.

726
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,705
You said I'd need it one day.

727
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:04,251
So I hid it in a place no one could find,
so don't worry about it.

728
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,378
(laughing in glee)

729
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,297
(grumbles) I missed an important scene
because of you!

730
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,800
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry.

731
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,844
(exclaims, laughing)

732
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:14,803
(Namil laughs along)

733
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,977
(gulping)

734
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,608
(refreshed exhale)

735
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,990
(soft contemplative music playing)

736
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,337
(knocking on door)

737
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,048
SOOHEE: Sir.

738
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,382
DONGJIN: Yes.

739
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,242
Hey, do you even understand
what you're saying right now?

740
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,746
JUN: You weren't just a nutjob.
You're a lunatic.

741
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,667
SOOHEE: There's a higher preference
for car camping.

742
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,879
So a lot of the new releases
are car camping tents.

743
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:31,797
Okay.

744
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,716
So I was thinking about
grouping these types of products

745
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,176
and setting up a special booth.

746
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,135
SUNWOO: Sounds good.

747
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,804
What about the cars?

748
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,682
KANG: With what we have plus
if our partner companies help out,

749
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,809
I think it'd be possible.

750
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,354
If not, I can just tell
my employees to go get some.

751
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,107
Ooh, talking like a real boss.

752
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,400
I learned from the best.

753
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,069
(laughing)

754
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,904
You know I've changed
your name on my phone.

755
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,198
From "Kang" to "Lifesaver."

756
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,908
(chuckles awkwardly)

757
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,120
I'm also looking into it,
so you don't have to overdo it.

758
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,830
KANG: It won't be for free.

759
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,375
I expect you to give me
a nice booth location.

760
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:09,960
We'll see.

761
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,587
Gosh, I'm this close to getting hurt.

762
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,464
(laughing)

763
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,632
(knocking on door)

764
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,221
Finally, we get to see the booth map.

765
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,347
(sighs)

766
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,810
If you don't have anything
else for me, I'll go home.

767
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,311
Good work.

768
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,464
(button clicks)

769
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,010
SUNWOO: It is concerning
that the caravan zone

770
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,470
is a bit far from the main entrance.

771
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,722
(clicks tongue)

772
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,265
Honestly, this would mean…

773
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,188
SOOHEE: I'm concerned that visitors
would come through the entrance

774
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,315
-and not stop by the other booths…
-(elevator dings)

775
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,530
SUNWOO: The camping zone.

776
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,826
Twice a day, for three days. It can
make you a bit drowsy after taking it.

777
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,912
-WOMAN: I understand.
-Okay.

778
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,706
(bag rustling)

779
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,084
JUN: Okay, thank you. Have a good day.

780
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,628
WOMAN: Have a nice day.

781
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:43,720
JUN PHARMACY

782
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,765
(door chime jingling)

783
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:48,892
(Woojoo grunts)

784
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:49,809
(glass thumps)

785
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,897
(pouring)

786
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,983
(Jun grunts)

787
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,126

788
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,382

790
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,515
(kettle thuds)

791
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,600
(teaspoon clinking)

792
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,233
(snapping fingers)

793
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,862
-Are you leaving?
-Mm-hmm.

794
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,324
So when did it start?

795
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,704
When did the spring breeze
of romance blow into your heart?

796
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,123
What spring breeze…

797
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,000
(chuckles)
"Who are you talking about?"

798
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,210
You're not asking that, are you?

799
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,589
When did you start falling for Sim Woojoo?

800
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,676
I didn't fall for her.

801
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:05,760
Yes, you did.

802
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:06,886
No, I didn't.

803
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,347
(Sunwoo scoffs)

804
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,437
Stop pretending and think carefully.

805
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:20,066
Think about who has entered
that boring little life of yours.

806
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,572
(mellow music playing)

807
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,181
FRUIT WORLD

808
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,183
DONGJIN (on phone): There are peaches,
pears, and apples.

809
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,477
Dongjin.

810
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,187
Do they have bananas?

811
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,772
You see, I'm on a diet.

812
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,775
Okay, I'll get bananas then.
One bunch of bananas, please.

813
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,153
Thank you. Could I also borrow a razor?

814
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,614
I think there's a new one
in the drawer in the living room.

815
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,283
JIGU: All right. Have you had dinner?

816
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,826
Yes, I did.

817
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,579
JIGU: Okay, I also did as well.
I'll see you soon.

818
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,418
SUNWOO:
Stop pretending and think carefully.

819
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,172
Think about who has entered
that boring little life of yours.

820
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,925
(mellow music continues)

821
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,351
(music fades out)

822
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,604
(drawer scraping)

823
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,526
(fast scraping, clattering)

824
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,027
Nice.

825
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,113
Gosh.

826
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,240
(object clacking)

827
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,157
Huh?

828
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,411
(snickers)

829
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,080
Huh?

830
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,457
(hisses)

831
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,501
What?

832
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,254
(deep inhales)

833
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,588
(grunts) I know this lady…

834
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,312
ELEVATOR VOICE: First floor.

835
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,198
Please wait!

836
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,829
(cans clinking)

837
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,380
MINYOUNG: You don't like bananas.

838
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,011
I'm moving.

839
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,100
So don't go sleep at a motel
and just come home to your place.

840
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,312
You can just live there.

841
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,735
If it's because of me, you can stay.
It's your house.

842
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:17,660
I just wish you could live
comfortably in your own place.

843
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,164
(gentle music)

844
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,291
I'm saying…

845
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,131
I finally don't care what you do.

846
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,414
(Woojoo shuddering)

847
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,875
I told you. I'm going to end everything.

848
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,045
So give me some time.

849
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:15,093
If you just keep the secret,
I promise I won't make you worry.

850
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,515
(gulping)

851
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,060
(groans)

852
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,898
That secret has left my hands.

853
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,776
This afternoon…

854
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,820
(snorts)

855
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,238
…I called your mother in Tongyeong.

856
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:38,825
Did you, really?

857
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,952
Yes, I did.

858
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,204
So, you need to finish it.

859
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,455
(shouts) Yoon Jun, are you crazy?

860
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,748
Not as crazy as you.

861
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,795
That guy is the son of the woman
that you hate the most in this world.

862
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,755
(shouts) Please get a hold of yourself!

863
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,924
Did I say I'm hopelessly in love with him
or something?

864
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,760
Why are you going this far?
What have I done to make you do all this?

865
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:03,391
-Hey, do you really not know why?
-No! I really don't know.

866
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,771
You tell me. What am I feeling?

867
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,106
Hey, Woojoo.

868
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,190
WOOJOO: I was just…

869
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,776
(loudly) More than Jigu
who quit studying and ran away!

870
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,738
More than you who's acting
this crazy because of me!

871
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,407
More than Haesung who's dating
a boy much younger than her!

872
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,783
More than my sick mom!

873
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,453
I just worry about him a little bit more.

874
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:28,499
I just wish he could be
a little less lonely.

875
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,627
So what is this?

876
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,171
What is this feeling?

877
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,551
What is this
that freaks you out this much?

878
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,854
Goodness…

879
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,607
(song amplifies)

880
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,799
(song amplifies)

881
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:45,702
(sighs)

882
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,834
(somber outro music playing)
