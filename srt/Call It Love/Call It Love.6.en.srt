1
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,977
CALL IT LOVE

2
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,982
EPISODE 6

3
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,112
Think about it

4
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,449
tens of thousands more times,
not just hundreds.

5
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,328
The reason why you shouldn't
show up in front of me anymore.

6
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,931
You can stop now.

7
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,268
That's good enough.

8
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,553
I'm sorry, but let's
have dinner some other time.

9
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,429
Why?

10
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,058
You can't possibly bring yourself to eat?

11
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,647
Why do you keep making
that miserable face?

12
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,277
If it bothers you that I held your hand
in front of her, I'll go tell her now.

13
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,238
Do you want me to go up there and tell her

14
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,991
that there's nothing going on between us
and it was just me acting up?

15
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,580
Are we friends or something?

16
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,500
Stop throwing such a fit.

17
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,299
And please don't do
something like this again.

18
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,219
I don't like being misunderstood,
nor misunderstanding.

19
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,980
Did I hug you? Or did I kiss you?

20
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,482
It's no big deal.
Even school kids hold hands.

21
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,567
What misunderstanding?

22
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,861
You should seriously stop overreacting.

23
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,115
No, that's not what I'm saying.

24
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,454
It's just that I might misunderstand…

25
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,458
I might misunderstand you.

26
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,586
All right?

27
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,980
Let's go. To have dinner.

28
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,116
TAERANG BUILDING

29
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,792
Sunwoo.

30
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,587
I must really be a scumbag.

31
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,883
I told myself before I came back.

32
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,220
If he was already with someone,

33
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,681
I wouldn't go near Dongjin

34
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,642
or get seen by him.

35
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,104
But do you know what I first thought
when I actually saw him?

36
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,526
I wished that that woman would be
an even worse scumbag than I am.

37
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,115
Is it possible for someone
to be worse than you?

38
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,410
Stop rubbing it in.

39
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,120
Dongjin doesn't have a girlfriend.

40
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,915
That was probably
just an act to push you away.

41
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,718
I know that look.

42
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,739
When do you take that off?

43
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,450
Tomorrow.

44
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,496
What do you think
about suing her while you're at it?

45
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm saying you should
sue your ex-girlfriend.

46
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,380
Technically, it's because of her that
you drank excessively and fell down.

47
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,425
She looked like she was rich, so do it.

48
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,014
How are you able
to say things like that so casually?

49
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,564
Should I be crying, then?
That's even weirder.

50
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,198
If you're bored,
try going on some internet forums.

51
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,785
There are so many stories there
that are way worse than yours.

52
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,417
Are you trying to console me?

53
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,503
Who says I'm consoling you?

54
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,715
I was just sharing information.

55
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,553
Whenever I thought life was unfair

56
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,680
with all the bad things
happening in my life,

57
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,351
I would read other people's life stories
and find far worse cases than mine.

58
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,731
Strangely, that made me feel better
and I could continue living on.

59
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,656
That's how it was with me.
Just to let you know.

60
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,495
Here are your noodles.

61
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,799
Why aren't you going home, by the way?

62
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,847
My brother saw you go into a motel.

63
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,106
Don't tell me if you don't want to.
I'm not that curious anyway.

64
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,944
Thank you.

65
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,247
I really didn't want to eat alone tonight.

66
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,209
So thank you.

67
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,010
They make good kimchi pancakes here.
Do you want to try some?

68
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,972
Excuse me, an order
of kimchi pancakes, please.

69
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,140
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,676
I hate spring.

71
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,639
The flowers do all the work,
but the season takes all the credit.

72
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,557
The queen of seasons, my foot.

73
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,019
What about summer?

74
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,730
Of course,
I hate it because it's hot.

75
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,608
I hate fall because it's gloomy.

76
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,110
As for winter,
I really hate the cold.

77
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,576
I wish it would rather just snow a lot.

78
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,016
Jun, are you a child? You called me
just because you didn't want to eat alone?

79
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,394
Me? Once I clock out,

80
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,771
I'm going to go practice
with my band and then head home.

81
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,740
Jun, Defcon level three is in effect.

82
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,951
What are you talking about?

83
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,080
The nutjob is here. I have to go, bye.

84
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,084
I thought I may be wrong,
but it is in fact my brother, Sim Jigu.

85
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,253
Woojoo. You must be quite shocked.

86
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,423
Shoot.

87
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,092
I see. You were on a date.

88
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,261
So you must have already had dinner…

89
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,597
This is a family matter, so you go.

90
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,560
And you stop saying nonsense
and go change.

91
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,145
We'll talk at home.

92
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,273
Okay, then I'll get going.

93
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,901
No! Please don't go.
Please stay. Please stay. Please stay.

94
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,572
If you leave now, she'll beat me
or cuss me out to death. Please.

95
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,449
Sim Jigu.

96
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,784
No. Let's talk while he's still here.
I'm scared!

97
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,911
Don't be absurd.
I know you're not scared of me.

98
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,080
You wouldn't be out here doing this
if you were scared!

99
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,248
What about your cram school?

100
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,667
Woojoo. Please calm down first,
and let's just talk, okay?

101
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,711
That's right. Just talk to him.

102
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,172
I am talking to him. Please step aside.

103
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,469
All right, I might as well just come clean
with everything while we're at it.

104
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,808
I quit the civil service exam.

105
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,024
I'm really grateful and feel bad
that you've supported me all this time.

106
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,194
But I can't give up on my dreams
just because I feel thankful and guilty.

107
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,238
The world stays the same
even if you give it up.

108
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,408
Sign back up for cram school
and go to a study dorm.

109
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,285
Woojoo!

110
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,162
I want to pursue music!

111
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,122
I want to sing!

112
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,207
Hey!

113
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,044
Please consider this
a life-saving measure and hold her tight!

114
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,295
I'll repay you one day!

115
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,536
Why did you take his side
when you don't even know him?

116
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,622
How could you be this oblivious to things?

117
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,750
He won't come home after running off
like that! And he has no money.

118
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,628
I didn't think it through. I'm sorry.

119
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,589
Why are you sorry?
I'm just shooting my mouth off.

120
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,302
Let's split up here. I'm going home.

121
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,848
Okay, then.

122
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,184
See you tomorrow.

123
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,725
-Not reading is better.
-I think reading is better.

124
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,020
How is that better?
Ignoring me after reading? That's worse.

125
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,927
He didn't come home last night?

126
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,349
Why aren't you surprised?

127
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,395
Did you know everything about Jigu?
Did you know he quit studying?

128
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,523
Mm-hmm.

129
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,941
"Mm-hmm"?

130
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,446
So you also knew about him working
at the café and trying to be a singer?

131
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,159
Yeah.

132
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,705
And despite all this, you've been upset
with me since early this morning.

133
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,209
Hey, Yoon Jun. Start talking!

134
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,797
Do you tell me everything?

135
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,133
You have things you don't share with me.

136
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,225
No wonder you were at the top
of your class. You're really smart.

137
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,309
What do you mean?

138
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,021
You'd think you can get away with it
if you sound serious when you're caught,

139
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,023
but that's not going to happen.

140
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,567
You know where Jigu is now, right?

141
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,319
Think however you want.

142
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,033
Hey, where are you going? Where's Jigu?

143
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,710
Psst. Hey, Jun, Jun, Jun…

144
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,128
Yoon Jun. Psst!

145
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,087
Gosh.

146
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,171
Hey!

147
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,424
Hey!

148
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,342
Jun! Jun! Jun! Jun!

149
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,886
Jun!

150
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,764
Come here.

151
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,400
Gosh, I thought she'd catch on
and come after you.

152
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,484
How did you throw her off?

153
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,528
"Do you tell me everything?"

154
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,366
It was the best acting of my life.

155
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,204
Seriously, you are wasting your talents
by being just a pharmacist.

156
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,126
I just grabbed a few things.
You won't last long away from home.

157
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,129
Just spend a few nights out to save face
and come back home.

158
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,300
Jun, I'm serious
for the first time in 26 years.

159
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,261
It's not just a phase I'm going through.
How should I put it…

160
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,889
It's like I'm creating
a big turning point in my life?

161
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,351
It may begin with me
embarrassingly running away,

162
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,020
but I'm going to get her permission
and live on my own.

163
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,897
I get all that.

164
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,692
But don't let your guard down.
You have more than one older sister.

165
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,112
I know that, but I don't think
Haesung will be a problem.

166
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,074
Her interests are solely somewhere else.

167
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,867
She doesn't care about me.

168
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,703
That's true.

169
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,130
Suho, you like your coffee sweet,
don't you? I like mine sweet too.

170
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,007
Coffee has to be sweet
after all, doesn't--

171
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,175
I don't like it sweet.

172
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,427
This is for the chief.

173
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,930
Oh, I see.

174
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,724
Then what kind of coffee do you like?

175
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,227
Ms. Sim.

176
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,480
That day was my first day working here.

177
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,401
Which day are you talking about?

178
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,070
You know…

179
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,447
When you had your hair pulled out.

180
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,116
I saw it all.

181
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,371
I'm just saying.
I thought you might not know.

182
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,665
Right, I didn't know.

183
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,880
But if that was a test to see my reaction,
I think you'll be disappointed.

184
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,885
Because I'm not ashamed about that at all.

185
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,306
Things sometimes
go wrong in a relationship.

186
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,476
If you shrivel up from embarrassment
every time that happens,

187
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,519
how can you love anyone?

188
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,149
I want to brush it off, forget about it,

189
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,651
and start fresh.

190
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,872
Would you like this coffee?

191
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,208
You're really giving that to me?

192
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,215
It's still warm.

193
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,176
No, it's not.

194
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,344
It's piping hot.

195
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,392
Coffee has to taste sweet after all.

196
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,353
And it's extra sweet today.

197
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,647
Ugh, why am I jealous of Haesung?

198
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,733
That brat is impressive.

199
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,486
She did find another romance, after all.

200
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,579
Please set up another guardrail, then.

201
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,663
Yes, I will.

202
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,084
And please look over this
while you're at it.

203
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,557
Soohee. It's been a while.

204
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,142
What's this?

205
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,229
You're not even going to say hi
to your old boss?

206
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,065
Do you have an appointment?

207
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,400
He'll show up to work, won't he?

208
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,403
If I wait in there,
I'm sure he'll show up.

209
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,578
BUSINESS TEAM
SIM WOOJOO

210
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,759
Let's see.

211
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,636
BAEK SOOHEE

212
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,527
The CEO will be here soon.

213
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,903
Okay.

214
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,615
By the way,
what's with the hospitality here?

215
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,452
I mean, shouldn't you be
bringing out some coffee at least?

216
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,122
Please wait.

217
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,124
And there's something
I've been curious about.

218
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,793
Who did you follow out here
to this company?

219
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,588
Was it your middle school friend,
Choi Sunwoo?

220
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,256
Or the venerable Han Dongjin?

221
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,216
You're wrong on both counts.

222
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,554
I didn't follow anyone out.
I ran away from someone.

223
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,222
I see.

224
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,103
You can go back to work, Ms. Baek.

225
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,857
Long time no see.

226
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,281
People don't change,
and I knew you would show up one day.

227
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,241
I just didn't think it'd be today.

228
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,577
This is why you're below me.

229
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,579
I heard you fired Cha Youngmin.

230
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,790
Then you should have guessed
I would come see you today.

231
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,168
What's this?

232
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,128
Are you scared or something?

233
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,255
Huh?

234
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,841
Because that would make me so happy.

235
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:27,267
Back then, I was sitting there,
and you were over here. Right?

236
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,825
2022 OUTDOOR CAMPING FAIR

237
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,538
Come on, you idiots.

238
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,457
Was this the big picture
you guys had in mind?

239
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,210
To cripple this company
by taking a bunch of employees?

240
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,670
We didn't say anything,

241
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,672
and we're not taking
all the employees who quit--

242
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,340
I don't care about you.

243
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,050
Dongjin. You stay with the company.

244
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,343
Sir!

245
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,762
You leaving me
doesn't cause much impact!

246
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,597
Dongjin.

247
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,768
I'll give you whatever promotion
and salary you want.

248
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,812
Let's stick together until the end.

249
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,487
-Let's go, Sunwoo.
-Huh?

250
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,159
We'll leave the company as planned.

251
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,666
Are you sure you won't regret this?

252
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,251
No, I'm not sure.

253
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:35,919
But I'll just…

254
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,213
let myself regret it.

255
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,135
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,138
-Let's go, Sunwoo.
-Okay.

257
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,519
Hey!

258
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,981
I may not be able to help you succeed,
but I still have the strength to ruin you!

259
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,817
You'll see! I'm going to crush you!

260
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,993
What? You're not surprised.

261
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,329
Man, what a bummer.

262
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,499
I even had an early breakfast
to show you that, you know?

263
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,501
Hey.

264
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,422
Stop trying to look tough
and just beg for mercy.

265
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,467
Then I'll go easy on you.

266
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,930
If this could have been resolved by me
begging, I'd have begged you already.

267
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,225
I'd get on my knees if you told me to.

268
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,562
You said it all the time.

269
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,106
Hesitate for three seconds,
and it's already too late.

270
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,778
Start your business when you can kneel
with just one second to think.

271
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:44,946
I remember that.

272
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,699
Hmm.

273
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,326
It must be today.

274
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,037
The day you kneel.

275
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,540
I know what's going on.

276
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,460
I know why you're going this far.

277
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,338
What are you saying?

278
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,841
It's not because your employee left
and started a new company.

279
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,055
I know that there's a different,
real reason behind it.

280
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,934
-Hello.
-Welcome.

281
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,227
A table for four.

282
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,397
Of course. One moment,
let me clear the table.

283
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,314
Okay.

284
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,442
This is supposed to be a big dinner
to commemorate our leaving the company,

285
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,527
but this seems too casual.

286
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,238
This place is really famous.
Team Leader Han…

287
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,866
Our CEO Han and I used to be regulars.

288
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,203
Was CEO Han a workaholic
back when he was a team leader too?

289
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,497
He supposedly works even on weekends.

290
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,082
He doesn't have a life outside of work.

291
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,375
Back then and even now,

292
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,378
-he's just good at his job.
-Is that right?

293
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,923
-Please, sit.
-Thank you.

294
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,057
We walked out
before we even placed our orders.

295
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:55,934
I'll be right there.

296
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,811
But still…

297
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,856
Him seeing you and me together
won't help anything.

298
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,107
That's true.

299
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,152
Please call me if something happens.

300
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,198
That's enough, sir.

301
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,494
You can't even drink that much.

302
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,746
Your empty words
don't mean anything.

303
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,916
You're the reason
I'm drinking myself to death here.

304
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,461
Let me take you home.

305
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,047
Quit trying to be the nice guy already.

306
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,341
I won't fall for it again.

307
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,093
Damn it.

308
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,306
I'm sorry, sir.

309
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,732
Dongjin, please help me out then.

310
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,774
Please get up.

311
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,235
Help me out for just six months.
Then I won't try to stop you.

312
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,948
Working alone with new hires
is just too difficult for me. Please?

313
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,327
Dongjin, I know! I really do!
I've been bad.

314
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,456
I was hard on you guys
and kept taking everything out on you.

315
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,001
But you know,
I've lived this way for 50 years.

316
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,711
How could I change overnight?

317
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,881
I don't even know how.

318
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,764
-Please get up.
-If I get up, will you help me?

319
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,933
Dongjin.

320
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,476
I'm begging you, please.

321
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,269
Please, I'm begging you.

322
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,438
You and I go way back.

323
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,607
Dongjin…

324
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,484
That day…

325
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,985
Dongjin, please…

326
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,362
WIFE

327
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,656
I heard that your wife collapsed.

328
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,160
It's understandable.

329
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,872
When a man suffers so much
and things are hard,

330
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,124
he can blame others

331
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,086
and lash out.

332
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,048
That's why I just let you
take it out on me a few times.

333
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,342
Because I felt so bad

334
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,886
and sorry for you.

335
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,516
But what happened to your wife

336
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,229
is not my fault.

337
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,116
Then whose fault is it?

338
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,160
If it weren't for you, I'd have picked up
the phone and called 119.

339
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,329
Then she wouldn't have had
to lie there so alone.

340
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,540
And you're saying
that this isn't your fault!

341
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,716
Your existence itself
is harmful and wrong!

342
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:39,097
What? You can't say anything
because what I'm saying is true, right?

343
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,016
There's no need to respond to such crap!

344
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,685
What? Crap?

345
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,437
You want to have a go?

346
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,023
Wasn't that your intention all along
when you got back at us?

347
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,900
I'm holding myself back from
cussing you out. Don't get all dramatic.

348
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,362
-Stop it.
-Stop what? I'm just now getting started.

349
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,948
CEO Shin. I mean, Mr. Shin Sungman.

350
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,327
Do you know when I decided
to quit working for you?

351
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,456
When you advised me
to work imagining my future.

352
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,874
I quit because I was so horrified

353
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,043
that my future would be to turn into you!

354
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,794
I said stop it.

355
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,754
I'm done.

356
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,090
You really need to manage
that look of helplessness.

357
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,843
This man is not going to even flinch
over hearing something like this.

358
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,303
Yeah, sure. Okay, all right!

359
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,972
Now you make me feel okay
saying what I've prepared.

360
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,307
You haven't left yet?

361
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,642
Yes, just a second.

362
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,269
Hey, Youngmin.

363
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,313
We're definitely going to do
the camping fair.

364
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,732
Internet, radio, electronic billboards,
and local newspapers.

365
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,151
Put up advertisements on everything!

366
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,570
The investment funds have come in!

367
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,073
So get this show on the road
starting today!

368
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,496
Go ahead!

369
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,289
We're not scared!

370
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,806
He's just sitting there
doing nothing again.

371
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,069
What do you want for dinner?

372
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,781
Beef brisket?
Or a full-course tuna sushi meal?

373
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,284
Sorry?

374
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,956
I know. I totally understand
you guys are feeling bewildered.

375
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,167
That's not it. We all have separate plans.

376
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,377
I know that too.

377
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,462
Then just let me know
where you're gathering.

378
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,131
I'll go there and just pick up the check.

379
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,928
I understand that you guys want to gather

380
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,598
to discuss what happened today
and talk trash about your boss.

381
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,184
Things are such a mess at the company

382
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,353
but there isn't much we can do
for you guys right now.

383
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,482
So can't you just play along with the boss
who wants to buy you drinks in the least?

384
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,484
Sir.

385
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,362
Can we just drink by ourselves?

386
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,825
We just… want to do that today.

387
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:11,040
Okay. I'm sorry.
I should just give you my credit card.

388
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,709
So…

389
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,671
Drink as much as you guys want,
and bill me for the cab fare.

390
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,006
Here.

391
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,842
Okay?

392
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,848
Sure.

393
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,353
I'm sorry, sir.

394
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,022
No, don't worry about it.

395
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,777
We'll see you tomorrow.

396
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,909
Sim Jigu quit.

397
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,955
Oh, right. If you see him,
please tell him to return his uniform.

398
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,814
The number you have
dialed is unavailable at the present.

399
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,783
PLAY PC

400
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,243
Have you checked
the karaoke spots?

401
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,746
Do you really think he'd be here?

402
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,248
If he's found here,
he'll be punished more.

403
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,751
How are you not worried
when your brother ran away from home?

404
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,425
What do I have to worry about exactly?

405
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,930
That he quit studying for the exam?
Or that he's getting back into singing?

406
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,349
-Of course, it's both.
-So what?

407
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,685
If you plant that boy back at his desk
when he just wants to sing,

408
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,812
would that make you feel better?

409
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,777
Just let him be.
Let him try whatever he wants to try.

410
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,990
His dad used to sing.
So maybe he took after him.

411
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:31,908
His dad?

412
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,867
Yes.

413
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,870
-Your dad.
-I don't have a dad.

414
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,997
All the more reason
for you to not crush his dreams.

415
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,208
That's your problem.

416
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,669
It's not Jigu's problem, but yours.

417
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,754
It's quicker for you to just give up.

418
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,217
And stop trying to control him.

419
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,012
"I supported you. You must do what I say."
This is what you're saying.

420
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,356
I guess being mean with words
is what I learned from you.

421
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,068
Why can't I say
those things to him?

422
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,862
I packed his lunch over a thousand times.

423
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,031
Give me the phone.

424
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,284
Give it back while I ask nicely.

425
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,996
I'll only count to three.

426
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,372
One,

427
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,416
two,

428
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,042
three.

429
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,798
Where are you going?

430
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,010
Aren't you going to look for your brother?

431
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,109
We should
mentally prepare ourselves.

432
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,195
It seems like they're planning
to leave the company all at once.

433
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,367
What if we actually
go out of business from this?

434
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,166
Why aren't you talking?

435
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,796
Silence doesn't suit you.

436
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,008
Do you always keep your mouth shut
because you think silence suits you?

437
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,371
I used to be pretty good
at running when I was a kid.

438
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,042
I used to win first place in county races.

439
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,337
This was possible because
it was a small countryside.

440
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,548
But the gym teacher told me…

441
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,594
to try out for the provincial competition.

442
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:25,433
He said I'd receive a scholarship
just for trying even if I didn't win.

443
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,644
But…

444
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,147
I didn't participate.

445
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,526
How much was the scholarship?

446
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,653
It was 300,000 won.

447
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,156
That's a good amount.

448
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,831
All the kids in the provincial competition
were members of track teams.

449
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,791
SHINHONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

450
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:55,504
The slowest kid of all of them
was three seconds faster than me.

451
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,177
That meant that
no matter how much I tried,

452
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,139
I'd have had to run
the track alone for three seconds.

453
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,391
Just thinking about that

454
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,602
made me lose it
even a month before the event.

455
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,188
My stomach hurt.

456
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,857
And so did my head.

457
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,782
So I gave up.

458
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,910
Because of those three seconds.

459
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,506
From birth,

460
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,551
I've always been weak-willed.

461
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,642
But you won't go down.

462
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,358
You know how sometimes you can tell a lot
about someone just by the way they walk?

463
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,611
I can tell you won't go down
no matter what.

464
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,239
I know for sure.

465
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,304
Ms. Sim.

466
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,646
But you won't go down.

467
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,318
I can tell you won't go down
no matter what.

468
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,236
I know for sure.

469
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,164
It's just that I might misunderstand…

470
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,335
I might misunderstand you.

471
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,380
All right?

472
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,433
Snap out of it, Woojoo.

473
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,353
Unless you have truly gone off the rails…

474
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,661
Thank you for everything.

475
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,205
I'll be off.

476
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,165
Thank you.

477
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,000
Take care.

478
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,419
Good work.

479
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,422
-Thanks! You'll do well.
-Goodbye.

480
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,299
Bye.

481
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,344
-Take care.
-Thanks for everything.

482
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,538
I'm really sorry that I'm leaving too.

483
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,981
Yes, this is Best Fairs.

484
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,150
Lunch delivery?

485
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,986
Yes, I'll be right down.

486
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,032
Where is she anyway?

487
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,498
JUN PHARMACY

488
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,042
Ma'am, that'll be 2,000 won.

489
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,877
I'm giving you
a 500-won employee discount.

490
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,173
How generous of you to give
a discount to a former employee.

491
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,549
View it as an advance payment.

492
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,468
You'll quit that job soon
and come back here.

493
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:53,928
What?

494
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,387
Why are you so surprised?

495
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,891
You said half of your entire company quit
and it's like a haunted house.

496
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,352
You said this would be
a good time for you to quit as well.

497
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,437
You said this the other day
after drinking.

498
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,855
I'll stop drinking.

499
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,483
When are you going to quit?

500
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,738
Woojoo?

501
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,281
Soon.

502
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,659
Three days? A week?

503
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,536
Stop rushing me.

504
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,622
It's not like I'll stay there forever,
I'll quit eventually.

505
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,916
I'll tell them when the time is right.

506
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,922
My background is in the Natural Sciences,
so I lack imagination.

507
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,675
But you're really fueling up
my imagination.

508
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,218
What do you mean?

509
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,304
Forget it if you don't understand.
I don't want to say it myself.

510
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,239
Lunch is here.

511
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,617
It's another lunch box?

512
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,370
I said I wanted to go out to eat today.

513
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,750
Tell Mr. Han to come and eat.

514
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,295
Mr. Han wasn't in his office.

515
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,382
He's probably crying alone somewhere.

516
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,510
I also cry alone like that these days.

517
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,211
I was just… washing my face.

518
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,672
It's not that…

519
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,425
Your button has come off.

520
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:14,526
I wish a bundle of cash
would just drop from the sky.

521
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,155
If we work well with the magazine company,

522
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,199
maybe we could proceed
without spending much money.

523
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,618
We're opening an advertising booth

524
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:26,580
at the camping festival
run by that magazine company.

525
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,333
So we do need some money.

526
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,545
Don't worry about the budget
and just focus on the plan.

527
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,381
Yes, sir.

528
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,931
CEO Shin probably has no idea
what we have up our sleeves.

529
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,641
Because I also didn't know

530
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:50,396
that Mr. Han Dongjin was
such a meticulous planner.

531
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,900
I mean, how long have you been
planning something like this?

532
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,443
Just eat your lunch.

533
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,155
A hands-on camping experience
at a festival.

534
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,115
Ha!

535
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:06,161
Let's prepare well
and leave a mark in the industry.

536
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,707
Ms. Baek, you can take
your time with the budget plans.

537
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,252
What? Why aren't you eating anymore?

538
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,796
Leave it, sir. We'll clean it up.

539
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,005
I've eaten plenty.

540
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,346
Hey, don't throw mine away,
I'm going to eat more after I come back.

541
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,648
You know…

542
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,237
Minyoung called.

543
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,615
Asking if we needed an investment.

544
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:51,039
Stop glaring like that. I told her no.

545
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,417
But

546
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,044
you could at least consider it, right?

547
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,343
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

548
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,308
Yesterday, I went through my mother's
jewelry box. I found one gold ring.

549
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,394
I wanted to even take that little thing.

550
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:24,156
I feel like we're standing
at the edge of a cliff.

551
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,265
UNCLE DAEHONG

552
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,562
Do you like it?

553
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,775
What if I do like it?

554
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,110
Do you want me to live with you?

555
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,029
Two men living together would be weird.

556
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,115
I bought this place
for when I got remarried,

557
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,076
but I don't have any woman to marry.

558
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,079
You can live here for a while.

559
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,374
I'm not just giving it to you.

560
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,334
I want someone living here
and taking care of it.

561
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,880
And like they say these days, I refuse
in advance to accept your refusal.

562
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,218
Something like this would be the only way
I'd get to see your face once in a while.

563
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,930
Please live here, for me.

564
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,439
The view is nice.

565
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,322
UNCLE DAEHONG

566
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,755
DONGJIN

567
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,591
Finally, you call me.

568
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,979
I'm sorry. I was parking.

569
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,732
I see. How are you?

570
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,609
Well, I'm doing okay.

571
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,153
But I heard that
you were not doing so well.

572
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,077
You can text me
your company account number.

573
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,707
I can't help you a lot,
but I'll send whatever I can.

574
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,003
And don't get all touched
because of this.

575
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,381
You helped me out
back when I was in trouble.

576
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,091
So I'm repaying you.

577
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,969
Thanks.

578
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,891
Next time, just buy me
some grilled beef at a barbeque place.

579
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,726
With all-you-can-drink soju and beer.

580
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,397
Thanks.

581
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,317
Do you remember
what you told me before?

582
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,697
If you can resolve an issue with money
and time, then it's not even a problem.

583
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,325
I said a lot of weird things.

584
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,077
Hang in there.

585
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,372
Thanks. Drive safely.

586
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,921
You won't go down.

587
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,216
I can tell you won't go down
no matter what.

588
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,593
I know for sure.

589
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,186
What?

590
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,356
I mean, I haven't heard from you.

591
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,734
So have you given it some thought?

592
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,112
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

593
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,001
Hey.

594
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,379
I'm not that old-fashioned.

595
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:12,509
Things can end between a couple.
What are you so embarrassed about?

596
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,264
Have you been well?

597
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,350
I've been good as usual.

598
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,186
This must have been fate.

599
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,939
I mean, we ran into each other
in that large department store.

600
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,735
I should have reached out to you…

601
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,612
I'm sorry.

602
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,241
Well… I didn't grab you
to get an apology from you.

603
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,288
Do you have some money?
Around 10 million won.

604
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,624
I can pay you back
as soon as the house is sold.

605
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,669
Let me borrow it for just two months.
I'll give it back to you right away.

606
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,550
What, don't you have any?

607
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:07,064
Obviously, I have to keep this
a secret from Dongjin, right?

608
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,570
BEST FAIRS

609
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,950
Go ahead and say what you want.

610
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,410
You're the one who stopped me.

611
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,746
I wanted to ask you something.

612
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,750
What makes you think I'll answer you?

613
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,589
"What's their relationship?
How far along are they?"

614
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,217
"How close are they?"

615
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,303
I want you to continue to be curious.

616
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,597
Because I have no intention of answering.

617
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,187
I live right across from Dongjin.

618
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,942
I moved back into my old place,
so don't misunderstand.

619
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,988
Why aren't you going home,
by the way?

620
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,953
I felt like it'd be unfair
if I didn't tell you.

621
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,497
I'm leaving.

622
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,844
Minyoung, you're pathetic.

623
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,203
Is it fun?

624
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,873
Hey, I asked you if it's fun.
I mean, you suck at it.

625
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,464
I'm not having any fun.

626
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,050
Maybe it's because there's no one
to hide from. This is boring.

627
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,134
What are you, a teenager?

628
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,638
Hey, my dream is to live like a teenager.

629
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:51,144
Running to get lunch, and then running
to play soccer after lunch, you know.

630
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,938
What an innocent child I was.

631
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,858
But right now,
my life just seems so gloomy.

632
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,320
Running to sit in the front row
at a popular lecture,

633
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,783
and then running to get the best seat
in the study hall after the class.

634
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,536
I just wanted to be happy on stage,
singing my songs.

635
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,705
And they're not letting me do it.

636
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,915
Yes!

637
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,878
So what? You're not going back home?

638
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,466
I'd go if they were looking for me.
But they're not.

639
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,051
You know?

640
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,471
I mean, no one is looking for me.

641
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,640
I don't know, man.

642
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,813
Having said that,
let me crash at your place.

643
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,398
-Hmm?
-Suho.

644
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,442
I'm having such a hard time. I can't sleep
another night in the public sauna.

645
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,944
-Seriously.
-Hello?

646
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,197
-Hey. You…
-Where are you right now?

647
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,700
This lying brat…

648
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,451
What a jerk.

649
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,370
What the…

650
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,163
Hmm…

651
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,581
Jajang or Jjamppong?

652
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,126
Jjamppong. I don't like jajangmyeon
because it's too sweet.

653
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,504
Me neither. I like jjamppong.

654
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,632
Uh, how about doenjang stew
or kimchi stew?

655
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,550
Kimchi stew.

656
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,261
I don't eat stuff that smells weird,
like soybean paste.

657
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,598
I don't even like the miso soup
they serve at sushi restaurants.

658
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,601
Okay, last one.

659
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,730
Fried chicken or pizza? One, two, three!

660
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,939
-Chicken…
-Pizza.

661
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,274
Huh?

662
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,737
-Really? Pizza?
-Yes, I'm allergic to chicken.

663
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,363
Gosh, that's crazy.

664
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,075
We have so much in common.

665
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:34,581
I just don't understand why they say
fried chicken is Korea's soul food.

666
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,670
That's so interesting. Let's try more
and see if there's anything else.

667
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,715
What else could we explore?

668
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,593
How about tripe?

669
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,802
I'd never get tired of that.

670
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,347
Me too.

671
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,890
-What?
-Huh?

672
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,894
I'm the one that likes tripe.

673
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,104
It's you, Jun.

674
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,236
Long time no see.
Are you heading home now?

675
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:12,577
Yes, how are you, Haesung?

676
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,747
Suho, this is my sister's friend.

677
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,209
-Hello.
-Yes.

678
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,046
Hmm…

679
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,298
Hang in there, young boy.

680
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,841
Good luck.

681
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,770
He likes to wish people good luck.

682
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,690
Good luck to you too!

683
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,818
Good luck!

684
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,194
Good luck.

685
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,112
Good luck!

686
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,655
Good luck!

687
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,740
Yeah!

688
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,773
Huh?

689
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:53,011
STAR BEER

690
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,201
GOLDEN COUNTRY REALTY

691
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,206
You're opening, right?

692
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,457
Yes.

693
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,293
There weren't any real estate
offices open, so I walked all over.

694
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,503
Are you looking for a house?

695
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,631
Not really. I just want to ask something.
Do you have coffee inside?

696
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,224
Darn it.

697
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,905
Yes, Aunt.

698
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,240
Why are you picking up so late?

699
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,408
-What's going on?
-You didn't know either, right?

700
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:58,993
Now that I think about it,

701
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,913
you would have done something
with that temper if you had known.

702
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,125
I'm going to work, so let's talk later--

703
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,045
Hey! Going to work
is not important right now.

704
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,049
That woman moved into the house
where you and your siblings used to live!

705
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,386
I found out that
she never put the house up for sale,

706
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,096
and now she's moved in
and is living there.

707
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,683
Can you even believe this?
We were the only fools who didn't know!

708
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,810
Everybody in the neighborhood
already knew apparently!

709
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,897
So ultimately she kicked out your
mom and even took over the master bedroom.

710
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,817
Gosh, that sly scumbag!

711
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,944
Hey, are you listening?

712
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,470
If you don't believe me,
come see for yourself.

713
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,081
Woojoo is late.
She's not the type to be late to work.

714
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,083
Has she called?

715
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:11,834
No.

716
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,644
This is Han Dongjin.

717
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,021
I don't know if you remember me.

718
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,526
This is Golden Country Realty.

719
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,778
Come over quickly.

720
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,491
That daughter you'd been looking for
is on her way here.

721
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,591
Darn it.

722
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:43,217
♪ Flowery breeze, flowery breeze ♪

723
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,596
♪ My life is like a flowery breeze ♪

724
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:48,848
Oh.

725
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:54,228
I'm coming. I'm coming.

726
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,190
Oh, who is it?

727
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:03,863
Open the door.

728
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:06,699
Open this door!

729
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,827
Open up! Open the door!

730
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,789
I said open this door!
