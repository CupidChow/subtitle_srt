1
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,977
CALL IT LOVE

2
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,814
EPISODE 5

3
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,336
I even let my girlfriend
cheat on me for a year.

4
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,433
Where's Dongjin right now?

5
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,310
He's out of the office.
That's why I'm asking…

6
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,110
Where could he have gone?
It's not like he has anywhere to go.

7
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,834
I moved back
to where I used to live.

8
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,087
I'll avoid you.

9
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,188
SUNWOO

10
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,041
I'll explain everything.
Just pick up the phone.

11
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,838
Sunwoo!

12
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,554
Hey, I was just about to call
you, and here you are, right on time.

13
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,035
Soju, please.

14
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,175
I'm going home.
I don't feel like drinking.

15
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,677
Hey,
how many times do I have to tell you?

16
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,512
A couple of sips
during a meal isn't drinking.

17
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,097
A drink with a meal is just

18
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,142
the one medicine
my pharmacy doesn't stock.

19
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,813
You can take that medicine
on your own.

20
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,273
Come on.

21
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,484
Who on earth drinks alone?

22
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,361
Why can't you?

23
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,529
Because it's bitter.

24
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,741
It's already bitter as it is,

25
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,952
but alone, it's unbearably so.

26
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,162
That tasted great.

27
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,414
Hey, I'll be at the noodle place.
Come quick.

28
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,083
Another drink?

29
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,002
We should all go!

30
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,672
-Who's leaving?
-What's up? What?

31
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,967
-Family needs to stick together.
-Hurry!

32
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,052
-Come on!
-You can leave later.

33
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,178
Who's driving?

34
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,222
That's why we need to go quick…

35
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,176
Sir, leave it. I'll clean it up.

36
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,013
I'm sorry.

37
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,027
When did you find out?

38
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,280
When did you…

39
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,450
find out where Minyoung lives?

40
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,579
You damn bastard.

41
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,793
When I keep quiet about something,
it's for a reason.

42
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,046
You just have to make me say these things.

43
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,300
A wedding invitation.

44
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,595
From the girl I dated for seven years.

45
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,810
From the girl that
I had in my arms just the day before.

46
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,692
I received a wedding invitation
from a girl like that.

47
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,446
Who would I tell this to?

48
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,660
No one would ever forget that, hmm?

49
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,880
My life is…

50
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,512
…really pathetic.

51
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,528
Are you crazy?

52
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,245
You scared me!

53
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,207
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,384
Who said I'm trying to die?

55
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,638
It's nothing like that.

56
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,040
So why did you stupidly put up
with it for a whole year?

57
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,335
You should have dumped her
the second you found out!

58
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,842
Go and take revenge on her now,
if you have to!

59
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,136
At the very least, trip her or something!

60
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,105
You should be out to ruin them.

61
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,607
Why do you ruin yourself like a fool?

62
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,826
I'm tired.

63
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,579
Don't follow me.

64
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,465
You're bleeding.

65
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,638
Your hand's bleeding.

66
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,657
Get up.

67
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:25,333
I'll let you know when Dongjin turns up,
so go home and wait.

68
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,421
I'll leave when I see him.

69
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,091
Will you please just listen to me?
Do you think he'd want to see you?

70
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,101
That's true.

71
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,398
Shameless.

72
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,942
A darn witch.

73
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,528
A crazy brat.

74
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,825
Call me what you want. I deserve it.

75
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,872
I wish they all would,
but nobody ever does.

76
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,337
Maybe that's why
I could be so shameless and come back.

77
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,799
So stubborn. Seriously.

78
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,726
Now that you know,
can you just cuss me out?

79
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,020
Maybe that'll wake me up.

80
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,440
What for?

81
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,695
Cussing someone out is pointless
if they don't even understand anything.

82
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,324
Even with the benefit of the doubt,

83
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,744
Dongjin wouldn't
have been unfaithful to you,

84
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,372
which means it had to be you, Minyoung.

85
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,791
I had a basic idea about what happened.

86
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,337
I just pretended not to know
so I would feel less uncomfortable.

87
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,174
I couldn't curse at you.
I don't deserve to do that.

88
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,468
It's just…

89
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,514
Poor Dongjin is the one suffering.

90
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,986
JUN PHARMACY

91
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,873
Here.

92
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,253
How much was it?

93
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,214
It was 65,000 won.

94
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,615
You weren't really trying
to off yourself earlier, were you?

95
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,662
I knew it.

96
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,916
Wanting to die
for getting dumped by a woman?

97
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,417
That's just embarrassing.

98
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,838
You said you even
got invited to the wedding.

99
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,549
And you didn't do anything?

100
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,678
You should have gone
to the wedding and crashed it.

101
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,516
I would have done it dozens
of times if I were you.

102
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,726
So she won't have the nerve
to show up again.

103
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:36,106
How can crashing a wedding be revenge?

104
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,655
Say you do that. What then?

105
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,536
In the end,

106
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:54,458
you'll have to live with that horrible
feeling for the rest of your life.

107
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,421
How is that revenge?

108
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,007
More like digging your own grave.

109
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,156
Ignoring it was the right thing to do.

110
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,248
This is why you get stabbed in the back.
You always make yourself look easy.

111
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,421
You didn't even know Mr. Cha was taking
the clients behind your back,

112
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,505
so stop acting big.

113
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,676
What did you just say?

114
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,095
You heard me.

115
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,435
Ms. Sim.

116
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,895
It's as I said just now.

117
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,565
Mr. Cha is getting
all the companies behind your back,

118
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,736
and he said you wouldn't
be able to hold the camping fair.

119
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,580
You have no idea how deep
in trouble you are,

120
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,373
and you feel like letting him slide?

121
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,692
Mr. Cha is getting
all the companies behind your back,

122
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,737
and he said you wouldn't
be able to hold the camping fair.

123
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,906
You and I go way back,
so I tried my best.

124
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,659
But you don't do business
out of friendship.

125
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,959
Taxi!

126
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,764
You have no idea
how deep in trouble you are,

127
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,265
and you feel like letting him slide?

128
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,733
Does it feel good to just say
whatever is on your mind?

129
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,487
To you, it may seem like people hold
themselves back because they're dumb.

130
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,532
But if you say everything
that's on your mind,

131
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,243
you have to watch others
get hurt by what you say.

132
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,580
Some people find it harder
than holding back,

133
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,459
so they try hard not to say anything.

134
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,173
This is why
you get stabbed in the back.

135
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,551
You always make yourself look easy.

136
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,991
Do you know what wizards use
to cast magic?

137
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,288
I don't know, a wand?

138
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,875
No, that's not it.

139
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,212
The wand is just an ornament.
The magic itself is cast through words.

140
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,840
Are you going to keep going?

141
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,469
If you don't want it,
go on minding your front teeth.

142
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,888
Right.

143
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,683
Practice makes perfect.

144
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:48,400
So instead of a wand,
I'm going to use words on Suho.

145
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,235
Here I go.

146
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:56,366
"You will fall in love with Haesung,
you'll fall in love with her."

147
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:02,081
"You will smile at me."

148
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,707
"Smile at me."

149
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,629
Haesung. Woojoo is making me
wait for her for over two hours.

150
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,839
What do you think about that?

151
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,634
-Trying to change the topic?
-Take a hint and stop it already.

152
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,429
I can't stomach that kind of stuff well.

153
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,391
Should I try something else?

154
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,314
So is Woojoo the one person
willing to eat with you?

155
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,024
Or do you just not have any other friends?

156
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,820
At this rate, you'll cry
once Woojoo starts dating someone.

157
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,738
Dating, my foot.

158
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:39,451
I got more chances of winning the lottery
than her scoring a date.

159
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,582
What?

160
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,837
You do know
Woojoo and I are siblings, right?

161
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,381
We have the same mother.

162
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,176
I just have this feeling

163
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,429
she'll find someone before you do.

164
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,689
Come on.

165
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,108
Man.

166
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,111
Is it the tone?

167
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,321
I should raise the tone of my voice.

168
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,954
"Do you know
what wizards use to cast magic?"

169
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,035
Jun, I'm off to work.

170
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,579
You're not even trying to hide it now?

171
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,249
By the way, Woojoo made some hangover soup
and wants you to have some.

172
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,919
I don't need any. I didn't even drink.

173
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,670
That's no way to apologize.

174
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,464
Right. She wanted me to tell you this too.

175
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,425
She's cleaning up at the pharmacy
ten times to say sorry.

176
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,263
I'll have some soup then.

177
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,355
You're easy. Way too easy.

178
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,067
♪ My heart wants you so much ♪

179
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,779
♪ You are my honey, honey, honey… ♪

180
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,864
Starting the morning
with some serious energy, I see.

181
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,449
I'm here!

182
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:48,580
♪ I only want you for always ♪

183
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,709
♪ Oh baby, honey, honey, honey ♪

184
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,963
♪ You are my honey, honey, honey ♪

185
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,925
♪ I want you so desperately,
and you only… ♪

186
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,176
It's hot.

187
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,521
♪ You are my honey, honey, honey ♪

188
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,065
♪ Do you have to turn back? ♪

189
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,775
Darn, you startled me!

190
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,194
Isn't it too early to swear like that…

191
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,165
Yoon Jun, I'm going to kill you!

192
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,220
I announced I was coming in!
You're the one who didn't hear me.

193
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,936
Plus, I have astigmatism,
so it was all a blur to me.

194
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,441
So cool it and go to work, all right?

195
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,358
Get in here!

196
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,653
I'm going to count to three!

197
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:07,326
One, two, three! Get in here, now!

198
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,261
Look over here.

199
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,308
Take a good look. These are my underwear.

200
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,019
On average of 360 days a year,
I wear matching underwear.

201
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,605
I also shave my legs
whether I'm dating or not.

202
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,565
Even when I'm running late
and can't do my brows,

203
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,525
I make sure to put on body lotion.

204
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,778
That's the kind of woman I am.

205
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,405
What are you doing?

206
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,533
Picking up the pieces
of my shattered self-esteem.

207
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,245
Forget about those tattered underwears
you saw me in. Those aren't mine.

208
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,665
Oh.

209
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,835
My gosh, that's what all of this is about?

210
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,837
Man. Seriously.

211
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,426
Haesung, I don't care whether you walk
around in holey underwear or bikinis.

212
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,096
I couldn't care any less.
It's really fine.

213
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,514
Huh?

214
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,724
Why don't you care?

215
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,851
Because you're…

216
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,729
like a giraffe to me.

217
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,651
We don't look at a giraffe and wonder
if it's male or female, right?

218
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,403
Similarly, I think of you as a giraffe…

219
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,366
Did you not know giraffes can
take lions down with one hind kick?

220
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,202
Out.

221
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,496
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. Have a nice day.

222
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,045
Darn it.

223
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,458
What?

224
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,753
Are you hurt? Is it broken?
Gosh, what happened to you?

225
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,426
I mean…

226
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,556
I stayed outside your place all night.

227
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,934
I have low blood pressure,
so I shouldn't sleep in the cold,

228
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,269
but I slept in the car.

229
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,024
Do you know what I mean?

230
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,822
I-I'm saying that's how sorry I am.

231
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:56,161
I wasn't trying to lie on purpose.
It just kind of came out of nowhere.

232
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,121
I just blurted it out at the moment.

233
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,415
Please believe me.

234
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,336
Just open the door.

235
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,963
I'm sorry, I really am.

236
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,882
Aren't you going to open the door?

237
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,551
Yes, okay. Sure…

238
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,141
Me too.

239
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,226
Huh?

240
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,521
I'm sorry for cussing you out.

241
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,942
Oh…

242
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,575
-Let's get going.
-Of course.

243
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,915
You're too kind.
It makes me feel even worse.

244
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,626
Yes. I'm coming.

245
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,142
I can't think right now.

246
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,187
What are we…

247
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,605
…supposed to do first?

248
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:11,278
First, let's visit the clients
and assess the situation.

249
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,823
By the way,

250
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,701
how did Sim Woojoo
come to learn about this?

251
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:23,623
I don't think Cha Youngmin told her
on his own. Did you ask her in detail?

252
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,167
WOOJOO: I…

253
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,714
am not the spy.

254
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,387
I can't say I've lived
the most righteous and pristine life…

255
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,849
…but I'm not so easy
that you can manipulate me

256
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,934
into doing something like that for money.

257
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,273
It's not her.

258
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,445
What do you mean it's not her?

259
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,948
I just know it's not her.

260
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,958
I hope not, too.

261
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,963
But we are not in a situation
to trust anyone right now.

262
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,508
It's hard enough for us as it is to make
a move thinking everyone is out to get us.

263
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm just saying
Sim Woojoo can't be an exception.

264
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,681
Hello.

265
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,266
Good morning.

266
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,363
Good morning.

267
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,827
Good morning.

268
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,204
Good morning.

269
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,601
Do a good job on that, please.

270
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,604
You need to advertise
your products, right?

271
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,357
I mean, if you back out so abruptly,
where would you go?

272
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,859
Sir. This really is…

273
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,864
He says it's a done deal

274
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,949
and there's no need to waste
any more time on that.

275
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,995
Then let me just ask you
one last question.

276
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,290
-You know Shinwoo Fair, right?
-We really don't know anything.

277
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,337
Something's definitely going on.

278
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,016
Hello.

279
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,934
Sir, did you find out anything?

280
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,937
We've split up the list,

281
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,648
-but we've got nothing so far.
-I looked around.

282
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,692
There's no exhibition
listed under Shinwoo Fair.

283
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,029
I'll send you a new list
of clients with no down payments.

284
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,410
What the… Did you lock the supply room?

285
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,123
What? That's odd.
I saw Ms. Baek go in there earlier.

286
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,002
OA ROOM
SUPPLY ROOM

287
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,579
Hello?

288
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,373
Is this Director Kang Minyoung?

289
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,374
Who is this?

290
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,168
Yes, this is Shin Sungman
from Shinwoo Fair.

291
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,963
Should I call back--

292
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,341
H-Hello?

293
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,599
Someone her age sleeping this late?
At least some of us are having it easy.

294
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,204
Yes. Ms. Kang… Hello.

295
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,332
Oh, I'm sorry. I was exercising,
and the call got cut off.

296
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,625
Yes. Of course.

297
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,752
Well, you left in such a hurry yesterday,

298
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,047
and then I heard nothing from you,
so I thought I'd give you a call.

299
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,720
Yes.

300
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,599
Well, I'm not trying
to rush you or anything.

301
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,060
But when do you think
you could deposit the investment funds?

302
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,314
Is Shinwoo Fair struggling financially?

303
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,357
It all looked fine on paper.

304
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,527
You gave me
the business plan just yesterday.

305
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,321
I'll review it and give you a call.

306
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,876
I think they're definitely working
behind our backs.

307
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,421
We just have to find out when and where.

308
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,978
We're both grown men,
so I don't want to hand-feed you,

309
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,147
but I'm putting these closer, okay?

310
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,694
KANG MINYOUNG

311
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,205
Want more soft tofu stew?

312
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,753
The number you have
dialed is unavailable at the present.

313
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,346
TAERANG BUILDING

314
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,764
Come with me.

315
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,752
I'm going to go from here.

316
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,839
You're not going home?

317
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,132
I'm just going to go.

318
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,676
Then, why don't you come over to my place?

319
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,386
What will you tell your mother?

320
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,223
I'll tell her you're refusing to go home

321
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,684
when your ex-girlfriend is the one
who moved in next door.

322
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,187
Our company's about to go down,

323
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,564
your ex-girlfriend came back,
and you broke your arm.

324
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,942
And if you can't even go back
to your own place, that's just too much.

325
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,617
Darn it.

326
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,306
All right.

327
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,267
Hello.

328
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,562
Oh, right.

329
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,942
-What did you say you wanted?
-Coffee-flavored milk.

330
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,110
Coming up.

331
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:23,955
Let's go.

332
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,916
Jeez. He's so tall, like a model.

333
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,668
What? Where?

334
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,754
That man walking over there,
with the bag.

335
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,924
I've seen that slouched back before.

336
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,926
Where did I see him?

337
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,012
Oh, right.

338
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,055
Neil Armstrong.

339
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,475
The first man
to ever woo the moon.

340
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,561
CEO Neil Armstrong.

341
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,460
How pitiful are you?

342
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,972
If you're going to keep replying to me,
let's just go out.

343
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,977
So he's walking into a motel alone.
So what? What do you want me to do?

344
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,103
Motel?

345
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,063
Hey, what's with that attitude?

346
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,233
I'm just asking because it's weird.

347
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,485
Why is he going
to a motel alone at this hour?

348
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,487
So why are you asking me that?

349
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,990
Whether he goes to a motel
or a sauna, how should I know?

350
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,660
And what are you doing out and about?
You should be studying.

351
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,455
How are you going to pass
by studying like everyone else?

352
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,373
You need to put in twice the effort--

353
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,750
Hello?

354
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,418
Hey, Sim Jigu!

355
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,304
Stop staring.

356
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,556
You're making me.

357
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,558
How interesting.

358
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:09,977
You fold the rest.

359
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,199
Gosh, what is she pissed about now?

360
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,410
Maybe she knows
you quit studying for the exam.

361
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,328
No.

362
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,164
I haven't told you
about my sisters yet, have I?

363
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,667
The eldest is the Hulk
and the second is a nutjob.

364
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,002
Which means,

365
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,964
if they've found out that I quit studying
for the civil service exam,

366
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,882
they would have shaved my head already.

367
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,133
Let's go inside.

368
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,677
Hmm? Aren't you seeing your girlfriend?

369
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,845
We broke up a week ago.

370
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,846
Oh, nice.

371
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,307
Then who were you texting? Your mom?

372
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,269
-A woman.
-Is she pretty?

373
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,772
-I don't know, she's old as hell.
-Let's go.

374
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,374
UNCLE DAEHONG

375
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,944
Sorry to keep you waiting.

376
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,822
Gosh, I had to go all the way
over to the main street.

377
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,327
Heeja, you like
the coffee here, don't you?

378
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,833
What's all this about? What do you want?

379
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,296
I'm telling you now,
but I don't have any money either.

380
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,507
-Why not?
-What?

381
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,219
Did you really sell my brother's house
and give your son all the money?

382
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,304
Why should I tell you about all that?

383
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,391
Don't be like that.

384
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,519
Heeja, if you have even a cent left,
lend it to me for just a month.

385
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,646
I'll pay you back with generous interest.

386
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,609
Someone I know invested 40 million won
and made twice that money in a month.

387
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,528
Goodness, do you really believe that?

388
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,155
I watched it happen
with my own eyes.

389
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,160
The rent for my salon
is late this month, too.

390
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,704
I'll think about it.

391
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,039
-Thank you, Heeja!
-Hey!

392
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,042
Don't touch me with those dirty hands
that touched the chemicals!

393
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,087
-Get me a wet wipe!
-Gosh, I'm sorry.

394
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,047
-Are you kidding me?
-Here are some tissues.

395
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,674
-What do I do?
-Hey!

396
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,303
JUHEE HAIRLINE

397
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,221
Did you meet with Woojoo?

398
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,766
Just like her mom, she'll get something
done once she puts her mind to it.

399
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,353
-Who?
-No, it's nothing.

400
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,065
Heeja, think about it
and give me a call, will you?

401
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:29,361
Hmm… Sure. I'll keep in touch.

402
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,529
Okay.

403
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,576
That darn cow. I hope
you fall and break your nose.

404
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,333
CEO Choi is understandable,
but why isn't CEO Han coming in?

405
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,376
He fell down and broke his arm.

406
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,421
But isn't he the type to show up
for work even with a broken leg?

407
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,964
He comes to work on the weekends too.

408
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,009
-I know, right? It's pretty strange.
-Yes. It's weird.

409
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,386
I heard something odd. A rumor.

410
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,471
What?

411
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,433
The Jet Camping contract
wasn't actually delayed but canceled.

412
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,351
Really?

413
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,103
I heard Mr. Cha talking on the phone
with Director Kim even yesterday.

414
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,816
My brother-in-law works there,
and he says it's almost certain.

415
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,568
Gosh, that's crazy.

416
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,903
What is this?

417
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,488
What? That's seriously nuts.

418
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,614
I know.

419
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,532
2022 OUTDOOR CAMPING FAIR

420
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,743
I was going to call you first,
but I've been really busy.

421
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,329
Honestly, this isn't right.

422
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,541
Putting on a fair with the same companies
a week before like some cheaters.

423
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,711
When did you receive this brochure?

424
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,257
Uh… About a month ago, I think?

425
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,510
Anyway, they promoted it by saying,
if we cancel our contract with you

426
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,012
and join their fair, they'd give us
a big discount on the booth

427
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,265
and promised the next fair participation

428
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,558
would be for free.

429
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,812
Is this the man who came to talk to you?

430
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,022
Yes, that's right.

431
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,156
Is everybody free for lunch?

432
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,033
Yes, sir.

433
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,035
Then let's have a team lunch today.

434
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,662
-Sounds good.
-Great.

435
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,290
Ms. Sim. Why don't you join us?

436
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,916
Ms. Sim too?

437
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,293
Isn't Ms. Sim part of our team?

438
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,877
I mean, that's…

439
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,004
Come on, hurry up.

440
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,761
What are you waiting for? Get up.

441
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,232
I'm switching companies.

442
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,238
Why the long faces?

443
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,743
I mean, it's not like you're all
going to work at Best Fairs forever.

444
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,496
There's nothing new about moving
to a new job that offers a higher salary.

445
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,414
What's so surprising?

446
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,374
It's just so sudden.

447
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,585
You could have
at least given us a heads-up.

448
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,254
And that's why I'm treating you all
to a nice lunch.

449
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,756
May I ask which company?

450
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,134
-You'll find out eventually…
-Shinwoo Fair.

451
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,888
He's going to work under CEO Shin.

452
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,228
Yes, it's like that.

453
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,230
Sir, that's not right.

454
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,399
You know what kind of a man CEO Shin is!

455
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,526
I mean, I get it
if it's any other company.

456
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,197
But joining Shinwoo Fair means
you're blatantly out to get Best Fairs.

457
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,242
I'm sorry, sir.
I just think that it's wrong.

458
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,078
Mr. Kang.

459
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,580
-You're not going to last long in sales.
-Pardon?

460
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,832
Take a hint.

461
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,418
Do you really think I'd be going alone?

462
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:36,507
I've told them about you all here,
so let's all join them together.

463
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,510
Best Fairs is about to go down.

464
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,471
The only way for it to survive is
to do well at the camping fair,

465
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,473
but they won't be able to hold it.

466
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,519
I'll bite the bullet and go first,
so follow me out when the time is right.

467
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,063
Do you understand what I'm saying?

468
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,566
What are you doing?

469
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,444
The lunch break is over.

470
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,705
I just can't tell whose side
she's on in moments like this.

471
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,632
I, too,

472
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,177
was taking my revenge.

473
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,014
I wanted to make lots of money,

474
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,308
drive a nice car,

475
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,395
and live in a better house.

476
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,817
I guess I wanted to say,
"You brought bad luck into my life."

477
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,612
"Now that you're gone,

478
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,784
I'm doing so much better."

479
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,376
Proving that is also revenge.

480
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,130
I need you, Ms. Sim.

481
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,091
Ms. Sim is going to be working
here again, starting today.

482
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,051
If you have a problem with that,
come see me.

483
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,137
Because I asked her to come back to work.

484
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,806
Just be yourself.
Don't let them get you down.

485
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,143
I trust your word that you don't let
people easily manipulate you.

486
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,270
Also, I don't really have a choice.

487
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,398
Asking and pleading with you,

488
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,401
is the only option I have.

489
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,127
Hello.

490
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:43,467
Mr. Han. I'm giving you a chance
to take your revenge for sure.

491
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,764
Mr. Cha is trying to get his
team members to join CEO Shin's company.

492
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,683
The man has no conscience.

493
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,093
What's this? Mr. Cha has family overseas?

494
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,805
That's sickeningly conventional.

495
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,896
Why didn't she go home?

496
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,817
I asked her to help pack up
Mr. Cha's belongings.

497
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,488
I heard from Dongjin…

498
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,783
I mean, from CEO Han.

499
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,245
Anyway… Thank you.

500
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,040
Do I just put everything in the box?

501
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,544
Yes. First, start with
personal belongings.

502
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,260
I'll pretend my being ignored
is all in my head.

503
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:36,788
Gosh. We just need one thing
that can prove he went to the same vendor.

504
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,541
-Don't you think he would have deleted it?
-But still…

505
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,087
The folder with his family photos.

506
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,049
-Open that.
-Huh?

507
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,848
What?

508
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,435
It's here!

509
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,230
I've seen him
open and close that file many times.

510
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,192
Ms. Sim, you hit the jackpot.

511
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,406
Now, we only need Dongjin to do well.

512
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,576
But he's never done anything
like this before, so I'm worried.

513
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,791
-You grind up potatoes,
-Okay.

514
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,584
-and you make it into flour.
-Yes.

515
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,337
-Sprinkle flour on the rice cake and…
-Okay.

516
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,507
-You know how we fry things?
-Yes.

517
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,424
Yes.

518
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:33,971
Then you fry that powder
onto the sticky rice cake.

519
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,431
What brings you here, Mr. Han?

520
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,562
I've been waiting for you.
I had something to tell you.

521
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,358
Hyunsoo, go inside. Grandma's coming soon.

522
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,275
Okay!

523
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,173
Go ahead.

524
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,680
Shall I start first?

525
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:21,351
Starting tomorrow, you no longer work
at Best Fairs, Mr. Cha.

526
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,645
Don't come to work.

527
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,773
The reason I came
all the way here is because

528
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,193
this would be better than
getting fired in front of your coworkers

529
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,071
you've worked with all these years.

530
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,533
We'll send your belongings by courier.

531
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,913
This is why you're getting
played by CEO Shin.

532
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,004
Being nice works at school.

533
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,548
Being nice out in the business world
makes you a pushover.

534
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,926
This is sincere advice.

535
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,889
So you can be more clever doing business.

536
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,940
Don't delude yourself.

537
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,318
I've been using you.

538
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,111
If I'd cut you out earlier,

539
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,781
the others could have gotten
involved with someone like CEO Shin.

540
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:21,119
I've been using you because I didn't
want them to go down the wrong path.

541
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,163
You know how to be blunt.

542
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,040
No, this is being blunt.

543
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:29,336
Does your daughter know what kind of money
is letting her study overseas?

544
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:58,907
Where are you?

545
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,172
Ah, this is a miracle.
I mean, how lucky can we get…

546
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,423
Seriously.

547
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,677
Great job, everybody. Amazing work.
Thank you so much.

548
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:23,557
Hey, why don't we go out
for a quick beer to celebrate?

549
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,642
I'm headed to the office.

550
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,355
Woojoo, come with us.

551
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,233
I'm meeting someone.

552
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,068
With who?

553
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,071
Okay. Let's do a raincheck, then.

554
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,741
You two go on ahead.

555
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:46,496
I left my wallet on my desk.
I'm going to grab that and leave.

556
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,757
Well, that was awkward.

557
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:01,052
Why would her wallet be on her desk
when she's never pulled it out?

558
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,387
Just let it go.

559
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,847
But I'm curious.

560
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,265
Let's just go.

561
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,241
I'm still at the office myself…

562
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,582
If you want, we can grab dinner together.

563
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,498
He's not here.

564
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,919
He's gone for the day.

565
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,131
When did he leave?

566
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,342
Has it been long since he left?

567
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,475
You just show up out of the blue
every single time.

568
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,769
Like you're toying with him.

569
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,396
-Are you talking to--
-I have to lock up.

570
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,029
Ms. Sim.

571
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,482
Are you hurt? Is it bad?

572
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,534
I have something to tell you.

573
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,662
Let's go somewhere more private.

574
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,003
You think we can meet
just because you want to talk?

575
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:10,927
Just leave.

576
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,637
It's not about me,
it's about the company.

577
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,684
I met CEO Shin.

578
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,562
I wanted to find out what he was up to.

579
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,397
I pretended to be an investor.

580
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,236
I wanted to help you.

581
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,825
What a nice excuse.

582
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,996
Yes, because it was the best one
I could come up with.

583
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,418
At least you're looking me in the eye
since this is about the company.

584
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,261
Why is everything so easy for you?

585
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,055
It wasn't easy.

586
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,477
I thought it over hundreds of times
and I barely mustered the courage to come.

587
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,898
I didn't come here to talk about this.

588
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,817
But I didn't get married.

589
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,862
I was alone the whole time in America.

590
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,873
I know. I have no shame.

591
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:27,170
But I really wanted to apologize to you.

592
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,180
Someone once said

593
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,182
that my back looks…

594
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,268
so bored,

595
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,481
and so lonely.

596
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:54,822
Think about it tens of thousands
more times, not just hundreds.

597
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,244
The reason why you shouldn't
show up in front of me anymore.

598
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,174
Let's go.

599
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,138
Let's go.
