00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,962
EPISODE 8

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,214
What? I'm not going to the internet cafe.

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,050
I'm heading over to fill in a part-time.
They'll pay me twice the usual.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,386
What?

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,222
I'm saving up to buy a guitar. Hang on.

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,475
Maybe it's not her?

7
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:18,810
(exclaims) My goodness!

8
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,103
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,399
Jeez.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,277
(sighs) I thought she saw me.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,949
(banging)

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,534
JIGU: Come on, Woojoo.

13
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,371
Can we please be normal? Seriously.

14
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,374
Gosh, she's killing me.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,917
(Woojoo sighs heavily)

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
(song playing)

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,513
WOOJOO (shouting): I was just…

18
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,974
More than Jigu
who quit studying and ran away!

19
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,977
More than you who's acting
this crazy because of me!

20
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,646
More than Haesung who's dating
a boy much younger than her!

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,856
More than my sick mom!

22
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,567
I just worry about him a little bit more.

23
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,362
I just wish he could be
a little less lonely.

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,531
So what is this?

25
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:15,909
What is this feeling?

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,829
What is this
that freaks you out this much?

27
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,922
Goodness…

28
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,298
(Woojoo sits down heavily)

29
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,804
(chair dragging)

30
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,889
(heavy footsteps)

31
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,936
(door opens harshly, chimes rattling)

32
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,814
(door slams, chimes rattling)

33
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
(song continues)

34
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,369
I really am a lunatic.

35
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,371
(song continues)

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,834
(sighs)

37
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,513
(deep breath)

38
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,454
(cell phone vibrates)

39
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,850
JIGU: My sister is drunk and asleep
at the playground outside.

40
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,186
Could you take care of her for me?

41
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,854
I'm on my way to a part-time job.

42
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,462
DONGJIN: Ms. Sim.

43
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,841
(song fades out)

44
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,185
(tender music playing)

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,491
Do you have any idea what time it is?

46
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,244
Aren't you scared to be out here?

47
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,335
If you came, you should have called me.

48
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,964
Why are you just sitting out here?

49
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,646
(slurred) Are you sure
I really came here to see you?

50
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,368
So I was the only one
who didn't know my own feelings.

51
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,803
This is why I didn't know.

52
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,974
You pretend not to notice every time.

53
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,198
Go back inside. I'll go home on my own.

54
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,459
Get up. It's late.

55
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,008
If you're not planning
to spend the night out here, get up.

56
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,718
I'll walk you home.

57
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,976
(tender music plays up)

58
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,941
(train whooshing)

59
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,155
(whooshing fades)

60
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:57,291
CALL IT LOVE

61
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,337
WOOJOO: Aren't your feet cold?

62
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,634
It's almost summer.

63
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,972
I wear socks even in the middle of summer.

64
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,683
My hands and feet are always cold.

65
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,650
Let me go get some water.

66
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,736
Stay here. I'll get you the water.

67
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,492
(door chimes jingling)

68
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,623
(gulping)

69
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,292
-DONGJIN: Drink slowly.
-(bottle thuds)

70
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,550
Do you know the athlete Ki Bobae?
She's a gold medalist in archery.

71
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,848
I almost had a chance to train with her.

72
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,768
I've won medals in national competitions,

73
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,480
and I prepared
for the national team selection tryout.

74
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,316
I was a promising archer.

75
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,068
That's impressive.

76
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,196
I was.

77
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,699
Until I was half-forced to quit archery

78
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,410
after a big injury on my shoulder
from a car accident.

79
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,916
Maybe I shouldn't call that an accident.

80
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,592
I found out
that my father was having an affair.

81
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,514
So the 17-year-old me tried to fix it
and followed him.

82
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,683
WOOJOO: And I saw him come out of a motel.

83
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,852
(mellow music playing)

84
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,689
I jumped in front of the car
my dad was driving without even thinking.

85
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,279
I was trying to scare him
and make a statement saying that,

86
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,910
"Your daughter knows everything.
So come back to your family."

87
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,750
But as time passed on,
I realized that I was lying to myself.

88
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:11,050
What I wanted was to hurt my father.

89
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,973
I wanted to leave a scar
that would last him a lifetime.

90
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,894
And give him twice
the amount of pain I felt.

91
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,276
I was born rotten like that.

92
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,369
Your pain was probably greater.

93
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,831
And it wasn't that you were rotten,

94
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,667
but that you didn't know any better.

95
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,217
You really shouldn't like me.

96
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,183
If you don't like me,
then there won't be any problem.

97
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,401
I'm asking a favor.

98
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,428
(mellow music continues)

99
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,916
(light whimpering)

100
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,304
(trembling)

101
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,209
JUN PHARMACY

102
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,254
Okay, Mr. Park Junkyu.

103
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,426
The medicine is for three days.
Don't forget to take them regularly.

104
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,427
MR. PARK: All right.

105
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,393
(photocopier whirring)

106
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,275
JUN: I don't know whether this is
good news or bad news,

107
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,861
but your mother didn't pick up
the phone so I couldn't tell her.

108
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,696
I just wanted you to know that.

109
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,662
(cell phone vibrating)

110
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,913
NUTJOB WOOJOO

111
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,171
WOOJOO: I'm going
to look for Jigu from today.

112
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,548
I want you to know that too.

113
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,718
Is this it?

114
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,348
This is so you, Woojoo.

115
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,605
CONTEX EXHIBITION HALL RENTAL CANCELLATION

116
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,734
(papers rustling)

117
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,277
CONTEX MANAGER: That's a bummer.

118
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,530
I was looking forward to working
with you on this fair. (clicks tongue)

119
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,948
We'll make it happen next time.

120
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,285
Are you really not going to tell me?

121
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,329
Where are you hosting your fair?

122
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,414
Is it Samseong-dong or Yangjae-dong?

123
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,333
Or is it all the way over in Songdo?

124
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,168
I'll also answer that next time.

125
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,920
At any rate,

126
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,965
I'll wait and see if you're successful
without working with us.

127
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,052
-That's you wishing us well, right?
-Of course, it is.

128
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,389
Uh, I don't know if you heard.

129
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,724
It's about CEO Shin.

130
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,186
Apparently, he can't even afford
the middle payment for the venue.

131
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,313
-The manager was my former co-worker.
-Don't worry.

132
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,023
What do you mean
the funds haven't come in?

133
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,191
T-T-That can't be.

134
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,442
-Take care, sir.
-(pensive music playing)

135
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,070
CONTEX MANAGER: He hasn't received
the investment that he was promised.

136
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,405
And he barely charged booth rental fees
from the companies.

137
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,033
I think he was planning to make up
for that by attracting visitors,

138
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,409
but that's easier said than done.

139
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,204
Some participants have caught on
and already pulled out.

140
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,331
So it does look like he's struggling.

141
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,792
This is just between us,

142
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,294
but doesn't that make you feel nice?

143
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,797
It makes me dizzy.

144
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:07,012
I've never wished him to succeed,
but I didn't wish him to be ruined either.

145
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,891
Now I wonder if I should wish him well.

146
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,227
(deep breath)

147
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,437
I don't know if I have to be
that concerned for him.

148
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,567
CONTEX MANAGER: You really are something.

149
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,238
(music fades out)

150
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,156
(heavy footsteps)

151
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,200
(somber music playing)

152
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,747
GALLERY WORKER: Director Kang Minyoung
doesn't come to work at the gallery.

153
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,166
Please don't come here looking for her.

154
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,259
(door clicks shut)

155
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,804
(door slams)

156
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,514
(sighs exasperatedly)

157
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,437
If she's got a business card
that says she's a director,

158
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,773
she's bound to show up to work one day.

159
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,775
(sighs)

160
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,529
(seethes) That cheeky brat.

161
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,949
If she won't give me the money,
she should at least tell me why.

162
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,329
I'm going to find you…
(breathes heavily)

163
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,788
…and get an explanation out of you.

164
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,874
(sighs)

165
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,626
I will.

166
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,551
DONGJIN: If it's because of me,
you can stay. It's your house.

167
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,305
I'm saying…

168
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,933
I finally don't care what you do.

169
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,854
(music crescendos, pauses)

170
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,899
(somber music resumes)

171
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,655
(office phone ringing)

172
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
(heavy footsteps)

173
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,918
Hello, this is Best Fairs.

174
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,504
CONTEX REHABILITATION AND WELFARE FAIR

175
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,881
WOOJOO: Hello?

176
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,342
It's me.

177
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,761
DONGJIN: Is Ms. Baek around?

178
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,015
-WOOJOO: They're all in a meeting.
-DONGJIN: Well…

179
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,935
I'm having trouble
opening a file on my phone.

180
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,647
Could you tell me the booth number
for Hojin Trading Company?

181
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,856
Okay.

182
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,816
(paper swiping)

183
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,734
-Did you get home okay last night?
-(hanging up beep)

184
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,730
WOOJOO: Booth 12.

185
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:10,738
You really shouldn't like me.

186
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,075
I'm asking a favor.

187
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,205
(vehicle approaching)

188
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,171
Sir, get in!

189
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,728
Did the meeting not go well?

190
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,814
It went well.

191
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,650
They'll join us in a similar capacity
as Hojin Trading Company.

192
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,862
Try to look a little happier then.
You scared me.

193
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,990
I still have a long way to go.

194
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,117
The stress is killing me.

195
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,995
KANG: You don't have to stress out
about every single thing.

196
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,289
Stop worrying, you'll age quicker.

197
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,752
Hey, Kang.

198
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,837
(clicks tongue)

199
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,632
If someone says,
"You really shouldn't like me,"

200
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,344
what do you think that means?

201
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,429
Uh, what are you talking about?

202
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,015
Never mind.

203
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,894
-Pretend you didn't hear it.
-Come on, I already heard it.

204
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:29,066
You want to know the meaning behind,
"Don't like me," right?

205
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,068
Let's see.

206
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,154
The person who said that knows.

207
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,990
They've caught on
that the other person likes them.

208
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,327
(contemplative music playing)

209
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,121
…COULD YOU TAKE CARE OF HER FOR ME?

210
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,042
(footsteps echoing)

211
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,002
KANG: So they're giving a warning.

212
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,214
"I know everything,
so don't confess to me."

213
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,925
"I don't like you."
They're just nailing that in.

214
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,220
I don't know who this is,

215
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,430
but they sure got rejected discreetly.

216
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,145
I should have turned left back there.

217
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,189
You should have put in the signal first.

218
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,697
(paper sheets rustling)

219
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,203
GOLDEN COUNTRY REALTY 02-212-2218

220
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,997
AUNT: He personally left it
with the realtor

221
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,124
not too long after you kids moved out.

222
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,002
He wanted to apologize
to you kids on his mother's behalf.

223
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,421
GOLDEN COUNTRY REALTY 02-212-2218

224
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,800
(memo rustles)

225
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,719
(bangs on chair)

226
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,896
(exhales sharply)

227
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,821
(hood slams)

228
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,868
I only got to drive this baby
on the freeway to Paju and back.

229
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,953
You checked the engine, so you'd know.

230
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,914
-It's pristine.
-DEALER: Sure.

231
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,542
Now please sign here and here.

232
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,920
(sighs in frustration)

233
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,546
(sniffles)

234
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,881
And did you bring the spare key?

235
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,258
No. I didn't.

236
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,344
That's going to lower the price a little.

237
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,386
Go ahead, then.

238
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,680
I should keep something to remember it by.

239
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,515
DEALER: Then just sign there, please.

240
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,727
(engine rumbling)

241
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,565
SUNWOO: The company is struggling
because there's no money.

242
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,818
And the CEO buys an expensive sports car?

243
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,695
Is that something a CEO should do?

244
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,156
No, that's what a stupid moron would do.

245
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,659
(chuckles, hisses)

246
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,953
I knew I wasn't going to be loved for it,

247
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,915
but do you know why
I still went ahead and bought that car?

248
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,292
(Sunwoo smacks lips)

249
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,669
I needed an outlet.

250
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,295
Something…

251
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,091
that could keep me grounded.

252
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,344
I wanted something
that works and revolves around me.

253
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,347
A car does everything as I say,

254
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,975
from the steering wheel,
gears, to signals.

255
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,062
And that gave me
a strange sense of comfort.

256
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,063
Because the company…

257
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,191
(forced laughter)

258
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,443
It revolves around Dongjin.

259
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,862
Let me tell you a funny story.

260
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,449
After I bought that car,
I even turned off the navigation.

261
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,034
I didn't want it telling me what to do.

262
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,452
(laughing)

263
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,080
Ugh, maybe I'm going through
late puberty or something.

264
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,168
Are you listening?

265
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:44,344
Anyway, I sold that car today.

266
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,722
It's not just bittersweet,

267
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,725
but actually heartbreaking.

268
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,312
But my mind is at ease.

269
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,396
Good job.

270
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,734
What? Is that all?

271
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,943
(Minyoung sighs)

272
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,572
Then what else should I say?

273
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,408
Did you really want to see me for this?

274
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,785
What's your problem now?

275
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,078
What I'm saying is…

276
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,622
You've been cold and snippy
every time you talked to me,

277
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,083
and suddenly you've returned
to the good old friendly Sunwoo.

278
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,127
Am I also nothing to you now?

279
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,795
Am I that trivial?

280
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,339
(groans)

281
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,303
If I lived across from him
and had been around,

282
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,764
I thought he'd ask me at least once.

283
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,308
I thought he'd talk to me
just to get me off his back.

284
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,353
But now he doesn't care whatever I do.

285
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,271
He told me to live there if I want.

286
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,648
What does that mean?

287
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,736
I saw you.

288
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,031
You and Sim Woojoo, together.

289
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,911
Please just leave Dongjin alone.

290
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,622
He's finally trying to live a little.

291
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,915
(exhales deeply)

292
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,834
SUNWOO: If you're doing this
because you feel bad for him…

293
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:58,919
(glass bangs)

294
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,798
Hey! Hey, Minyoung!

295
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,841
(heavy footsteps leaving)

296
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,343
Why…

297
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,220
(melancholic music playing)

298
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,556
Why does this feel worse
than when I sold my car?

299
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,360
(security system beeps)

300
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,377
(presses button)

301
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,046
(elevator chiming dimly)

302
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,214
ELEVATOR VOICE: First floor.

303
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,847
(elevator doors click shut)

304
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,937
HEEJA (shouting): How rude can you be?

305
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,607
An elder is talking on the phone.
How dare you?

306
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,985
MAN: I apologized to you multiple times.

307
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,404
HEEJA: And I'm telling you
I can't accept that apology.

308
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,531
I can't accept it!

309
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,995
MAN: I honked the horn because you kept
talking on your phone in front of our car!

310
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,788
You could have just asked me to move.

311
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,082
(shouts)
I was so startled that I fell down!

312
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,168
This is a car accident, you know!

313
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,170
-MAN: Listen here!
-(Heeja sighs)

314
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,671
WOMAN: Just pay for her treatment.

315
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,174
HEEJA: Gosh, my clothes are now dirty.

316
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,635
Oh, gosh, my back is hurting too.
Oh, my gosh.

317
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,471
MINYOUNG: I have a reservation
under Kang Minyoung.

318
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,514
(calm music playing)

319
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,023
(shudders)

320
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,692
(footsteps approaching)

321
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,783
(chuckles)

322
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,620
Sorry, I'm late. I'm Dongjin's mom.

323
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,832
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Minyoung.

324
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,584
Thank you for reaching out to me first.

325
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,710
(laughs awkwardly)
Sure.

326
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,879
HEEJA: Sit down.

327
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,839
(chair dragging)

328
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,056
(laughing)

329
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,850
This is my first time
meeting Dongjin's girlfriend.

330
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,895
Gosh.
(laughs)

331
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,981
(door shuts)

332
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,033
(dishes clinking)

333
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,785
(sink water running)

334
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,967
MINYOUNG: Are you doing that
to make me feel bad?

335
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,011
-(faucet stops)
-(dishes clinking)

336
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,306
I told you not to do the dishes
without gloves.

337
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,058
(Dongjin chuckles)

338
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,059
I forgot.

339
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,103
Then put them on now.

340
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,022
I'm done.

341
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,819
Is something going on?

342
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,158
MINYOUNG: A few days ago,

343
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,288
I met your mother.

344
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,045
I found her number on your phone
and asked her to see me.

345
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,674
I asked you
to introduce me to her a few times

346
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,093
but you kept postponing it.

347
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,641
My mom also wants to meet you.
How about you?

348
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,353
Later.

349
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,818
Do you even want to marry me?

350
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,447
I do.

351
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,743
That's why I'm giving you time.

352
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,000
So that you can think about it carefully.

353
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,464
(contemplative music playing)

354
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,716
-(faucet water running)
-(dishes clinking)

355
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,309
(contemplative music amplifies)

356
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,519
(cell phone vibrates)

357
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,567
HEEJA: Do you want to go shopping
with just us women, without Dongjin?

358
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,209
(music turns resolute)

359
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,141
(security keypad beeping)

360
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,032
(shudders)

361
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,410
(doorbell chimes)

362
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,752
(doorbell chimes)

363
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,588
-(door lock clacking)
-(security system beeping)

364
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,465
(banging)

365
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,800
MINYOUNG: Just listen there.

366
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:40,927
You were right.

367
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,347
I did hesitate about marrying you

368
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,433
because of your mother.

369
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,436
I was afraid that my whole life

370
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,814
would be turned upside down
because of your mother.

371
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,984
You can't blame me for that.

372
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,611
But… (shudders)

373
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,282
…you also started avoiding me
from then on.

374
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,993
You were afraid
I'd harp on you about marriage.

375
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,537
It was so obvious.

376
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,498
For me…

377
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,377
a simple word like "I'll do better"

378
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,255
would have made everything okay.

379
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,383
But you said nothing until the very end.

380
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,262
You just left me alone as if to say,
"It's your life, so you decide."

381
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,849
So you share the blame too.

382
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,270
(shuddering)

383
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,440
(door clicks shut)

384
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,359
(security system beeping)

385
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,403
(music fades out)

386
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,366
(patting)

387
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,586
(mellow music playing)

388
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,218
(heavy footsteps)

389
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,111
WOOJOO: Your button has come off.

390
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,628
(door opens)

391
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,131
(music fades out)

392
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,384
(slams)

393
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,517
WOOJOO: You're here.

394
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,645
Did you find another part-time job?

395
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,480
Supplying side dishes to a diner?

396
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,816
Pack some for lunch tomorrow.

397
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,776
You said you were tired of buying lunch.

398
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,735
(chopsticks clatter)

399
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,654
I see you're really trying hard.

400
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,447
WOOJOO: Did you have dinner yet?

401
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,575
How about looking at me
if you're going to talk to me?

402
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,118
(utensils clatter, clink)

403
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,538
Did you have dinner?
If not, I'll give you some.

404
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,039
I ate.

405
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,457
Then put the dishes in the fridge.

406
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,961
(dish clinks)

407
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,212
(Jun clicks tongue)

408
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,010
You said you'd go to look for Jigu.

409
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,970
Did you already go look for him?

410
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,600
I'm looking for him right now,
and that's why I'm cooking here.

411
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,437
I noticed a lot of things
missing from Jigu's room,

412
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,022
like underwear and socks.

413
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,691
Who could have delivered those to him?

414
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,903
Could it be my sister who doesn't care,

415
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,696
and thinks that he'll come back
when he does?

416
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,406
Or could it be you?

417
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,699
(loud shutting click)

418
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,660
Fine, it was me.

419
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,578
So what?

420
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,164
Text him to stop by the pharmacy tomorrow.

421
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:57,916
I'll deal with the rest.

422
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,001
Do you think you're in a position
to order me around?

423
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,089
What's my position?

424
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,261
You think you finding out
that I like him is somehow my weakness?

425
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,055
I just like him.

426
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,806
(scoffs) So you're…

427
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,893
You're just openly proclaiming it now?

428
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,896
My head is about to burst open
without you breathing down on my neck.

429
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,481
So if you can see that I'm trying,

430
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,442
just let me settle things on my own.

431
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,569
I'm asking you a favor.

432
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,158
(dishes clinking)

433
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,452
(song playing in background)

434
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,704
(phone camera shutter snapping)

435
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,219
(snapping continues)

436
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,721
(Haesung sighs)

437
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,640
I think that's enough pictures.

438
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,560
We have to take a hundred shots
to get one good picture.

439
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,690
Uh, this picture makes my legs look short.

440
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,732
Does it?

441
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,359
Do you want me to take another one?

442
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,443
No.

443
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,653
I could post this one.

444
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:15,159
So, are you planning on becoming a model?

445
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,537
You really like taking pictures.

446
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,746
Are you being sarcastic?

447
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,790
(chuckles) Oh, no, no.

448
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,209
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

449
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,211
This is just for fun.

450
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,879
I'm uploading these on social media.

451
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,841
Speaking of, should we make
a couple's account?

452
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,761
A couple's account? Not a couple's ring?

453
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,264
I guess you don't know this stuff.

454
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:41,019
It's sharing a social media account
and posting pictures of us together.

455
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,938
Oh…

456
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,065
I can start learning now.

457
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,151
What should I do first?

458
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,236
SUHO: Let me first create an account.

459
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,043
(security system beeping)

460
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,711
(muffled) What's this?

461
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,421
Young Boy didn't walk you home tonight?

462
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,299
It's almost time for the last bus.

463
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,551
-(lighter clicking)
-You're picking up smoking again?

464
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,344
I was thinking about it.

465
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,473
But this lighter wouldn't let me.
Stupid thing.

466
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,642
Listen.

467
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,481
Have you heard of something
called a couple's account?

468
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,233
-A couple's what?
-A couple's account.

469
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,486
A couple…

470
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,529
Is it like a shared bank account?

471
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,658
So this is how my Suho must have felt.

472
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,827
It must have been lonely.

473
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,954
(smacks lips)
It's just a little generation gap.

474
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,372
I can overcome it, right?

475
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,586
And you're sure it's a generation gap?

476
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,840
What do you mean?

477
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,262
I'm wondering if you're confusing
incompatibility with a generation gap.

478
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,973
It's a mistake you make
in every relationship.

479
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,851
You're very passionate,
but the other is lukewarm.

480
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,563
(whimsical music playing)

481
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,693
What?

482
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,904
You know what your mistake is?

483
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,449
It's that you run your mouth
without thinking.

484
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,829
I'm supposed to go
meet your parents, right?

485
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,331
If that ever happens,

486
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,667
then I'm changing my name
from Sim Haesung to Sim Moksung!

487
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,293
(heavy footsteps)

488
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,295
What's that supposed to mean?
You promised.

489
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,297
Haesung.

490
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,632
-HAESUNG: I don't care.
-(door slams)

491
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,134
JUN: Wait, come on.

492
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,762
Excuse me, Ms. Sim Moksung!

493
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,724
I apologize. I think I misspoke!

494
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,273
JIGU: Gosh.

495
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,484
Have a wonderful day today.

496
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,403
DONGJIN: Okay.

497
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,779
Isn't the night shift hard?

498
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,198
I can't be whining about stuff like that.

499
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,409
Thanks to you, I get to have warm showers.

500
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,368
(smirks)

501
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,619
-I'll see you.
-Okay.

502
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,454
Oh, right.

503
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,999
Someone came by yesterday.

504
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,459
(security system beeping)

505
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,670
JIGU: Uh, it was a woman.

506
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,548
At first, I thought she was drunk
and came to the wrong door.

507
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,175
But she actually lived across from you.

508
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,386
I was wondering if you knew her.

509
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,537
(inquisitive music playing)

510
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,633
(door slams)

511
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,389
(knocking)

512
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,390
What the…

513
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,476
(exclaims)

514
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,979
(stuttering) My goodness.

515
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,773
-I'm just…
-(door clicks)

516
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,192
(footsteps leaving)

517
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,028
GALLERY EMPLOYEE:
You can't be doing this here.

518
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,072
All right, then…

519
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:25,201
Should I move my car over there and wait?

520
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:30,915
I'm really sorry, but I really need
to talk to Director Kang in person.

521
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,253
I'm not here
to collect a debt or anything.

522
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,673
Uh, I'm just here to give
my thanks to the director.

523
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,674
(chuckles nervously)

524
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,758
Really.

525
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,010
I don't know the exact address,

526
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,930
but I know what apartment she lives in.

527
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,235
(music fades out)

528
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,932
YURI: Woojoo, could you put these
in the conference room?

529
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,033
(contemplative music playing)

530
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,868
AGENT (on phone):
The daughter of that family.

531
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,998
She got your business card,
and she came here.

532
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,043
She came and told me

533
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,545
that she's given up on the house.

534
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,965
And she no longer wants to be
stressed about the house matter.

535
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,551
She told you to stop looking for her.

536
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,389
And I didn't want
to come here empty-handed.

537
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,601
My goodness. You didn't have to.

538
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,561
Thank you for these.

539
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,731
Goodbye then.

540
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:20,900
(agent sighs)

541
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:29,909
And one last thing.
Could you please tell him this?

542
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,915
My family's moved
to a better place than before,

543
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,750
and we're doing just fine.

544
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,379
So he should stop worrying about us.

545
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,423
Thank you so much.

546
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,009
Just finish this in person.

547
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,304
He seemed like a nice guy.

548
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,889
I know.

549
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,310
If I told him to give me back the money
his mother took from us,

550
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,187
he would ask
for my bank account number first.

551
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,357
I should have known a long time ago.

552
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,489
WOOJOO: But now, I'm just trying
to undo the mistake I made.

553
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,577
(music turns tender)

554
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,544
To the conference room, right?

555
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,315
It's a lot.

556
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,568
They're for the advertisement.

557
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,611
Ms. Baek said she'd pick from these.

558
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,864
(documents rustling)

559
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,495
Aren't you leaving?

560
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,583
If there's nothing more to say…

561
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,542
DONGJIN: The button.

562
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,337
Did you patch it back on?

563
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,678
I'm grateful, but don't do that again.

564
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,683
Okay, I won't.

565
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,147
Get back to work then.

566
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:30,488
WOOJOO: Can't you just think I did it
because I could and just take it?

567
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,660
You don't have to be sorry
or grateful for every little thing.

568
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,374
I want to do it.

569
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,252
And I'll do it again if I want to,
so lock the door if you don't want it.

570
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,296
(documents clatter)

571
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,192
(sighs)

572
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:17,076
Four iced Americanos, two iced lattes,
and one hot Americano, please.

573
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,827
One more iced Americano, please.

574
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,621
And I'll pay for everything.

575
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,373
Gosh, Mr. Cha.

576
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,624
It's been a while, Yuri.

577
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,048
You don't look so good.
You must be busy at work.

578
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,716
Thanks to you.

579
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,135
Are you still moving forward
with the camping fair?

580
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,345
(slurping)

581
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,348
Mr. Cha, I'm not stupid.

582
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,891
Stop fishing for information.

583
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,226
I wasn't doing that.

584
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,937
I was just asking how everyone is doing
since it's been a while.

585
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,398
Since you're the youngest
among those who stayed behind,

586
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,857
you must have a lot of errands.

587
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:49,942
All the photo-copying too.

588
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,110
Ms. Sim still works with us.

589
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,237
She does?

590
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,864
I don't know if she's loyal
or doesn't have anywhere else to go,

591
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,157
but she still works here.

592
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,493
The CEO cares for her a lot too.

593
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,496
He kept asking around just because
a part-timer didn't show up for work.

594
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,040
Wait, which one are you talking about?

595
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,333
Mr. Choi or Mr. Han?

596
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,127
Mr. Han, of course.

597
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,880
The way I see it,
those two are very close.

598
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,966
(cell phone vibrates)

599
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:14,883
I have to go now.

600
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,385
Okay, bye.

601
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,601
So if you really want
to ruin this company,

602
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,019
then try harder.

603
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,228
Starting tomorrow,

604
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,938
you no longer work at Best Fairs, Mr. Cha.

605
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,982
(pensive music playing)

606
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,527
(sighs, mutters)
They're close?

607
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,659
(music fades out)

608
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,745
(cell phone vibrating intermittently)

609
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,755
SUNWOO

610
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,673
(tired exhale)

611
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,054
-Hello--
-(hanging up beep)

612
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,059
What? Did she hang up or what?

613
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,853
(light groan)

614
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,688
(sighs)

615
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,649
(doorbell chimes)

616
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,153
(doorbell chimes)

617
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,822
(groaning)

618
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,534
(knocking on door)

619
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,744
SUNGMAN: Hello?

620
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,663
(knocking on door)

621
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,872
Are you home?

622
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,957
(knocking on door)

623
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,418
Director Kang, are you home?

624
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,504
This is Shin Sungman.

625
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,214
(doorbell chimes)

626
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:41,512
(on intercom) If you're in there,
I'd like to say just one thing.

627
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,223
I, Shin Sungman,

628
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,266
do not know how to give up.

629
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,521
This job may just be
a matter of livelihood for others,

630
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,107
but for me,
it's a matter of life and death.

631
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,318
So I can't just give up.

632
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,988
Please call me.

633
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,116
I'll be waiting.

634
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,911
JIHYUNG: Uh, I'm hungry.

635
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,039
HAESUNG: Ah, I want to go home.

636
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,040
(Jihyung chuckles)

637
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,834
We still have hours left on the clock.

638
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,877
-WAITRESS: Welcome.
-JUN: Hello.

639
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,298
Haesung.

640
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,802
Do you know that man?

641
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,804
I wouldn't call him a man.

642
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:25,931
Just a kid that I know.

643
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,266
Oh.

644
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,185
May I sit with you for a moment?

645
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,103
Of course.

646
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,813
Please sit so I can
get to know you better.

647
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,273
Well…

648
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,441
One more, please.

649
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,026
Jeez.

650
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,654
Gosh, you came far to have lunch.

651
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,156
Why do you care?

652
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,616
(utensils rattling)

653
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,034
I'm sorry about yesterday

654
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,911
like I always am for everything.

655
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,122
You know that.
I talk too much without a filter.

656
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,165
(snorts)

657
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,167
Have you thought about correcting that?

658
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,211
(inhales deeply)

659
00:45:56,295 --> 00:46:00,674
If you become Sim Moksung,
I'll try my best to correct it.

660
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,759
I'll be good.

661
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,470
Just eat your food and leave.

662
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,516
Do you really think
I'll just eat and leave?

663
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,018
I'm going to pick up the bill too.

664
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,437
This is my treat, so please enjoy.

665
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,355
JIHYUNG: Oh, thank you.

666
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,942
By the way, you two look really close.

667
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,361
I've never seen you
talk casually to anyone before.

668
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,530
Right, Haesung and I…

669
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,491
Well…

670
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:31,121
We know enough about each other
but respect each other's privacy as well.

671
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,623
Oh…

672
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,416
What kind of a relationship is that?

673
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,001
I guess I'm too old to understand that.

674
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,253
It just means there's nothing between us.

675
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,922
You're hurting my feelings again.

676
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,634
How is there nothing between us?
There's something very special between us.

677
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,052
"Special"?

678
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,012
I am your…

679
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:51,934
landlord.

680
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,813
A landlord that buys his tenant lunch.
How special is that?

681
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,315
I'm sure it's very special.

682
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,108
Sure, whatever.

683
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:01,777
Gosh.

684
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,488
(slurps)

685
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,660
Oh, right. You forgot to take your pills.

686
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,702
Go take it.

687
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,371
Oh, you mean the vitamins?

688
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,791
No, the prescription medicine
you take after lunch.

689
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,335
Uh, well, that's just…

690
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,088
I left the pharmacy closed for too long,
so I'm heading back.

691
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,757
-Okay, bye.
-See you.

692
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,843
-Thank you for lunch.
-My pleasure.

693
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,302
-See you at home.
-Okay.

694
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,807
(sighs)

695
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,769
STAFF 1: We'll meet you there then.

696
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,855
-STAFF 2: Order a lot.
-STAFF 1: Yes, sir.

697
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,939
-(laughter)
-STAFF 2: All right.

698
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,402
(mellow music playing)

699
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,487
(indistinct chatter)

700
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,118
-NAHYUN: I have to come in early…
-Aren't you wrapping up for the day?

701
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,370
-Tonight's office dinner is at six, right?
-Yes.

702
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,414
NAHYUN: I wonder if we're going
to have pork again today.

703
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,291
I'm craving beef.

704
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,793
YURI: Should I try asking him?

705
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,003
-NAHYUN: Yes.
-DONGHAN: You should.

706
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:01,920
YURI: Okay.

707
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,922
-Wait for me, I'll go ask.
-NAHYUN: Sure.

708
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:04,923
(Yuri hisses)

709
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,091
-Shall we go?
-NAHYUN: Okay.

710
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,220
(documents clatter)

711
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,026
(chair rolling)

712
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,695
It's the usual barbecue place, right?

713
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,738
(loudly) No!

714
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,324
It's beef tonight! The one next door!

715
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,325
-(Yuri whoops)
-(Sunwoo cackles)

716
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,910
It's a proper dinner for a change.

717
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,162
You told Kang
to come straight there, right?

718
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,330
Yes, I told him.

719
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,498
SUNWOO: But I don't see Ms. Sim.

720
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,125
I think she went home.

721
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,085
SOOHEE: You didn't tell her
about the office dinner?

722
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,712
YURI: Of course I did.
I asked her to come.

723
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,632
-And guess what she said to me.
-SUNWOO: What did she say?

724
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,133
WOOJOO: I'm not going.

725
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,218
Why not?

726
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,763
An office dinner
is to get to know each other.

727
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,097
I don't want that.

728
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,478
YURI: She said that she's a part-timer
who will quit once her contract ends,

729
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,229
so she saw no point in getting to know us.

730
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,147
SUNWOO: What?

731
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,982
YURI: She didn't want any
unnecessary relationships,

732
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,108
so she didn't want to go.

733
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,069
SOOHEE: She really said that?

734
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,321
YURI: Yes,
it really took me by surprise too.

735
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,157
SUNWOO: Gosh, you never know
what to expect from her.

736
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,701
I thought she'd want to
work with us longer.

737
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,870
Oh, CEO Han. You're here.

738
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,163
(elevator dings)

739
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,998
Oh, it's here. Let's go.

740
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,166
Get in, everyone.

741
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:24,962
-Yes, that.
-SUNWOO: Okay.

742
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:31,885
SUNWOO: Eat up.

743
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,512
-Order anything.
-NAHYUN: Yes, sir.

744
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,597
-SUNWOO: Whatever you guys want.
-(staff laughing)

745
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,765
SUNWOO: Is that okay, Mr. Han?

746
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,308
(Dongjin chuckles awkwardly)

747
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,643
Our Mr. Han is ever so shy,

748
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,103
so he won't give any speech, right?

749
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,147
SUNWOO (mutters): Okay.

750
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,065
(loudly) All right.

751
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:50,153
As always, I'll make the toast.

752
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,989
Everyone raise your glass.

753
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,199
Uh…

754
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:58,328
The fair is coming up very soon.

755
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,332
I'd like to thank those of you
who were loyal enough to stay with us,

756
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,877
and those of you brave enough to join us.

757
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,423
I chose this phrase for the toast

758
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,050
because I really wanted
to say these words to you.

759
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,760
Let's all say it together.

760
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,220
Let's survive!

761
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:19,766
Let's raise our glasses of love!

762
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,892
ALL: Raise them!

763
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,852
(glasses clink)

764
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,062
(all gulping)

765
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,106
-(glass thumps)
-(Sunwoo exhales)

766
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,985
I really think this company
wouldn't have survived without me.

767
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:30,944
Don't you think?

768
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,571
-(chuckles meekly)
-(Sunwoo snickers)

769
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,829
We've come this far

770
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,248
thanks to you, Ms. Baek.

771
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,876
Please thank me after the fair.

772
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,713
Then I'll thank you again then.

773
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,467
(glasses clinking)

774
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,093
SUNWOO: Eat up.

775
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,304
You can take some home too.

776
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,307
(Dongjin exhales)

777
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:02,976
By the way…

778
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,687
I didn't stay with the company

779
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,274
over some loyalty
like CEO Choi was saying.

780
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,277
Nobody really cares about loyalty.

781
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,905
So why would I care about that?

782
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,782
It only stabs you in the back.

783
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,994
I just wanted to work, that's why.

784
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,501
And Yuri stayed because of her savings.

785
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,336
(mellow music playing)

786
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,588
So…

787
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,216
don't be burdened by us.

788
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,645
(pop music playing in room)

789
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,813
WOMAN: ♪ Honey, honey… ♪

790
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,022
JIGU: Excuse me.

791
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,734
♪ Do you have to turn back? ♪

792
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,985
♪ I only want you… ♪

793
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,195
Have a good time.

794
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,405
(music fades)

795
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,908
WOOJOO: Why did it have to be a karaoke?

796
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:05,038
JUN: Maybe he wanted to at least hold
a karaoke mic if not a stage mic.

797
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,331
Where's he staying?

798
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,999
That's the one thing he wouldn't tell me.

799
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,252
He just told me
to let you know he's all right.

800
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,090
JUN: Just wait quietly and talk it out.

801
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,884
Don't barge in and give him
a heart attack at his workplace.

802
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,929
That's just unfair.

803
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,556
Unfair, my foot.

804
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:23,890
I'm hanging up.

805
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,809
(hanging-up beep)

806
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,150
(sighs exasperatedly)

807
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,538
(glass bangs)

808
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,915
(Sunwoo groans)

809
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,003
(clicks tongue)
Just how much did we drink tonight?

810
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,672
(sighs)

811
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,632
Can you make it to work tomorrow?

812
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,468
I'll make it no matter what.

813
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,514
I even sold my car,
pledging to start anew.

814
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,142
So I must show up to work.

815
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:10,729
You sold it?

816
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:11,688
(loudly) Of course.

817
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,524
I had the most emotional farewell.

818
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,110
(Sunwoo giggling)

819
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,448
I'm asking you because I'm drunk,

820
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,160
but why won't you go out with Sim Woojoo?

821
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,121
(sighs, slurred) Will you please stop?

822
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,915
Then…

823
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,460
explain the tension
in the conference room today.

824
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:40,675
WOOJOO: Can't you just think I did it
because I could and just take it?

825
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:46,348
You don't have to be sorry
or grateful for every little thing.

826
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,475
I want to do it.

827
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,353
And I'll do it again if I want to,
so lock the door if you don't want it.

828
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,396
(documents clatter)

829
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,775
(Sunwoo thumping)

830
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,193
Stop pretending.

831
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,237
You definitely have feelings for her.

832
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,323
Dongjin.

833
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,867
Think simple.

834
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,370
Just follow your heart, okay?

835
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,538
(sighs)

836
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,128
DONGJIN: I removed all the furniture
in the living room.

837
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,965
Then I set up a tent inside my place.

838
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,093
And I swore this one thing to myself.

839
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,846
I will not be hurt again.

840
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,436
I will not be abandoned again.

841
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,107
(sentimental guitar song playing)

842
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,944
DONGJIN: I know
how every relationship ends.

843
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:43,905
I'm just…

844
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,868
protecting myself.

845
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,080
So that I won't be swayed.

846
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,837
Does that mean you were swayed at least?

847
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,055
WOOJOO: But you won't go down.

848
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,102
You know how sometimes you can tell a lot
about someone just by the way they walk?

849
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,397
I can tell you won't go down
no matter what.

850
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:23,236
I just wish you could live
comfortably in your own place.

851
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,825
WOOJOO: You really shouldn't like me.

852
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,537
I'm asking a favor.

853
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,205
WOOJOO: I want to do it.

854
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,125
And I'll do it again if I want to,
so lock the door if you don't want it.

855
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,719
Yes. (inhales)

856
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,596
SUNWOO: "Yes"?

857
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,680
(romantic music)

858
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,223
(loudly) Really?

859
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,476
You just said yes.

860
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,520
(laughing boisterously)

861
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,440
You already have some.

862
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,484
(laughs, cheers)

863
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:03,818
(sets bottle)

864
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:09,574
Let's raise our glasses of love.

865
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,703
(sighs)

866
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,246
-Amazing!
-(glasses clink)

867
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,206
(clicks tongue)

868
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:20,543
(Sunwoo's glass thuds)

869
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,629
(Dongjin's glass lands softly)

870
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,548
(romantic music continues)

871
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,559
DONGJIN: Minyoung.

872
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,103
(song fades out)

873
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:26,985
Did you drink?

874
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,538
Good for you.

875
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,127
I don't really have the right to say this…

876
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,465
but stop drinking.

877
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,344
You've punished yourself enough.

878
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,018
Bye.

879
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,104
(stomping)

880
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,779
(dramatic music playing)

881
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,587
(trembling)
Those two were working together.

882
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,507
Trying to ruin me.
(inhales)

883
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,342
Damn them.

884
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,888
(heavy footsteps)

885
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,564
(dramatic music intensifies)

886
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,420
(music fades)
