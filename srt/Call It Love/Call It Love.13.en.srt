EPISODE 13

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,637
-(mellow music playing)
-(footsteps approaching)

3
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,308
(sighs)

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,731
Do you want me
to console you or something?

5
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,074
Get back inside. You'll look weird
staying out here like this.

6
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,749
(snorts)

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,799
HAESUNG: Our family members were always
scattered and doing their own thing.

8
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,510
-We don't like to gather together.
-(indistinct chatter)

9
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,845
But…

10
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,015
(short inhale)
…after some things happened,

11
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,142
we started gathering together
to drink and sing

12
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,437
when one of us seemed down or depressed.

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,982
We feel too awkward
to directly console them.

14
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,943
So we just spend time together.

15
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,739
So that the person
won't be depressed all alone.

16
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,119
(inhales)
And today, it's our mom.

17
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,038
HYUNJU: Jigu, do you know this song?
Sing this for me.

18
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,122
(chuckles)

19
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,794
She doesn't seem like it, right?

20
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,212
No.

21
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,129
(chuckles, inhales)

22
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,507
Everyone in this family is like that.

23
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,008
They don't show anything.

24
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,972
The girl you're seeing
is kind of like that too.

25
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,395
So in a way, you fit right in.

26
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,981
I don't know how to say it…

27
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,652
(inhales) …but you seem like
a good match with our family.

28
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,614
-(Haesung laughs)
-(laughs awkwardly)

29
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,949
(cans click)

30
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,701
(chuckles, gulps)

31
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,287
(can thuds)

32
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,956
(door opens)

33
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,795
(door shuts)

34
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,841
(footsteps approaching)

35
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,301
JUN: Why aren't you singing?

36
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,762
JIGU: I don't know which song to pick.

37
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,808
(intro theme music playing)

38
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,443
(music fades out)

39
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,782
CALL IT LOVE

40
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,457
Well…

41
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,710
I'm sorry to just show up
unannounced every time.

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,922
You don't have to be sorry
about small things like this.

43
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,007
Actually, I enjoyed it.

44
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,346
If you are free tomorrow evening,
please join us for dinner.

45
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,513
I really mean it.

46
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,434
He's busy with work.
He has a business trip, too.

47
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,186
I just want to see him some more.

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,106
When do I get to see you again?

49
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,651
I'll come to visit you in Tongyeong.

50
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,362
HYUNJU: Okay, please do.

51
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,989
Yes, I'll be leaving now.

52
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,534
See you later.

53
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,204
-Have a good night.
-HAESUNG: Bye.

54
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,936
(objects rattling)

55
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,145
(Heeja smacks lips)

56
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,733
Huh?

57
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,654
(lid snaps open)

58
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,701
Who made all this food?

59
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,624
(slurps)

60
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,546
Mmm.
(munches)

61
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,215
(slurps, giggles)

62
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,218
(wind blowing, leaves rustling)

63
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,934
(sudden stomp)

64
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:29,454
JIGU: ♪ I want to go
to the farthest place ♪

65
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:35,043
♪ I wonder what kind of people
I will meet there ♪

66
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,713
-♪ I want to go to the highest point… ♪
-Hello?

67
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,757
DONGJIN (on phone):
I forgot to give you your bag.

68
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,842
If you haven't gone too far, wait for me.

69
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,635
No, don't bother.

70
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,762
I'll come to you.

71
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,931
(soft music playing)

72
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,727
I'll be back soon.

73
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,437
Why would you see him again? Just go home.

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,481
I won't be long. You go ahead.

75
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,068
Gosh, that nutjob.

76
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,738
(sighs)

77
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,998
Just look at the time, huh?

78
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,125
It's really quite dangerous at night.

79
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,295
If it's something that ordinary,
I'll also just let it slide.

80
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,297
But…

81
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,716
I'm sensing something else.

82
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,472
I don't know what you're talking about.

83
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,431
Let's just go.

84
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,766
(clears throat)

85
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,939
Is there a problem with Mr. Han Dongjin?

86
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,445
How serious is it?

87
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,074
Huh?

88
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,245
(soft music continues)

89
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,834
WOOJOO: I thought I told you.

90
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,711
I don't want to extend my contract.

91
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,091
No, don't bother. I'll come to you.

92
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,226
I could have come to you.

93
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,397
My family is waiting, so I'll be going.

94
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,481
Get home safely.

95
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,900
Could you hear me out for a second?

96
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,072
I know what you're going to say.

97
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,329
A part-timer quitting work
isn't a big deal.

98
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,166
So please don't worry about it anymore.

99
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,335
You don't have to be so worried about me.

100
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,005
(chuckles)

101
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,923
The bag was just an excuse.

102
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,634
I went there because I missed you.

103
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,681
I wanted to see you.

104
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,143
I thought it would make me feel calm.

105
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,574
HAESUNG: Was he married before?

106
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,619
Or does he have a child?

107
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,205
No.

108
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,501
What, so does he have debt?

109
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,879
How much then?
Is it over a hundred million won?

110
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,718
(Jun sighs)

111
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,014
Haesung.

112
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,226
Don't call me like that.
You're scaring me.

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,021
(clicks tongue)
Sit down, okay?

114
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,856
Let's sit down and talk.

115
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,656
The way you're so calm means
that it's something big, isn't it?

116
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,161
Tell me. What is it?

117
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,331
Why do you two seem so tense?

118
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,003
I can't talk about it.

119
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,593
I don't even know where to begin or how.

120
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,309
(door opens and shuts)

121
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,229
(phone vibrating)

122
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,526
(vibrating stops)

123
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,152
Hey.

124
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,324
-(brooding music playing)
-(sighs deeply)

125
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,034
(hanging-up beep)

126
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,869
JUN: She wants you here right now.

127
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,581
She says she'll call Mr. Han Dongjin
if you don't show up.

128
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,583
I don't think she'll back down.

129
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,793
So just come here.
And we'll deal with this together.

130
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,304
(sighs)

131
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,564
WOOJOO: Haesung, do you know who this is?

132
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,858
Mr. Han. Get up.

133
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,276
We need to talk.

134
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,320
(heavy footsteps)

135
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,281
Even if you end up breaking up,
at least try dating him.

136
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,490
There's no harm in trying.

137
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,950
WOOJOO: No way.

138
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,078
It won't happen,
not even over my dead body.

139
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,622
WOOJOO: I think I'm going to regret it.

140
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,708
I know I'll regret it.

141
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,836
But I want to be here right now.

142
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,421
(melancholic music playing)

143
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,881
I want to be with him.

144
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,762
(sighs disgruntledly)

145
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,350
(footsteps approaching)

146
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,324
(slaps)

147
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,493
Hey, what are you doing?

148
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,287
(breathes angrily)

149
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,164
He's married, isn't he?

150
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,460
(panting angrily)

151
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,212
It can't happen even over your dead body.

152
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,547
And you want to be with him
even though you'd regret it.

153
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,468
That can only mean he's married, right?

154
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,680
You've gone and done
that despicable thing!

155
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,225
Sim Woojoo.

156
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,520
You know that
this simply can't happen in our family.

157
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,401
(sniffles) When others spout nonsense
such as, "It's not an affair, it's love,"

158
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,070
we're supposed to say,

159
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,949
"You're just terrible people
who drive stakes through others' hearts."

160
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,410
Because we saw what Mom had to go through.

161
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,330
(breathing while crying)

162
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,749
And that's why, for me…
(whimpering)

163
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,838
…I feel more miserable now
than when Dad had an affair.

164
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,925
So miserable that I want to kill myself!

165
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,054
(inhales shakily)

166
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,222
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,851
Did you even think about Mom
when you were seeing him?

168
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,478
(shouts)
Did you even think about our family?

169
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,064
(panting angrily)

170
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,027
Haesung.

171
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,655
He's not married.

172
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,365
(music fades out)

173
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,659
That's not what this is.

174
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,542
(breathes hesitantly)

175
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,004
That guy, Han Dongjin…

176
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,007
He's the son of that woman.

177
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,636
The one your dad cheated on your mom with.

178
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,890
(gasps)

179
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,559
What?

180
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,103
JUN: She got the job
at that company to take revenge.

181
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,147
(sighs)

182
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,565
But things turned out differently.

183
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,569
(melancholic music playing)

184
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,658
(sighs dumbfoundedly)

185
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,458
You…

186
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,420
Jun, you knew this all along and…

187
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,675
(exhaling in disbelief)

188
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,971
(Haesung sighs and sniffles)

189
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,890
What an admirable friendship.

190
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,601
It's impressive.

191
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,269
(panting angrily)

192
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,980
It's so deeply moving, really! Huh?

193
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,233
(sniffling)

194
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,860
(whimpering)

195
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,529
I'm sorry, Haesung.

196
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,740
(sniffles)
It's all my fault.

197
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,535
(weeping)

198
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,802
(weeping continues)

199
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,892
(Woojoo continues weeping)

200
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,649
(weeping continues)

201
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,651
(Jun's footsteps leaving)

202
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,491
(weeping continues)

203
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,206
(sniffling)

204
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,750
(door opens)

205
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
(door shuts)

206
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,369
(melancholic music continues)

207
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,798
(heavy footsteps)

208
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,303
Haesung.

209
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,765
Haesung, let me talk to you.

210
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
-Where are you going?
-(sniffles)

211
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,276
You and Woojoo are both lunatics!

212
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,363
Does this make any sense to you?
This has to be a joke.

213
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,906
And…

214
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,868
to think I said all those things
to that woman's son…

215
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,454
(panting angrily)

216
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,207
-I'll explain. Let's head inside.
-(shouts) Explain what?

217
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,125
What can you possibly explain?

218
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,462
(panting angrily)

219
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,840
JUN: I'm really sorry,

220
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,468
but I was going
to keep it a secret until the end.

221
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,513
I felt bad for Woojoo.

222
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,604
I've felt sorry for her since we were 17.

223
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,774
When she jumped onto her dad's car

224
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,902
and when she gave up on college
to work and make money.

225
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,531
JUN: It broke my heart to see her
living such an aloof and stoic life.

226
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,867
So when she finally found
someone she liked,

227
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,371
I pretended to believe her
when she said she'd end it.

228
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,582
It was probably tougher on her,
so what could I do?

229
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,503
Now that you know about it,

230
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,672
she'll take care of it and end it.

231
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,718
She wouldn't continue things
at the cost of hurting her family.

232
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,885
You know this too, Haesung.

233
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,431
(sighs)
What a load of bullcrap.

234
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,310
(melancholic music builds)

235
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,312
(sniffling)

236
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,708
ZUCCHINI, BEAN SPROUTS, POTATO

237
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,881
(footsteps approaching)

238
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,095
(music fades out)

239
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,853
JIGU: What are you doing?

240
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,692
I see.

241
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,780
You're planning to make food
for Dongjin, right?

242
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,990
(inhales and sighs)

243
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,867
You've only met him twice,
isn't that too soon?

244
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,203
I need a reason
to see him for the third time.

245
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,705
-So we can get closer.
-Hmm…

246
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,375
So my sisters take after you.

247
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,294
So driven.

248
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,838
What dishes does he like?

249
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,007
Dongjin?

250
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,510
He likes meat. Make him some meat dishes.

251
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,761
Like braised beef?

252
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,845
Yes, that works.

253
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,109
SHIITAKE MUSHROOM, ANCHOVY (STIR-FRIED),
BRAISED BEEF (BEEF SHANK 2 GEUN)

254
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,278
(chopsticks tapping)

255
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,906
(Heeja munching)

256
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,202
What does she do for a living?

257
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,330
(chuckles)

258
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,625
You wouldn't buy this stuff.
Someone prepared it for you.

259
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,462
What does she do?

260
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,467
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.
I won't be back for a week.

261
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,720
Have a good trip.

262
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,430
(chopsticks tapping)

263
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,724
(sighs dumbfoundedly)

264
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,478
What? Are you afraid
I'll just settle down here?

265
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,313
Well, don't worry.

266
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,232
Because we've lived apart
since you were little,

267
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,651
I feel uncomfortable living here too.

268
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,361
I'm going to leave!

269
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,573
(chopsticks thumping)

270
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,204
(sighs deeply)

271
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,248
(security system beeping)

272
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,421
(doorbell chiming)

273
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,101
(smacks lips, inhales deeply)

274
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,604
Have you set a date for the move?

275
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,730
Not yet.

276
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,525
I'll pack a few things
and move in with my parents.

277
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,031
They caught me living recklessly.
It's for the better anyway.

278
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,327
The fair's starting soon, right?

279
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,162
Yes.

280
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,580
You must be so busy.

281
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,124
Why did you stop by here?

282
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,377
(sighs)

283
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,548
I used work as an excuse

284
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,800
not to pay enough attention
to what my mother was doing.

285
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,428
It must have been very hard for you.

286
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,431
I'm sorry for not picking up on it sooner.

287
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,892
It's late, but I apologize.

288
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,898
I should have told you everything sooner.

289
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,945
Your words make me feel better instantly.

290
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,657
(tender music playing)

291
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,075
I apologize too.

292
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,454
About the wedding invitation
my mom sent you.

293
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,291
It might sound like an excuse,
but I found out later.

294
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,419
I always felt horrible,

295
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,214
thinking about how much you'd hate me

296
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,218
and how terrible I must seem to you.

297
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,515
Don't feel like that anymore.
It's okay now.

298
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,434
I'm relieved.

299
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,688
You're with someone nice.

300
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,070
Let me know how much it is.

301
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,364
I'll pay you back.

302
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,241
Will you pay me back
even if I say it's okay?

303
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,826
Yes.

304
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,244
Okay.

305
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,538
But don't rush to pay me back.

306
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,125
(breathes deeply)

307
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,460
Thanks.

308
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,926
(tender music playing)

309
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,181
(thuds)

310
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,742
WOOJOO: Haesung, just give me two days.

311
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,205
(sighs)

312
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,167
I'll quit the job in two days
and end everything.

313
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,169
I promise.

314
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,004
(shoestrings rustle)

315
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,589
Today.

316
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,966
Quit the job today.

317
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,094
(sighs)

318
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,140
(breathes deeply)

319
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,937
Or do as you wish.

320
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,607
I'll do as I please too.

321
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,984
Haesung…

322
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,990
(door opens and shuts)

323
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,368
DONGJIN: I'd like to mark the booths
early tomorrow morning.

324
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,577
Is that possible?

325
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,829
Yes, we can contact
a local business in Gangwon-do

326
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,664
and move up the schedule.

327
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,416
Is it because of Hojin Trading Company?

328
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,503
We can't expedite the electrical work.
Are they okay with that?

329
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,714
We've decided to just place
the materials at the booths for now.

330
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,174
(inhales)

331
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,636
Then, I'll head out first
with the planning team.

332
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,472
I guess you'll have to leave tonight
instead of tomorrow.

333
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,182
We should both be present for the marking.

334
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:13,892
We should.

335
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,144
(Sunwoo breathes heavily)

336
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,106
Gosh, the office stuff alone
must be quite a lot.

337
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,941
Woojoo is packing them in advance.

338
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,860
What does a part-timer know?
You should have just let Ms. Kim do it.

339
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,322
(Sunwoo exhales exasperatedly)

340
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,747
(footsteps fading)

341
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,793
(knocking)

342
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,880
-Should we have a lunch break?
-Yes.

343
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,383
(mutters)
This goes here and…

344
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,677
YURI: Mmm!

345
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,761
(Soohee chuckles)

346
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,973
I wanted to buy you something delicious.

347
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:54,975
This is delicious.

348
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,269
Why do you want to buy her
something delicious?

349
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,021
I'm quitting.

350
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,774
What?

351
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,570
SOOHEE: Let's get together to eat
when we're done with the fair.

352
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,405
You've worked so hard.

353
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,324
It wouldn't sit right with me…
(exhales)

354
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,701
…if I sent you off
without doing something.

355
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,246
Ms. Sim, did you break up with Mr. Han?

356
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,165
Yuri.

357
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,959
No, what I mean is…

358
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:26,798
I was kind of looking forward
to having Ms. Sim as my junior coworker.

359
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,343
You're not the most friendly person,

360
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,929
but you're good at your job.

361
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,433
And now that you say that you're quitting,
I'm just taken off guard.

362
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,688
(softly)
Hurry up and eat.

363
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,486
Thank you for everything, Ms. Baek.

364
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,032
I always thought you were really cool.

365
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,075
I really mean that.

366
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,536
Please take my calls.

367
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,331
Don't mark me as spam
just because you quit.

368
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,042
(chuckles lightly)

369
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,770
SUNWOO: Check this for one last time.

370
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,230
YURI: Yes, sir.

371
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,189
(mellow music playing)

372
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,357
(sighs)

373
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,367
Tell him that I packed small amounts
because I didn't know how much he'd eat.

374
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,577
And that he should
come back for more later.

375
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,788
Gosh, who would think this is little?

376
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,706
People would think
you emptied out a grocery.

377
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,252
Also, tell him to add more seasoning
if my cooking is too bland for him.

378
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,505
(Hyunju strains)

379
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,633
My gosh, Madam Kim. Stop.

380
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,301
Put away the kimchi container.

381
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,386
Why?

382
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,514
Your son doesn't have a car
and can't carry all that on foot.

383
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,515
Well…

384
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,684
Then let me just pack some fresh kimchi.

385
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,060
Just a little bit.

386
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,187
-(scoffs)
-(container clattering)

387
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,438
Okay, as you wish.

388
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,148
It's only your son's arms
that will suffer.

389
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,199
(groans)

390
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,784
Gosh. Wait a minute.

391
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,452
(objects thud)

392
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,288
(groans)

393
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,124
-(exhales)
-(mellow music playing)

394
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,500
(groans)

395
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,213
(elevator button clicks)

396
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,133
(feet tapping)

397
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,261
(elevator chimes)

398
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,971
AUTOMATED VOICE: First floor.

399
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,101
Oh. Hello, ma'am.

400
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,270
Huh? Me?

401
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,229
Yes.

402
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,609
I'm an acquaintance of Dongjin,
and I'm on my way to his place right now.

403
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,027
(chuckles awkwardly)

404
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,820
Ma'am, I saw you in the photo.

405
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,864
Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.

406
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,241
Yes, nice to meet you too.
My name is Sim Jigu.

407
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,910
Uh, Dongjin isn't home right now
because he's at work.

408
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,496
I know, so I'll just
leave these by his door.

409
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,250
These are side dishes made by my mother,
and she's a really good cook.

410
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,585
So she packed some food for him.

411
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,338
Then please put them in the fridge.

412
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,340
-Yes, ma'am.
-Would you like the door code?

413
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,924
No, I know it.

414
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,510
Then I'll leave you to it. Okay.

415
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,428
Yes, ma'am.

416
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,388
(running footsteps)

417
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,397
-To Yeonhui-dong, please.
-DRIVER: Yes, ma'am.

418
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,733
(door shuts)

419
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,532
(brooding music playing)

420
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,825
(Namil's junior exhales in awe)

421
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,369
What a nice house.

422
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,872
Nice, nice, nice.

423
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,876
(sighs deeply)

424
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,056
Take a look.

425
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,016
Didn't I tell you
the front yard is wonderful?

426
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,851
MAN 1: Hmm. It's pretty nice.

427
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,312
HEEJA (sighs): The inside is even nicer.

428
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,271
(chuckles)

429
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,065
-MAN 1: Okay, let's head inside.
-Let's go.

430
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,442
(footsteps leaving)

431
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,653
(door shuts)

432
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,447
(inaudible chatter)

433
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,907
Thank you. I'll give you a call.

434
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,908
Okay.

435
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,035
(calling beep)

436
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,164
GOLDEN COUNTRY REALTY

437
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,709
(phone vibrating)

438
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,001
Darn it.

439
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,546
JUNIOR

440
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,256
How did it go?

441
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,092
JUNIOR: Gosh, you were right, Namil.

442
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,927
As soon as you left that house,

443
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,762
she went to every single realtor

444
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,848
in the neighborhood
and put the house up for sale.

445
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,182
My goodness.

446
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,893
I told you she'd be quick.
She doesn't waste any time.

447
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,188
And the house has finally been sold.

448
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,023
(chuckles on phone)

449
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,443
JUNIOR: She did put the house
for cheaper than the market value,

450
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,863
and since the house is so nice,
they signed the contract right away.

451
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,198
HEEJA: Deposit to this account, please.

452
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,286
MALE AGENT: You're getting a great deal
considering the current market value.

453
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,497
JUNIOR (on phone): What will you do now?

454
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,208
I'll take care of the rest,
so step back for now.

455
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,427
RECORDED CONVERSATION

456
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,637
IMPORTANT:
HEEJA'S CALL ABOUT THE WILL

457
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,017
HEEJA (on record): This is outrageous!
The will doesn't mention my name anywhere!

458
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,270
I've done more than enough
for him as a wife,

459
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,439
and he couldn't bother
to even leave me a penny!

460
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,441
Even the house in Yeonhui-dong?

461
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,904
The only asset he has left is that house,
and even that is left to his kids.

462
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,322
(grumbles)

463
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,782
Darn, I'm so mad right now.

464
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,328
What would have happened
if I hadn't found this?

465
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,789
So what will you do now?

466
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,082
HEEJA: I'm going to keep this hidden

467
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,293
and wait till he dies.

468
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,712
NURSE: Is the guardian
of patient Sim Chulmin here?

469
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,422
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

470
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,924
-Yes, it's me!
-NURSE: Okay.

471
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,346
HEEJA
RECORDED CONVERSATION

472
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,267
HEEJA (on record): This is outrageous!
The will doesn't mention my name anywhere!

473
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,522
I've done more than enough
for him as a wife, and he couldn't…

474
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,607
That lunatic! Gosh.

475
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,442
NAMIL (on record):
Even the house in Yeonhui-dong?

476
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,444
HEEJA: The only asset he has left
is that house…

477
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,988
(ominous music playing)

478
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,910
JUN: I'm really sorry…

479
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,869
(slaps)

480
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,871
…but I was going
to keep it a secret until the end.

481
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,165
I felt bad for Woojoo.

482
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,876
(whimpers)
I'm sorry, Haesung.

483
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,463
(sniffles)
It's all my fault.

484
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,633
(Woojoo cries in flashback)

485
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,301
(sighs)

486
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,386
Jihyung.

487
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,846
JIHYUNG: Hmm?

488
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,767
I've been taking medicine
for a panic disorder.

489
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,605
Ever since that woman
grabbed my hair and made a scene.

490
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,525
(softly) I see.

491
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,277
(normally)
I understand.

492
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,905
This really isn't that big of a deal.

493
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,742
It's something I can casually share

494
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,995
with my coworkers and friends.

495
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,581
(inhales)

496
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,458
So I don't know why it's so difficult
to tell my family about it.

497
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,587
Yes. It's hard.

498
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,256
(inhales)

499
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,843
Maybe it's because you know
they'd worry about you more than yourself.

500
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,014
And it would be tough for you
to see your family like that.

501
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,268
I guess so.

502
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,355
But you should tell them
what needs to be said.

503
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,192
My parents found out about me
getting scammed long after it happened.

504
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,445
And my mom couldn't eat for three days.

505
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,906
She said she was hurt,

506
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,742
and that she felt like
an unreliable mother.

507
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,869
That really caught me off guard.

508
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,456
Cheer up.

509
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,336
(Jihyung sighs)

510
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,379
(sentimental music playing)

511
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,383
(indistinct chatter)

512
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,858
(Dongjin inhales deeply)

513
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,001
SUNWOO: Hey.

514
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,427
(sighs)

515
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,389
-(folder slams)
-What?

516
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,391
Do you have something to say?

517
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,143
Mmm.

518
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,480
Did something happen
between you and Ms. Sim Woojoo?

519
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,113
Why? Did she say something?

520
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,161
(laughs)

521
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,079
You know…

522
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,333
With all the preparations for
the camping fair and the overseas fairs,

523
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,876
things have been hectic.

524
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,379
What could possibly happen
between the CEO and a part-timer?

525
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,425
Can you stop calling her a part-timer?

526
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,595
She has a name. Call her by her name.

527
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,641
Okay, Sim Woojoo.

528
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,559
Is that better?

529
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,441
(chuckles awkwardly)

530
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,361
I thought you were going to Ilsan.
Don't you have to go?

531
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,822
(Sunwoo chuckles)

532
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,615
Well, I'll go first.

533
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,162
Take care driving at night,
and call me when you're about to leave.

534
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,540
(Sunwoo sighs)

535
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,345
-(sighs)
-(feet stomping)

536
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,433
(heavy footsteps)

537
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,562
(cart wheels rolling)

538
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,450
(man 2 straining)

539
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,535
(cart wheels rolling)

540
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,037
YURI: Right.

541
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,289
Did you pack the pamphlets
with the fair map

542
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,665
that were delivered this morning?

543
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,418
They're inside the yellow box in there.
I've marked them.

544
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,003
YURI: So you did pack them.

545
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,755
So…

546
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,218
Thank you for the good work thus far.

547
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,305
(mellow music playing)

548
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,400
(trunk lid thuds)

549
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,904
(moans)

550
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,240
-(door shuts)
-(trunk shuts)

551
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,955
(sighs)

552
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,250
(seat belt buckling up)

553
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,878
How long do you think it'll take us?

554
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,213
There's no traffic,

555
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,132
so we'll be there
in about two and a half hours.

556
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,135
I'm sorry, but please wake me up
when we arrive.

557
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,052
STAFF: Yes, sir.

558
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,768
The van just left.

559
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,272
I know. I wanted to talk to you,
so I waited.

560
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,735
I can be back at the office
by seven o'clock.

561
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,362
Please wait until then.
I'll come to get you.

562
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,117
Don't take these and go home alone.

563
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,455
I'll see you later.

564
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,030
HYUNJU: Why are you home already?
Are you done for the day?

565
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,333
(water pouring)

566
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,762
I didn't say I was thirsty.

567
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,555
What are you about to tell me?

568
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,686
Drink this whole thing,
and then I'll tell you.

569
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,524
Drink, it's lukewarm water.

570
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,528
JUN: Okay, have a good day.

571
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,614
JUN PHARMACY

572
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,241
JIGU: Hi.

573
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,993
JUN: Hey.

574
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,412
-Going to the practice room?
-JIGU: No. I can't today.

575
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,788
I'm taking Mom to the bus terminal.

576
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,624
(in English)
Oh, thank you.

577
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,168
(exclaims)

578
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,088
-(in Korean) Could I have a cheongsimhwan?
-Cheongsimhwan?

579
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,258
-Cheongsimhwan…
-(Jigu exhales refreshedly)

580
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,801
Why do you need it all of a sudden?

581
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,887
I don't know. Haesung told me to get it.
She'll pay for it too.

582
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,889
Where is she right now?

583
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,850
Home. She told me to come home too.

584
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,393
(gulping)

585
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,480
(gulping)

586
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,737
(mug thuds)

587
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,573
(breathing nervously)

588
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,412
(clicks tongue)

589
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:56,500
After your divorce and you got sick,

590
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,212
things that were
most difficult for me were…

591
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,964
(somber music playing)

592
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,799
…you not picking up your phone,

593
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,805
or Woojoo or Jigu calling me
at work out of the blue.

594
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,392
"Why are they calling me at this hour?"

595
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,771
"Did something happen again at home?"

596
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,566
Each time,

597
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,111
my heart would beat really fast,

598
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,113
and it was difficult.

599
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,284
I'm still like that.

600
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,955
My heart sinks
when Jigu suddenly calls me.

601
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,128
I think that's why I had such a hard time

602
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,216
telling you about how we lost the house.

603
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,471
"When should I call Mom

604
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,433
so that she wouldn't be in such a shock?"

605
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,435
(breathing deeply)

606
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,023
I'd mull it over
and then lose the opportunity.

607
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,983
Again and again…

608
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,615
(footsteps approaching)

609
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,785
HYUNJU: I know.

610
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,079
I understand what you kids
have gone through.

611
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,084
(footsteps approaching)

612
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,923
Yesterday…

613
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,426
I hit Woojoo.

614
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,761
I wanted it to hurt.

615
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,849
So I hit her with all my strength.

616
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,642
(trembles)

617
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,310
She didn't even squeak.

618
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,022
She's a former athlete,
and she just let me hit her.

619
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,861
(whimpering)

620
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,156
(sighs)

621
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,618
Mom, what do we do about Woojoo?

622
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,084
Han Dongjin…

623
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,046
Han Dongjin, that guy…

624
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,341
(whimpers)

625
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,011
He's that woman's son.

626
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,515
(whimpers)

627
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,643
(tearfully)
The man

628
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,148
our Woojoo loves so much is…

629
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,232
(sniffles)

630
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,029
He's the son of that woman.

631
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,448
Who?

632
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,533
(somber music builds)

633
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,576
Whose son?

634
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,578
(whimpering)

635
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,625
The woman who took our house.

636
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,295
Heeja?

637
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,883
Yes.

638
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,182
JIGU: Yes, that's right. It's Dongjin.

639
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,767
We're living together.

640
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,310
(yells)
You crazy idiot!

641
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,311
Are you insane?

642
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,562
I know everything.

643
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,690
I know what kind of relationship
Dongjin's mom and our mom have.

644
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,900
Didn't you already know this?

645
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,240
Darn it. I can't believe this.

646
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,077
(sighs)
This isn't right.

647
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:19,995
Huh?

648
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,707
You know this is messed up.

649
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,584
Be quiet and sit down.

650
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,920
(sighs)

651
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,258
Woojoo knew all along.

652
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,177
Back when I was staying at his house.

653
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,013
No, way before that, she already knew.

654
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,807
She knew and still dated him!

655
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,935
We don't need you
freaking out as well, so just stay quiet!

656
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,354
I just went over there and met that woman.

657
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,567
I even bowed to that woman like a fool!

658
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,988
I lowered my head to her
when I should have just ignored her!

659
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,322
So what?

660
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,367
Then go back and take your greeting back!

661
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,285
(scoffs)

662
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,121
Are you kidding me right now?

663
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,747
(shouts)
Both of you, just stop!

664
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,125
(trembling)

665
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,296
Mom…

666
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,006
Mom, have a cheongsimhwan.

667
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,760
-(bottle cap snaps)
-(whimpering) Please take it.

668
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,763
We can't have you faint from this.

669
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,891
Okay, Mom?

670
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,019
(bottle thuds)

671
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,273
(gulping)

672
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,571
(sniffles)

673
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,407
Does he know?

674
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,536
Did he meet her knowing this?

675
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,623
No, he didn't.

676
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,626
I don't think he knows.

677
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,049
(trembling)

678
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,592
JUN (on phone): Haesung is home right now.

679
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,594
WOOJOO: Yes.

680
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,138
JUN: Don't hate her.

681
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,349
It must've been hard for her
to come to that decision.

682
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,683
WOOJOO: I don't hate her.

683
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,395
JUN: Okay, I'll see you at home.

684
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,735
(hanging-up beep)

685
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,115
-(sighs)
-(somber music playing)

686
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,382
SIM WOOJOO

687
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,220
(nameplate clatters)

688
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,391
(lanyard thuds)

689
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,439
DONGJIN: I'm Han Dongjin from Best Fairs.

690
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,652
(music fades out)

691
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,531
I thought I recognized you from the back.

692
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:43,991
Hi, how are you?

693
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,201
EXHIBITION STAFF:
You could have just gotten the notes.

694
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,953
Why come here when you have a fair to run?

695
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,705
You sure work hard.

696
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,914
(exhales awkwardly)

697
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,083
If you have that much time,
let's get some tea.

698
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,710
Sure, let's do that.

699
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,049
EXHIBITION STAFF: It's an organizational
fair, so the budget is kind of tight,

700
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,761
but they can be helpful
for overseas fairs,

701
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,014
so even new companies
are jumping on the bid.

702
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,101
I guess it won't be easy.
The bidding competition must be tough too.

703
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,561
Quit whining.

704
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,564
Best Fairs is regarded
as a veteran-level company around here.

705
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,274
You know you'll crush it.

706
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,027
You received the invitation, right?

707
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,989
Yes. I'm going to take my team
and head over there on opening day.

708
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,035
I might as well collect some intelligence
on how an outdoor camping fair is run.

709
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,663
By the way, that man…

710
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,499
Isn't that CEO Choi Sunwoo?

711
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,711
EXHIBITION STAFF: It is him.

712
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,257
SUNWOO: The employees are all there.

713
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,218
I just got a call from them.

714
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:46,970
I mean…

715
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,432
I thought

716
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,018
I had to talk to you,

717
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,020
so I came all this way.

718
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,648
But this is…

719
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,152
I don't know if it's for your sake,
or I just don't want to be blamed later.

720
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,904
It's confusing.

721
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,241
Just tell me.
(sighs)

722
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,619
Once you tell me,
it's all my responsibility.

723
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,539
Whether I suffer or endure it…

724
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,584
I'll deal with it myself.

725
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,004
So if it's something
I should know, tell me.

726
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,008
It's about Ms. Sim Woojoo.

727
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,057
(melancholic music playing)

728
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,810
SUNWOO: Cha Youngmin came by the office.

729
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,728
He was asking to be rehired.

730
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,232
In the midst of talking,

731
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,902
he asked why Ms. Sim can be
given a chance and he can't.

732
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,240
He said that she helped him.
I didn't believe it either.

733
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,575
But…

734
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,287
he was dead serious about it,
and it was kind of concerning.

735
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,666
SUNWOO: According to him, she came to him…

736
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,253
and told him of her own accord.

737
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,465
DONGJIN: What did she tell him?

738
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,218
What did she tell him?

739
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,307
"You've been caught for being the spy."

740
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,143
"Han Dongjin knows all about it."

741
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,773
"So if you want to ruin
this company, then try harder."

742
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,153
So if you really want to ruin
this company, then try harder.

743
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,240
I asked her straight up.

744
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,702
I asked if she'd ever said that
to Cha Youngmin.

745
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,957
She said she had.

746
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,084
She admitted it outright.

747
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,222
(smacks lips, sighs)

748
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,225
Did you ask her why she did that?

749
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,394
SUNWOO: I did ask her.

750
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,688
She wouldn't tell me.

751
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,149
She just asked me for a favor.

752
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,444
She said that she'll tell you herself

753
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,238
after the fair is over.

754
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,785
She asked for more time saying
that's the only way you'd be hurt less.

755
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,498
But what would she know
when she's the one inflicting the pain?

756
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,375
SUNWOO: Pain is all the same.

757
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,627
There's no such thing
as one that hurts less.

758
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,470
(door opens)

759
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:35,889
(door shuts)

760
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,874
Wait inside.

761
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,293
(Jun exhales)

762
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:12,884
I was

763
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:14,928
being careless.

764
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,389
Please don't be mad.

765
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,601
Haesung.

766
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,689
You said you still wouldn't tell me…

767
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,818
even if it happened again.

768
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,320
You're right.

769
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,823
You wouldn't tell me.

770
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,453
That's your loyalty toward Woojoo.

771
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,706
I do understand.

772
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,332
But…

773
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,838
It just…

774
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,300
hurts a lot.

775
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,635
So…

776
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,307
I'm no longer going to like you.

777
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,350
(somber song playing)

778
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,061
Don't talk to me anymore.

779
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,149
Let's just be…

780
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,860
how we were before.

781
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,703
(female vocals singing)

782
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,132
HYUNJU: I heard you met Heeja's son.

783
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,760
But he was still looking for us.

784
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,887
To apologize to us.

785
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,556
I also told him that it wasn't his fault.

786
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,853
Just like how we suffered because of Dad,

787
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,898
he seemed like

788
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,235
he suffered a lot because of his mom.

789
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,904
WOOJOO: So I forgave him.

790
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,074
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The number you dialed is turned off.

791
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,119
Please record your message after the beep…

792
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,247
The number you dialed is turned off…

793
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,456
(Jigu snorts)

794
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:15,966
(smacks lips)

795
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:16,883
She's not answering.

796
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,846
Her phone's been turned off all day.

797
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,806
Call…

798
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,060
Call him.

799
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,937
Ask him if he's with her.

800
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,647
What if he says he is?

801
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,567
Tell him everything?

802
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,116
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The number you dialed is turned off.

803
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,910
Please record your message after the--

804
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,370
(hanging-up beep)

805
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,707
(somber music)

806
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,342
SUNWOO: Dongjin knows everything.

807
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,720
CEO CHOI SUNWOO:
DONGJIN KNOWS EVERYTHING.

808
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,940
(breathes deeply)

809
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,411
-(song ends)
-(phone vibrating)

810
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:53,832
Where are you?

811
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,047
Why did you turn off your phone?
I told you to wait for me at the office.

812
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,137
(inhales deeply)

813
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,389
Where are you?

814
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,476
You heard everything.

815
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,313
You should be asking about that first.

816
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,150
WOOJOO: I warned you.

817
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,569
I'm evil and selfish.

818
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,738
(somber music playing)

819
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,241
I blatantly lied to you
and manipulated you.

820
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,826
DONGJIN: I know you're not like that.

821
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,249
I know you're not that type of person.

822
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,878
DONGJIN: It was back
when Mr. Cha was still with us,

823
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,047
and we weren't seeing
each other like this.

824
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,674
It wasn't something major
that you lied about.

825
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,969
And I'm okay with it.

826
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:53,183
So it's all good. Nothing changes.

827
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,227
Let's meet up.

828
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,730
Let's talk in person.

829
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,526
(hanging-up beep)

830
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:06,863
(sniffles)

831
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,376
(shuddering)

832
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,761
(sighs)

833
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,014
(vehicle approaching)

834
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,376
This was my home.

835
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,506
I lived here for over 20 years.

836
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,051
All the happiness,

837
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,803
sorrow,

838
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,972
and pain from my life…

839
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,934
They're all in that house.

840
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:25,400
And someone took that house from us.

841
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,196
WOOJOO: I've lived there for 20 years,
and I got kicked out of there in 2 days.

842
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,032
HEEJA: What about this house?

843
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,452
How many times do I have
to tell you this house is mine?

844
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:40,081
The deed of our house got transferred
to a total stranger overnight.

845
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,375
DONGJIN: What happened to the people
who were living here before?

846
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,586
HEEJA (yells): How would I know the phone
numbers of the kids I kicked out?

847
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,546
WOOJOO: You look well.

848
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,674
Like someone
who's forgotten all about the past.

849
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,050
HEEJA: Honey.

850
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,927
Dongjin is here.

851
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,015
I found out
that my father was having an affair.

852
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,391
WOOJOO: Why do you keep saying sorry?

853
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,518
You don't even know
what it means to be truly sorry.

854
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,647
I wanted to take my revenge,

855
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,066
and I wanted payback.

856
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,572
I realized only too late
that it was a mistake.

857
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,327
(sentimental music playing)

858
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,211
I'm sorry.

859
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,386
I'm most sorry to you, Mr. Han.

860
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,640
(sighs nervously)

861
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,068
(breathes deeply)

862
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,455
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

863
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,255
(sighs nervously)

864
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,717
It must've been hard by yourself.

865
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:17,971
(Dongjin sighs)

866
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,308
Now that I know…

867
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:25,979
(sighs in relief)

868
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,232
…if you could give me some time--

869
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,525
WOOJOO: What are you doing?

870
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,153
You should be mad.

871
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,825
"How could you do this to me?"

872
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,121
"You had so many chances to tell me,
so how could you deceive me like this?"

873
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,289
You should be yelling at me.

874
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,751
You just got stabbed in the back.

875
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:53,256
You got played by a woman
who was determined to deceive you.

876
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,757
(music fades out)

877
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,551
Aren't you upset at all?

878
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,891
Why are you sorry?

879
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

880
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,943
But in the end,

881
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,779
you couldn't take your revenge on me.

882
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,578
I wasn't ruined.

883
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,090
DONGJIN: Right now I'm just…

884
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,512
(shuddering)

885
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,597
I'm sad.

886
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,934
(under breath)
I'm sorry.

887
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,938
It's all my fault.
(whimpers)

888
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,070
(Woojoo sniffles)

889
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,822
(song with male vocals playing)

890
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,413
(inaudible crying)

891
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,409
(song continues)
