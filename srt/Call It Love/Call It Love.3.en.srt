EPISODE 3

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,713
SUNWOO (chuckles awkwardly): Uh, ma'am...

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,842
You... you can't suddenly just request us
to return the money like that.

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,594
Uh, when you just gave it to us
a month ago, right?

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,013
(Heeja scoffs)

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,765
HEEJA:
Did I ask you to return the money to me?

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,768
I thought I was asking Dongjin
to return it.

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,311
In that case,

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,313
could you please give us
a few more weeks to get it?

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,231
(taps)

11
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,442
SUNWOO: It's just that,
we're kind of in a tight spot.

12
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,863
Why do I have to beg you,
just to get back all the cash I lent?

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,158
Look, I don't care. Just return it all.
(grunts)

14
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,326
I have my own reasons
for wanting it, okay?

15
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,582
DONGJIN: Give us your bank account number.
(inhales sharply)

16
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,377
I never felt comfortable
borrowing that money from you anyway.

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,795
So don't worry.

18
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,715
-I'll give it back to you.
-SUNWOO: Wait.

19
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,760
Hey, uh, Dongjin. Uh...

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,970
Take care, ma'am.

21
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,639
(Sunwoo grunts softly)

22
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,976
(breathes deeply)

23
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,063
(groans)

24
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,193
That son of mine is
just like his father...

25
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,820
(clicks tongue)
I don't know why he's so weak.

26
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,701
(somber music)

27
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,303
(feet stomping)

28
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,894
That money.

29
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,230
We should return it.

30
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,024
(chuckles, inhales sharply)

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,776
Yeah, sure.

32
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,822
It's not like we were ever
really flush with cash.

33
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,576
SUNWOO: Just talk to me.

34
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,412
If you're going through something then...

35
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,581
Well, I'm around, man,
if you need help, okay?

36
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,585
I'll think about it.

37
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,388
(theme music)

38
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:14,485
CALL IT LOVE

39
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,322
(tires screeching)

40
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,246
That little jerk. Hey!

41
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,540
JUHO (shouts): Han Dongjin!

42
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,666
Damnit, man.

43
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,544
JUHO:
How in the hell could you do this to me?

44
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,463
You hear me, Dongjin?

45
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,633
(heavy footsteps approaching)

46
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
(tense music)

47
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,641
-JUHO: What the--
-(Woojoo gasps)

48
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,476
You...

49
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,691
(tense music)

50
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,277
(Juho groans)

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,321
(Juho breathing heavily)

52
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,989
JUHO: Who the hell are you?
(pants)

53
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,282
Are you okay, sir?

54
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,825
JUHO: Damnit.

55
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,036
-Hey, I asked you who you are.
-Let me help you up.

56
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,829
Sim Woojoo.

57
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,122
(sharp exhale)

58
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,207
(Juho scoffs)

59
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,708
Did I ask you for your name?

60
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,086
-Get off me, you bastard!
-(groans)

61
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,379
(Dongjin grunts)

62
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,090
(sharp exhale)
Are you blind, lady?

63
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,217
JUHO: I'm obviously a higher rank than him

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,718
and I look older.

65
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,930
So if you were going to shove anyone,
it should have been this bastard here.

66
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,723
How dare you push me!

67
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,267
Please, just talk to me, sir.

68
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,185
-All right?
-Got anything to say?

69
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,228
(sighs)

70
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,896
WOOJOO: Leave me out of your fight.

71
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,690
Looks like you're not injured.

72
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,694
Let me know if you're gonna hit him again,
I'll call the police.

73
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,903
Are you serious?

74
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,488
Is she drunk or just nuts?

75
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,491
I did drink a little, but I'm not nuts.

76
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,535
-(Juho sighs)
-Sim Woojoo. Please go.

77
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,828
DONGJIN: You're not helping.

78
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,872
I was gonna leave anyway
after saying one last thing to you.

79
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,584
Being nice doesn't mean
you wait for a wild boar to come

80
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,794
and just charge at you.

81
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,546
WOOJOO: It just makes you dumb.

82
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,424
You little...

83
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,426
Just thought you should know that.

84
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,095
(Juho splutters)
Boar?

85
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,763
Hey! Hey!

86
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,641
Did she just say that I was a wild boar?

87
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,935
Let go of me. Hey!

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,813
(grunts)
Let go, dammit.

89
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,983
JUHO (sighs): Seriously.

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,818
(Juho sighs)

91
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,864
(irritated sigh)

92
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,874
SEKANG PORK RINDS

93
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,130
-DRIVER: Here's the keys to his car.
-DONGJIN: Ah...

94
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,549
-Thanks so much.
-Take care of him. Good night, sir.

95
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:49,390
(background chatter)

96
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,269
(Juho sighs)

97
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,813
Did you, uh, obtain the keys?

98
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,108
He's had two bottles already.

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,819
Be quiet and pour me something to drink.

100
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,704
(gulping)

101
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,498
(exhales deeply)

102
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,416
You know what?

103
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,709
(inhales deeply)

104
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,919
There was only one person

105
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,546
who knew my wife ran off
with that neighbor.

106
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,341
You know? So it had to be you, Dongjin.

107
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,260
I trusted you

108
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,429
'cause no matter how damn drunk you were,

109
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,348
you kept a secret.

110
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,851
(Juho scoffs, chuckling)

111
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,103
JUHO: Stupid of me.

112
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,104
(gulps)

113
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,940
My relationship was destroyed
because of another man,

114
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,775
so what does that mean for me then?

115
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,318
(Juho chuckles)

116
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,945
Oh, Mr. Kim, sir,

117
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,030
-that actually wasn't him that leaked...
-(taps)

118
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,907
(sighs)

119
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,826
Never mind.

120
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,452
Sir, we're deeply sorry.

121
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,287
We will take full responsibility for that.

122
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,333
(exhales sharply)

123
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,627
Earlier today...

124
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,506
my wife had just sent
the divorce paperwork.

125
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,718
JUHO: So I was as mad as I could be,

126
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,596
and you were an easy target.

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,516
(Juho breathes deeply)

128
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,644
You should treat
that female employee to a meal.

129
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,939
JUHO: I mean, she...

130
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,150
actually stopped me from hitting Dongjin.

131
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,985
She shoved me out of the way!

132
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:24,902
Huh?

133
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,446
An employee?

134
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,488
(Juho sighs)

135
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,740
JUHO: Dongjin, I envy you.

136
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,285
(chuckles)
You have a girl who wants to protect you.

137
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,290
(gulping)

138
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,959
(Juho exhales sharply)

139
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,377
Excuse us, um...

140
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,005
Can we get a bowl of noodles, please?

141
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,593
You should eat something, sir.
The noodles will help.

142
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,012
(background chatter)

143
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,934
(gulping)

144
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,147
(Sunwoo chuckles)

145
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,525
SUNWOO: So she saw you,
and only you, and thought,

146
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,069
"I can't just stand by
and watch that man get hurt."

147
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,070
Goodness.

148
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,823
(chuckling)

149
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,575
(inhales sharply)

150
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,871
I had no idea Ms. Baek had
romantic feelings for you like that.

151
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,041
It's not like that.

152
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,751
SUNWOO: Come on, man.

153
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,129
I mean, Baek Soohee tends to ignore
what I say,

154
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,425
but she really follows your every word
like she's going to church on Sunday.

155
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,594
Nah, she doesn't.

156
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,973
Listen, if you two tie the knot,
then I will drop you a nice check,

157
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,391
hmm, as your gift.

158
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,602
(Sunwoo chuckles)

159
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,270
The girl I was with tonight...

160
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,648
(inhales sharply)

161
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,107
...it wasn't Ms. Baek, all right?

162
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,984
(chuckles)

163
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,986
Then who was it then, huh?

164
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,782
Hey, what female employee
is gonna stay extra late

165
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,908
working with you like that?

166
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,118
Baek Soohee would be
the only one who'd do that.

167
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,330
It was Sim Woojoo.

168
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,915
Sim Woojoo, huh?
(soft gasp)

169
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:02,833
What?

170
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,877
You mean the part-timer?

171
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,505
(Sunwoo exclaims)

172
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,631
(tires screech)

173
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,550
-(bumps)
-JUHO: Oh! My head!

174
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,094
(groans in pain)
I bumped my head...

175
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,262
(exhales deeply)

176
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,641
(sighs)

177
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,727
Why meet up with her at night?

178
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,980
Are you seeing that girl?

179
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,234
Ah... You are.

180
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,319
(Sunwoo chuckles, mumbles)

181
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,283
(Sunwoo and Dongjin grunting)

182
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,867
DONGJIN: I asked her to come see me.

183
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,703
We both live in the same neighborhood.

184
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,955
-What?
-Hold him up! Hold him up!

185
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,290
Hold him up.

186
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,666
-(Dongjin grunts)
-(Juho snoring)

187
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,378
I just found out
my man asked some girl out at night.

188
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,380
SUNWOO: Come on, man.
How could I not be surprised?

189
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,134
But uh, you're dating the spy,
isn't that weird?

190
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,302
It's problematic.

191
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,971
The spy is someone else.

192
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,472
Sim Woojoo is innocent.

193
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,890
Huh?

194
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,269
Yeah, but you know,
no woman is completely innocent.

195
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,353
Let's get him inside.

196
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,855
(Dongjin and Sunwoo grunt)

197
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,897
Um...

198
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,191
Wait, you must be joking right now?

199
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,818
You can't be serious, Dongjin.

200
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,572
SUNWOO: This isn't some kinda...
elaborate prank?

201
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,283
I confirmed it earlier.

202
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,493
I saw President Shin and Mr. Cha meet.

203
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,334
(indistinct chatter)

204
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,467
(somber music)

205
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,510
(frustrated groan)

206
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,388
(inhales deeply)
No thanks, water's not gonna help.

207
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,892
Wow, I've never felt this betrayed
in my life.

208
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,144
I mean, how am I supposed
to trust anyone again?

209
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,522
-This is nothing, Sunwoo.
-Huh?

210
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,690
(scoffs)
No?

211
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,567
How would this mean nothing?

212
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,529
I mean, I can still remember his face
from that day, you know?

213
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,572
'Cause he was all like,

214
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,199
"There's no way it was him."

215
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,533
There's no way it was him.

216
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,327
"I'll be responsible if it was though."

217
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,621
I'll be responsible if it was.

218
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,582
How can he stab us in the back
with that look on his face?

219
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,958
It's so terrifying.

220
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,336
(Sunwoo sighs)

221
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,838
(distressed sigh)

222
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,884
You know I've never liked japchae, right?

223
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,893
My mom always made japchae for me
each time she remarried.

224
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,980
DONGJIN:
I've eaten that japchae three times,

225
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,818
and each time, I said to myself...

226
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,861
"Not again."

227
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,242
But every time, I was wrong.

228
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,330
She betrayed her son's trust in her
every single time.

229
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,128
SUNWOO: Your mother...
was married four times?

230
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,090
I never knew that.

231
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,675
(scoffs softly)

232
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,263
-DONGJIN: Let's get going.
-SUNWOO: Hold on.

233
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,472
(Sunwoo grunts)

234
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,683
SUNWOO: Oh, come on, man.

235
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,686
How is that supposed
to make me feel better, huh?

236
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,229
It makes me feel bad for you.

237
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,897
-DONGJIN: Go on.
-SUNWOO: Wait!

238
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,151
(soft guitar music)

239
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,955
(soft groan)

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,876
(gasps)

241
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,132
Uh, are you okay?

242
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,925
The alarm didn't ring yet.

243
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,343
(groans)

244
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,429
Why do you do this?

245
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,973
So, about the test.

246
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,309
WOOJOO: You have less than 50 days left.

247
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,269
Last year,
you failed by only three points,

248
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,854
so this year, you'll pass, right?

249
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,815
I'm not trying to pressure you,
so don't feel pressured about it.

250
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,819
Look, what you're asking right now

251
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,362
is like asking a chain smoker

252
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,156
when he'll quit smoking cigarettes
every day.

253
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,909
JIGU: Ugh, you're so mean. Seriously.

254
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
You little shit, you smoke?

255
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,453
(Jigu groans)

256
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,663
Yes, I smoke!

257
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,332
I've served in the army.

258
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,250
I'm old enough to smoke
if I feel like it, okay?

259
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,711
(groans)

260
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,087
That's true.

261
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,590
You should be the one
to live a carefree life.

262
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,592
JIGU: What's your problem?
You're scaring me.

263
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,302
Okay, sleep.

264
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,853
(sighs)

265
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,987
Why'd you come here and wake me up anyway?

266
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,948
(sighs)

267
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,992
They say that
moms think of their children.

268
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,411
So they can stand their stupid husbands.

269
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,997
I wanted to see if I could stand it better

270
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,332
if I looked at my baby brother.

271
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,710
But after seeing how small your room is,
I decided I won't.

272
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,839
I'm gonna go to work.

273
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,050
The boss wants me to come to work,
so I can't stay home, right?

274
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,803
Why should I be scared?

275
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,304
I haven't done anything.

276
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,265
Woojoo, wait.

277
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,558
Hmm?

278
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,228
Close the door.

279
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,980
It gets drafty.

280
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,486
(door slides close)

281
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,329
(line ringing)

282
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,373
-(door closes)
-(electronic chime)

283
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,834
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The person you are trying to reach

284
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,751
cannot come to the phone--

285
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,752
WOOJOO: Where is he?

286
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,170
(phone chimes)

287
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,881
(line ringing)

288
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,344
(ringing continues)

289
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,936
(ringing continues)

290
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,273
JUN (over phone): Hey.

291
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,983
Where are you? You weren't home.

292
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,152
JUN: At the pharmacy.
Do you need something?

293
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,403
I made us all some soup.

294
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,529
(sighs)

295
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,990
Next time, can you just... send me a text?

296
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,991
You don't have to call.

297
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,744
I'm too lazy to type on the phone.

298
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,871
If you're lazy, why are we talking?

299
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,708
By the way, why do you keep whispering?

300
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,460
-(horn honking)
-I'm not.

301
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,129
(engine revving)

302
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,966
(engine rumbling)

303
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,472
Are you outside?

304
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,433
JUN: No.

305
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,061
I, uh...

306
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,563
left the pharmacy door open
to let some air in.

307
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,857
Then why do I sense
that you're kinda near here?

308
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,905
WOOJOO: Yoon Jun.

309
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,282
Do you wanna come out
like a normal person,

310
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,327
or should I pull you out by the ear
on the count of three?

311
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,371
-WOOJOO: One, two--
-(sighs)

312
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,289
Fine. I'll come out
before you finish the countdown.

313
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,041
JUN: So it's still kinda normal.

314
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,627
(sighs, chuckles softly)

315
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,878
(inhales sharply)

316
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,380
I shouldn't have answered your phone call.

317
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,508
(smacks lips)
That's what gave it away, right?

318
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,426
It was a critical mistake.

319
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,680
I know what you're trying to do.
Forget it.

320
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,598
Mm-mm. No, you forget it.

321
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,019
Because today, I'm gonna find out
where you've been working these days.

322
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,271
JUN: I've already had breakfast.

323
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,315
And that means I'm determined to find out.

324
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,358
(chuckles)

325
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,567
That's cute.

326
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,779
(soft music)

327
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,825
(panting)

328
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,742
Dammit.

329
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,248
(controlled breathing)

330
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,590
(panting)

331
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,676
(panting continues)

332
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,064
(breathes heavily)

333
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,402
(panting)

334
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,947
Oh, timeout!

335
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,116
(Woojoo panting)

336
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,536
You know I'm a record holder
of the Chuncheon Marathon.

337
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,537
Give up, okay?

338
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,331
(sighs)
All right, I'll tell you.

339
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,251
-I work over there.
-Over where?

340
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,502
(sighs)

341
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,337
It's around here, okay?

342
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,174
I'm giving away a lot already
telling you this much.

343
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,091
(sighs)

344
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,636
(panting)

345
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,554
One week.

346
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,306
-(Jun sniffs)
-(pants)

347
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,307
I'm not joking.

348
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,475
I give you one week.

349
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,769
Whether it's revenge
or to confess your love,

350
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,145
just get it done and come back to work.

351
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,148
(sighs)
And if I say no?

352
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,107
(scoffs)

353
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,319
If you continue to work there
after a week's gone by...

354
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,112
(sighs)

355
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,198
...I'm just gonna have to make a call
to your mother in Tongyeong.

356
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,408
"Hello, ma'am. Did you know Woojoo--"

357
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,410
Don't call my mom, I'm warning you!

358
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,536
I won't see you anymore.

359
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,830
(sighs)

360
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,417
Then let's not see each other.

361
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,377
(mellow music)

362
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,296
And that means you'd have to move out.

363
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,174
Yoon Jun.

364
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,593
Are you telling me
to move out of your house right now?

365
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,552
(scoffs)

366
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,221
Didn't you beg us to move in with you?

367
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,223
I did.
(inhales deeply)

368
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,184
I thought it would be fun
having all of us there living together.

369
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,937
JUN:
So, I begged you to move into my house.

370
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,898
That's why. Hmm?

371
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,317
That's why me saying
"I won't see you again", is serious.

372
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,071
(breathes deeply)

373
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,697
JUN: If I didn't know anything, fine.

374
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,658
But now that I know,
I can't let you do that.

375
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,911
I'm just looking out for you, okay? Okay?

376
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,997
Let's not see each other again, then.

377
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,415
What?

378
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,211
I've thought about it
every minute of every day.

379
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,505
"What do I know about revenge, huh?

380
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,966
Just forget it. Patience is a virtue."

381
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,594
But those aren't even my ideas.

382
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,680
That's what my mom
had to keep telling herself.

383
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,725
I still think my mom should have
at the very least...

384
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,187
just pulled that woman's hair out
the day she found out about it all.

385
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,232
Then maybe she wouldn't
have gotten cancer, I think.

386
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,362
So I have to do something, you know?

387
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,115
I'll lose my mind if I don't do anything.

388
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,160
(mellow music continues)

389
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,330
(sniffles)

390
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,250
TAERANG BUILDING

391
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,394
JUHO: Dongjin, I envy you.
(chuckles)

392
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,521
You have a girl who wants to protect you.

393
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,818
(mellow music continues)

394
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,920
DONGJIN: Uh...

395
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,340
(whispers)
What's with today? My gosh.

396
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,971
Hey, do you know that guy back there?

397
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,806
No. Never met him before.

398
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,684
Well, you may not know him
but he seems to know you.

399
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,813
JUN: He keeps looking at you.

400
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,523
Like he wants to tell you something.

401
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,445
(elevator bell dings)

402
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,624
You're late.

403
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,627
For me, but not work though.

404
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,883
-So yesterday--
-WOOJOO: Let me just say first.

405
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,178
I wasn't trying to help
or defend you yesterday, all right?

406
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,806
It was just instinct.

407
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,892
'Cause that was clear to me
that you were about to be attacked.

408
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,103
So there is no need
to try to thank me for it.

409
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,604
Well, thank you.

410
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,856
I'm being serious.

411
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,941
I don't wanna hear it.

412
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,237
You really like to make things, um...

413
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,240
(Dongjin inhales sharply)

414
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,366
DONGJIN: Let's go in.

415
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,827
Why don't you finish your sentences?

416
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,204
I make things more what?

417
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,332
More, um...

418
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,834
(clicks tongue)

419
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,210
...amusing in a way.

420
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,382
Amusing... Amusing.

421
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,968
Have you ever actually met a funny person?

422
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,429
Who are you to say I'm amusing?
(scoffs)

423
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,513
(inhales deeply)

424
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,640
(exhales deeply)

425
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,725
(Dongjin inhales sharply)

426
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,476
DONGJIN: Can you...

427
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,270
come to my office a quarter past ten?

428
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,313
Ya?

429
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,273
Go on in.

430
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,199
(indistinct chatter)

431
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,499
(distant phone ringing)

432
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,252
(indistinct chatter)

433
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,258
You're not actually here to work, are you?

434
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,344
What's it to you?

435
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,306
MINSOO: You must have thick skin
to come back here.

436
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,849
YURI: Is she crazy?

437
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,601
Can't you work anywhere else?

438
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,063
DONGJIN: Ms. Sim will be joining us again,
starting today.

439
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,939
-YURI: What?
-MINSOO: Oh, hello, sir.

440
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,108
Come see me if you have an issue.

441
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,486
I asked her to return back to the office.

442
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,737
(disapproving sigh)

443
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,534
Let's get back to work.

444
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,413
(employees murmuring)

445
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,507
Just be yourself.

446
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,133
DONGJIN: Don't let them bully you.

447
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,968
Mm.

448
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:07,928
(elevator bell dings)

449
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,558
Was he waiting for me
because he knew this would happen?

450
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,771
Get to work.

451
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,869
(water running)

452
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,996
YOUNGMIN: Good morning.

453
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,790
-EMPLOYEES: Good morning.
-YURI: Good morning, sir.

454
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,458
-MALE EMPLOYEE: Good morning, sir.
-(quietly) Look, look...

455
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,127
Do you have something in your eye?

456
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,586
No. Look over there, it's Woojoo.

457
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,963
Hmm?

458
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,134
(water running)

459
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,556
President Han asked her
to return to the office.

460
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,683
Seriously though, why is she here?

461
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,560
YOUNGMIN: Yes.

462
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,228
I'm curious as well.

463
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,021
YURI: What?

464
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,731
-(distant phone ringing)
-YOUNGMIN: Did you work on the data?

465
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,400
Give it to me.

466
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,778
DONGJIN: So we need about 90 more booths
to reach our target?

467
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,449
YOUNGMIN: There's a number of companies
that have verbally agreed to participate,

468
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,201
so you can assume that we have
more or less reached our target.

469
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,079
But I have to say thanks to you two
convincing Mr. Kim to attend,

470
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,664
the Business Team can catch a break.

471
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,708
Just thinking about
having to persuade him,

472
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,168
kept me up all night.
(chuckles)

473
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,169
(scoffs)

474
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,881
-How's it possible your skin's so nice?
-Skin?

475
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,843
For someone who didn't sleep enough,
I find your skin way too clean.

476
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,052
Can you please not lie?

477
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,220
Uh...
(chuckles awkwardly)

478
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,097
I'm blessed with some naturally good skin.

479
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,850
Uh, I've never had any acne,
even in my early years.

480
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,143
Interesting.

481
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,354
Is never getting a pimple something
that an adult should brag on about?

482
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,647
It's conceited of you!

483
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,860
Did I, uh, do something wrong?

484
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,785
Who here doesn't know
that I'm a bit of a weirdo?

485
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,454
Forget it, just let it go.

486
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,955
I haven't been around as of late.

487
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,042
I'm just very irritated. I'm sorry.

488
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,006
-(door opens)
-I'll go talk to him.

489
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,424
-(footsteps receding)
-(door opens)

490
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,800
(smacks lips)
Well, I guess that's all today.

491
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,013
Excuse me.

492
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,599
YOUNGMIN: Can you tell me something, sir?

493
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,684
So, Ms. Sim...

494
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,062
Why is she here with us, again?

495
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,939
(knocks on door)

496
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,025
(distant phone ringing)

497
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,157
Starting from today,
she'll be working with the Business Unit.

498
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,331
(rattling)

499
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,046
DONGJIN: Why did you lower the blinds?

500
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,383
To make him curious.

501
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,970
Mr. Cha doesn't seem to know
that he's been found out.

502
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,430
WOOJOO: It seemed like you wanted
to torment him a bit,

503
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,807
so I thought I'd help.

504
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,730
So, uh...

505
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,441
Why do I have to be on the Business Team?

506
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,405
Not telling Mr. Cha about it
isn't to torment him,

507
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,157
but also prevent others
from behaving like he would.

508
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,370
The President Shin I know is relentless.

509
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,913
He's not going to stop it.

510
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,792
I want to avoid
having to suspect my own staff.

511
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,586
Over and over.

512
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,505
DONGJIN: So...

513
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,757
I would like your help with that.

514
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,430
(soft music)

515
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,851
So are you telling me
to keep an eye on him, then?

516
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,690
I'm asking a favor...

517
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,236
but also telling you as your boss.

518
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,741
What if I decide to team up
with Mr. Cha, what then?

519
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,954
I mean,
all I have to do is say I'll do it.

520
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,541
And instead, I can work with him
and even accept President Shin's money

521
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,626
and not tell you about it.

522
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,088
I've only been working here
for three weeks.

523
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,673
You trust me?

524
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,676
WOOJOO: You really are naive.

525
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,681
I trust that you are not
easily manipulated.

526
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,645
DONGJIN:
Also, I don't really have an alternative.

527
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,606
Asking and begging are my choices.

528
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,317
My only options.

529
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,153
(soft music continues)

530
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,114
(flustered sigh)

531
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,618
Don't try to look pitiful.

532
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,994
I don't intend to help you.

533
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,441
WOOJOO:
So I have to do something, you know?

534
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,361
I'll lose my mind if I don't do anything.

535
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,031
(mellow music)

536
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,958
JUN: Hey there.

537
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,084
JIGU: Hello, welcome.

538
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,919
Iced Americano, extra shot.

539
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,921
JIGU: Okay, one extra shot,
iced Americano.

540
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,506
4,500 won, please.
(gasps)

541
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,594
Jun...

542
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,096
(nervous chuckle)

543
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:48,977
(cash register dings)

544
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,104
(upbeat music playing)

545
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,530
Jun.

546
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,031
So you know...

547
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,701
I've only been working here about a week.

548
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,910
Honestly.

549
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,454
Okay then,

550
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,622
why am I the one who caught you?

551
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,374
It's not fair.
(scoffs)

552
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,126
(inhales sharply)

553
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,878
Will you please not tell Woojoo?

554
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,088
I wanna write music.

555
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,089
Ah.

556
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,800
-I didn't hear that.
-Hey, listen, okay?

557
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,760
Jun.
(smacks lips)

558
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,721
My plan was to study hard for two years
after getting out of the army.

559
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,806
If I gave it everything
but still didn't pass the exams,

560
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,891
it's no big deal.

561
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,517
So after spending two years in the army,

562
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,478
and then another two years
studying hard for school,

563
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,062
I think I should go
and do what I want now.

564
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,314
That's enough.

565
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:35,857
I got it.

566
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,905
You won't tell Woojoo at all?

567
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,865
It's not that I won't,

568
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,284
-I can't.
-(breathes deeply)

569
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,953
(soft chuckle)

570
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,289
Jun.

571
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,834
For real...

572
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,337
Thank you.

573
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,214
Thank you so much.

574
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,423
(Jigu moans)

575
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,510
-Cut that out.
-Right.

576
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,558
Mark my words, man.

577
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,936
It's not because I'm looking out
on your behalf.

578
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,312
(agreed groan)

579
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,941
Jun, seriously,
why the heck are you in Seoul?

580
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,192
JIGU: Hmm?

581
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,653
Shouldn't you be at Haeinsa
or some other great temple? Seriously?

582
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,238
(claps)
Oh, Great One.

583
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,740
I pray. Please, make this humble human
do the chores.

584
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,784
JIGU: Oh, I'll even clean the bathrooms.

585
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,619
Oh, Great One!
(laughs)

586
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,205
Need anything else?

587
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,332
Enjoy your coffee.
(chuckles)

588
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,296
(sighs deeply)

589
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,299
I wonder when he'll learn.

590
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,136
I bet he doesn't even know
about the cash Woojoo's saving.

591
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,598
FEMALE EMPLOYEE:
Okay, good work, everyone.

592
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,850
I'm heading out.

593
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,977
-EMPLOYEES: Have a good evening.
-EUNHEE: Have a good night!

594
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,815
(banknote counter whirring)

595
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,942
(whirring continues)

596
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,404
Hey, is the calculation off?

597
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,197
NARAE:
She can't hear anything you say right now.

598
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,660
It's something she does
every time she gets out of a relationship.

599
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,829
-EUNHEE: She does that again and again.
-(Jihyung sighs)

600
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,039
She'll be recounting
those figures all night.

601
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,624
NARAE: Times like these,
she does her best work.

602
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,709
Go ahead, keep working.

603
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,503
(sighs)
What a weird thing to do.

604
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,589
We're leaving.

605
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,133
JIHYUNG: Don't work too hard.

606
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,264
(papers rustling)

607
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,143
(Jun sniffs)

608
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,437
(soft music)

609
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,231
(soft grunt)

610
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,859
JUN PHARMACY

611
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,736
(sighs)

612
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,865
(breathes deeply)

613
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,329
(keyboard clacking)

614
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,374
(footsteps approaching)

615
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,963
Oh, um, hey, aren't you gonna go home?

616
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,882
HAESUNG:
Uh, I'll set the alarm before I head out,

617
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,467
so you can head home if you want to.

618
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,218
Have a good night then.

619
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,352
(papers rustling)

620
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,188
While you work, be sure to stay hydrated.

621
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,610
YOU ARE AMAZING

622
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,829
Well, I guess... I should be on my way.

623
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,539
You know...

624
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,381
I could misunderstand this.

625
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,799
Uh...

626
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,467
Why did it have to be a heart?

627
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,219
I'll assign meaning to it.

628
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,055
-SUHO: I got that from someone earlier.
-I never noticed.

629
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,141
(romantic music)

630
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,227
But you're actually quite handsome.

631
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,520
What?

632
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,563
"Park Suho."

633
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,025
SECURITY GUARD
PARK SUHO

634
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,194
Your name is romantic-sounding.

635
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,990
Women are... moved

636
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,075
by really small kind gestures like this,
you know?

637
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,369
And...

638
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,831
I was moved by this gesture so...

639
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,251
(clears throat)

640
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,670
Um... Okay...

641
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,632
(romantic music continues)

642
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,564
"You are amazing."
(soft chuckle)

643
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,025
HAESUNG: You are amazing!

644
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,151
(giggles)

645
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,737
JUN: So, did you confess your love?

646
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,824
Are you rubbing it in?

647
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,617
Well, did you?

648
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,415
"Your crazy mother sold our house
and gave you the money,

649
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,666
so I'm plotting revenge."

650
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,210
That's not a heartfelt confession of love,
all right?

651
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,337
-It's just a confession.
-(scoffs)

652
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,674
Oh, good. You've regained your sanity,
you're finally making some sense.

653
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,842
You having fun?

654
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,177
Oh, yeah.

655
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,970
This is most definitely entertaining.

656
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,849
Oh.

657
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,559
How's this for entertaining, huh?

658
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,773
So the guy... wants me to keep an eye
on the spy in his company.

659
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,903
He's giving a fish to a cat,
and he says that he trusts me.

660
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:32,987
(scoffs)

661
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,782
How can he be the head of a company?

662
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,409
He's so full of weak spots,
it's ridiculous.

663
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,829
There's two presidents, but only he works.

664
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,165
That just proves how dumb he is.

665
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,377
-(sighs)
-I'm asking just in case.

666
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,504
(Jun clears throat)

667
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,838
He's handsome to you, right?

668
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,549
-What?
-You heard me.

669
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,884
Are you attracted to him?

670
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,179
Why would you ask me that, Jun?

671
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,680
(chuckles)

672
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,142
You must,
especially since you can't answer me.

673
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,978
What do his looks
have to do with anything?

674
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,563
He's still my sworn enemy.

675
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,190
Well, that's good.

676
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,525
I thought you forgot.

677
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,654
(chuckles softly)

678
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,660
(belches)

679
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,412
-(approaching footsteps)
-(door opens)

680
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,081
HAESUNG: Excuse me.

681
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,208
Can I get a large pork gukbap, please?

682
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:29,919
(Haesung sighs)

683
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,712
(Haesung slurping)

684
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,051
(Haesung slurps)

685
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,011
(Haesung gulps)

686
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,721
(Haesung exhales sharply)

687
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,683
Listen up, you two.

688
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,311
You better not think
that I'm doing all right,

689
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,813
just 'cause I'm acting all normal,

690
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,858
even after getting my hair
pulled out at work.

691
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,734
Oh, come on. We wouldn't think that.

692
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,239
Now that I'm not dating,
I find myself eating a lot.

693
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,240
(sighs)

694
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,952
HAESUNG: Being hungry can't just be
all that I look forward to.

695
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,121
Just keep eating.

696
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,748
(sighs)

697
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,669
You know what I think?

698
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,339
Those people who get snappy over nothing.

699
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,301
Well, they're like that
'cause they're not dating.

700
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,638
This piece of kimchi that they served
won't fit in my mouth.

701
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,225
Normally, people would just take a bite.

702
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,519
But some complain because it's too big.

703
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,148
So I would ask that person
this very question.

704
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,065
(gasps)

705
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,611
"Has it been over a year
since you've been in a relationship?"

706
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,946
Then that person
will likely answer this way.

707
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,198
(inhales sharply)
"Are you..."

708
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,365
WOOJOO AND JUN: "A fortune teller?"

709
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,909
(slaps)

710
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,079
JUN: Oh, that's such a cliché.

711
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,789
It's the oldest line in the book.

712
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,917
(sighs)

713
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,377
Why is my kimchi so big though?

714
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,181
(Haesung hisses)

715
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,477
HAESUNG: Hey, you two better not
be keeping any secrets from me.

716
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,978
JUN: Hmm?

717
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,314
WOOJOO: When have we ever kept
any secrets from you?

718
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,398
You see? Like that.

719
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,192
You just said "we" as in you two.

720
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,902
I'm always alone.

721
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,612
(snorts)
What's wrong?

722
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,114
Gukbap is something you two like.

723
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,824
It's not something I like.

724
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,452
I only came
'cause I didn't want cup noodles

725
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,828
at a convenience store.

726
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,291
(pensive music)

727
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,045
HAESUNG: Truly lonely people...

728
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,089
are the ones
who can't even say they're lonely.

729
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,341
You two need to realize that.

730
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,885
Stop acting crazy, all right?

731
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,638
Go find someone new to date. Hmm?

732
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,974
I guess.

733
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,893
That'd be better, right?

734
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,066
HAESUNG (chuckles):
Yeah, I think it would be.

735
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,779
(microwave oven beeping)

736
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,460
(mellow guitar music)

737
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,384
(crunching)

738
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,306
(loud pounding)

739
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,765
(crunching)

740
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,018
(loud pounding continues)

741
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,854
(loud pounding)

742
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,734
(loud pounding continues)

743
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,696
(loud pounding)

744
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,073
(loud pounding continues)

745
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,618
(loud pounding continues)

746
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,707
(keypad beeping)

747
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,542
(line ringing)

748
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,045
Yes, this is unit 2701.

749
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,963
GUARD (over phone): Again?

750
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,800
GUARD: 2702?

751
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,594
Get up!

752
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,137
There's been another complaint.

753
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,638
2702?

754
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,724
(water running)

755
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,187
(doorbell chimes)

756
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,563
(intercom beeps)

757
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,523
(guard sighs)

758
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,484
I don't know what their deal is.

759
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,070
But they promise
they won't make any more noise.

760
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,613
Thanks so much, I appreciate it.

761
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,697
(intercom beeps)

762
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,203
(Dongjin sighs)

763
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,501
(soft music playing)

764
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,546
SUNGMAN: It's, uh...
(clears throat)

765
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,050
As you know, the expo market is
just a battle over spots.

766
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,720
The pie is small
and every company wants a little slice.

767
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,555
(inhales sharply)
Um...

768
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,309
Well, so it seems like they give you
a certain amount of recognition

769
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,187
if you've been in the business
for over ten years.

770
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,355
(chuckles nervously)
Yes.

771
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,233
And Shinwoo Fair is...

772
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,275
Yes.

773
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,611
We've been here for 14 years.

774
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,113
That's good.

775
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,739
(soft chuckle)

776
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,241
Will I get to hear

777
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,076
what your company's next move is
going forward?

778
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,702
Oh... Would, would...

779
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,038
Would you like for me to explain it first?

780
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,082
SUNGMAN: So to start, if you guarantee
your long-term investment,

781
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,375
I can give you a business plan

782
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,751
that will, um, cover you
for ten more years.

783
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,587
Oh, uh, may I visit you at the address

784
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,673
on the business card
you gave me earlier? Yes?

785
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,425
No, I'll reach out to you.

786
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,634
SUNGMAN: Oh, yes, of course.

787
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,102
Sorry. Something urgent just came up.

788
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,770
I'll contact you after I look at this.

789
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,898
Yes, okay, uh, then,
I'll... I'll wait for your call.

790
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,317
(heels thudding)

791
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,319
(sighs)

792
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,404
(fingers snap)

793
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,573
(exhales deeply)

794
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,991
(clatters)

795
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,910
What? Wait a minute, you saw who?

796
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,911
CHANGSOO (over phone): Oh, Minyoung.

797
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,455
Dongjin's college sweetheart.

798
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,834
Oh, hello, ma'am. This is Sunwoo.
How are you doing today?

799
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,586
Your husband is well I hope?

800
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,671
Oh, well,
it's not that I couldn't get married,

801
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,797
I just didn't.
(chuckles)

802
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,257
Uh, why yes, doing well.

803
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,675
So I just wanted to find out

804
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,344
if Minyoung is still doing well
over in New York?

805
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,015
No, it's just a friend of mine told me
that he saw Minyoung in Gangnam.

806
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,351
Oh, yes, I know.
I also think he was mistaken...

807
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,898
SUNWOO: Uh, ma'am.

808
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,318
It just so happens
that I'm walking into a meeting.

809
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,072
I'm sorry, may I call you again later?

810
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,662
Excuse me.

811
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,290
I am, uh, almost certain
that those are not your bags.

812
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,917
SUNWOO: You might be mistaken.

813
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,586
I have a share on this bag though.

814
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,339
These initials...

815
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,757
Didn't I put them on there?

816
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,842
Do I know you?

817
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,594
You're speaking to me like I do.

818
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,846
MINYOUNG: I hoped I'd see you.

819
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,724
I thought that you might still like
to play golf during the workday.

820
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,684
(sighs)

821
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,605
I won't get to golf for a while now.
All because of you.

822
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,984
(scoffs softly)

823
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,116
(mechanical whirring)

824
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,452
(metal clangs)

825
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,124
Hey there, sir?

826
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,918
You haven't eaten, right?

827
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,005
(Kang sighs)

828
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,508
What CEO comes out here
and assembles it himself?

829
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,884
I told you we'd take care of it.

830
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,470
-(Dongjin breathes heavily)
-(rattling)

831
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,348
Hey, you'll move it outside, right?

832
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,599
Let's eat something first.

833
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,142
KANG: I'm in my thirties now.

834
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,519
I can't do anything if I don't eat.

835
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,272
Jeez, stop.
(scoffs)

836
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,150
DONGJIN: You look well.

837
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,069
It's pretty hard work,

838
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,446
but it's so much better than office work.

839
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,950
You should join me,
I'll recruit you this time.

840
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,201
(sighs)

841
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,787
How much are you offering?

842
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,915
-I'm not cheap.
-(chuckles)

843
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,250
Don't tell me you like money, too.

844
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,545
Doesn't everyone like money?

845
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,007
I can't get enough of it.

846
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,801
I really love it though.

847
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,597
I do, too.

848
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,932
I like it more than women.

849
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,475
(both laugh)

850
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,270
(Kang chuckles)

851
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,355
(inhales sharply)
Have you heard from the old man?

852
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,482
KANG:
He wants you to drop by the campgrounds.

853
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,901
(sniffs)

854
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,445
Uh... How about next weekend?

855
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,031
(inhales sharply)

856
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,324
Is he doing okay?

857
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,284
He talks about you sometimes,
and he's all right.

858
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,079
(sniffs)
You'll go, right?

859
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,335
When you finish the car,
send me a picture of it.

860
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,045
-(Dongjin grunts softly)
-Come on, let's go.

861
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,255
DONGJIN: I'm a salaryman.

862
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,049
(clicks tongue)
I have to work.

863
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,008
(Kang sighs)

864
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,011
Oh, grab a towel,
there's none in the shower.

865
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,513
-(indistinct chatter)
-(phone ringing)

866
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,978
NEED ITEMIZED RECEIPTS

867
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,777
Is Mr. Han in his office?

868
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,612
No, he said he was going to a meeting.

869
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,865
Then...

870
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,159
who put this on my desk?

871
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,745
The same person that always does.

872
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:26,914
It was me.

873
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,332
You should bring it in person.

874
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,293
Just leaving it on my desk like that
is incredibly rude.

875
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,712
YOUNGMIN:
You're old enough to know that, right?

876
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,680
(paper thuds)

877
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,764
Bring it to me in person.

878
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,146
(annoyed sigh)

879
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:04,743
Here it is.

880
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,203
YOUNGMIN: Explain what it is.

881
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,665
(sighs)

882
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,333
It's a report that...

883
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,294
itemizes any of the expenses
that were used on clients.

884
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,629
Got it. Dismissed.

885
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,091
If you don't like
that I'm on the Business Team,

886
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,009
take it up with the president yourself.

887
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,637
Instead of overreacting
like you're guilty of something.

888
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:25,931
What?

889
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,808
What did you just say?

890
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,895
-Ms. Sim...
-Ms. Baek, are you going to stop this act?

891
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,857
(footsteps approaching)

892
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,693
Apologize to him.

893
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,947
I understand that it's your personality
to have no filter,

894
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,574
but that doesn't mean you can be rude.

895
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,869
I think you understood what I said.

896
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,500
I apologize. I was out of line.

897
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,712
Oh, wow.

898
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,213
Fishing for compliments.

899
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,676
Hey, what kind of a part-timer makes
more noise than a regular employee?

900
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,261
-MALE EMPLOYEE: I know, right?
-Seriously.

901
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,472
(sighs)

902
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,143
-(thuds)
-(ice cubes rattle)

903
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,978
-(clinking)
-(thuds)

904
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,856
(ice cubes clinking)

905
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,608
-(thuds)
-(clinks)

906
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,861
(ice cubes rattling)

907
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,987
-(thuds)
-(crunching)

908
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,906
WOOJOO: If you don't like
that I'm on the Business Team,

909
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,532
take it up with the president yourself.

910
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,702
Instead of overreacting
like you're guilty of something.

911
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,996
(crunching)

912
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,463
(sighs)

913
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,095
(cell phone ringing)

914
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,516
What is it?

915
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,518
Uh, President Han
hasn't called you, right?

916
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,727
Did you get caught?

917
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,020
YOUNGMIN (over phone): No. I haven't.

918
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,439
There's just this girl here
that gets on my nerves.

919
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,276
Wonder if they know anything
or if the president knows about us.

920
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,903
(sighs)

921
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,489
Hey, I have to go. Bye.

922
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,537
I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman.

923
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,372
(Juho sighs)

924
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,915
YOUNGMIN: All right, let's go eat.

925
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,333
(Minsoo grunts)

926
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,794
-EMPLOYEE 1: Wanna eat together? Let's go.
-YURI: Yeah, sure, why not? Cool.

927
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,671
MINSOO: What do you want? Budaejjiggae?

928
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,755
Or kalguksoo?

929
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,298
YOUNGMIN: You wanna get some barley rice?

930
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,925
-MINSOO: Oh, sounds good.
-YOUNGMIN: Great.

931
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,886
(phone ringing)

932
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,264
Oh, sir. I'll answer this call
and catch up.

933
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,266
YOUNGMIN: Don't worry about it.
She can take it.

934
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,768
MINSOO: Ah.
(inhales sharply)

935
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,228
Try and take good notes.

936
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,609
Hello, Best Fairs, how can I help you?

937
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,488
(sighs)

938
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,614
Yes.

939
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,869
WOOJOO: Yes, I understand.

940
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,871
SAMIL TRAILER WITHDRAWS

941
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:54,830
(phone thuds)

942
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,082
(phones ringing)

943
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,918
(ringing continues)

944
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,796
(ringing continues)

945
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:06,758
WOOJOO: Yes?

946
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,303
(indistinct chatter)

947
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,268
(soft music)

948
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,092
(Woojoo sighs)

949
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,315
I saw you come in here.

950
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,946
I'm a regular customer.

951
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,322
DONGJIN: 'Cause it's usually empty.

952
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,615
Well, okay, but I didn't ask.

953
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,703
Is something wrong?

954
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,289
What if something did happen?

955
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,376
Would you like every little work matter
reported to you?

956
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,004
You always sound, um--

957
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,131
Hey, stop there. Don't say "amusing."

958
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,509
I really hate it.

959
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,517
Can you just order your lunch?

960
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,355
The stew here is too salty.

961
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,566
-You should order the soup.
-SERVER: Here's your denjang-jjigae.

962
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,946
(cart rattling)

963
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,076
(Dongjin slurps)

964
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,833
(crunching)

965
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,338
I won't spy on Manager Cha.

966
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,552
I mean, I wasn't going to help you anyway,
but it's over.

967
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,347
It's quite clear that he hates me.

968
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,267
But um, I mean
I also don't like him all that much.

969
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,021
What don't you like?

970
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,189
Why would I like him?

971
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,984
He's disloyal and rude to everyone.

972
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,486
WOOJOO: Like a two-for-one sale.

973
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,574
(crunching)

974
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,826
Seriously, how can you stand him at all?

975
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,911
You're really strange.

976
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,372
(crunching continues)

977
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,792
I let my girlfriend cheat on me
for a year.

978
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,256
(mellow music)

979
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,966
I have a lot of patience.

980
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,860
No follow-up questions?

981
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,322
It must have been
something you could put up with.

982
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,369
I'm not super interested
in other people's misery.

983
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,329
(clatters)

984
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,044
(sighs)

985
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,004
(slurps)

986
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,591
(mellow music continues)

987
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,406
HAESUNG: Hey, do you know
why Suho didn't come into work today?

988
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,699
Is it his day off?

989
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,326
NARAE: Who is Suho?

990
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,287
HAESUNG: Oh, you know,
the handsome special guard police officer.

991
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,539
NARAE: Oh, seriously?

992
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,165
Seriously.

993
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,709
Wait, what?

994
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,547
Oh, you and your sister
both like handsome guys, huh?

995
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,550
(chuckles)
I do for sure, but my sister doesn't.

996
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,718
Pfff. I don't think
she's interested in dating.

997
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,428
Look over there.

998
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,013
-What's that, huh?
-Huh?

999
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,857
(tender music)

1000
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,874
(indistinct PA announcement)

1001
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,587
(Heeja hums)

1002
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,507
HEEJA: Oh!
(chuckles)

1003
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,635
Looks nice on you, huh?
(chuckles)

1004
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,970
-Oh, really?
-Mm.

1005
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:05,098
But doesn't this suit kinda look like
it's made for old people?

1006
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,266
Oh. Mm-mm.

1007
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,976
I mean, if I wear this,

1008
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,562
everyone would think
that you and I are the same age.

1009
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,397
(scoffs)

1010
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,817
Honey, if you say something
that mean again to me,

1011
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,905
I might start nagging
instead of buying all this for you.

1012
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,031
-(growls affectionately)
-(laughs)

1013
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,575
Ah, I want what he's wearing, and um...

1014
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,035
That one.

1015
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,953
HEEJA: Top and bottom. One payment.

1016
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,246
-STAFF: Certainly.
-Honey...

1017
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,331
-Hmm?
-NAMIL: Uh...

1018
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,249
Two suits seem a little bit too much.

1019
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,834
(laughs)

1020
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,378
Oh, that suit isn't going to you, dear.

1021
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,756
It's for someone else. Hmm...

1022
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,508
(distant phone ringing)

1023
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,268
I'm going to the courier.

1024
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,489
(Namil sucks teeth)

1025
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,407
Should we go together?

1026
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,119
NAMIL: It'd be nice to say hi
since we'll see him often.

1027
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,414
Honey, we should have
a little bit of respect, all right?

1028
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,624
Huh?

1029
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,585
It isn't a good look
since the funeral is recent.

1030
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,880
If I take my current boyfriend up there,
two months after the service...

1031
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,173
Ah...

1032
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,008
How would he react, huh?

1033
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,218
I'll come back soon, okay?

1034
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,177
(childishly)
Okay.

1035
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,553
(both laughing)

1036
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,432
(Heeja chuckles)

1037
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,518
TAERANG BUILDING

1038
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,978
HEEJA: I'll be back.
(chuckles)

1039
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:33,895
(car door closes)

1040
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,855
(Heeja chuckles)

1041
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,693
(sighs)

1042
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,403
(sucks teeth)

1043
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,488
101 YEARS OF TAERANG
THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

1044
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,795
(elevator dings)

1045
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:30,118
Ah, I am here to see President Han.

1046
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,369
Sorry, but who are you?

1047
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,454
(displeased groan)

1048
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,790
You're not very good at determining
who you're talking to. Can't you tell?

1049
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,126
I'm his mom, silly.
(giggles)

1050
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,087
Oh, welcome.

1051
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,339
-He's in his office.
-HEEJA: Ah...

1052
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,300
Oh, be a dear
and bring me an iced coffee, sweetie.

1053
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,509
HEEJA: An Americano.

1054
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,720
All right?
(giggling)

1055
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,764
(Heeja exhales softly)

1056
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,645
SOOHEE: Oh, Woojoo, I've a meeting.

1057
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,898
Can you bring an iced coffee
to Mr. Han's office?

1058
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,108
-Okay.
-SOOHEE: Uh, he didn't ask for it.

1059
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,068
His mother is here.

1060
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,862
Whose... mom's here?

1061
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,030
Mr. Han.

1062
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,325
(unsettling music)

1063
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,390
HEEJA: Oh, will you stop frowning?

1064
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,350
My son is president
so I should get to see you.

1065
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,560
Why are you here?

1066
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,354
Oh, um...

1067
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,272
I have a gift for you.

1068
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,025
And a little thing to tell you.

1069
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,110
(Heeja giggles)

1070
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,736
(inhales deeply)

1071
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,946
You found a new guy?

1072
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,572
Um...

1073
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,491
You know me, I can't be single.

1074
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,701
I'm still too young for that.

1075
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,495
Your mom gets lonely, too.

1076
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:08,633
HEEJA: Oh, look, your father and I
were legally married, you get it?

1077
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,969
That house was under your father's name.

1078
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,430
It belonged to you then,
but now it's an inheritance.

1079
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,722
It was mine to sell!

1080
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,558
I haven't done anything wrong, okay?

1081
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,852
WOOJOO: I swear,
if you take our home away from us,

1082
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,145
karma will come for you.

1083
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,480
You can't uproot us like that,
how could you?

1084
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,192
(knocks on door)

1085
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:32,991
Thank you.

1086
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,285
But don't do stuff like this from now on.

1087
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,829
Ms. Baek asked me to take care of this.

1088
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,706
Otherwise, I wouldn't have.

1089
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,505
(unsettling music continues)

1090
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,430
(scoffs)

1091
00:57:56,681 --> 00:58:00,518
Now that you're all done with the coffee,
head back out.

1092
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:08,318
(music intensifies)

1093
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,909
You know, son,
you might have to train that one again.

1094
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,869
Or you could just fire her.

1095
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,245
Mother.

1096
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,372
(groans)

1097
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,332
(sighs)

1098
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:27,879
WOOJOO: Excuse me.

1099
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,924
Do we know each other?

1100
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,050
(gasps)

1101
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,843
What is she saying right now?

1102
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,762
How on earth could I, huh?

1103
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,555
I've only just met you now.

1104
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,350
(soft gasp)

1105
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,309
Do I know you?

1106
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:46,397
(wailing)

1107
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,942
WOOJOO: It's been 15 years.

1108
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,819
So I suppose there's a chance you don't.

1109
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,240
(soft tense music)

1110
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,909
I guess that we don't know each other.

1111
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,454
You look like you're the kind of person
who forgets about the past.

1112
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,580
(astonished gasp)

1113
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,124
How dare you speak to us like that!

1114
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,377
I'm sorry, I guess what I mean is...

1115
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,461
if we haven't met,

1116
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,172
then you shouldn't speak that way.

1117
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,173
(stunned gasp)

1118
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,425
(angry groan)

1119
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,427
Hey, what kind of insolent little...

1120
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,679
(splutters)
Hey!

1121
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,305
How much should I let you keep going?

1122
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,348
(gasps)

1123
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,809
(sighs)

1124
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,771
Please leave now.

1125
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,359
And don't ever come
and visit me here again.

1126
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,822
(soft tense music continues)

1127
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:56,467
(breathing heavily)

1128
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,219
(Jigu groans)

1129
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,972
JIGU: Why are
both of my older sisters complete nutjobs?

1130
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,223
Huh?

1131
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,519
I mean, even if one of them was normal,
I wouldn't be here sweeping dirt, would I?

1132
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,438
Don't forget to mop the floor.

1133
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:09,897
Yay.

1134
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,483
By the way...

1135
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,571
Should I tell
Woojoo or Haesung the situation?

1136
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,532
(inhales sharply)
When I think about it...

1137
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,493
At least Woojoo doesn't actually hit me.

1138
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:25,747
Hey, Jigu, bro.

1139
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,542
You should... accept the beating.

1140
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,462
You can't just drop that bomb on Woojoo.

1141
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,964
Ah... You know...

1142
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,091
If I was really planning
to listen to your advice,

1143
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,260
then I wouldn't have quit studying
in the first place.

1144
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,012
(sighs)

1145
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,014
Okay.

1146
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,391
I'll tell Woojoo and call it quits then.

1147
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,560
Oh, please just listen to me,
don't tell Woojoo.

1148
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,728
Oh, come on, why not?

1149
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,731
I'm just afraid that...
(sighs)

1150
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,025
she'd flip out like that one day.

1151
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,068
(frustrated sigh)

1152
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,321
That day again? Tsk! Seriously, hmm?

1153
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,073
JIGU:
Why won't anyone tell me what happened?

1154
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,700
-Oh! You're back.
-Honey!

1155
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:03,910
(both chuckle)

1156
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,287
-Here.
-Thank you.

1157
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,747
-(Heeja breathes deeply)
-(mumbles)

1158
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,706
-HEEJA: Aww.
-(chuckles)

1159
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,333
JUN: Do you know what made your sister...

1160
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,378
become such a cosmic-level nutjob?

1161
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,717
It was that one day.

1162
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,303
(melancholic music)

1163
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,276
YOUNG WOOJOO: Ah, please no...

1164
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,778
(nervous breathing)

1165
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,238
Don't come outside.

1166
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,489
Don't, please.

1167
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,076
(laughs)
There you are.

1168
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,369
(both laughing)

1169
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,370
-HEEJA: Aww.
-(sobs)

1170
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,247
(Heeja laughing)

1171
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,416
-HEEJA: Huh? It's snowing.
-(whimpers)

1172
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,836
-(crying)
-(laughter)

1173
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,172
(whimpering)

1174
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,800
(young Woojoo whimpers, sniffles)

1175
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,301
(whimpering)

1176
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,679
(melancholy music)

1177
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,980
(melancholy music continues)

1178
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,276
(inhales shakily)

1179
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,082
JUN: I've seen it before.

1180
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,002
When she's been hurt...

1181
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,881
I've seen how far
her craziness will take her.

1182
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,222
CHULMIN: It's worth it.

1183
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,807
(both laugh)

1184
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,142
-(Heeja gasps, yelps)
-CHULMIN: Whoa!

1185
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,310
-(Heeja exhales sharply)
-(thudding)

1186
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,564
(dramatic music)

1187
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,986
(Heeja gasps)

1188
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,452
(crowd murmuring)

1189
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:10,912
Woojoo?

1190
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,081
Oh! She totally jumped.

1191
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,209
She jumped right in front of the car!
I, uh...

1192
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,627
Woojoo! You okay?

1193
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,920
(sobs)
Why?

1194
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,798
Why? Why?

1195
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,341
What the hell were you thinking?

1196
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,260
(shouts)
Why does it have to be her?

1197
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,470
(young Woojoo crying)

1198
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:30,097
(crying continues)

1199
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,433
(breathing heavily)

1200
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,353
(whimpers, sniffles)

1201
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,857
CHULMIN: Oh, hello? Is this 119?

1202
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,026
-Yes, uh, there's been an accident.
-(crying)

1203
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,986
Please send an ambulance quickly.

1204
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:44,946
CHULMIN: Yes.

1205
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,037
(car engine rumbling)

1206
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,623
(ominous music)

1207
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,959
(rumbling continues)

1208
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,460
(tires screech)

1209
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,515
(distant phone ringing)

1210
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,600
He went where?

1211
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,979
SOOHEE: Mr. Kim supposedly went
on a business trip to Shanghai.

1212
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,939
I just wanted to know
if you knew about this.

1213
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,858
No, he didn't mention it.

1214
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,484
(Soohee sighs)

1215
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:26,112
SOOHEE (over phone): The booth location
and the price have been agreed on,

1216
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,864
but now they're delaying the contract.

1217
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:29,991
Thanks a lot.

1218
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,659
Take the rest of the day off.

1219
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,412
BEST FAIRS

1220
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:35,413
(phone chimes)

1221
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:39,292
(line ringing)

1222
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,918
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The number you have dialed is unavailable,

1223
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,211
-if you like to leave--
-(phone chimes)

1224
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,092
(elevator bell dings)

1225
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,473
(smacks lips, inhales sharply)

1226
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:59,395
DONGJIN: This is the second time...

1227
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,442
that you've walked by like I wasn't here.

1228
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:07,570
Speak...

1229
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,448
(sighs, smacks lips)

1230
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,616
Earlier...

1231
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,702
My mother was rude to you.

1232
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:15,745
Sorry she did that.

1233
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,289
DONGJIN: And you don't...

1234
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,250
have to make coffee... for anyone.

1235
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,002
That's not part of your duties.

1236
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,797
Neither is watching Mr. Cha all day
at the office.

1237
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,175
WOOJOO: But you made me do it.

1238
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:34,972
(smacks lips, inhales deeply)

1239
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,975
-I'm sorry.
-Why do you keep saying that?

1240
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,104
You wouldn't know
what it means to be sorry.

1241
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,444
(somber music)

1242
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,168
YOUNGMIN: Let's go home, everyone.

1243
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,294
EMPLOYEES: Yes, sir.

1244
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,516
Look at her walking out
without even saying goodbye.

1245
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,436
(Youngmin clears throat)

1246
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,604
We're going for a drink.

1247
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:24,772
You wanna come?

1248
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,357
I have plans.

1249
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,734
You shouldn't get married too soon.

1250
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,613
When someone is waiting for you at home,
life's pretty much over.

1251
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,864
(awkward laughter)

1252
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,116
We'll remember that, sir.

1253
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,534
-Have a good evening!
-Goodbye.

1254
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:37,618
-Good night.
-YOUNGMIN: Take care.

1255
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:43,541
(car engine rumbling)

1256
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,543
(tires screech)

1257
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,632
(indistinct chatter)

1258
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,566
(Youngmin humming)

1259
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,913
I'm not telling you this
because I'm suddenly on your side.

1260
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,041
So don't thank me too much now.

1261
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,251
(sighs)

1262
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,711
The President knows...

1263
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,048
that you and President Shin
are working together.

1264
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:33,549
What are you saying?

1265
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,218
Why else do you think he sent me
to work with the Business Division?

1266
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,558
You've been caught red-handed.

1267
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,146
So if you really wanna get this company
into complete bankruptcy...

1268
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,773
try harder then why don't you!

1269
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,360
(irritated sigh)

1270
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,196
-(car lock beeps)
-YOUNGMIN: Damnit.

1271
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,292
(tense music)

1272
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,988
(tires screeching)

1273
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,544
(closing theme music)
