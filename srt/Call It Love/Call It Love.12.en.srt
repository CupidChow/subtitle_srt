1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,961
(intro theme music playing)

2
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,679
(music fades out)

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,977
CALL IT LOVE

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,021
(water running from faucet)

5
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,689
(water stops running)

6
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,525
(echoing drip)

7
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,321
(contemplative music playing)

8
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,368
DONGJIN: <i>Do you want to stay here tonight?</i>

9
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,483
(gulping)

10
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,361
Would you like more fruit?

11
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,782
(footsteps leaving)

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,954
Do you have…

13
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,582
any beer?

14
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,132
Wait here. I'll go get some real quick.

15
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,098
(door clicks open)

16
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,850
(footsteps receding)

17
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,935
(door clicks shut)

18
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,562
(security system beeping)

19
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,906
EPISODE 12

20
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,622
(groans)

21
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,090
Why are you calling me
instead of coming home?

22
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,425
What's Mom doing?

23
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,510
She went into her room a while ago.

24
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,971
Is Jun with you?

25
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,264
He went to his family home.

26
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,141
He'll stay there for the time being.

27
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,313
HAESUNG: <i>Hey, get some ice cream
on your back, a really sweet one.</i>

28
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,232
<i>I can feel my blood sugar
dropping right now.</i>

29
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,233
Haesung.

30
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,281
Is something wrong?

31
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,998
What? What's going on?

32
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,917
I'll come to you right now…

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,251
I think I'm going to regret it.

34
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,005
I know I'll regret it.

35
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,260
But I want to be here right now.

36
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,597
I want to be with him.

37
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,229
(sighs) So you're just saying
you're sleeping over.

38
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,192
(softly) Why do you have to
sound like you're dying?

39
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,777
You scared me.

40
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,404
My bad.

41
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,489
(Haesung sighs on phone)

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,366
HAESUNG: <i>I'll cover for you.</i>

43
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,452
<i>I'll make something up for Mom
so she doesn't worry.</i>

44
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>Just get to work straight from there.</i>

45
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,380
(inhales)

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,674
(exhales deeply)

47
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,008
(door opens)

48
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,094
(door shuts)

49
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,179
(security system beeping)

50
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,002
WOOJOO: I'm in here.

51
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,635
(music subdues)

52
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,221
I was most curious about
this room at your place.

53
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
(tender music playing)

54
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,446
WOOJOO: It's as if
you're moving out tomorrow.

55
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,115
Your room is basically empty,

56
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,993
and so is your fridge.

57
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,078
This isn't really my house,

58
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,457
and I've always wanted to leave.

59
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,460
It was my dream once.

60
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,963
If I was broke, I'd go with my tent.

61
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,674
And if I had some money,

62
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,386
I'd get a camper
and go away for as long as I could.

63
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,809
But instead, I kind of
stumbled into starting up a company.

64
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,604
And it's always been on thin ice,

65
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,857
always teetering on the edge.

66
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,070
So I figured I'd just run away
if things didn't work out.

67
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,238
I'd at least disappear for a while.

68
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,532
And to do that,

69
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,036
I'd need my fridge to be empty
so that I would feel okay.

70
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,123
How would you ever run away
with your personality?

71
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,335
I bet you can't even keep your phone off.

72
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,048
Have you ever left your phone turned off?

73
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,928
No.

74
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,846
(snorts) I knew it.

75
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,937
Was there anything else you wanted to do

76
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,606
besides winning a gold medal?

77
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,360
(sighs)

78
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,448
WOOJOO: I heard that a Buddhist monk
once told my parents this,

79
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,910
"Your second child will be
the pillar of the household."

80
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,330
"She'd be worth as much as ten sons,
so raise her well."

81
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,708
When I heard that
from my father for the 100th time,

82
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,751
I finally realized.

83
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,629
I was trying to be
the pillar of our family.

84
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,384
If you ask me what my dreams are…

85
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,557
I'd like my sister to marry someone nice,

86
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,353
and I'd like my little brother
to get a stable job.

87
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,610
That's all.

88
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,405
I haven't really thought
about anything else.

89
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,699
Is that boring?

90
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,160
I'd say you're very kind.

91
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,705
No, we're both stupid.

92
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,209
(chuckles)

93
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,422
If I really was kind, I wouldn't be here.

94
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,178
In my head, I'm saying,
"You shouldn't be here. Go home."

95
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,514
When you went out to get the beer,

96
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,224
I was like, "Now is your chance, go home."

97
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,313
But it's all just in my head.
My body won't move.

98
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,650
I like being with you too much.

99
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,902
(music stops abruptly)

100
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,113
I…

101
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,246
really like you a lot, Mr. Han.

102
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,753
To the point where
I wish everyone else in the world

103
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,381
would just disappear
and only the two of us would be left.

104
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,388
(romantic music playing)

105
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,770
(smooching)

106
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,946
(smooching)

107
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,463
(smooching)

108
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,575
(music fades out)

109
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,455
(bright music playing)

110
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,599
HYUNJU: <i>In this day and age,</i>

111
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,560
<i>a younger sibling getting married
before the older one is no big deal.</i>

112
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,521
HAESUNG: Mom, what do you know?

113
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,774
I met him at Jigu's part-time job.

114
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,276
I know she didn't go to work early.

115
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,737
Your mom isn't that old-fashioned, okay?

116
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,073
I did not know that.

117
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,202
I want you to call Jun
on your way to work.

118
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,580
Tell him to come over and get some food.

119
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,040
And that I'm sorry but I'd need him

120
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,167
to stay at his parents' for another week.

121
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,086
(swallows hard)

122
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,462
Are you staying longer?

123
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,756
Are you afraid
I'd want to settle down here?

124
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,383
That's not…

125
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,637
The owner of this house is Jun.
Talk to him about it.

126
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,056
(chopsticks clinking on bowl)

127
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,601
Do you have any savings?

128
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
I'll lend you some money
so you can find a place.

129
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,649
Unmarried adult men and women
living in the same house is just wrong.

130
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,277
If Jun's parents find out,
things won't be pretty.

131
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,406
You are old-fashioned after all.

132
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,742
(short inhale)

133
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,620
Okay, I'll look around.

134
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,666
But don't pack any food for him.

135
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,335
Jun will probably come back in a few days.

136
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,878
(inhales)

137
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,130
Maybe even today.

138
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,258
He can't last long over there.
I know that much.

139
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,010
JIGU: Oh, that's refreshing.

140
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,179
Did you all sleep well?

141
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,060
WOOJOO: <i>I'm leaving early
to stop by my place before going to work.</i>

142
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,354
<i>Have some breakfast
before heading to work.</i>

143
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,484
(bright music playing)

144
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,762
(camera shutter clicks)

145
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,725
(tapping on phone)

146
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:49,894
(phone thuds)

147
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,563
(utensils clinking)

148
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,776
(utensils scraping on plate)

149
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,696
(munching)

150
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,743
(munching)

151
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,122
(bright music building)

152
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,418
(munching)

153
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,176
(frying pan sizzling)

154
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,563
(stove buttons beeping)

155
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,325
(music pauses)

156
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,955
(bright music resumes)

157
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,047
(picking up phone)

158
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,102
I have something to tell you.

159
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,397
Could I see you
before you come to the office?

160
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,232
(music ends)

161
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,859
SUNWOO: Sit down.

162
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,569
People will think
you're getting yelled at.

163
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,282
Please give me some time.

164
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,286
(sighs)

165
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,330
I'm not asking you to let it slide.

166
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,419
In order to talk about
why I helped Mr. Cha,

167
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
there are just so many things to explain.

168
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,260
Like why I started working here,
who I am,

169
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,972
and what I've done.

170
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,557
I have to explain everything.

171
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,810
DONGJIN: <i>My mother is my weakness.</i>

172
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,271
A weakness I want to hide

173
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,481
and don't want anyone to spot.

174
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,525
(sentimental music playing)

175
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,944
SUNWOO: Who exactly are you, Ms. Sim?

176
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,239
Who are you?

177
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,455
It's my fault and my mistake,
so I want to sort it out.

178
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,706
What do you mean, sort it out?

179
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,336
Can matters of the heart be sorted out?

180
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,423
You messed up his heart as you pleased.

181
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,550
So what exactly are you going to sort out?

182
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,512
At the very least, I don't want him
to find out from someone else.

183
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,182
I'm going to tell him myself.

184
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,476
That way, he won't be hurt as much.

185
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,270
That's for certain.

186
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,649
(sighs)

187
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,526
Just give me time.

188
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,571
(puffs)

189
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,158
SUNWOO: Let's talk after the fair is over.

190
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,994
I'll try to wait as well.

191
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,875
Your contract expires
around that time anyway.

192
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,711
Let's wrap it all up then.

193
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,384
Jeez.
(clicks tongue)

194
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,306
(sighs deeply)

195
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,852
(music fades out)

196
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,733
Mr. Choi, the final drafts of the poster
are ready in the conference room.

197
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,318
Okay, I'll be right there.

198
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,239
Woojoo, could you go help Yuri?

199
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,199
I'll be right over
once I let Mr. Han know.

200
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,410
Sure.

201
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,460
-(bright music playing)
-(breathing happily)

202
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,380
It's so exciting to see the final posters.

203
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,297
(employees chuckling)

204
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,718
YURI: We're finally hosting the fair.

205
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,138
Now, my portfolio won't
just have proxy work

206
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,557
but an originally planned fair
on it as well.

207
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,767
That made me so emotional.

208
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,852
SUNWOO: Congratulations.

209
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,645
SOOHEE: Do we have
all the tech support applications?

210
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,981
YURI: Yes, I got them from all
the companies that need electrical work.

211
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,733
EMPLOYEES (murmuring):
They look so good.

212
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,568
Which do you like the most, Woojoo?

213
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,819
EMPLOYEES (murmuring):
I think this one's the best.

214
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,571
For me…

215
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,077
(employees murmuring)

216
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,469
CEO Han, pick one.
We have to decide on one by today.

217
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,807
I personally like the third one best.
It's got a good seasonal atmosphere too.

218
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,184
And you, Mr. Han?

219
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,313
Yes, I like the third one too.

220
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,231
It highlights the location and time well.

221
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,191
YURI: I like it too.

222
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,402
And it has a festival vibe to it,
so I like this one best.

223
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,208
(music fades out)

224
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,464
WOMAN 1: I felt like a hotel café would be
uncomfortable for both of us.

225
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,300
And I didn't want to make it obvious
that we were having a blind date.

226
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,597
I guess I shouldn't have worn a suit.

227
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,891
It looks nice on you.

228
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,068
(coughs lightly)

229
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,948
(puffs)
So…

230
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,409
Would it be terribly cliché

231
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,787
if I asked you about your hobbies?

232
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,289
It would be a classic question.

233
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,290
(chuckles)

234
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,501
I enjoy traveling.

235
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:48,919
Traveling…

236
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,130
Nice.

237
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,258
Have you ever been to Spain?

238
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,551
No.

239
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,181
(smacks lips)

240
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,391
How is it there?

241
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,184
(short inhale)

242
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,605
In Spain, there's a place called Mallorca.

243
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:15,237
It would be the equivalent
of Jeju Island in Korea.

244
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,196
(mellow music playing)

245
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,281
I also liked Barcelona…

246
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,033
NARAE: <i>Haesung really hates eating alone.</i>

247
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,910
She says it's embarrassing and awkward.

248
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,955
Maybe I should have gone with her.

249
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,957
No, she said she wanted to eat alone.

250
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,043
She can't possibly be
dating again, can she?

251
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,171
(hissing)

252
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,547
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,382
Let's not talk like that among ourselves.

254
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,009
(meekly) Okay.

255
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,260
JIHYUNG: And we won't ask

256
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,431
until Haesung asks first
to eat together, okay?

257
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,767
-OWNER: Here are your noodles.
-HAESUNG: Yes, thank you.

258
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,438
-MALE GUEST: Sir.
-OWNER: Yes?

259
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,522
MALE GUEST: Could we have some water?

260
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,359
JIHYUNG:
<i>Let her spend some time by herself.</i>

261
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,861
30-MINUTE ANIME
WARRIOR IN THE SKY, ANIWARS

262
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,864
<i>She's done enough
empty laughing and chatting</i>

263
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,490
<i>while going through hell.</i>

264
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,286
<i>It's about time she stops doing that.</i>

265
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,668
(customers slurping)

266
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,800
(slurping)

267
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,719
(phone thuds)

268
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,810
(stirring)

269
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,898
(slurping)

270
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,942
(munching)

271
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,695
(music building)

272
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,119
(slurping)

273
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,929
(music continues)

274
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,395
(groans)

275
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,126
(breathes nervously)

276
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,138
(music fades out)

277
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,514
So…

278
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,433
Shall we go to dinner?

279
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,893
(exhales uncomfortably)

280
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,937
(chuckles awkwardly)

281
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,493
Do you like Japanese food?

282
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,288
I know a really good place nearby.

283
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,457
Well…

284
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,417
(breathes hesitantly)

285
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,628
(sighs) Can we pretend
that we've already had dinner?

286
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,088
Pardon?

287
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,257
(smacks lips)

288
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,467
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,094
Oh…

290
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,806
Am I not your type?

291
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,600
No.
(scoffs)

292
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,643
No, it's nothing like that.

293
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,646
I don't know how to explain this.

294
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,483
It's just that I'm weird.

295
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,486
I have no idea what to say
while having dinner.

296
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,113
And when I think about that,
I feel suffocated.

297
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,616
What?

298
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,456
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,043
(chuckles awkwardly)

300
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,130
(scoffs)

301
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,757
What a jerk.

302
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,428
(scoffs)

303
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,555
(mutters)
Crazy bastard.

304
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,016
(scoffs)

305
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,576
SUNWOO: You drive.

306
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,703
I'm better at drinking
with clients than you are.

307
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,914
DONGJIN: Let's do it together.
We can call a cab after.

308
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,376
SUNWOO: The magazine company folks
prefer soju, and they drink like whales.

309
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,794
You can't handle them.

310
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,297
Hang on a second.

311
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,384
SUNWOO: CEO Han, let's just go.

312
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,600
I have an appointment
so I'll head home straight from there.

313
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,066
Thank you for the breakfast.

314
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,443
I'll call you.

315
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,673
(slurping loudly)

316
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,967
(munching)

317
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,886
(somber music playing)

318
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,929
(snorts)

319
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,032
WOOJOO NUTJOB

320
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,080
MOTHER

321
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,925
(phone thuds)

322
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,475
(pouring)

323
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,315
(gulping)

324
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,443
Ah.

325
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,445
Yoon Jun.

326
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,324
What you have is an illness.

327
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,161
You're the one who's sick.

328
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,749
(footsteps approaching)

329
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,965
HAESUNG: What are you doing here?

330
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,264
(Jun sighs)

331
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,016
Sighing at my face means
you want me to get lost, right?

332
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,310
Should I go?

333
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,729
Do you want me to go?

334
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,233
Sit down.

335
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,627
(music fades out)

336
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,630
I went on a blind date today.

337
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,468
And my mom found out about our scheme.

338
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,097
Anyway…

339
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,018
I thought, "What's the big deal?
I'll just go through the motions."

340
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,270
So I just went there.

341
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,566
But every single word
from her mouth suffocated me.

342
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,278
"What do I say
if she asks me what my hobby is?"

343
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,364
"What if she asks me
what my weekend plans are?"

344
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,284
"I hope she doesn't ask me any questions."

345
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,202
That's all I could think about.

346
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,664
It's an illness, you know.

347
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,542
I just can't stand being uncomfortable.

348
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,336
It's gross,

349
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,589
but I guess
I take after my dad, after all.

350
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,673
(chuckles)

351
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,966
You're too hard on yourself.

352
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,930
JUN: Every time my pharmacy
school friends…

353
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,140
(tender music playing)

354
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,100
…complained about how difficult it is

355
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,519
to be inside that
tiny matchbox of a pharmacy,

356
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,396
I was like, "What's with them?"

357
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,774
"That's where I'm most comfortable."

358
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,405
And then it's Sim Haesung,
Sim Jigu, and Sim Woojoo next.

359
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,244
I think that's why I went off on you.

360
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,332
I hated the possibility
of being uncomfortable with you.

361
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,753
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,005
I was out of line.

363
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,051
(sighs)

364
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,887
I'm confused if you're rejecting me
or apologizing to me.

365
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,555
What?

366
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,641
How many times
are you going to turn me down?

367
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,687
I understand Korean just fine.
Why beat around the bush so much?

368
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,107
I got it.

369
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,651
I'll keep my heart
from fluttering from now on.

370
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,444
Happy now?

371
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,821
(giggles)

372
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,700
(laughing)

373
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,451
You're killing me, Sim Haesung.

374
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,080
(giggles)

375
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:46,766
SUNWOO: Ms. Baek and I
will be at the fair first.

376
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,894
So wrap things up
and come with the planning team.

377
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,105
DONGJIN: Mm-hmm.

378
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,691
Ms. Sim…

379
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,528
will not be going to the fair.

380
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,115
Her contract is up before the fair anyway.

381
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,868
It won't look good
if we force her to come.

382
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,203
She said it herself
that she doesn't want to go.

383
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,417
(inhales deeply)

384
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,713
(door opens)

385
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,641
(music ends)

386
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,281
(calling beep, ringing tone)

387
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,368
(phone vibrating)

388
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,001
MR. HAN DONGJIN

389
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,089
(mellow music playing)

390
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,232
I don't drink anymore.

391
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,822
And I'm moving.

392
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,285
I won't be around here anymore.

393
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,372
(phone vibrating)

394
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,540
(groans)

395
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,710
(music fades out)

396
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,006
(vibrating stops)

397
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,174
(exhales)

398
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,975
-Hello.
-MAN 1: <i>Hey, did you get the money?</i>

399
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,769
HYUNJU: <i>Excuse me.</i>

400
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,523
Just talk to me right here.
And give me back my stuff.

401
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,402
(tense music playing)

402
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,779
You know who is living
in the house in Yeonhui-dong, right?

403
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,950
That house was supposed to belong
to the three siblings, your children.

404
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,327
That's how it should be.

405
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,786
But things aren't right here.

406
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,624
So if you can come up with
about 30 million won,

407
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,294
I'll tell you how you can
get the house back.

408
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,423
You live with Heeja, correct?

409
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,636
If there's a way to get the house back,
then bring me the solution.

410
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,471
I'll pay you then with interest.

411
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,097
No, wait.

412
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,808
I don't want to hear another word.
I've been fooled once, no more.

413
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,478
Do you people have
even a shred of conscience?

414
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,314
If there is a way to get it back,
I'll find it myself.

415
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,483
I won't need your dirty hands to help me.

416
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,444
I'm going off the grid from today.

417
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,528
It's over.

418
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,489
I can't get any more money,

419
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,282
so I can't pay off the gambling debt.

420
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,910
What else can I do? I have to hide.

421
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,536
Hey.

422
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,373
There's no point if I tell you
where I'll be going.

423
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,291
Don't look for me for a while.

424
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,918
Darn it.

425
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,837
(heavy footsteps approaching)

426
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,130
HEEJA: Honey.

427
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,049
I'm home.

428
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,509
Where are you?

429
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,177
(laughs) Are you in the shower?

430
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,681
(door slams)

431
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,892
-No.
-(Namil grumbles)

432
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,477
-(Heeja strains)
-NAMIL: Darn it!

433
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,478
(Heeja yelps)

434
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,689
NAMIL: Seriously!

435
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,898
(Heeja whimpers)

436
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,194
HEEJA: Hey!
(groans)

437
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,278
(screams)
What?

438
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:13,449
Did you really think we'll be parting ways
without going through all this?

439
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,827
(stutters)
What did you just say?

440
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,914
I'm totally broke, and you're broke too
if you don't sell this house.

441
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,832
Then we're finished.

442
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,876
Did you go out with me for money?

443
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,503
Was it all for money?

444
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,255
Then what?

445
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,589
You thought I loved you?

446
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,800
That's gross, snap out of it!

447
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,470
Just go find someone else.
Finding guys is your specialty.

448
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,973
(screams)
You leave those things here!

449
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,519
I know your resident registration number,
your car license plate number, everything.

450
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,523
You're done for
if I report you to the police!

451
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,983
The police?

452
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,401
Sure. Let's go.

453
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,362
You think I don't have anything
to say to them?

454
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,156
Do you want me to go tell them

455
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,033
how you hid your dead husband's will?
(screams)

456
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,619
How dare you play the victim card?

457
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,582
Think carefully.

458
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,167
Who has more to lose here?

459
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,877
(whimpers)
Wait.

460
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,961
(screams) Hey!

461
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,715
Don't take anything with you.
Leave those things here!

462
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,550
-(screams) You jerk!
-(whines)

463
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,010
(sobbing)

464
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,386
Why should I do that?

465
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,096
Damn it!

466
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,810
(Heeja wailing)

467
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,271
Kang Namil!

468
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,607
(sobbing)

469
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,903
(wailing)

470
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,656
(music fades out)

471
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:53,883
Mom.

472
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,345
I only have this one suit.

473
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,472
Woojoo bought it for me
to wear to job interviews.

474
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,647
I'll just need to iron out the shirt.

475
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,902
What's this?

476
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,862
Are you two going somewhere?

477
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,739
I have no idea.

478
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,450
I'll tell you
when all three of you are here.

479
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,160
I don't want to repeat myself.

480
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,079
(plastic rustling)

481
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,168
What's with the suit?

482
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,796
HYUNJU: I'm taking Jigu to see your aunt.

483
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,382
That tough aunt with the hair salon?

484
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,925
Some guy came to see me.

485
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,928
He says there is a way
to get the house back.

486
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,765
Shortly after buying that house…

487
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,979
your father said this as he planted
the tree and grass in the front yard.

488
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,525
"I'll evenly divide this house
into three parts for our children."

489
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,862
"It's the only way to stop
any of them from selling the house."

490
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,072
Even when he was having an affair,

491
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,117
he wasn't letting go
of the deed to the house.

492
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,745
So there's no way
he'd have handed it to her.

493
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,165
(iron switch flicks)

494
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,208
I'm going to ask your aunt first.

495
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,752
And if it can't be helped…

496
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,715
I'll meet her in person and ask directly.

497
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,758
Meet who? That woman?

498
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,677
(iron scrubbing)

499
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,230
(sighing)

500
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,693
Come on, pick it up.

501
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,155
(door shuts)

502
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,240
(phone vibrating)

503
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,169
(phone continues vibrating)

504
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,672
(vibrating stops)

505
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,137
(phone resumes vibrating)

506
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,145
MINYOUNG'S AGENT: Hello.

507
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,565
I apologize for calling you
so early in the morning.

508
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,108
They're a newlywed couple,

509
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,487
and both work full-time
so now was the only time they could spare.

510
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,490
Why don't you guys go ahead
and take a look around?

511
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,283
I'll park the car and follow you.

512
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,120
MINYOUNG: This way, please.

513
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,540
Aren't you Minyoung?

514
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,297
(tense music playing)

515
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,215
(chuckles)

516
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:44,053
HEEJA: I am his mother,
but he really is something else.

517
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:48,933
"Tell me. Why did you two break up?"
I asked him countless times,

518
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,685
and he just wouldn't budge.

519
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,478
That's the kind of person he is.

520
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,856
He doesn't have it in him
to spill other's dirty secrets.

521
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,570
I already had a hunch
as to why you two broke up.

522
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,867
If I couldn't understand you,
who could, you know?

523
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,827
(exhales quickly)

524
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,871
Make sure to answer my calls from now on

525
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,748
and come meet me
at the address I send you.

526
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,960
-Come and take a look at the house--
-We're not back together.

527
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,338
What are you talking about?

528
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,800
Don't even give me that pathetic lie.

529
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,843
Gosh.

530
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,595
(clicks loudly)

531
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,432
(elevator chiming)

532
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,560
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Twentieth floor. Door opening.</i>

533
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,438
I'm sorry, but could you get off here?

534
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,523
(feet stomping)

535
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,191
Me?

536
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,694
I'll show you the house next time.

537
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,653
I'm sorry.

538
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,822
-MAN 2: You mean us?
-WOMAN 2: Okay.

539
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,367
(man clears throat)

540
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,537
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Door closing.</i>

541
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,803
MINYOUNG: I live here.

542
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,722
Across from him.

543
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,265
(Heeja chuckles)

544
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,767
And that changes things?

545
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,727
Since you say you understand everything,

546
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,355
I'll tell you how I dumped your son.

547
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,902
While I was dating Dongjin,
I went on a blind date,

548
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,445
met with that person's family,

549
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,030
and even set a date for the wedding.

550
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:30,659
Then I just told Dongjin
that I'm marrying someone else.

551
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,579
That's not all.

552
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,457
My mom, who didn't approve of Dongjin
because he's got only one parent,

553
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,585
even sent him a wedding invitation.

554
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,670
(scoffs, shouts)
That's just insane!

555
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,339
I'm not done yet.

556
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,299
Perhaps I was getting punished,

557
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,093
but it didn't work out
with that other guy.

558
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,844
So I split up with him and came to Korea.

559
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,514
And I moved into the apartment
right across from Dongjin.

560
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,474
Because I wanted him back.

561
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,726
(chuckles dumbfoundedly)

562
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,770
I thought, "He'd forgive me
if I kept apologizing."

563
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,023
"No matter how cold he tries to be,
I know Han Dongjin."

564
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,943
That's how I was holding on
and I only just managed

565
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,528
to let it go and give up.

566
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,197
But you know what?

567
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,699
I'm upset too.

568
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,494
If it hadn't been for you…

569
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,539
(loudly) If you hadn't constantly asked me
to give you some money

570
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,375
or kept asking me to buy you stuff,

571
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,086
I wouldn't have gone that far.

572
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,171
So I can't give you any more money.

573
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,425
(breaking into tears)
You're the reason I became this way.

574
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,843
(yells)
Who are you trying to blame?

575
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:35,516
Did you hear that?
Did you hear her ridiculous claims?

576
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,852
My goodness…
(scoffs)

577
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,021
I'm sorry.

578
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,731
Don't be.

579
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,359
Let's talk later. Get inside.

580
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,653
HEEJA: Hey, why are you crying?

581
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,905
What on earth do you have to cry about?

582
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,782
-Please get inside.
-(Heeja grumbles)

583
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,783
Talk to me.

584
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,827
(heavy footsteps leaving)

585
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,414
(door opens)

586
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,086
(sighs)
Sorry.

587
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,635
(gloomy music playing)

588
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,529
(exclaims in exasperation)

589
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,618
Your poor mom lives alone.
Aren't you worried about why I called you?

590
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,578
Pick up your phone on time.

591
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,080
Don't make me run over here
so early in the morning.

592
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,124
But you don't live alone.

593
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,960
Well, I started living alone yesterday.

594
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,087
That son of a…

595
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,589
Gosh.

596
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,636
Anyway, that jerk
took all my jewelry and ran off.

597
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:58,140
I thought he was just playing cards
with friends for fun.

598
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,643
I was scammed.

599
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,269
(breathes unhappily)

600
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,688
Did you borrow money from Minyoung?

601
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,488
How much?

602
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,907
(stutters)
Well…

603
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,618
It's really not much.
(chuckles)

604
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,204
How much? I have to know
in order to pay her back.

605
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,915
(shouts)
What do you mean "pay her back"?

606
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,125
I heard what she did to you.

607
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,170
(lowers voice) I'm going after her
for compensation money.

608
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,343
(laughs nervously)
Come on, who do you think I am?

609
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:38,222
I was just saying things.
I didn't mean them.

610
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,851
Well…

611
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,607
I'm going to live here for the time being.

612
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,945
I don't want to go back to that house.

613
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:01,328
I mean, if it's too awkward
to live with me, uh…

614
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,998
you could give me some money.

615
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,041
And I'll go find a room to rent.

616
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,631
I have to go to work.

617
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,345
HEEJA: You're coming straight home
afterward, right?

618
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,932
(door opens, security system beeps)

619
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,310
-(sighs)
-(door shuts)

620
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,858
(groans)

621
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,332
(messenger vibrating)

622
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,465
MINYOUNG: <i>Not now. Let's talk later.</i>

623
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,133
<i>Have a good day at work.</i>

624
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,020
DONGJIN:
<i>I'm sorry. I'll apologize instead.</i>

625
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,044
(music fades out)

626
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,756
(uplifting music playing)

627
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,597
MINYOUNG: <i>I'm moving.</i>

628
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,725
I won't be around here anymore.

629
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,814
Why are you telling me this?

630
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,358
Dongjin wants to be happy with you.

631
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,363
How could I not give up
after hearing that?

632
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:07,871
MINYOUNG: <i>I thought Dongjin would take
my broken self back into his arms.</i>

633
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,250
<i>Maybe he couldn't love me,</i>

634
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,171
<i>but I thought he'd at least be
by my side until I became okay.</i>

635
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,264
<i>If it hadn't been for you,
maybe it could have happened.</i>

636
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,149
(inhales)

637
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,492
(music fades out)

638
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,204
(gloomy music playing)

639
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,692
I heard from Sunwoo.

640
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,195
That…

641
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,281
you're going to quit working here.

642
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,532
(music stops)

643
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,037
I thought I told you.

644
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,831
I don't want to extend my contract.

645
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,836
Can't you reconsider?

646
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,350
I think I'll be sad
if you're not around when I'm at work.

647
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,025
STAFF 1: Good morning.

648
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,360
-STAFF 2: Hello.
-STAFF 3: Yes, good morning.

649
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,112
-(indistinct chatter)
-I'll be at my desk.

650
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,156
(mellow music playing)

651
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,158
STAFF 4: I'll talk to you later.

652
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,993
STAFF 5: Get me that thing from yesterday.

653
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:10,911
STAFF 4: Okay.

654
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,039
STAFF 4: Good morning.

655
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,048
STAFF 4: Hello, sir.

656
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,218
STAFF 5: Good morning.

657
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,263
STAFF 4: Did you have breakfast?

658
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,062
(mellow music continues)

659
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,860
(Jigu grunts uncomfortably)

660
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,194
Hmm?

661
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,950
Be polite and don't tell her
about your singing.

662
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,911
Why? Are you embarrassed about that?

663
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,163
Watch your tone with me. I'm your mother.

664
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,041
There will be people
jealous of you when you do well

665
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,460
and delighted when you fail.

666
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,628
Don't even care about them.

667
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,797
Then why are you taking me there?

668
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,050
Your aunt only has two daughters.

669
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,468
Oh.

670
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,554
My mom sure knows how to strategize.

671
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,019
(tapping)

672
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:20,939
(clinking hard)

673
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,733
(sighs)

674
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,821
Have some coffee.

675
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,198
It's been a while, Jigu.

676
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,700
Yes, it has.

677
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,994
What are you up to these days?
Did you get a job?

678
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,996
Thank you for the coffee.

679
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,873
(chuckles) Sure.

680
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,045
Hyunju, are you feeling better nowadays?

681
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,172
I'm sorry I didn't reach out to you.

682
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,841
I've been so busy.
(chuckles)

683
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,761
You meet with Heeja often, right?

684
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,763
I don't meet her often.

685
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,931
(exclaims dumbfoundedly)

686
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,851
Just once or twice during the holidays?
I don't really meet her apart from that.

687
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,270
I thought to myself
that I wouldn't talk about it

688
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,065
since it's been over ten years
and it would make me feel old.

689
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,900
But seeing you right now, I can't help it.

690
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,779
Who prepared birthday meals
for your husband

691
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,698
and took care of your daughters
after they gave birth?

692
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,785
(scoffs) Come on. Why are you
digging up such old history?

693
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,620
I didn't tell you
to cut off ties with your brother.

694
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,413
We were close.

695
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,207
When you heard that I was sick,

696
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,085
didn't you wonder how sick I was
or how I was doing?

697
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,962
(sighs)

698
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,381
I have no excuse for that.

699
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:33,220
Then tell me everything you know
about the house in Yeonhui-dong, Heeja,

700
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,638
and the man she lives with.

701
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,139
Don't leave anything out.

702
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,934
I want to tell you everything too,

703
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,145
but Woojoo knows more than I do.

704
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,982
She should have met with Heeja's son.

705
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,402
You must not have heard.

706
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,613
Then you probably don't know
she's been to the police station.

707
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,865
-The police station?
-Yeah.

708
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,295
(phone vibrating)

709
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,675
JIGU: <i>Woojoo, why didn't you say?</i>

710
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:12,801
WOOJOO: <i>Say what?</i>

711
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,888
(phone vibrating)

712
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,350
JIGU: <i>That you've been
to the police station,</i>

713
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,893
<i>and that you've met that woman's son.</i>

714
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,645
(sighs)

715
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,523
(dire music playing)

716
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,402
(ringing tone)

717
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,574
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person
you're trying to reach is not available…</i>

718
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,203
(calling beep and ringing tone)

719
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,249
(sighs nervously)

720
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,422
NUTJOB NUMBER TWO

721
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,764
AUNT: <i>She found out
that Heeja was still living in that house,</i>

722
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,266
and went over there to confront her.

723
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,519
She wouldn't open the door
and instead just called the cops on her.

724
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,396
So I had to go bail her out.

725
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,278
Mom.

726
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,489
Let's just go quietly.

727
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,331
JIGU: <i>We're on our way to Yeonhui-dong.
I'll call you later.</i>

728
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,348
(music crescendos)

729
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,641
(smashing)

730
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,654
Mom, should we just go?

731
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,364
Why?

732
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,658
You don't think I can take her?

733
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,870
Not at all. I'm afraid you'll mess her up.

734
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,791
Let's just listen to
what Woojoo has to say.

735
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,502
Okay?

736
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,047
Look, it's Woojoo.

737
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,049
(music fades out)

738
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:15,901
(door opens)

739
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,361
(door shuts)

740
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,405
(footsteps approaching)

741
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,367
Can we even be here?

742
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,661
Yes, I got permission from the boss.

743
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,206
On days we close,
I use this place as my practice studio.

744
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,832
We'll just need to clean up.

745
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,673
Now tell me.

746
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,802
I heard you've been to the police station.

747
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,263
And I heard you met Heeja's son.

748
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,516
What did he say?

749
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,019
What do you think?

750
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,271
I bet he said,
"I'm sorry but it's our house now."

751
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,856
He didn't.

752
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,364
At first, I heard that she sold the house
to invest in her son's company.

753
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,824
But it turned out

754
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,994
the son had nothing to do with it.

755
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:17,087
But he was still looking for us.
To apologize to us.

756
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,797
Apologize to us?

757
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,133
Yes.

758
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,804
He looked so guilty.

759
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,557
I couldn't even suspect
any other intention

760
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,851
as he apologized.

761
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,895
(resolute music playing)

762
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,825
I'm sorry.

763
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,460
WOOJOO: <i>So…</i>

764
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,838
<i>I told him I understood.</i>

765
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,008
<i>And I told him it was okay.</i>

766
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,678
<i>I also told him that it wasn't his fault.</i>

767
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,224
Just like how we suffered because of Dad,

768
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,935
he seemed like

769
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,315
he suffered a lot because of his mom.

770
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,194
So I forgave him.

771
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,283
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

772
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,915
Is that all?

773
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,879
Is there anything else you're hiding?

774
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:46,760
There isn't.

775
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,729
(resolute music builds)

776
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,607
-SOOHEE: Are you clocking out?
-YURI: I am.

777
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,651
(indistinct chatter)

778
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,155
YURI: Sir, we're clocking out for the day!

779
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,157
WHERE ARE YOU?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

780
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,876
SIM JIGU

781
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,919
(calling beep)

782
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,381
(ringing tone)

783
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,392
(music fades out)

784
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,893
-JUN: You're here.
-Yes.

785
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,603
You heard from Jigu, right?

786
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,273
He said we should grab beers.
Let's get some on our way back.

787
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,152
Mom's leaving tomorrow.

788
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,611
So come back home.

789
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,698
It's not because of her
that I hadn't been home.

790
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,533
I'm coming back home tonight.

791
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,180
(phone vibrating)

792
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,560
(vibrating stops)

793
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,563
-Hi.
-DONGJIN: <i>Where are you?</i>

794
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,106
<i>Right now, I'm…</i>

795
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,317
I had some things to take care of at home

796
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,111
and I didn't think to call you.

797
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,156
I'll explain tomorrow morning.

798
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,574
DONGJIN:
You look like you had a rough day.

799
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,618
(mellow music playing)

800
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,841
(running footsteps approaching)

801
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,218
HAESUNG: Mr. Han?

802
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,886
(exclaims happily)

803
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,182
(giggles)
I told you.

804
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,767
It's good we bought a lot of beer.

805
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,895
Let's go in together.
(giggles)

806
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,443
(running footsteps)

807
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,742
(sighs)

808
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,541
JIGU (on mic): <i>Gosh, so a moment like this
can actually happen in real life.</i>

809
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,752
(breathes nervously)
This is truly such a happy moment.

810
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:12,715
Good to see you.

811
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,259
Yes, ma'am.

812
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,680
Start singing, Jigu.

813
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,181
JIGU: Okay.

814
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,683
Let me first announce

815
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,937
that we're gathered here today
by the official request of Ms. Kim Hyunju,

816
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,481
who is gracing us with her presence here.

817
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,774
You did this?

818
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,151
You said no one's heard him sing.

819
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,570
We should at least hear him once.

820
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,780
(Jigu exhales nervously)

821
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,657
I don't know
why my voice is shaking so much.

822
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,242
(inhales) First of all,

823
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,328
it's a great honor
to be able to sing in front of you all.

824
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,706
You who trust me the least in the world,

825
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:49,002
but also cherish me the most in the world.

826
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,880
(applause)

827
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,969
"DEPARTURE" BY KIM DONGRYUL
