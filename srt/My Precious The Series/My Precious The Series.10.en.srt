4

Here.

5
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,097
Lin left this for you.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,026
(But then suddenly,)

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,320
(Lin poked a pen on my back and woke me up.)

8
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:27,665
I don’t want to be an awesome person anymore.

9
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:28,755
I want to become a writer.

10
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,755
I will write about us for you to read one day.

11
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:31,850
I promise.

12
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:33,798
(After that,)

13
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:36,113
(I started writing the story about us)

14
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,732
Tong!
(ever since I got back from Lin’s wedding.)

15
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:41,824
Mr. Sommai.

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,445
Are you and your friends coming to the alumni party on the 20th?

17
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:54,842
Of course.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,150
Me and the boys, we have an appointment.

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,526
Great.

20
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:01,282
So I can prepare my stick to whip you guys up if you misbehave.

21
00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:03,365
That’s great, sir.

22
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,170
Dong was longing to get his rear whipped by you.

23
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:06,972
That troublemaker.

24
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:08,432
He has to get it hard.

25
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:09,670
We’d have to make his rear bruise.

26
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:23,000
Here you go, J’Phon’s Honey Toast.

27
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:24,641
Thank you, Madame.

28
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,686
Haven’t seen you in a while, you’re still as handsome as ever.

29
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:28,461
What did she see in you?

30
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:36,813
I can’t believe her shop stands through winds and rains.

31
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:42,633
Do you know why her shop stands through winds and rains?

32
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:43,688
Why?

33
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:45,000
Did she have an auspicious tattoo?

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,692
Don’t cut me.

35
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:47,810
That has nothing to do with it.

36
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:51,440
It’s because she knows how to adapt.

37
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:56,170
Adapting is an important element in business.

38
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:57,503
Really?

39
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:58,288
Yeah.

40
00:01:58,288 --> 00:01:59,877
Where did you recite that from?

41
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:02,360
It’s my job.

42
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,198
That’s true, though.

43
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:06,872
The toast and the Pink Milk with Syrup still taste as good as ever.

44
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:10,201
Tong.

45
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:12,619
Why aren’t you eating?

46
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:16,897
Well,

47
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:21,821
I messaged Lin and invited her to the alumni party.

48
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,587
She still hasn’t replied.

49
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:25,995
You stupid.

50
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:27,604
She’s abroad, how can she answer you?

51
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,832
I think she’s busy.

52
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:35,800
Doing a Doctoral degree isn’t easy.

53
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:40,000
That means you’re talking to her every day?

54
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,148
I just mustered up the courage and wrote her.

55
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:45,082
My dude,

56
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,771
she probably has no interest in you.

57
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,662
Hey! You little crap.

58
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:49,637
Are you my friend?

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,302
Of course I’m your friend.

60
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,951
Hey, did you ask Ja-Oh about Lin?

61
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,107
I did.

62
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,793
But there’s no reason for me to fill you guys in.

63
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,352
Hey!

64
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:02,855
(Tell him.)

65
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,348
Fine, I’ll fill you in.

66
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,191
I heard that

67
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,027
Lin is studying very hard.

68
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,441
We knew that.

69
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:16,769
Let’s bring my nose up.

70
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,460
Seriously now.

71
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,204
I heard that

72
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:26,440
Lin is still single.

73
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:30,058
Who’s speeding around here?

74
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:30,905
So noisy.

75
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:32,397
There he comes.

76
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,712
Wow.

77
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,775
Did you ride through a storm?

78
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:52,722
There’s lots of dust.

79
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:53,786
Really, a lot.

80
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,129
Boys.

81
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,213
Bank is ready to join the alumni party.

82
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,021
You’re going there looking like this?

83
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:03,328
Why?

84
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:04,655
Do I not look cool?

85
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:05,451
You are.

86
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:07,208
Very funky.

87
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:08,637
You mean I look cool.

88
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:09,852
He meant that you smell funky.

89
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,402
You’re all wet.

90
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:24,365
THE FIRST… AND LAST LOVE.

91
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,357
You bastard Tong.

92
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:09,763
How much longer are you going to take for dressing up?

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,747
Hurry up.

94
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,141
We’re going to miss the food.

95
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:14,817
I’m taking out the memories.

96
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:22,645
Can we go now?

97
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:23,647
You’re so slow.

98
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,372
Let’s go.

99
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,502
You’re wasting time.

100
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:35,483
[ALUMNI PARTY, KHWANWINIT WITTAYA SCHOOL, BATCH 44]

101
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:36,684
Took you guys long enough.

102
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:38,797
Hello.

103
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,713
You guys are all working now.

104
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:43,656
I think it’s been 10 years.

105
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,171
Hello. Hello.

106
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,360
Hey!

107
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,309
You troublemakers.

108
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,780
Here you guys are.

109
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,935
Alright, class.

110
00:06:55,135 --> 00:07:02,114
Hello, Mr. Sommai Saisuwan.

111
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,075
You guys are calling me in full.

112
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,425
Do you guys still miss my stick?

113
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,201
Yes, we do.

114
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:15,351
Sir.

115
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,003
If you do then come here one at a time.

116
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,509
You go first.

117
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:21,050
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

118
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,001
That’s your girlfriend.

119
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:22,868
Let her go first.

120
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,110
Be the tester.

121
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,675
Hey, Troublemakers.

122
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,297
Why don’t you guys join the event?

123
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,867
The food’s ready.

124
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,259
Or do you guys want a whip or two more?

125
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:03,940
That’s enough.

126
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,448
Do you miss us, Sir?

127
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:06,870
Of course, I do.

128
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,757
By the way, do you still scratch your crotch, Mai?

129
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,265
Not anymore, Sir.

130
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,958
My wifey fixed me.

131
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,679
All my underwear is clean now.

132
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:19,725
No wonder.

133
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:23,316
Siraprapa was with you all the time when you were in school.

134
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:25,055
In the end, you guys marry each other.

135
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,007
That’s not true, Sir.

136
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,710
I hated him back then.

137
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:29,933
That’s right, Sir.

138
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,783
Ja-Oh was an angry Giraffe back then.

139
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,152
She was beating me up day and night.

140
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:36,721
- That’s what they call, “you get what you hate”.
- I’m sorry.

141
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:40,889
Sir.

142
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,005
Can we go to the Class 4/3?

143
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:45,117
Tong,

144
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:46,819
why would you go there?

145
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,188
Wouldn’t you want to hurry and join the event?

146
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:55,797
It’s not awesome to join the alumni party without going back to your class.

147
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:11,776
It changed a little.

148
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:12,661
What changed?

149
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:16,212
Wow, new school.

150
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,120
Hey, Dong.

151
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:21,351
What does this say?

152
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:22,605
Grammar.

153
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,250
Hey,

154
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:25,034
there’s an improvement.

155
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:26,021
Yes, bro.

156
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:27,101
- So cool.
- Dong,

157
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:28,587
a kindergarten kid could read that too.

158
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:31,450
I had been studying it for years.

159
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,210
Good job, my dude.

160
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,734
Hey, let me sit in the front.

161
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:38,089
Me and Mai always sat at the back when we were in school.

162
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:42,829
I remember sitting in this row.

163
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:43,773
Really?

164
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:44,855
Weren’t you sitting in my heart, Ja-Oh?

165
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:47,386
Easy.

166
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,377
That’s my wife.

167
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,729
I’m only joking.

168
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,628
Hey, Tong.

169
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,621
When will you finish the book you’re writing?

170
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:57,174
Right.

171
00:09:57,174 --> 00:10:00,176
I want to know how the end of your book goes already.

172
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:07,092
I think our lives don’t have an ending like movies or novels.

173
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:09,503
There are only the next episodes.

174
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,993
Damn.

175
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,497
So poetic.

176
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,303
Tong, but if you don’t hurry and finish your book, the world is ending tomorrow.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,680
Hold on,

178
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:22,790
how do you know, babe?

179
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,442
The Mayans wrote that the world would end on December 21st, 2012.

180
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:30,511
My, Ja-Oh.

181
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,387
It was you who was talking about the Y2K Ghost too.

182
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,979
Calm down.

183
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:39,615
But if the world actually ends tomorrow,

184
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:41,503
what do you guys want to do?

185
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:51,898
I want to meet her one more time.

186
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,860
I want to see her smile again.

187
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:49,031
Tong.

188
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:07,121
Lin!

189
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:10,891
Lin!

190
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,393
Pao. Dong.

191
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:16,479
Mai. Bank.

192
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:19,632
How are you?

193
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,704
I’m alright.

194
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,806
Boys!

195
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:26,154
Tong!

196
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:27,365
Come here, Tong.

197
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:49,939
Are you guys doing alright?

198
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:53,341
I miss you guys so much.

199
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,390
I miss you too, Lin.

200
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:05,598
Why are we sad when we finally managed to gather?

201
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,882
Join us, Ja-Oh.

202
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,694
(She’s still the same Lin.)

203
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,098
(The one I fell for when I was 16.)

204
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,480
(She’s back with puzzles in a new Exercise Book.)

205
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:30,846
(This time, I’m not going to make mistakes again.)

206
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,486
Tong!

207
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:49,438
Tong, are you alright?

208
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,166
Are you okay?

209
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:54,924
Who are you guys?!

210
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,708
I’m glad

211
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,764
that you accepted my invitation and came.

212
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:10,944
How does it feel

213
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:12,500
to be the first PhD in our batch?

214
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,133
It feels tiring.

215
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:16,818
Then don’t go back to your study.

216
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:45,942
I’m glad

217
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,801
that you accepted my invitation and came.

218
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,152
I’m glad to have come too.

219
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:56,776
I miss home so badly.

220
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:02,705
It’s really tough studying there.

221
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:03,823
You know what, Tong?

222
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,703
I cried so many times because I wanted to go home.

223
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,732
This is probably the first time you’re disheartened because of study.

224
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,349
Because it’s really tough.

225
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:20,541
When I got to see the ocean at the South Pole,

226
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,584
my tiredness disappeared.

227
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,033
When I get to dive,

228
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,099
to see the marine life,

229
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,901
it was extraordinary.

230
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,387
It was really awesome.

231
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,491
I’m glad that you’re happy with what you love.

232
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:45,135
Yes.

233
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:46,830
Thanks.

234
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:48,916
What about you?

235
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:50,538
Are you happy?

236
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:59,008
If we’re talking about this moment,

237
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:04,777
I’m so happy to be here with you right now.

238
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,062
I was talking about your work.

239
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:12,838
Well,

240
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,881
it’s pretty good.

241
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:16,989
I get to write about lots of fun things.

242
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:20,211
I really want you to see my work.

243
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,377
What about the novel you promised me?

244
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:30,978
Almost there.

245
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,783
I’ll be waiting.

246
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,533
2013

247
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,419
You are doing your hair up so fine.

248
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:57,591
Of course, dude.

249
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:59,275
What are you doing, Tong?

250
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,258
I’m recording us talking.

251
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:04,944
That serious?

252
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,792
I thought you were joking.

253
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:10,002
He wasn’t joking ever since he asked to meet us at school.

254
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,107
By the way, Tong.

255
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,584
Are you sure you want to write a novel about me?

256
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,897
I’m not writing about you,

257
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,419
I’m writing about us.

258
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,235
Whatever it is.

259
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,475
But let me be the main lead for this one.

260
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,038
But why would you get to be the main lead?

261
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:32,419
Because I’m the most handsome one in the group.

262
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:34,718
You bastard.

263
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,286
You’re 30 yet still acting like 16.

264
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,318
Right, 16 was our golden era.

265
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,507
That’s true.

266
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:46,579
By the way,

267
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,098
I couldn’t feel any fun like when I was 16.

268
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:53,591
It was indeed a really great memory.

269
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:55,420
But I think it’s a bit of a shame

270
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:59,768
that we can’t get that anymore when we’re adults.

271
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:00,911
That’s true.

272
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,542
I couldn’t find any memory like that ever since I finished school.

273
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,410
Hey, guys.

274
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:14,872
Do you guys think we could forget our first love?

275
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,116
Of course, we can.

276
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:18,297
Really?

277
00:18:18,904 --> 00:18:21,379
Isn’t first love ‘the one’?

278
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,639
Isn’t our destiny ‘the one’?

279
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:29,583
Are you talking about Lin?

280
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:31,904
Of course it’s about Lin.

281
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,497
Tong’s first love is Lin.

282
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:34,387
You stupid.

283
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,945
It’s not hard to forget your first love.

284
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:40,115
But it’s hard because it’s Lin.

285
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:40,799
You stupid.

286
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,750
One can never forget the one you love.

287
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,321
Your feelings might decrease.

288
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,409
But you can never forget.

289
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,742
What Pao said is true.

290
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:59,538
Let me ask you something, Tong.

291
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:01,374
At Lin’s wedding,

292
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,897
you had a chance to kiss her

293
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,730
but why didn’t you do it?

294
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,679
Right, I was wondering the same.

295
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,840
I haven’t been to the school for a while.

296
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,937
It didn’t change much, did it?

297
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,439
It reminds me of that time,

298
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,997
the time when you were trying to hit on me.

299
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:02,146
What are you saying?

300
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:03,403
I wasn’t trying to hit on you.

301
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:05,987
Are you sure you weren’t?

302
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:08,236
Yeah.

303
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,709
The ones trying to hit on you were those guys.

304
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,782
They’re not going to sit with us.

305
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:26,295
They’re like that.

306
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,387
You guys didn’t change one bit.

307
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:40,712
Everyone still loves you just the same, Lin.

308
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,712
Thank you, guys.

309
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:01,379
Thanks for hitting on me.

310
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,514
(No matter how many years have passed,)

311
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:11,456
(all of us still miss)

312
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:15,659
(and fall for this girl with big round eyes)

313
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:17,554
(and beautiful smile just the same.)

314
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:27,908
Lin.

315
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,025
Look at them.

316
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,566
(Perhaps, they might be in love with her their whole life,)

317
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:36,513
(who knows?)

318
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:44,557
Then

319
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:46,796
when are you going back to your study?

320
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:49,991
I’m going back next week already.

321
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,171
One more year and I’ll be done with my doctoral degree.

322
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,363
Well,

323
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:55,399
Pimnara, PhD.

324
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,661
How does it feel

325
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,968
to be the first PhD in our batch?

326
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,037
Well.

327
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,136
It feels tiring.

328
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:10,965
Think about it,

329
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:16,470
Since I was born, I have already spent over 20 years in education.

330
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,146
Then don’t go back to your study.

331
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,619
Stay with me.

332
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:31,907
Lin.

333
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:39,627
Do you want to go out with me?

334
00:22:57,152 --> 00:22:57,743
Tong.

335
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:01,297
Why did you ask Lin to quit her studies?

336
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:03,769
What do I do about Tong?

337
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,009
Do you still love Tong?

338
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:30,918
[Boonyong Pharmacy]

339
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:01,535
Lin.

340
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:03,489
Are you alright?

341
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,010
Ja-Oh.

342
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,719
What do I do about Tong?

343
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,175
Do you still love Tong?

344
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:27,568
Of course, I do.

345
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,225
Tong was my first love.

346
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:54,490
Tong.

347
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,570
You guys’ favorite drinks.

348
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:00,488
It’s the green one for me.

349
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,717
You’re so picky.

350
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:03,060
Bank.

351
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:06,570
Tong.

352
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,369
Why did you ask Lin to quit her studies?

353
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:16,311
I understand that you love her

354
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,425
but you shouldn’t have done that.

355
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:20,719
Hey,

356
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:23,329
but we’re already 30.

357
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:25,373
And Tong has been waiting for Lin for a long time.

358
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,765
If they don’t get together now

359
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:27,939
then shall they wait until after they’re retired?

360
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:35,829
Hey, but you guys know that for someone like Lin, study is very important.

361
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,854
Right,

362
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:41,618
if you’re trying to lure her then you should have some tricks.

363
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:43,885
I was only asking her out

364
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:45,302
not trying to sell drugs.

365
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:49,530
That’s why you don’t have a girlfriend.

366
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:51,046
You’re single too.

367
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:52,581
Hey, hold on.

368
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:53,984
Who says Bank is single?

369
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,760
He has lots of girlfriends.

370
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,360
They’re all his clients.

371
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,424
Dong has a girlfriend too, not just me.

372
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:04,752
I refuse to answer any personal questions.

373
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,153
My butt!

374
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,007
Tong’s not laughing at all.

375
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,978
We’d better not stray out of the issue.

376
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,573
We should help Tong out.

377
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:15,584
We will have to separate and get back to work soon.

378
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:20,754
We can help with his novel

379
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:26,416
but with Lin, you have to handle it yourself, Tong.

380
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:35,023
Honestly, your life seems like a mid-life crisis.

381
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:36,564
Work,

382
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:37,301
love,

383
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:39,162
it’s all problematic.

384
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:48,038
I just don’t want it to be like the way it was back then.

385
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:50,843
Take it easy.

386
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:56,332
I’m afraid I would ruin it again.

387
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:58,266
Oh.

388
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,239
Hello, Lin.

389
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,717
I can’t do what you asked.

390
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:25,523
I will go back and continue my studies.

391
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:41,354
I understand.

392
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:44,691
What did you understand?

393
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:49,513
I understand that

394
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:56,631
when you put your mind on something

395
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:00,007
you will keep going and see through it until the end.

396
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,800
You wouldn’t give up on your dreams easily.

397
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:12,855
And one more thing,

398
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:21,347
you wouldn’t be able to simply forget about Petch.

399
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:46,459
Do you remember the thing about the parallel universe that you told me back when the Tsunami hit?

400
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,980
Of course, I do.

401
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:56,407
What do you think we in the parallel universe are doing?

402
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:10,563
I’m only hoping that

403
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,421
they are happy.

404
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:20,808
And that the other Tong

405
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,545
wouldn’t make the same mistakes I did.

406
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:32,362
But do you know what?

407
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:38,910
When one makes a mistake, there’s always a chance of redemption.

408
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:44,503
It depends on whether one would be able to take that chance.

409
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:53,457
Then,

410
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,883
do I get that chance?

411
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:17,900
Why do you want to meet us so desperately, Tong?

412
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,231
I’ve finished my novel.

413
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,150
How does the ending go?

414
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:22,636
Read it yourself.

415
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,732
No matter how many exercise puzzles you will make me solve,

416
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:28,932
I will only give you one answer.

417
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:49,072
Would you be able to wait another year until I finish my studies?

418
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:54,567
Let’s start over when that time comes.

419
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:02,877
Yeah.

420
00:32:04,863 --> 00:32:06,304
Of course, I can wait for you.

421
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:12,727
I hope we won’t mess it up again.

422
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,159
I hope we will be able to grab this chance.

423
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:28,392
But

424
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,037
can I ask something that might seem out of order?

425
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,291
What is it?

426
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,122
No matter how many exercise puzzles you will make me solve,

427
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:05,021
I will only give you one answer.

428
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,609
(The love life went smoothly for all of us.)

429
00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:48,263
(Mai and Ja-Oh are busy with raising their children.)

430
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:49,419
Are you going to Papa Mai?

431
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,318
Are you going to Papa Mai?

432
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:55,675
(While Pao becomes a lover-boy-meatball.)

433
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,751
(To the extent that it surprises me how he quit acting mature)

434
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,686
(and become just a little boy when it comes to love.)

435
00:35:01,543 --> 00:35:03,033
Just help me out a little here.

436
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:08,146
(But for some, too much love can bring you headaches.)

437
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:08,726
Bank.

438
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:10,139
You said you’re only talking to me.

439
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:10,797
Bank.

440
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:13,527
Who is she?
(But he has no idea that the one who exposed his multiple affairs)

441
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:16,122
- Bank, who are these two girls?
- (is actually his parents.)

442
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,056
Hello, honey?

443
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,332
No, no. I’m still working.

444
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:24,502
(In the end, Dong took up his family’s business.)

445
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,332
(And me?)

446
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,324
(I spend my time finishing up my novel.)

447
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:36,821
(While waiting for my first love to finally return.)

448
00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:57,440
Why do we have to meet at school, Tong?
[1 YEAR LATER]

449
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,172
Right.

450
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,683
We’re meeting up after a year,

451
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:04,745
there are plenty of good places like J’Phon’s place we could go but you wouldn’t.

452
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,851
But I think it sets us in the vibe.

453
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,644
Reminds us of when we were in school.

454
00:36:09,396 --> 00:36:14,193
Why do you want to meet us so desperately, Tong?

455
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:17,031
Do you know we are super busy

456
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:18,619
yet we have to make time to see you?

457
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:22,155
I asked you guys to meet here because I wanted to tell you guys that

458
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:27,891
I’ve finished my novel.

459
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:29,224
Hey!

460
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:30,227
You’ve finished?

461
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,204
How does the ending go?

462
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,335
Read it yourself.

463
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:37,447
Fine.

464
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,794
Once I get the book, I’ll skip to the ending part.

465
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:42,787
Read it properly, dude.

466
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:44,665
I put my heart into writing it.

467
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:46,976
Can you give us some spoilers?

468
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,213
- Like a little bit.
- Mai. Mai.

469
00:36:48,483 --> 00:36:49,111
“Spoil”.

470
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:51,613
“Spoil”.

471
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,503
Could you “spoil” a bit for us?

472
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:00,918
It’s about our first love.

473
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,192
Our first limb?

474
00:37:02,192 --> 00:37:03,194
Our first love!

475
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,487
Guys!

476
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,681
Lin!

477
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,578
How have you been?

478
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:16,551
Wifey?

479
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:20,042
Lin wouldn’t care about a first love nonsense.

480
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:24,078
What?

481
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:25,689
I hate how you say words.

482
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:28,506
Say congratulations to her in English.

483
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,103
Congratulations.

484
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:32,111
There we go.

485
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:36,492
A foreigner-like accent.

486
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:37,503
Foreigner-like.

487
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:38,566
Yeah, whatever.

488
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:39,882
Congratulations.

489
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,252

(But with an addition that)

514
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:17,388
(she’s my last love.)

515
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:35,177
A DAY IN TONG AND LIN’S PARALLEL UNIVERSE.

516
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,526
Babe.

517
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:57,930
What are you thinking?

518
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,254
I have a writer’s block.

519
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:05,065
I couldn’t come up with the script.

520
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,769
Here.

521
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:15,043
Take the bill so you can think of something.

522
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,531
Is it the end of the month already?

523
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:24,261
I’ve just paid the rent, the water, the electricity.

524
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:27,122
There’s also the cost of the new AC.

525
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:28,896
There are countless spendings already.

526
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:34,385
But thing most well-spent

527
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:37,770
is when we’re together.

528
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,000
Hey.

529
00:41:40,136 --> 00:41:41,519
I’m being serious.

530
00:41:41,594 --> 00:41:42,643
Quit joking.

531
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:44,953
I’m telling the truth.

532
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:48,052
As long as we hold on to each other’s hands,

533
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,543
we’ll get through it.

534
00:41:53,146 --> 00:41:54,813
I’ll never let go of your hands.

535
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:56,940
Same here.

536
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,288
What should we eat for dinner today?

537
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:12,755
We’re out of rice,

538
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:17,706
there’s only vegetables and a little bit of pork left.

539
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:20,516
There’s only one menu.

540
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:21,284
Hmm?

541
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:22,934
The “End-Of-The-Month-Menu”.

542
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:25,262
Come on, babe.

543
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:27,354
Can’t it be something special?

544
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:29,729
It’s our anniversary after all.

545
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,171
Then, a shabu?

546
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:38,667
Fine.

547
00:42:55,232 --> 00:42:56,233
Hold on.

548
00:42:59,105 --> 00:43:00,104
Why?

549
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:01,338
Not yet.

550
00:43:01,338 --> 00:43:02,616
We haven’t got all the things we need.

551
00:43:03,555 --> 00:43:04,437
What’s missing?

552
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:09,473
This.

553
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:13,716
The best thing.

554
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,213
Then we should call it “End-Of-The-Month-Shabu”.

555
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:26,040
Do you want some meatballs?

556
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,393
Thank you.

557
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:33,287
Cheers.

558
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,202
Cheers.

559
00:43:55,907 --> 00:43:58,497
The noodles remind me of the parallel universe.

560
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:00,197
How so?

561
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,184
There are lots of noodles, right?

562
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:10,409
It’s like the parallel universe that branches out into timelines.

563
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:17,269
Maybe, in some parallel universe, we might be eating this “End-Of-The-Month-Menu”.

564
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:22,751
I think we would be eating this in every parallel universe.

565
00:44:25,008 --> 00:44:26,793
That’s possible.

566
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:31,003
Here, here.

567
00:44:47,864 --> 00:44:48,468
Hmm?

568
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:13,783
It’s pretty romantic when we eat this way.

569
00:45:16,562 --> 00:45:17,757
Right.

570
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:25,133
Is it good?

571
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:26,466
Very.
