4
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:17,492
Let me ask you something.

5
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,606
Why don’t you like studying?

6
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:22,696
I was afraid that if I was studious, I would become smarter than you.

7
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:28,520
(From now on, do anything to make him concentrate on his studies.)

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,749
The exercise.

9
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:32,818
Why would you want another student to look after me?

10
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:33,975
We have to help each other.

11
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,084
Are you going to tutor us?

12
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:36,777
Yes.

13
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:40,253
I was about to invite you guys for a study session this Saturday.

14
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,295
[Mama Or’s Cuisine.]

15
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,106
Pao!

16
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:06,845
You’re so slow.

17
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,242
You guys didn’t wait for me.

18
00:01:09,217 --> 00:01:11,633
Ja-Oh, your friends are here.

19
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:13,205
Hey!

20
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:17,353
Hurry up.

21
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:19,459
Hello, Mom and Dad.

22
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,046
Hello.

23
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:22,095
- Hello, Mom and Dad.
- Hello.

24
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:25,143
Hello, Mom and Dad.

25
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:27,348
Come on in, I’ll get you something to drink.

26
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:29,434
Sorry to trouble you.

27
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,209
Dad.

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,582
I got this.

29
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:35,570
You should go and sit back.

30
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:38,568
It’s nothing big, I got this.

31
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,585
You don’t always have friends coming over.

32
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,493
Feel free to let Mama Or know what you want to eat.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,937
Sai Ua, please.

34
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,127
Sure.

35
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:48,797
I’m making Larb right now.

36
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:51,002
That’s my favorite.

37
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,177
Can I have Kaeb Moo to it too?

38
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:53,687
For sure. You got it.

39
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:54,609
Come on it.

40
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:55,591
Come in.

41
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,557
Thank you.

42
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,329
Thank you.

43
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,207
Drinks.

44
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:09,352
Lin, here you go.

45
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:16,265
Delicious!

46
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,225
This is so delicious.

47
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,095
Is it that delicious?

48
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,041
It is.

49
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,489
It’s the best I’ve ever had in my life.

50
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:25,916
Where did the Larb go?

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,313
Mom, the Larb is so good.

52
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:30,855
Hold on, Mai.

53
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,119
Who did you just call ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad’?

54
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:37,020
Well, you’re one possessive person.

55
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,510
It’s alright, Ja-Oh, I’ll get him for you.

56
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,059
Right in there.

57
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:45,395
I told you.

58
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:48,330
Your parents’ cuisine is the best in town.

59
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,066
Lin, do you want some rice?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,765
What rice?

61
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,819
Rights to get into your heart.

62
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,132
Lame!

63
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:14,294
(The Family’s pride.)

64
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:18,017
I’m so full.

65
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,466
So full my stomach’s going to explode.

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,865
I actually want to eat more but I can’t shuck anything down anymore.

67
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,831
Why didn’t I know there’s such a delicious place?

68
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:30,500
Had I known it before, I’d come here every day.

69
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:33,899
Right, why haven’t we been here before when it’s this delicious?

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,848
My house is not in a prime location.

71
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,381
We also don’t have a regular opening time.

72
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,998
My dad’s a little sick.

73
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,487
When he’s sick, we’d have to close the shop.

74
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,574
Mom has to take him to the doctor too.

75
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,466
But just wait and see.

76
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,983
I’ll become rich one day.

77
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,391
I’ll take my dad to the best doctor in town.

78
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:21,164
I’ll move this place to the heart of the town

79
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:23,704
and hire lots of employees.

80
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:24,548
Sounds great.

81
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,915
That way you can have lots of employees grilling Sai Ua for us.

82
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:36,426
At that time, can you hire me too?

83
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:39,022
Sure, would you like to sign the contract now?

84
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:40,329
Hey, hey!

85
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:41,440
Hire me too.

86
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,426
I’m good at washing dishes.

87
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,741
Does Paweena get you to wash the dish often?

88
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,337
Yeah.

89
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:46,686
She used me so much that I turned into a pro.

90
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:50,000
Wish-wash.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,233
A pro.

92
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,139
Mr. Mai.

93
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:52,639
Yes?

94
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,168
Can you show us your dishwashing skills?

95
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:58,257
Dad, Mom, please sit back.

96
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,508
We’ve got someone to wash the dish for us.

97
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,505
Shouldn’t have said that.

98
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:04,895
Strength.

99
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:06,076
Off you go, good sir.

100
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,064
Go, go.

101
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,418
Go, boy.

102
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:09,479
Hurry up and get to work.

103
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,742
Go. Go. Go.

104
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,995
Wish-wash.

105
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:16,196
Go. What are you waiting for?

106
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:17,576
The plates are piling.

107
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:20,043
Go. Go. Go.

108
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,085
What is your size?

109
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:26,737
I think I’m a big size.W

110
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:28,418
e don’t have any chairs for guests.

111
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,364
You guys are fine with sitting on the floor, right?

112
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:32,912
Sure, no problem.

113
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,082
I can even lie around.

114
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:37,718
Dong, you come here.

115
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,656
That wasn’t intentional.

116
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:41,110
Ow!

117
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:55,901
Are you guys here to study or to play?

118
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,931
Mai, come and sit here.

119
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:10,777
Tong,

120
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:12,755
come and sit here.

121
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,861
Dong.

122
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,478
Are you not going to stop?

123
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:27,908
78.

124
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:28,775
Are you on it?

125
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:35,634
I taught you a lot.

126
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:43,395
Rocket, my boy.

127
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,379
- You gave it a name?
- You’re so pretty.

128
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,048
Thank you guys for today.

129
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,156
Are you thanking me for washing the dishes for you, Giraffe?

130
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:50,917
No.

131
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:53,569
I’m thanking you guys for coming to my house.

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,861
It’d be such a waste if we didn’t come when the food here is so good.

133
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,000
Isn’t that right, guys?

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,852
Yeah.

135
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,585
You guys should go home.

136
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:03,786
See you tomorrow.

137
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:05,567
I’ll get going.

138
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,948
Hey, Lin. Wait.

139
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:14,117
It’s late so it’s dangerous.

140
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:16,981
Would you go home with me?

141
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:17,713
I’ll take you home.

142
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,069
I think you’re the most dangerous one.

143
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:23,188
Lin. Take the bike.

144
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:24,766
It’s safe and you won’t have to worry.

145
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,802
Your bicycle, huh, Pao?

146
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,526
Will she even get home by midnight?

147
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,566
Lin, it’s better if you come home with me.

148
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:34,229
Lin won’t go home with someone like you.

149
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,394
Lin, you should come home with me.

150
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,780
My car is the newest and the safest.

151
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,655
You’re the most dangerous one.

152
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,034
I’ll take Lin home.

153
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,560
Guys, it’s alright.

154
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,640
I can get home myself.

155
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,144
No.

156
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,670
Lin, it’s late.

157
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,744
What’d happen if you met a thief on your way home?

158
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:52,269
Stop talking nonsense.

159
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:52,944
Lin, hop on my motorbike.

160
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:53,800
It’s the safest one, trust me.

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,131
Back off, you.

162
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,353
All of you are dangerous.

163
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:57,899
It’s you and your bicycle, rather.

164
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:03,995
Stop.

165
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:13,396
Let’s fight for it.

166
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:16,689
Whoever wins gets to take Lin home.

167
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,136
Deal.

168
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,886
Black-And-Whites.

169
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,556
Black-And-Whites.

170
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,737
Black-And-Whites.

171
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:56,305
Black-And-Whites.

172
00:09:57,882 --> 00:09:58,900
Black-And-Whites.

173
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:00,770
Black-And-Whites.

174
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,122
Black-And-Whites.

175
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:03,668
Black-And-Whites.

176
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,769
Black-And-Whites.

177
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:11,395
Black-And-Whites.

178
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:13,042
Will you get to go home tonight?

179
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:16,155
Black-And-Whites.

180
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,414
Then all of you just take me home altogether.

181
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,826
I’ll get going, Ja-Oh.

182
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,534
Let’s go.

183
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:30,701
I’m going first.

184
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,219
No!

185
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:36,558
No, you don’t!

186
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,159
Don’t stop me.

187
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,490
Will there be any prize for me if I get the highest score in English?

188
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:51,215
Nontawat.

189
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:54,226
You can do it if you put your head into it.

190
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,058
I can do it even without putting my head into it.

191
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,241
I’m a genius.

192
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,144
Where is our Meatball?

193
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,488
Ow!

194
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:25,035
Ow!

195
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,086
Ow! That hurts.

196
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,923
You can see alright, Pao?

197
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,924
Yes, no big deal.

198
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,924
You can really see, right, Pao?

199
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:36,898
Yes, Lin.

200
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,044
Meatball!

201
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:39,961
Oh, Meatball!

202
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,080
Pretty.

203
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,378
Nice.

204
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,417
Oh, here he is.

205
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,652
It’s my turn now, boy.

206
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:00,105
Thanks, Pao.

207
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:01,342
Sure.

208
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:02,775
Come, Lin.

209
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,856
Slow down, Bank.

210
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,577
What did you say?

211
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:12,778
There’s a cow?

212
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:14,862
I said, slow down!

213
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:21,880
Here we are.

214
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,190
See you, Lin.

215
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,259
Bye bye. I’ll get going.

216
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:30,582
Dong.

217
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:33,391
Please go slowly.

218
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,838
No speeding.

219
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,402
Do you want to be with me a little longer?

220
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:13,175
Isn’t this too slow?

221
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,405
It’s not slow enough?

222
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:16,233
Fine, I’ll go slower.

223
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,301
Do you want to hear some music again?

224
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:25,518
It’s alright.

225
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:34,751
Dong, you bastard.

226
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,762
Why are you so late?

227
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:38,845
I can’t help it.

228
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:40,550
Lin wants to be with me a little longer.

229
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:46,193
See you, Lin.

230
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:53,372
Lin.

231
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:54,777
Let’s go.

232
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,686
I’ve just borrowed my dad’s motorbike.

233
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:00,117
I just learned to ride a few days ago.

234
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:01,205
What?

235
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:07,151
Are you alright, Mai?

236
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,411
Lin, I think we need to help each other out here.

237
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:14,919
Alright. Sure.

238
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,006
You stand right here.

239
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:17,482
1…2…

240
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,312
I forgot to release the brake.

241
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:23,872
Go!

242
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:28,469
Almost there.

243
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:33,769
Did your motorbike break down?

244
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,920
Why did are you so late?

245
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,473
There was no problem with my motorbike.

246
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,592
I just didn’t know how to ride with a passenger.

247
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:41,901
Lin doesn’t know how to ride a motorbike neither.

248
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,029
So we had to tow it.

249
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,925
Then why did you offer to take Lin home in the first place?

250
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:45,898
That’s right.

251
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,367
You have to seize the opportunity when it’s infront of you.

252
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:50,403
Come, Tong. Let’s go home.

253
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:55,489
Bye bye, Lin.

254
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:58,226
Tong.

255
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,021
Drive properly, I don’t want anymore of this.

256
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:13,629
I’ve never ridden on a bike going as fast as that before.

257
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,548
Maybe you didn’t say it clearly.

258
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:16,675
No.

259
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,676
I said, “Bank, slow down.”

260
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:20,873
There we go.

261
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:21,928
You said, ‘cow’.

262
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,768
How’s that a ‘cow’?

263
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,007
You said, ‘cow’. You missaid it.

264
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,422
I said, “slow down.”

265
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:27,531
- You said, Slow–
- I said, Slow–

266
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:28,031
Ow!

267
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:33,628
Are you an electric eel?

268
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:35,587
Are you crazy?

269
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:36,455
What are you on about?

270
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:37,469
Electric eel.

271
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,148
Electric eel.

272
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,207
I’m not an electric eel.

273
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:40,970
Electric eel.

274
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,523
- That’s you.
- Electric eel.

275
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,023
Electric eel.

276
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:42,742
- Tong!
- Electric eel.

277
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:44,718
Electric eel.

278
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:45,307
That’s you.

279
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:46,029
Electric eel.

280
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:53,122
Can I speak to Edgar, please?

281
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:59,067
I’m afraid he is not home from work yet.

282
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,957
Who’s speaking?

283
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:08,189
It is McWell a friend of his.

284
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:08,790
Tong.

285
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:11,831
Stop reading.

286
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:13,022
It’s dinner time.

287
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:14,821
Okay, Mommy.

288
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:19,763
I think we have to send our boy abroad.

289
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,118
Try getting out of this town first.

290
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:27,465
Now I understand why we need to focus on our study.

291
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,601
You just realized that now?

292
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:32,012
What did you understand?

293
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:39,687
So that our loved one would be proud of us, Mom.

294
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:42,214
You are one sweet talker.

295
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:44,085
Eat some fish.

296
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,196
So you’ll be smart.

297
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:47,772
Thank you, Mommy.

298
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,075
Mom. Dad.

299
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:59,525
Will there be any prize for me if I get the highest score in English?

300
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:01,669
You don’t even have to get the highest score,

301
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:04,604
I’d give you a price if you even scored half of it.

302
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:05,851
You said it, Dad.

303
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:06,644
Yeah.

304
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:07,716
You can’t go back on your words.

305
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,349
A man doesn’t take back his words.

306
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,119
What about my gold?

307
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,619
That’s something from ages ago, you still remember it?

308
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,570
You just said it last night.

309
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,120
Alright.

310
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,893
I’ll buy you two heaps.

311
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:25,036
We’re not talking about some snacks here.

312
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:27,008
Are you still playing such stupid jokes?

313
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:30,547
You’d better put your money on the bedside.

314
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:32,539
Tong.

315
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,733
My botox must have moved.

316
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,611
Go get me some painkiller.

317
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,102
One second, Dad.

318
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,172
Why are you just sitting there?

319
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:47,486
Go on and eat.

320
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:49,235
I’m waiting for the painkiller.

321
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,132
Here it is, Dad.

322
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:53,023
Are you alright?

323
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,595
Are you trying to kill yourself with those drugs?

324
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:57,405
Do you think you can escape me with death?

325
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:58,537
Tong. Eat your food.

326
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,667
You are one mastermind, huh?

327
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,120
You sure knows how to crack jokes.

328
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:06,201
Don’t you ever consider whether I would be able to play along?

329
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,655
Danai.

330
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:14,043
Second best score, 18 points.

331
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,797
Keep this up.

332
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:16,428
Yes, miss.

333
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,084
Siraprapa.

334
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:19,692
11 points.

335
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:23,869
It almost got you there

336
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,467
Concentrate on your study more.

337
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,658
Don’t just draw.

338
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:29,382
Nontawat.

339
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:37,149
18 points.

340
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,710
You can do it if you put your head into it.

341
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,608
I can do it even without putting my head into it.

342
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,923
I’m a genius.

343
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:54,970
Right.

344
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:58,164
From whom did you copy from?

345
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,436
You’d better keep up your genius ability.

346
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,185
If you’re a real man, try beating Pimnara.

347
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,322
A full score.

348
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:20,070
Teeradon.

349
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,018
Yes?

350
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:22,811
5 points.

351
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,724
Failing again and again.

352
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,982
Don’t forget to come and see me at lunch time for re-test.

353
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:33,236
Alright.

354
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,486
That’s it for today.

355
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:35,898
Please stand up.

356
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:41,857
Thank you, Teacher.

357
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,946
5 points!

358
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,353
It’s alright.

359
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:51,292
Try again next time.

360
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:52,548
With intensive studying.

361
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,678
Hey, Giraffe.

362
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,475
Do you want to play?

363
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,635
You’ve got long legs, good for this.

364
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,825
Come on, Giraffe.

365
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:20,496
Ja-Oh!

366
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,095
Are you calling yourself a genius just because you get the second-highest score?

367
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,653
I was just brushing through it yet I’ve got 18.

368
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:46,037
A genius like me can get good scores without a need to pay attention in class.

369
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:49,028
That’s true.

370
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:50,086
Don’t you believe me?

371
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:51,983
I do.

372
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:53,895
If you do then why are you studying hard?

373
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:57,145
Let me ask you something.

374
00:20:57,652 --> 00:20:59,016
Why are you studying so hard?

375
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,020
You would make it into university anyways.

376
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:06,306
Hey. You don’t have to always expect the outcome of everything you do.

377
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:09,057
I just do it because it’s a good thing.

378
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,760
Do you always have to behave maturely all the time?

379
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,930
Then how’s acting childish like you any better?

380
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,826
How would you know when you’ve never tried?

381
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,826
Not only do I act like a child.

382
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:25,985
I also look young.

383
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:34,284
If it’s nonsense, you don’t have to waste your time and do it, Tong.

384
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:39,897
Hey, Preecha!

385
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,995
I’ve got 18 out of 20.

386
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,809
How’s that? I’m good, aren’t I?

387
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:45,313
Here it is.

388
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,652
What would happen if you get a full score?

389
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,417
If I get a full score, you’d feel intimidated.

390
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:53,947
I’m so want to feel intimidated.

391
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:05,185
Dude! I got 18.

392
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:06,192
I got 18.

393
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,596
Yay!

394
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:14,144
Ja-Oh.

395
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,062
Where are the boys going?

396
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:19,925
Well the boys are “into the eggs” these days.

397
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:22,556
We just wanted to make a history

398
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:24,652
by playing games into the year 2000.

399
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:52,529
Wakey-wakey!

00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:03,022
Hey!

404
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,011
We sure know each other well.

405
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:09,670
The thing is, my boy’s got a good score in his English test.

406
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,083
So I was looking for a present to give hime.

407
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:12,892
Are you talking about Dong?

408
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,404
Yes.

409
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:14,918
What’s your ranking in the class?

410
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:16,067
I got 5 points.

411
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:17,345
Out of 5?

412
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:18,247
Out of 20.

413
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,117
Oh!

414
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:23,086
There’s an improvement.

415
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:26,343
He used to get 0 or nothing over 1.

416
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,819
But now he’s got 5 points.

417
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:30,550
That’s an improvement so I’m getting him some presents.

418
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:33,381
The new goods.

419
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:34,160
You got it.

420
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:35,027
Shall we?

421
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:36,148
Let’s go.

422
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:38,218
Come on.

423
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:39,657
Follow me to the back.

424
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,102
Where?

425
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:44,381
I’ve got lots of new stuff.

426
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,716
Oh?

427
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:48,478
Oh?

428
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,083
Oh?

429
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,640
Oh?

430
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:50,297
Oh?

431
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:51,282
Oh? Uncle Haeb.

432
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,130
You’re supposed to ‘Oh?’ at Dong.

433
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:53,955
Hello, Uncle Chen.

434
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,237
Why are you so surprised?

435
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:58,299
Hold on, are you looking for a present for your son too, Tao?

436
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,682
As an adult, you’re not supposed to put a limit on the youths.

437
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,310
You have to let them learn.

438
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:05,236
Great.

439
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:10,966
This one’s Chinese, 3 Japanese, and this one’s Thai.

440
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:12,975
Mine are all Japanese.

441
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:13,475
Is that so?

442
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:18,301
Tao!

443
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,118
You said you were taking Tong to buy the speaker.

444
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,848
We were getting a haircut then go…

445
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:24,662
What haircut?

446
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:25,922
He sells porn at the backdoor.

447
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,527
And what’s that?

448
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:29,542
I want Tong to learn a little about sex education.

449
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:32,430
Chen! Are you teaching Dong sex education too?

450
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,295
As a dad, shouldn’t I teach him that?

451
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:36,329
Also, our son’s improved in his studies

452
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,685
so I’m getting him some rewards.

453
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:42,065
Don’t tell me you’re rewarding him with porn?

454
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,626
My.

455
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:52,211
Calm down. There are lots of people at the market.

456
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:53,206
I don’t care.

457
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:54,167
I’m not ashamed of it.

458
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:55,911
What’s wrong with you?

459
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,095
How old are you that you still watch this sort of movie?

460
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:57,760
Where did you get the money?

461
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,283
Where did you get the money for these porns?

462
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:01,013
You barely have teeth left yet you’re still into these kind of stuff?

463
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,787
I’m just teaching him.

464
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:04,104
That’s why our son’s like this.

465
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:06,491
The money keep going missing, I was wondering where it went.

466
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:07,852
You never say a word.

467
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:10,547
Aren’t you ashamed when you carry porn out of there?

468
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:12,165
I’m not being rash!

469
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:14,163
I’m just who I am, what’s with it?

470
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:16,742
Hey. What are you doing on the new year’s day?

471
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:18,509
Nothing in particular, why?

472
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:20,333
I found something or us to do.

473
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,305
It’s your cue for the haircut.

474
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,139
I’ll go get  my hair cut.

475
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:25,883
No, you’re not getting a hair cut.

476
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:29,481
Look. I can’t even grab your hair.

477
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:30,699
- Why would you have a haircut?
- Come get your haircut.

478
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:31,199
No need for that.

479
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,486
Tong, let’s go home.

480
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:34,306
Sir!

481
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:35,777
And you be quiet.

482
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:38,493
Put the money on the bedside.

483
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:39,850
I’ll give you one big talk down.

484
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,698
You never give me the money when I asked.

485
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:42,198
Do you understand me?

486
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:43,011
How can I give it to you?

487
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:44,652
You only bring troubles every single day.

488
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:45,480
You bastard.

489
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:49,153
Class.

490
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:52,647
Thank you, Teacher.

491
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:56,475
Go! Go! Go!

492
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,681
Hey.

Where are the boys going?

498
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:14,993
Why are they in such a hurry?

499
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:19,068
Well the boys are “into the eggs” these days.

500
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:24,807
Into the eggs?

501
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:28,467
Coming!

502
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,024
You can’t catch up to us.

503
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:36,381
You can’t catch up to us.

504
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,198
(Though Lin likes to say that we’re doing useless things,)

505
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,038
(But this is how a student life’s supposed to be for it to be fun.)

00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,783
I’m here first.

509
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:51,283
Wait for me.

510
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:53,929
I must get to play before you do.

511
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:54,429
But I’m here first.

512
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,811
(Uncle Khai’s Game Room is the most popular one at that time.)

513
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,495
Uncle Khai, two hours, please.

514
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:01,623
You’ll get out of it. Get out of the game.

515
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:03,722
Try me.

516
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,022
My Carlos!

517
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:05,938
It’s going for that goal.

518
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:06,770
Goal!

519
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:10,925
So noisy.

520
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,972
Well you’re only good at that one player, Bank.

521

522
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:14,587
Pass it!

523
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:15,493
Pass it!

524
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,705

I’ll get what Pao gets.

528
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:23,863
I’ll pass.

529
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:24,684
I’ll pass as well, Uncle.

530
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,757
If you don’t want anything just don’t shout the orders.
(But Uncle Khai’s not just famous for his games.)

531
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:31,957

Who are you guys?

539
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,783
Uncle Khai,

540
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,450
how did you make such great boiled eggs?

541
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:08,430
Bouncy egg whites and runny egg yolks.

542
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,403
So delicious.

543
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:12,709

544
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,398
Are you going anywhere on new year’s day?

545
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:16,933
Oh no.

546
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,535
Why would you go on a trip?

547
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:19,416
It’s such a waste of money.

548
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,700
I’d rather stay home and take care of my grandchildren.

549
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:25,505
Then, can you open the game room for us to play?

550
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:27,801
Who opens their business on new year’s day?

551
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,027
Come on, Uncle.

552
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:33,125
We just wanted to make a history

553
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:35,382
by playing games into the year 2000.

554
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:37,113
How does that sound?

555
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:37,910
Let’s do this, Uncle.

556
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,256
If you open the game room for us to play,

557
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:41,903
we’ll give you a special rate.

558
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:50,579
Do you guys think money can buy me?

559
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:53,632
You guys are right.

560
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,663
Since you guys are loyal customers,

561
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:57,981
I’ll gladly open it for you.

562
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:02,149
Hey, hey!

563
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:03,951
My treat.

564
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,100
Rich Man Dong!

565
00:29:06,238 --> 00:29:08,098
How far are you going to go with the game addiction?

566
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:14,530
Lin,

567
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:16,111
let me ask you something.

568
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,272
Why would you put that much mind into Tong?

569
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:21,383
The food for the new year’s event is pride.

570
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:25,344
It’s the pride of us and our family.

571
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,735
Our family?

572
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,489
How far are you going to go with the game addiction?

573
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,591
Why aren’t you home yet? It’s late.

574
00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:49,976
I was studying at Ja-Oh’s.

575
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,582
You guys,

576
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,994
how can you play games until this late at night?

577
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:57,037
Lin, we’re doing games not drugs.

578
00:29:57,037 --> 00:29:59,377
But you guys are playing games until midnight?

579
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,927
Well, even you guys study until midnight,

580
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,365
we’re just playing games until midnight, what’s wrong with that?

581
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,636
That’s because what you guys are doing is useless.

582
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,870
Uncle Khai, don’t open the game room for them to play.

583
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,226
What rights have you?

584
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:16,576
The rights as your class president.

585
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,510
That has nothing to do with it.

586
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,605
This is not school.

587
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:20,818
Tong.

588
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:23,228
We’re heading home soon, Lin.

589
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:24,547
We’re just staying for the noodles.

590
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:25,223
Huh?

591
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,514
Right, we’re just staying for the noodles.

592
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:29,180
Here, hurry up and eat so we can hurry home.

593
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,470
What she said is right, though.

594
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,986
Let’s do this, finish your noodles and go home.

595
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:38,361
For the new year’s day, let me know once you guys decided on something.

596
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:42,378
I would gladly serve you guys at a special price.

597
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:44,202
Sounds good? Shall we do that?

598
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:45,172
What about the bowl, uncle?

599
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:45,904
The bowl?

600
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,513
Just place it in front of the shop.

601
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,717
You took my eggs.

602
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,098
We’re having tests yet again?

603
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,505
Is she making us speak English?

604
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:04,572
I’d better add more English exercise for Tong.

605
00:31:05,061 --> 00:31:06,735
So he’d be able to do it on the next test.

606
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:08,658
Lin.

607
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:09,578
Hmm?

608
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:11,254
Lin, let me ask you something.

609
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:13,413
What is it?

610
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:16,294
Why would you put that much mind into Tong?

611
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:21,385
Because Mr. Sommai asked me to keep my eyes on him.

612
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:24,664
You don’t really have to care about him that much, though.

613
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,452
I just don’t like lazy people.

614
00:31:29,397 --> 00:31:32,686
Tong is smart but he’s lazy.

615
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,448
All he does everyday is play.

616
00:31:34,448 --> 00:31:35,301
That’s true.

617
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:36,953
Their entire group.

618
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:39,918
There’s only Pao who pays attention to his studies.

619
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:44,310
They invited each other to play games into the new year.

620
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:46,006
Pao’s in it too.

621
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:49,771
I can never understand boys.

622
00:31:51,522 --> 00:31:53,540
Doesn’t the owner of the game room afraid of the computer breaking down?

623
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:58,275
Isn’t he scared of Y2K when they play games over night?

624
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,486
Shall we do this?

625
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,686
Sounds good?

626
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,079
I’m getting them this time.

627
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:30,443
TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR.

628
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,453
Stop!

629
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:53,168
Everybody in their seats.

630
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:56,308
Hey!

631
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,392
Well, well.

632
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,490
Is this class or football pitch?

633
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:07,722
I have an important announcement.

634
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:11,234
There will be the new year’s event next week

635
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:14,836
so there’s no more classes.

636
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:20,640
Hold on!

637
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:25,971
But you guys still have to come to school during the same school time.

638
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,470
Because I’ll keep track of your attendance.

639
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,422
Don’t forget to bring food

640
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:37,744
since we’re going to have a feast in this class.

641
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:40,268
I’ll get going.

642
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,999
Hey. What are you guys bringing on the new year’s event?

643
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:51,719
The Arsenol Cookie.

644
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:55,158
That’s not cool, Bank.

645
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,039
Why? Does the food for a new year’s event has to be cool?

646
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,037
Right, does a new year’s food has to be cool?

647
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:02,295
You guys don’t know the first thing about it.

648
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:06,921
My mom said the food for the new year’s event is something sacred.

649
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,725
That’s my dad’s name you just said.

650
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:14,049
I’m sorry.

651
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:15,981
I was just kidding.

652
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,978
My mom said the food is pride!

653
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:21,449
That’s right.

654
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:24,862
The food for the new year’s event is pride.

655
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,738
It’s the pride of us and our family.

656
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:30,794
Our family?

657
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,658
Talking about which, what should I bring?

658
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,371
There we go.

659
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:45,796
Khon-dee please bring me some meatballs.

660
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,473
Ow!

661
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:03,658
Here’s Meatball.

662
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,579
Mom, help me.

663
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,018
Not this meatball, this is my boy!

664
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:23,048
Oh!

665
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,667
Are those fried chicken, Mom?

666
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:25,988
They smell so good

667
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:30,238
.What are you doing, Mom?

668
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:31,085
Why’s there so much stuff.

669
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:37,514
This is The Crying Huang Huo Hong Hao Emperor’s Fried Rice.

670
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:39,976
It’s our family’s traditional fried rice recipe.

671
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:40,931
Yeah?

672
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,942
I guarantee you, that it’s going to be the most delicious one in your class and we’re going to win over everyone.

673
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:46,943
Mom!

674
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:47,498
What is it?

675
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:49,453
Isn’t that too much?

676
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:50,347
Mom!

677
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:50,847
What?

678
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,128
Are you treating the entire town?

679
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:53,593
You’d better take more than less.

680
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,197
People could say we’re stingy.

681
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:59,938
Why would we bring something stinky? No stinky food.

682
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:01,233
Mom!

683
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,662
Mommy!

684
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,748
Hmm?

685
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:06,787
Don’t you have any food prepared for me?

686
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,219
Where would I get the time to prepare?

687
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:11,033
I’ve got a lot on my plate selling rice.

688
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:13,658
But it’s the family’s pride, Mom.

689
00:36:13,658 --> 00:36:15,298
It’s the new year’s event feast,

690
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,232
it’s embarrassing if you bring only a little amount.

691
00:36:18,232 --> 00:36:22,500
Your mom never backs down on something to do with pride,

692
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,012
keep that in mind, Tong.

693
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,767
This is what you called the Fighter’s Spirit.

694
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,186
We don’t back down even for something small.

695
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,855
Are you making some more?

696
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:33,482
Yes.

697
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,524
That’s just a small amount.

698
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,101
It’s new year after all.

699
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:39,544
My Meatball Pao.

700
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:44,616
Ouch, hot!

701
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:47,103
Madame, where’s the meatball?

702
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:55,235
The Crying Huang Huo Hong Hao Emperor’s Fried Rice?

703
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:56,923
What about my portion?

704
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,686
What am I getting to eat today?

705
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,209
A plain porridge.

706
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:00,847
What?

707
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,050
Plain porridge again?

708
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,549
What about Grandma?

709
00:37:05,012 --> 00:37:07,149
Are you making her eat only plain porridge?

710
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,422
And what’s wrong with that?

711
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:17,514
She’s been eating it for over 10 years.

712
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:18,519
What’s up with that?

713
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:26,862
Hmm!

714
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,459
So delicious.

715
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:36,577
Mom! My friends will make fun of me if I donn’t bring anything to school.

716
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:37,744
My son.

717
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,718
What’s so hard about that?

718
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,018
Our family never falls behind anyone when it comes to money.

719
00:37:43,147 --> 00:37:43,991
Take this.

720
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,025
What should I buy, Dad?

721
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,511
Buy whatever kids these days like.

722
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:52,502
Come up with it yourself.

723
00:37:54,735 --> 00:37:56,323
So graceful.

724
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:03,598
Don’t be too rash, easy there.

725
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:17,341
Madame, did you prepare that for me?

726
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:18,930
How did you know I was going to buy them?

727
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:20,915
No, these are not for you.

728
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:21,973
Someone’s already bought them all.

729
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:23,782
Who did?

730
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:26,635
Bank?

731
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:27,295
Yeah.

732
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:29,664
Here comes my big client.

733
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:30,959
It’s you?

734
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,862
Why Bank?

735
00:38:33,197 --> 00:38:34,486
He got to me first.

736
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,782
Mom said keep the change.

737
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,592
Thank you.

738
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:44,500
What is it?

739
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:48,205
Early birds get the worms.

740
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,801
You bastard.

741
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:52,458
You!

742
00:38:53,593 --> 00:38:54,975
Oh, Madame!

743
00:38:55,357 --> 00:38:56,670
Did you sell everything to him?

744
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,874
- Have you got anything left for me?
- That’s all of it.

745
00:38:57,874 --> 00:38:58,784
Not one?

746
00:38:58,784 --> 00:38:59,742
Nope.

747
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:00,608
Perhaps laying around at the back?

748
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,291
None.

749
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,321
It’s all sold out.

750
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:03,478
None on the second floor?

751
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,447
Why don’t you go and make it yourself?

752
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:13,303
Hey!

753
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:18,597
What did you bring, Ja-Oh?

754
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:22,518
I’ve got pork sausages with pork skin and black pepper pork sausages.

755
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:25,195
The pork sausages from my house are super delicious.

756
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:28,692
Even if the sausages are not good,

757
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:30,901
I still think you are good, our pretty Ja-Oh.

758
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:35,058
Your joke’s so lame, Mai!

759
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,708
Aw, Giraffe.

760
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:40,817
I still think you are good, our pretty Ja-Oh.

761
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:44,738
Hey, what did you bring, Tong?

762
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:48,154
Here it is, fried chicken from my Mom family’s recipe.

763
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:49,220
Just fried chicken?

764
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,988
You can’t just say that!

765
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:54,001
This is the original southern recipe.

766
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:55,940
What did you bring?

767
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,035
You can’t beat my mom.

768
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:57,868
Show me.

769
00:39:57,868 --> 00:40:01,366
The Crying Huang Huo Hong Hao Emperor’s Fried Rice

770
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:06,653
What sort of fried rice is that, the name’s not even appetizing.

771
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:08,702
Paweena sucks.

772
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:10,009
That’s my mom.

773
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:11,038
What did you bring?

774
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:14,718
Everyone love what I bring.

775
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:19,698
Kaya toast from J’Phon’s Milk Shop.

776
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,768
How can you be proud if you bring something you bought, Bank?

777
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:26,556
Right, how can you be proud of that?

778
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,286
You’re supposed to make it yourself.

779
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:29,198
That’s right.

780
00:40:29,198 --> 00:40:30,872
Pao’s right.

781
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:33,418
What did you bring?

782
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:34,083
I…

783
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,407
Well, I…

784
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:38,494
I brought the most awesome thing.

785
00:40:41,017 --> 00:40:43,125
Where’s your stuff? I don’t see you bringing anything.

786
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:48,482
My dad said that our Jarasjam Family never fall behind anyone when it comes to money.

787
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:50,166
So?

788
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:51,228
So?

789
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:54,964
I brought this for you to eat.

790
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:57,778
Friends.

791
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:06,088
Since it’s New Year, we, the Jarasjam Family, are giving you 100 Baht each.

792
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,459
Take it and enjoy.

793
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:14,867
Whoever is hungry and feel like eating, line up.

794
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:16,979
Mr. Dong.

795
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:20,761
Hold on, I’ve got lots so I’m giving you 200.

796
00:41:21,502 --> 00:41:23,502
400 please, Mr. Dong!

797
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:25,040
Is he dumb?

798
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,167
He is dumb.

799
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:32,237
Can I have 200?

800
00:41:32,237 --> 00:41:32,891
I’m running out.

801
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:33,531
Go and line up at the back.

802
00:41:37,022 --> 00:41:38,066
That’s so cool.

803
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:39,192
Rich Man Dong.

804
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,098
Are you guys still going to go play games over night?

805
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:51,447
Of course we are.

806
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:52,707
Aren’t you scared?

807
00:41:53,153 --> 00:41:54,947
The Y2K Ghost.

808
00:41:58,507 --> 00:41:59,548
Let’s do a bet.

809
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:03,017
If you get the highest score in the final exam this time,

810
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:04,321
you can do anything to me.

811
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,184
But if I get the highest score,

812
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,589
you have to cut your hair into a bob.

813
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,461
Sure.

814
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:12,091
Because I would win anyways.
