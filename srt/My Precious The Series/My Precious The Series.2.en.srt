(Back then, apart from coming to school to play,)

5
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:22,192
(we were there to meet a certain someone.)

6
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:25,502
(Someone we all fell for.)

7
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:29,840
Since you’re the class president, I assign you to get Tong to study.

8
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,708
Why would Mr. Sommai have me look after Tong?

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,275
I’ve found a smart daughter-in-law for you.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,653
Where did you get the confidence that she’d like someone like you?

11
00:00:58,447 --> 00:00:59,489
How was it, son?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,958
Did you manage to steal her heart?

13
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,454
Hey, don’t overthink it.

14
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,067
Girls like one of the few things.

15
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:08,095
If they don’t like music,

16
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,004
they must like gold.

17
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:10,163
Here.

18
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:12,642
Can I have all your gold, then?

19
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:13,950
Take it.

20
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:16,501
Look at what you teach our boy.

21
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,715
Such great pieces of advice.

22
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:22,040
Girls can’t be bought off with jewels or things.

23
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,709
Those are just materials.

24
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,080
But you agreed to marry me because of…

25
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,425
Then what do I do next?

26
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,570
You have to buy her trust.

27
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:46,635
Where do they sell it?

28
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,210
How much does it cost?

29
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:51,720
You sure are your dad’s boy.

30
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:52,700
Let’s get in.

31
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:56,138
And how much did Dad spend, Mom?

32
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:57,223
Can you sell it to me?

33
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,226
What are you talking about!?

34
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,918
Trusts aren’t bought with money!

35
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:04,686
(Winning over the heart.)

36
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:06,537
This is my favorite.
(Haeb’s Salon)

37
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:08,440
Pao, get those beans for me.

38
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,625
What about mine, Auntie?

39
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,598
Thank you.

40
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:17,687
Thank you.

41
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,019
This one’s rotten.

42
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:25,000
Look at this, Bank.

43
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:31,475
Can I ask you something very serious?

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,409
What is it?

45
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,183
You like Lin, right?

46
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:47,738
Bank.

47
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,250
Tong’s not answering

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,974
that means he likes her.

49
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,863
Hey, Uncle. I don’t like Lin.

50
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:57,372
Why would someone awesome like me like Lin?

51
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:57,942
No way.

52
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:59,177
Why not, Tong?

53
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:04,214
Lin is cute, smart, and has a beautiful smile.

54
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,538
Lin is pretty just like her mother.

55
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,686
You guys know what?

56
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,120
Lin’s Mom used to be the beauty of the town.

57
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:17,323
Really?

58
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,400
All the boys were chasing after her.

59
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,812
Including you, right?

60
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:24,868
Hey, Dong. I didn’t even have to try.

61
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:28,130
Because you could get her in no time?

62
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,097
Because she wouldn’t even graze her eyes on my shadow.

63
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,364
Don’t you go and tell anyone about it!

64
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,098
Just like you guys, could only watch from afar.

65
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:36,583
Hey, don’t count me into it, Uncle.

66
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:37,615
I don’t like Lin.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,462
He’s just being in denial.

68
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:40,932
I really want to smack some senses into you.

69
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:42,969
Who do you like then?

70
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:43,636
Ja-Oh?

71
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:45,975
Tall and long?

72
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:50,140
Don’t you talk crap about Ja-Oh.

73
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,197
Her height reaches a standard.

74
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,527
A giraffe’s standard.

75
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:57,833
You guys, don’t evade the topic.

76
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,293
Let’s make a pack.

77
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:00,242
A pack on what?

78
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,759
A pack on who gets to hit on Lin.

79
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,695
Bullshit.

80
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:06,811
I told you, Lin doesn’t like stupid people like you

81
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:07,643
You.

82
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,487
You.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,492
And…

84
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:12,410
I’m sorry, Uncle.

85
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:17,281
What did you say, you brat?

86
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:20,107
Get some rice noodle on him.

87
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:21,431
Why can’t I get all of them off?

88
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:22,713
Hey!

89
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:27,835
We should have done this a long time ago.

90
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:29,828
It’s much better.

91
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:33,711
Go and tell your mom to buy you a motorbike.

92
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,609
I don’t get my Mom too.

93
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,623
This is so comfortable.

94
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:56,208
Ton-Liu.

95
00:05:57,572 --> 00:05:59,662
Help me take the stuff in.

96
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:00,836
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,271
This shop is the prettiest around here.

98
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,287
Here you go.

99
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:09,812
The drink isn’t sweet compared to her face.

100
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,266
You’re the man!

101
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,611
Dude, her dad’s here.

102
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,267
Do you want some medicine?

103
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,554
That’s alright.

104
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:18,760
Dad!

105
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:28,459
Hey! Ja-Oh!

106
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:31,100
You are so attractive, Lin.

107
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:33,810
All the boys in the entire city must be trying their luck on you.

108
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,484
You’re exaggerating.

109
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:37,269
They’re just here to buy the drinks.

110
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:39,840
I would love to be as attractive as you are.

111
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,349
You should stop crouching your back first,

112
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,511
it ruins your posture.

113
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,257
A short person like you would never understand.

114
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,294
I’ve had boys making fun of me since primary school.

115
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,850
So you chased and tried to kick them?

116
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,358
So how would anyone dare hit on you?

117
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:57,742
That’s right.

118
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,096
But it’s satisfying.

119
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:00,178
See?

120
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,618
Do you want anything to drink?

121
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:06,893
You girls are still as pretty as ever.

122
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,428
Especially, Lin.

123
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,854
Mai, if you’re going to be itching like this, why don’t you go in and get some medicine?

124
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,534
I have my meds but I don’t put them on.

125
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:17,309
It stings.

126
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:22,225
By the way, can I buy something, Lin?

127
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:23,727
Sure, what do you want?

128
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:25,917
Can it be your heart?

129
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,233
Lin, I think I’m sick.

130
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,516
Touch my forehead.

131
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:38,248
Lin, don’t trust him.

132
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,510
He just wants you to touch his forehead.

133
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,764
Are you guys here to molest Lin?

134
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:46,336
Hey, hey, not me. I’m here for the drinks.

135
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,207
Lin, if you don’t want to touch his forehead,

136
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,103
you can take my hand.

137
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
The hand you use to scratch your crotch?

138
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,433
- You giraffe!
- Filthy!

139
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,652
Are you craving leaves?

140
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:01,249
Mai! Ja-Oh! Stop!

141
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,138
Stay still.

142
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,742
Ja-Oh. Stop.

143
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:05,611
What are you guys doing here?

144
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,908
If you have nothing to do, just go home.

145
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:11,086
I said I’m here for the drinks.

146
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,764
♪ A big bottle of Chrysanthemum drink ♪

147
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,991
I want a piece of your heart.

148
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,799
Don’t know if I can have some?

149
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,566
If you want anything just go to the market.

150
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:23,928
Father.

151
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,633
Hello, Father.

152
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,154
It’s Lin’s dad, not yours.

153
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,437
Hello.

154
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,900
Lin’s dad is not your dad.

155
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:40,562
Lin, can I get one chrysanthemum drink?

156
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:42,654
Fine, but wait for your cue.

157
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,057
Oh, so you don’t only eat leaves, Ja-Oh?

158
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:45,797
Mind your business.

159
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:02,477
Dong, what’s wrong?

160
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:04,440
Dong?

161
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:05,690
What’s wrong with you, Dong?

162
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,452
The sweets got stuck in my throat.

163
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:14,080
I was going to pretend to be sick but now I’m really sick.

164
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,526
Poor Pao.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,061
It’s on me again, Lin.

166
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,544
Burrrp.

167
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:34,912
Let’s go home.

168
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:36,987
How are you going to go home?

169
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,033
It’s still raining.

170
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,832
Right, my hair would be ruined.

171
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,922
Hey, have you forgotten it’s a Saturday?

172
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,573
There are new movies at Uncle Haeb’s.

173
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:45,861
They’ll be gone if you’re late.

174
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,518
Hey, Uncle Haeb!

175
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:48,438
Uncle hoarse voice?

176
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,462
Uncle Haeb!

177
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:50,217
A hoarse voice?

178
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:57,814
Uncle Haeb!

179
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:11,610
Hold on, Ja-Oh.

180
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,646
Isn’t Uncle Haeb’s a salon?

181
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,440
Does he sell movies too?

182
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,347
I could never understand boys.

183
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,542
Lin!

184
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:44,460
Lin!

185
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,229
Tong.

186
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,607
Could you sell me some meds, Lin?

187
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,520
I’m sick.

188
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,021
It’s late in the night, Tong.

189
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:05,511
Go home and sleep.

190
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,320
I’m really sick.

191
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,973
There’s no more meds at home.

192
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,686
Don’t you believe me?

193
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:13,488
Look at me.

194
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,340
Come around to the front.

195
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:42,870
If you’re really sick then go to the hospital.

196
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,268
Why would you come here?

197
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,842
To buy meds?

198
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:52,783
You’d get better faster with the doctor’s injection, though.

199
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,183
I don’t want injections.

200
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:05,731
Are you afraid of needles?

201
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,553
No.

202
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,206
You must be afraid of needles.

203
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:10,934
I’m not.

204
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,376
That must be it.

205
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,618
- You’re afraid of needles.
- If you’re not going to sell it to me then…

206
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,320
Will you sell me the meds?

207
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,102
Will you sell me the meds? If not, I’ll just go somewhere else.

208
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:23,858
Hold on.

209
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:28,626
Come here.

210
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:40,940
Come here.

211
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:44,880
Just come here and stay still.

212
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,853
You really do have a fever.

213
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:11,415
Wait here, I’ll get my dad.

214
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,975
My dad said you shouldn’t ride motorbikes after taking the meds, didn’t he?

215
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,956
Why? Are you saying this because you care about me?

216
00:14:59,216 --> 00:14:59,869
Here you go.

217
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:04,173
This is a decongestant, take this once every 4-6 hours.

218
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,411
It will make you a little sleepy and lethargic.

219
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:11,224
Be careful when you drive.

220
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:16,454
Drink lots of water and get enough sleep so you can recover quickly.

221
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:18,154
Oh, and this.

222
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:22,333
Take it and have your mom brew it for you, got it?

223
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:23,782
Yes.

224
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,112
Thank you, uncle.

225
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:28,521
You’re sick, Tong?

226
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:30,660
Why are you here alone?

227
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,490
Mom and Dad are visiting the cousins in Surat Thani, Auntie.

228
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,863
My.

229
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:39,169
Are you hungry? Have you eaten anything?

230
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:41,107
No, I’m not hungry.

231
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:49,646
You must be hungry.

232
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:53,739
Let’s eat something.

233
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:56,725
Lin,

234
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:58,746
bring your friend some porridge.

235
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:02,751
Let’s see.

236
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,206
Oh, you’re feverish.

237
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,613
Have some porridge and take the meds.

238
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:09,432
Lin.

239
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:10,475
Go.

240
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:20,283
You poor thing.

241
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:21,539
Your parents are out of town.

242
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,419
He must have gotten the rain.

243
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,017
Right.

244
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:26,316
Here it is.

245
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,300
Thanks.

246
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:35,957
Have it.

247
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:37,464
Have a lot of it.

248
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:40,985
Oh, slow down.

249
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:42,535
There’s no need to rush.

250
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,531
Eat up and then you can take your meds.

251
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:50,189
Lin, bring your friend some water.

252
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,637
So he can have his meds as well.

253
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:27,357
Hey, Tong.

254
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,950
My dad said you shouldn’t ride motorbikes after taking the meds, didn’t he?

255
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,296
He said to be careful not that I can’t ride it.

256
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,056
Accidents are no joke.

257
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:40,380
Why?

258
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:41,967
Are you saying this because you care about me?

259
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,743
I just don’t want anything to happen.

260
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:47,803
I don’t want you saying that my Dad didn’t warn you about it.

261
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,633
“I don’t want you saying that my Dad didn’t warn you about it.”

262
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:05,952
Hey!

263
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:07,601
Dong!

264
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:08,504
Are you alright, Dong?

265
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:10,475
Are you okay?

266
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:13,793
Hey, the teacher’s here.

267
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:16,346
Please stand up.

268
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:17,344
You don’t have to.

269
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:23,064
Take your extra reading book out.

270
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:26,996
Turn to Chapter 3.

271
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,294
So strict.

272
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,344
Pao, let me borrow yours, I didn’t bring mine.

273
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:31,588
I only have one of them.

274
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,607
Those who didn’t bring the book, stand up.

275
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:36,957
I

276
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,484
brought it, miss.

277
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,300
Nontawat.

278
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:52,655
How long have you been studying?

279
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:55,107
Why do you still forget to bring it?

280
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,208
Is my lecture not important?

281
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,083
Take the chair and lift it over your head.

282
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:04,917
Good.

283
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:06,809
Now you will remember.

284
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:11,504
Do you forget to wear your underwear as well since you’re so forgetful?

285
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:12,714
Of course I do.

286
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:13,796
Otherwise, I would get a hernia.

287
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:20,184
Do 150 jump-squats in front of the class.

288
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,946
With your chair.

289
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,673
What scotch tape?

290
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:24,954
Do you want to join him?

291
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:25,622
No, miss.

292
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:34,668
Tong got it.

293
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:35,206
Here we go.

294
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:36,977
Chapter 3.

295
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:04,527
(Arghhhhh)

296
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:05,905
(Miss Jane)

297
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:19,827
(Lin is actually quite cute. What a shame she’s too studious.)

298
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,484
(Lin is actually quite cute. What a shame she’s too studious.)

299
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:04,243
Why don’t you like studying?

300
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,343
I was afraid that if I was studious, I would become smarter than you.

301
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:08,491
Ow!

302
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,119
Sommai!

303
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,639
I’m sorry, Joy.

304
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:54,263
Tong you bastard.

305
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:55,782
My bad.

306
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,207
What’s up with you?

307
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:58,864
I just wanted to get you.

308
00:21:58,864 --> 00:21:59,840
Go wash your face.

309
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,742
I’m sorry, Joy.

310
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:04,059
Joy, you can come back and read it again.

311
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,077
I won’t charge you.

312
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:12,142
What is it?

313
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,993
I just wanted to thank you for yesterday.

314
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:20,451
There’s no need for that.

315
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:22,391
I didn’t want to learn anyway.

316
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:26,423
I still wanted to thank you, though.

317
00:22:27,774 --> 00:22:28,724
You wanted to thank me?

318
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:30,981
Buy me a drink then.

319
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:40,824
Let me ask you something.

320
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:42,275
Go on, then.

321
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,252
Why don’t you like studying?

322
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:53,755
I was afraid that if I was studious, I would become smarter than you.

323
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:59,156
If someone like me takes things seriously,

324
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:01,126
It’d make someone like you end up weeping.

325
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:04,716
Hey, Tong!

326
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,818
Let’s go play football with the 8th class.

327
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,162
I want to show them my steps already.

328
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,063
They’re betting 500.

329
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:12,678
Let’s get some money for snacks at J’Phon’s.

330
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:13,623
Let’s do it.

331
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,467
Is there anything going on between you two?

332
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:20,529
No.

333
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:25,116
Let’s go.

334
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:34,519
Lin.

335
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,907
Are you having that?

336
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:37,090
Ah, no.

337
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:40,790
Dong.

338
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:42,195
You forgot the lid.

339
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:43,735
Oh, we don’t eat the lid.

340
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:16,443
That hurts.

341
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:21,431
These are the exercises I made myself.

342
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,114
I wanted to try you out first.

343
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:25,150
Take it and finish it at home then bring it to me tomorrow.

[Tong’s Excercise Book.]

345
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,601
Is this a love tryout?

346
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:40,871
A brain tryout.

347
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,646
What’s the point?

348
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:46,644
So that you can think I’m dumber than you?

349
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:48,538
I’m not doing it.

350
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:55,104
I don’t look down on you for being dumber than me.

351
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:59,915
I look down on you for having a bias against smart people instead of focusing on your studies like the others.

[Tong’s Exercise Book.]

353
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,569
What’s the point of studying hard?

354
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:38,679
Who could ever finish when there is this much?

355
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:48,955
Tong.

356
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:51,529
A family meeting.

357
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,176
What’s up with the two of you?

358
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,876
Your dad suddenly wants to buy a new speaker set.

359
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:58,936
Oh? Why are you buying a new one, Dad?

360
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:00,069
The old one’s still working well.

361
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,626
Tong, having a good speaker set is my happiness.

362
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:04,859
Everyone else has it.

363
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:06,185
That’s right.

364
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:08,301
It's Dad's happiness so you should cut him some slack, Mom.

365
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:09,658
But it’s my money.

366
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,924
It’s me who wins the bread.

367
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:13,867
You’re not on the right for doing that.

368
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:16,331
What if my stipend gets deducted?

369
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:17,012
Tong.

370
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:19,450
So whose side are you on?

371
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:24,650
I’m your son, the both of you.

372
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,102
How can I take sides?

373
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:28,507
You are cunning.

374
00:26:28,507 --> 00:26:29,943
You sure know how to stay afloat.

375
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:31,803
You’re smart like your dad.

376
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:33,063
But stingy like your mom.

377
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:35,846
Well, are you dissing me now, Tao?

378
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:38,977
No wonder why our son takes after you when you’re this cunning.

379
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,585
You do nothing but play just like your dad.

380
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:43,672
Where are you going?

381
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:44,172
Why?

382
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,356
I’m coming with you.

383
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:46,104
Where are you going?

384
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,124
I’m so going to beat you up.

385
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:47,809
Are you talking about me?

386
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:48,780
I mean Tong.

387
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,342
Our dad is not afraid of anyone.

388
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:54,769
Apart from Mom.

389
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,785
[Tong’s Exercise Book.]

390
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:42,502
What is it?

391
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:43,388
The exercise.

392
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:54,561
Such easy-peasy questions,

393
00:27:55,236 --> 00:27:56,663
a genius like me can solve them.

394
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:58,434
Don’t be surprised.

395
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,307
I sure am surprised.

396
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,458
You got almost all of it wrong.

397
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,984
You didn’t take any look into the textbook, didn’t you?

398
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,383
[Tong’s Exercise Book.]

399
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:24,294
This is for English.

400
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:25,582
Social studies.

401
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,279
And science.

402
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,305
Take it home, finish it, and bring it to me tomorrow.

403
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:32,551
Hey.

404
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:34,633
Was that not enough for a tryout?

405
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,115
And why should I do what you want me to?

406
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,152
Well, it is what it is.

407
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:44,716
The smart gets to make the rules.

408
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:57,059
This one as well, Tong.

409
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:58,420
Take it and solve it.

410
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:04,845
Take it.

411
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:27,321
You guys,

412
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:28,825
let me ask you something.

413
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:30,943
Is it a hard question?

414
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:32,243
It can be.

415
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:34,191
Or maybe it is not.

416
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:35,805
So is it hard?

417
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:36,520
Would you just listen first?

418
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:39,146
What is it, Tong?

419
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,071
Why do we need to study hard?

420
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:47,012
That’s a tough one.

421
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:51,384
Because it’s what students are supposed to do.

422
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:56,775
It tells what kind of adult you would grow up to be.

423
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,669
If you can’t even succeed in your study,

424
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:03,242
you will grow up and become a failed adult.

425
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,429
You’re too serious, Pao.

426
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,528
Mai’s right.

427
00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:11,065
Why should we be so serious?

428
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,334
Aren’t you guys sick of it?

429
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:12,953
I am.

430
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,770
When it comes to studying, I’m so sick of it.

431
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:18,496
But for comics, bring it.

432
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:21,488
That’s because you guys are childish.

433
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,558
Damn it.

434
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:28,019
Who was the one who made the rule that we’re supposed to study hard and be serious?

435
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:30,207
If I ever met that person,

436
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:31,335
I’d kick his butt.

437
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:32,986
Ow!

438
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:38,852
Hey! Sommai!

439
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:40,116
Tong!

440
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:44,323
Please don’t be angry with me.

441
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:45,550
Mr. Sommai!

442
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:51,599
A tiger!

443
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,133
I think we’re eating some porridge at the temple today.

444
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:00,663
Why at the temple?

445
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:01,826
For Tong’s funeral, of course.

446
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:03,262
Tong.

447
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:05,104
Tong.

448
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,619
You shouldn’t have done that.

449
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:11,648
Tong.

450
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:13,788
I’ll miss you.

451
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:16,486
Friends forever.

452
00:31:18,797 --> 00:31:20,440
(From now on,)

453
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,013
Tong.

454
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,519
(do anything to make him concentrate on his studies.)

455
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,083
The exercise.

456
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,039
Why would you want another student to look after me?

458
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:56,466
Oh.

00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:57,476
Pimnara.

460
00:31:57,476 --> 00:32:01,929
I assigned you to keep Tong on track, are you still doing that?

461
00:32:02,235 --> 00:32:03,658
I am, sir.

462
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:04,578
Is that so?

463
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:06,335
But Tong’s not getting any better.

464
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:08,178
Come on, sir.

465
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,143
You be quiet.

466
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:12,030
Alright, Pimnara.

467
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,727
I’m giving you full permission on Tong.

468
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,360
Do anything to get him to study hard.

469
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:23,092
Why would you want another student to look after me?

470
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:25,478
Have you ever listened to any grown-up’s words?

471
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:32,753
Someone like you needs to be fixed by someone like Pimnara.

472
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:33,848
But, Sir.

473
00:32:33,848 --> 00:32:34,868
Don’t say a word.

474
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:36,408
We’ll take this as I said.

475
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,597
That’s all for it.

476
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:40,945
You’re dismissed.

477
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:42,604
Tong.

478
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:45,268
Put the hem of your shirt in your pants.

479
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:50,725
Alright, you’re dismissed.

480
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,298
I said to dress properly.

481
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,941
Tuck your shirt in.

482
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:02,245
Right.

483
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:23,417
I’ve aged a lot.

484
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,212
Hey,

485
00:33:33,257 --> 00:33:34,398
let me tell you something.

486
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,960
You could never make me studious.

487
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:38,953
So don’t even try.

488
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:42,049
Is it not because you’re afraid of me?

489
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,088
Me? Afraid of you?

490
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:46,101
That’s a joke.

491
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:50,377
Yes, it’s not a joke.

492
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:53,074
Because I’m taking it seriously from now on.

493
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:56,376
How?

494
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:57,901
What are you going to do? Tell me.

495
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,292
Even my parents can’t make me study.

496
00:34:03,913 --> 00:34:06,869
Then you can wait and see what I would do.

497
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:21,204
And my life was changed.

498
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:22,993
Tong.

499
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,203
The exercise.

500
00:34:40,627 --> 00:34:41,316
Ow!

501
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:45,233
Have you finished your exercises?

502
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,579
I’m waiting to get my hair cut.

503
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:47,846
Are you almost done, Uncle Haeb?

504
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:49,766
Have you finished your exercises?

505
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:52,756
What is it?

506
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:53,913
I’m waiting to get my hair cut.

507
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:55,190
Do it now.

508
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:57,853
Tong!

509
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:00,957
Okay, okay.

510
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,464
Are you going to study or not?

511
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:03,418
No.

512
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:04,240
You are.

513
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:05,727
Ow!

514
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:06,607
Are you going to study or not?

515
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,107
No.

516
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:08,843
Are you going to study or not?

517
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:09,630
Uncle, are you free now?

518
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,154
Please cut my hair.

519
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:10,681
Are you going to study or not?

520
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:13,178
I’m busy, the amulet’s checking me out.

521
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,121
Checking out the amulet!

522
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:14,853
Thanks.

523
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:15,785
I’m not studying.

524
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:16,513
Are you going to study or not?

525
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:17,210
No!

526
00:35:17,522 --> 00:35:18,404
Are you going to study or not?

527
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:19,038
No!

528
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:20,081
Uncle, I want to cut my hair.

529
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:24,006
Faster!

530
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,775
Damn

531
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,450
Right on.

532
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:44,128
What’s gotten into you?

533
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,640
You’re especially studious.

534
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:54,412
Tong! Why are you reciting that at this hour?

535
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:56,313
It’s noisy.

536
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:58,054
I’m studying for my exams, Uncle Toei.

537
00:35:58,054 --> 00:35:58,976
You?

538
00:35:58,976 --> 00:35:59,743
You stupid.

539
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,208
You. I f*ck you.

540
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,513
I f*ck. I f*ck you.

541
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:03,329
What the heck?

542
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,023
F*ck you.

543
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:06,195
What the hecking f*ck?

544
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:09,007
I f*ck you.

545
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,826
That’s Tao’s boy.

546
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:15,633
I’m so proud.

547
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,528
This signal.

548
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,633
I’m going to have a long night.

549
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:28,914
[Lee’s Khao Perp from Sukhothai.]

550
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:31,832
When is he coming?

551
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:32,861
Dong,

552
00:36:33,243 --> 00:36:34,301
did you bring any money?

553
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:36,075
I don’t have any wallet.

554
00:36:36,954 --> 00:36:38,913
I have a wallet but no money.

555
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:40,290
Please take a seat.

556
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,178
It’s alright, we don’t need money for this shop.

557
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:41,942
We only need to use our strength.

558
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:45,461
Thank you.

559
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,641
Thank you, Khon Dee.

560
00:36:52,763 --> 00:36:53,590
Delicious.

561
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:55,885
Guys.

562
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:59,956
I’ve just seen The Matrix. It was so much fun.

563
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,648
Have you guys seen it?

564
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:02,633
I watched it.

565
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:04,990
The way he dodged the bullet was so cool.

566
00:37:09,502 --> 00:37:10,741
Dodged it.

567
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,631
Stop fooling around, eat your food first.

568
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,304
So serious.

569
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:18,312
Hey, Tong. What have you done?

570
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:19,308
You seem so tired.

571
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:22,055
How many times did you jerk off last night?

572
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,121
Well, Tong what have you been doing?

573
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,767
Studying for exams?

574
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:30,840
He was watching porn.

575
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,993
Are you talking about yourself?

576
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:33,037
I’m talking about you, maybe.

577
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:36,089
Tong studying for exams? No way, Mom.

578
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:39,044
Why would you say that about your friend, my Meatball?

579
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,417
Mom!

580
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:42,774
I told you not to call me that.

581
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:45,212
Awwwwe.

582
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:46,433
Meatball.

583
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:48,485
(No matter how hard we study,)

584
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,940
(kids are just kids.)

585
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,742
Damn you guys.

586
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:54,557
(We’d play hard when it’s playtime.)

587
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:56,538
(For the sake that we are kids.)

588
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:00,637
(Even for someone like Lin,)

589
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,665
(she does play like a kid as well.)

590
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:08,971
I want number 3, do it 7 times.

591
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,864
You’ll get a handsome boyfriend, Lin.

592
00:38:20,306 --> 00:38:21,479
What are the girls playing?

593
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:22,967
Is it that fun?

594
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,120
It’s called the Paper Of Fortune.

595
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,189
It’s used to predict fortune.

596
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:26,962
Is that so?

597
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,157
Does anyone want to try mine?

598
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:30,472
Me, me!

599
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,667
The first one

600
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:36,377
.Which number do you want and how many times?

601
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:37,222
I want number 1.

602
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:39,457
130 times.

603
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,015
13 times is enough for you.

604
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:48,600
Haha!

605
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:49,593
Your dad’s dying

606
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:55,108
Your dad’s dying.

607
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:56,171
Your turn now.

608
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:56,829
Which number?

609
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:57,520
4.

610
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,320
How many turns?

611
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,113
4.

612
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:03,643
Your house’s burning down!

613
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,012
Your house’s burning down!

614
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:08,387
Your turn now.

615
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:08,993
Number 2.

616
00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:10,460
8 turns.

617
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:15,416
Your wife’s going to cheat on you.

618
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,443
I want number 3.

619
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,375
9 turns.

620
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:25,553
You got pimples on your butt.

621
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:28,164
Let us see!

622
00:39:28,164 --> 00:39:28,664
I actually have one.

623
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:29,273
How do you know?

624
00:39:29,273 --> 00:39:30,456
Seriously? Let us see.

625
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:35,278
Who else would like to try?

626
00:39:36,195 --> 00:39:36,861
Me.

627
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:41,050
Do you dare try mine?

628
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:47,869
Do you think I’d be scared?

629
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:51,701
Number 3.

630
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,135
7 turns.

631
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,187
Have you done your exercises?

632
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:07,673
Number 4, 4 turns.

633
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:09,953
Have you done your exercises?

634
00:40:10,634 --> 00:40:11,808
Try mine. Number 3, 9 turns.

635
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:12,913
Number 3, 9 turns.

636
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:15,193
Have you done your exercises?

637
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:16,433
How’s that possible? It’s repetitive.

638
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:22,058
Have you done your exercises?

639
00:40:22,058 --> 00:40:23,489
There must be something wrong. Let me see.

640
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:27,611
[Have you done your exercises?]

641
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:29,753
You cheated.

642
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:32,651
Go and do your exercises or I’ll report to Mr. Sommai.

643
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:35,553
Why, you girls get to play.

644
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,510
I told you, the smart gets to make the rules.

645
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:42,804
What rules are you talking about?

646
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:43,485
I’m not playing along.

647
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,101
You guys as well.

648
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:08,745
Go and study already.

649
00:41:11,854 --> 00:41:14,721
Why do I need to study after school?

650
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:18,472
It’s raining. How are you going to go home?

651
00:41:18,914 --> 00:41:22,979
Isn’t there anything more useful than studying after school?

652
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,874
Lin said it, the smart get to make the rules.

653
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,303
That’s not fair.

654
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:31,407
This is the smartest I can get.

655
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,803
How can I beat them?

656
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:34,254
That’s right.

657
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,501
That’s why you should study hard. Look at Tong.

658
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:39,048
He’s studying without any words.

659
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:42,558
So that’s Tong’s plan from the start.

660
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,853
Do you feel spirited now?

661
00:41:45,898 --> 00:41:48,135
I do but I still can’t figure this out.

662
00:41:55,732 --> 00:41:59,430
I’m glad to see you guys studying this hard.

663
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:04,420
We’re not studying hard, we just want to make the rules too.

664
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,060
You guys are trying to beat Lin?

665
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,133
Maybe in some afternoon in your next lives.

666
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:12,800
No, maybe in some evening.

667
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:16,379
Is that so, Giraffe?

668
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:18,092
As if you’re so smart.

669
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:19,262
All you feed on is leaves.

670
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:21,741
Calm down, Ja-Oh.

671
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,768
Don’t fight.

672
00:42:23,913 --> 00:42:25,106
We have to help each other.

673
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:26,267
Right, we have to help each other.

674
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:26,994
How would you help?

675
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:29,951
Are you going to tutor us?

676
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,552
Yes.

677
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:34,934
I was about to invite you guys for a study session this Saturday.

678
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:37,207
At your house?

679
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:39,047
No.

680
00:42:39,302 --> 00:42:40,288
At Ja-Oh’s.

681
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:41,498
Boo.

682
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:42,141
I’m closing my books.

683
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:43,200
Would that be a good idea?

684
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,356
It is.

685
00:42:47,427 --> 00:42:48,624
If Ja-Oh's house is not available,

686
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:49,932
we can go to my house.

687
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:51,671
I’ve got a very spacious house.

688
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:52,774
As if.

689
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:55,446
How is your house spacious, it’s just as big as mine.

690
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:59,273
It’s alright, let’s do it at Ja-Oh’s.

691
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:01,482
I want to have some curry-on-rice at Ja-Oh Mom’s place.

692
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:03,079
But Lin,

693
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:05,490
my Mom’s Khao Perp is also delicious.

694
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,194
But Ja-Oh Mom’s curry-on-rice is the best in town.

695
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:09,581
Is that so?

696
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:10,478
Yeah.

697
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:36,237
Mom, Dad. Will there be any prize for me if I get the highest score in English?

698
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:37,791
Nontawat.

699
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:40,950
You can do it if you put your head into it.

700
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,897
I can do it even without putting my head into it.

701
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,619
Are you calling yourself a genius just because you get the second-highest score?

702
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:50,666
A genius like me can get good scores without a need to pay attention in class.

703
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:53,041
Lin, let me ask you something.

704
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:55,398
Why would you put that much mind into Tong?
