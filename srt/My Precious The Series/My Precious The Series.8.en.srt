1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What do you say we create Fight Club?

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,530
It’s going to be awesome.

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,730
Why would you do that?

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,730
Stop acting like a child.

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,300
It’s all because I’m childish that makes me so dumb as to like you.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,950
You’re so foolish, Tong.

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,240
I was foolish to love you.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,050
(In the end,)

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,120
(we accepted Dong’s invitation)

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,120
(and went back to our home to heal our broken hearts)

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,360
Do you think

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,030
Lin and Pao would last?

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,730
Do you think Lin really likes Pao?

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,830
No way.

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,820
Then why would Lin go out with Pao?

16
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,110
Because Pao is mature.

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,770
Lin doesn’t like someone childish like us.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,530
Really?

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,920
Is that all it takes for one to be in a relationship?

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,820
Doesn’t it have to do with whether you have feelings for someone or not?

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,070
It’s all about maturity?

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,550
Really?

23
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,440
I once read from a book.

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,830
That love is complicated.

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,620
Some things can’t be explained.

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,030
That’s why the adults warn us not to fall in love when we’re in school.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
Wait until you graduate to fall in love.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,850
Then why can the others love?

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Maybe because they’re mature enough to understand.

30
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,480
Does that mean we’re not mature enough?

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,710
I’m jealous of Pao

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,590
for being mature.

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,710
What do you think the two are doing now?

34
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,420
I guess they’re being happy.

35
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:21,580
MATURE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,410
Hey.

37
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:22,930
Two.

38
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,400
What?

39
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,120
How much more is he going to do the push-ups?

40
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,030
He said he’s going to be doing a hundred thousand push-ups.

41
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:28,560
What?

42
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,640
Why a hundred-thousand.

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,640
Because his pain is a hundred-thousand in scale.

44
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,760
He’s heartbroken.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,360
Heartbroken?

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,040
Yeah.

47
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,440
Damn.

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,180
How did he come up with that?

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,180
Hey.

50
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,070
Go on.

51
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,540
Keep the rep going.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,530
Why did you say that?

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,110
Because life goes on, you have to keep going.

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,080
Ayye!

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,320
- Hey! - That’s some punch line.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,840
You can see his muscles.

57
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,080
I’m always by your side.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,520
There we go, 300.

59
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,720
We’re rooting for you.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,340
300.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,860
Come on.

62
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,570
One more rep, dude.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Get up.

64
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,890
One more.

65
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,960
You can do it.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,900
Just one more.

67
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,150
One more.

68
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,900
Look, his muscles are showing.

69
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,580
Yeah.

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,340
You can do it.

71
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,960
We can’t survive with just an undergraduate degree these days, Lin.

72
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,540
I think you have to plan what you want to study after graduating.

73
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,570
If you want to become a researcher,

74
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,240
I think you have to take a master’s so you can get an additional degree.

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,150
Even better if you study abroad so you can get a higher salary

76
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,340
and it’d also be easier for you to get a job too.

77
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,950
Can we talk it out first?

78
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,720
That’s it.

79
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,120
I don’t think I can take it anymore.

80
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,730
Can we not break up?

81
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,250
I’m sorry.

82
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,100
Babe.

83
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,920
Let’s get back together.

84
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,600
Don’t be unreasonable like this again, okay?

85
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,640
(As a class president, I want you to get Tong to focus on his studies.)

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
(Can you do that?)

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,430
I’m the first to put a sticker on Lin.

88
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,160
Here’s your cake, Lin.

89
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,760
(Pao was with Lin for 3 months.)

90
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,170
(In the end, Lin broke up with him.)

91
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,120
(Thinking about it, it seemed like a second chance for me)

92
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,060
(but I hadn’t been contacting Lin for 2 years.)

93
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,090
(Until that day)

94
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:50,640
26 DECEMBER, 2004.

95
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,920
(TONG IS STUPID)

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,210
They say it’s a giant wave.

97
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,770
How big is the wave?

98
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,690
I heard the news this morning,

99
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,960
They said it’s as tall as a 4-storey building.

100
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,460
You must be kidding.

101
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,520
4-storey building?

102
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,120
Yeah.

103
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,560
That’s like the building we’re in.

104
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,560
The worst earthquake in the history of Thailand hit the country at 7:58 AM.

105
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,770
The earthquake’s origin is the Sumatra Island

106
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,410
What’s going on?

107
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,540
of Indonesia.

108
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,520
A giant wave.

109
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,520
They’re covering the news about it now, you should join us.

110
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,230
Multiple huge waves are hitting the coastal area

111
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,870
causing great damage with over 100 deaths and over 800 injuries.

112
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,520
The number of deaths and injuries is still on the rise.

113
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,290
Especially in the provinces near the Andaman Sea and islands.

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,120
Including Phuket, Phang Nga, Krabi, Ranong, Trang…

115
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,840
Shit, that’s my home.

116
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,930
Call your family. Hurry up.

117
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,560
That’s your hometown.

118
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,160
Try your Mom, your grandma, your sister’s number. Whatever.

119
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,630
Can you remember any?

120
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,740
01

121
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,480
01

122
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,600
192

123
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,230
8262

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,730
8262

125
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,410
One second.

126
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,570
Let me try again.

127
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,170
I’ll try.

128
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,740
How was it?

129
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,340
Can you contact Lin?

130
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,140
I can’t, Mom.

131
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,780
I was watching the news

132
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,710
it seemed horrifying when the wave hit the coast.

133
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,810
I’m so worried about Lin.

134
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,170
Let us know if you know anything more.

135
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
We’ll just be tidying the shop.

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,990
It’s getting more and more stressful as time goes by.

137
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,580
No one’s able to contact Lin.

138
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,260
The line’s always busy.

139
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,520
If it were me

140
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,460
I wouldn’t be able to survive.

141
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,030
The waves that hit seemed horrifying just as Dad said.

142
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,650
I wonder how Lin is doing.

143
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,520
I think Lin’s going to be fine.

144
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,150
Lin is great.

145
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,980
She was able to make Tong concentrate on his studies, remember?

146
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Trust me.

147
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,510
Lin will be fine.

148
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,070
I think so too.

149
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,890
Don’t think too much.

150
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
You like to overthink.

151
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,540
Aren’t you worried?

152
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,140
She was your first love.

153
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,570
You know what?

154
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,760
I had a crush on Lin from the first day of school.

155
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,710
Lin was the first love for all of you, wasn’t she?

156
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,170
Yeah.

157
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,640
The whole gang liked her.

158
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,240
Did you know

159
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,070
who Lin’s first love was?

160
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,200
Of course.

161
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,370
It was Tong.

162
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,750
I knew that long ago.

163
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,450
Tong must be dead worried about Lin.

164
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,080
I hope you’re safe, Lin.

165
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Hello, Tong.

166
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,960
Hello, Lin.

167
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,020
How are you doing?

168
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,020
I heard you’re doing an internship in Ranong.

169
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,990
I just watched the news and…

170
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,090
How is Ranong?

171
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,200
Are you in Ranong right now?

172
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,130
Are you alright?

173
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,460
I’m fine.

174
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,960
I’m safe.

175
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,540
I was in town during the time the Tsunami hit.

176
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,700
Don’t worry, Tong.

177
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,160
I’m fine.

178
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,420
Where are you right now?

179
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
I’m at the temporary shelter.

180
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,310
It seems chaotic here.

181
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,650
Full of people who are injured

182
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,640
and people looking for their families.

183
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,070
You’re okay, right?

184
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,050
I’m fine.

185
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
I’ve just talked to Ma and Pa.

186
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,370
You know what, Lin?

187
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,620
I was so scared

188
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,440
when I heard the news.

189
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,010
Especially when the system went down.

190
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,470
I was even more worried.

191
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,640
I was afraid that something bad would happen to you.

192
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,800
But you’re fine and that’s good.

193
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,180
I get to hear your voice already,

194
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,430
so I’m no longer worried.

195
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,250
Thanks, Tong.

196
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,040
Then

197
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,190
that’s that.

198
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hold on.

199
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,080
You miss me, don’t you?

200
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
That’s what they mean when they say

201
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,900
when in crisis, you’ll think of the face of the one you love.

202
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,310
I can’t remember your face anymore.

203
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,560
We haven’t met in two years.

204
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,740
Come on.

205
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,780
How can you forget my handsome face?

206
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,570
How have you been over the past two years?

207
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,840
Did you study hard?

208
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,010
We haven’t talked in two years

209
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,990
and you’re asking me about my studies?

210
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,360
Because you tend to not pay attention to your study.

211
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,880
I’m just worried.

212
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,550
I’ve become way more keen on my studies.

213
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,320
It’s actually because of you

214
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,360
for making me more keen on my studies.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
You’re a sweet talker.

216
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,270
So…

217
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Are you seeing anyone right now?

218
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,840
I’m not telling you.

219
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
But I was with Pao for a while.

220
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,400
I knew that.

221
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,190
Then

222
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,420
why did you guys break up?

223
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,610
I felt like Pao didn’t really like me.

224
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,430
That’s not true.

225
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,980
Pao is crazy about you.

226
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,310
He probably likes you from head to toe.

227
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,670
Ever since I got the love from you,

228
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,370
it was hard for me to find a love like that again.

229
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,760
That’s probably why I felt like Pao didn’t like me that much.

230
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,060
You’re one talker.

231
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,540
I don’t believe you.

232
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Hey.

233
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,410
I mean it.

234
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,630
Lin.

235
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,160
Let me ask you something.

236
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
If I ask you for a second chance now,

237
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,140
would it be too late?

238
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,740
You know what, Tong?

239
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,490
I’ve heard that,

240
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,160
the prime time in love

241
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,360
is the time before two people decide to be in a relationship.

242
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Because once you get into the relationship,

243
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,670
the feelings that were there before you date

244
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,640
would disappear.

245
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,740
So I want to keep the good feelings between us the way it is.

246
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,080
Oh.

247
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,600
Then I’m in trouble.

248
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,800
But because of that,

249
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,790
you’re my best memories.

250
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,150
Lin.

251
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,050
Do you believe in a parallel universe?

252
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,310
Perhaps,

253
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,250
in another universe

254
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,090
we are together.

255
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,880
I’m envious of them.

256
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,530
Thanks for liking me, Tong.

257
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,410
I have to go.

258
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,670
I’ll hang up now.

259
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,940
(Getting to talk to Lin again made me realize)

260
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,770
(that the worst mistake I made)

261
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,860
(was to not have contacted Lin over the two years.)

262
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,670
(Tong’s Treasure)

263
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,600
(Tong’s Excercise Book)

264
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,250
Come.

265
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,970
Let’s get to studying.

266
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,600
Hurry up.

267
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,780
What are you up to now?

268
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,290
(Tong’s Excercise Book)
- 	Take these and finish them at home.

269
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,910
Bring it back to me tomorrow.

270
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,820
(Because even if we don’t get to be together)

271
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
(we could still be good friends.)

272
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,810
(But all this time,)

273
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,560
(I’ve never realized that.)

274
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,460
(On that day, I realize what being mature means.)

275
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:23,270
(It’s when we learn to live with the loss of a certain thing.)

276
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,210
(Once we’ve accepted that we’ve really lost it,)

277
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,910
(that is the day)

278
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,760
(when we become a step more mature.)

279
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,650
2006

280
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,080
Here he comes!

281
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,590
Here Tong comes!

282
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,120
Go slow, go slow.

283
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,260
You bastard!

284
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,060
I’ll snitch on your Dad about it.

285
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,640
We’re here.

286
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,240
Why would you offend my dad?

287
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,260
The service fee, Sir?

288
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,200
You’re asking for a service fee when you drive like this?

289
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,680
Help.

290
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,920
That’s for me?

291
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,050
By myself?

292
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,630
What the heck did you bring with you?

293
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,380
This is heavy!

294
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,310
Why? I was there for a couple of years.

295
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,910
You brought a lot.

296
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,460
Mom, I’m back.

297
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,790
Aw, the fan is so heavy.

298
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,160
You were carrying only one thing and you say it was heavy?

299
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,020
Hey, Tong.

300
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,750
I’m happy for you.

301
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,480
I’ve never thought you would graduate and receive an honor like people do.

302
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,450
Right.

303
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,880
You’re good just like I am.

304
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,880
I’d get an honor too.

305
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,140
My butt!

306
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,880
Just wait until you see my grades when I graduate.

307
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,400
We’d be shocked.

308
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,620
Shocked whether they’re grades or random nominal numbers.

309
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,630
Don’t belittle Dong.

310
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,010
He might be able to do it.

311
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,180
Hey, Tong.

312
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,800
Thanks.

313
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,220
You’re really my true friend.

314
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
I’ll be looking forward to your movies.

315
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,760
If there’s a handsome and rich main lead role,

316
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,520
then give me a call.

317
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,790
I’m making action movies.

318
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,530
With bombs and fires and stuff.

319
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,280
Someone like you are going to make action movies?

320
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,180
I’d rather say porn.

321
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,530
Hey, but don’t worry.

322
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,160
I’ll be watching all your movies.

323
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,160
No matter how bad they are.

324
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,890
Only if you introduce me to some pretty actresses.

325
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,950
That’s the Bank I know.

326
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,550
Thanks for your compliment.

327
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,290
He wasn’t complimenting you,

328
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,680
he was calling you out.

329
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,240
I’ll take that as a compliment.

330
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,800
Hey, I haven’t bragged to Uncle Toei.

331
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,820
Then go.

332
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,690
Go, go.

333
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,840
I took a while setting my hair.

334
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,690
Hello, Granny.

335
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,580
Uncle Toei!

336
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,840
Uncle Toei!

337
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,850
Hello.

338
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,520
What is it, homeboy?

339
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,540
Tong has graduated from university.

340
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,620
With a first-class honor as well.

341
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,410
You’ve graduated?

342
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,880
Yeah!

343
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,780
I want to laugh my fake teeth off.

344
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,020
Well, isn’t my friend a smart cookie, Uncle?

345
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,580
He got a first-class honor.

346
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,770
Right, you’re good.

347
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,920
But I hate you, you bastard.

348
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,740
You were reciting stuff late at night that I couldn’t sleep

349
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,370
and had to recite it along every damn night.

350
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,360
Uncle Teoi, if you don’t congratulate him,

351
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,920
you might not get any sleep tonight.

352
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,840
- Easy, easy. - 	Hold on.

353
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,380
Hey.

354
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,640
I’m only joking.

355
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,610
Congratulations to you.

356
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,460
Come on, Uncle.

357
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,190
You have to congratulate me in English.

358
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Well, you bastard.

359
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,980
Do I have to do it in English?

360
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:39,660
Yeah.

361
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,810
Wait a second.

362
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,570
A second.

363
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,080
Hold on.

364
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,640
Here, found it.

365
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,480
Tong,

366
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,140
congrat-ulation.

367
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,020
Fuck you, you little shit.

368
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,800
Oi,

369
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,330
shut up.

370
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,440
My mom is something.

371
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
‘Not normal’.

372
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,880
My mom is something.

373
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:10,970
Uncle!

374
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,510
Uncle Toei!

375
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,110
Thank you.

376
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,350
When will Mai come?

377
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,320
I’m here!

378
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,050
Brake, brake, brake!

379
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,830
The dirt.

380
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,840
The dirt is all over the place.

381
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,400
Damn it, I missed the bus.

382
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,960
I just stopped by for porridge just for a second.

383
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,780
Why didn’t you catch the earlier one?

384
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,890
I was hungry.

385
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,220
I was just stopping by to eat for a second.

386
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,260
Thank you guys

387
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,530
for helping me move out.

388
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,530
You don’t have to thank us

389
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,080
if you’re going to call everyone every second to help you with your stuff.

390
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,080
That’s right.

391
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,310
I even got a letter.

392
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,770
He sent me a freaking letter.

393
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,760
You don’t get to say that.

394
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,890
You didn’t come in the end.

395
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,360
I got one too.

396
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,170
I got one from every means.

397
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,660
Get what?

398
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,450
I didn’t get anything.

399
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,920
You don’t need one.

400
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,920
I know that if I need something, you will come.

401
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,790
Do you mean we’re telepathic

402
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,340
and can send messages without seeing each other?

403
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:17,890
No.

404
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,690
Because you’re nosy.

405
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,640
I’m keeping a tally on you.

406
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,830
Hey,

407
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
are you guys free on Saturday?

408
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,750
Let’s grab food at Ja-Oh’s Mom’s.

409
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,140
Let’s go!

410
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,050
I miss the food at Ja-Oh’s Mom’s.

411
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,560
Sounds good.

412
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,560
Let’s go!

413
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,320
Hey, guys.

414
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,700
Let’s play Dry Boat.

415
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,720
I’m all grown up, I’m not playing.

416
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,740
The Dad of the slowest one to get there dies!

417
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,510
Dong!

418
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,450
(After graduating from university,)

419
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,260
(meeting my friends from high school friend made me notice that they’ve slowly changed.)

420
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,630
(Whether it’s their hair,)

421
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,090
(or what they wear.)

422
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,100
(But no matter how much has changed,)

423
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,040
(meeting the same group of friends just means turning into boys yet again.)

424
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,950
Pa, I’ve graduated from university.

425
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,740
I even got a first-class honor, Pa.

426
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,360
The entire time I was in university,

427
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,240
I was following your teachings.

428
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,820
I never fooled around with life.

429
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,880
My meatball is the best.

430
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,620
Papa must be proud of you, my boy.

431
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,960
Why are you crying, Ma?

432
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,020
Why are you crying?

433
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,600
(Pao is still the Meatball who takes life seriously.)

434
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,530
(He’s still following his Dad’s teaching.)

435
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,280
Dad.

436
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
I’m going for the provincial-level’s tryout next week.

437
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,720
Do you get paid for that?

438
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,420
The only money I would gain

439
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
is from becoming an NBA Basketball Player.

440
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,450
Do whatever you want.

441
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,780
But I can guarantee you, Dad,

442
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,130
that I will become the world’s number one basketball player.

443
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,970
- (Bank still wants to become an NBA Basketball Player.)
- And also the most handsome one.

444
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,600
(He still doesn’t understand the difference between a dream and a daydream.)

445
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,270
(It’s hard to break that out to him.)

446
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,980
(Since his parents couldn’t even do that.)

447
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:42,960
So cool.

448
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,370
Here it is, Honey, Granny.

449
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,960
Come, come.

450
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
Put it down right here.

451
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,670
My favorite.

452
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,090
Mai.

453
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,380
Yes?

454
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,490
Trust me.

455
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,280
Go study abroad.

456
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,440
All your siblings refused to continue their studies.

457
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,210
They all fled to Bangkok.

458
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,680
There’s only you left

459
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,670
to be the hope of our family.

460
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,940
Right, our family’s already gotten 3 undergrad degrees.

461
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,080
If our son gets a doctoral degree,

462
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:21,450
we’d be the first household to have a child with a doctoral degree.

463
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,420
But I want to learn magic tricks, Mom.

464
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,050
What?

465
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,130
Magic tricks?

466
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,600
Why would you want to learn magic tricks?

467
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,910
It’s a special skill, Pa.

468
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,120
Used to relieve the client’s stress.

469
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,690
When the client is stressed out and doesn’t have the budget to build a house,

470
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,690
we could show them a magic trick to relieve their stress.

471
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,440
When their stresses are relieved,

472
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,750
they will have the courage to make loans.

473
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,040
Once they take out the loan, they’ll have the money to buy stuff from us, Pa.

474
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,960
That’s a good idea.

475
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,380
Right, Granny?

476
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,630
That’s a great idea.

477
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,820
More importantly, Pa.

478
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,330
It can be used to draw girls.

479
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,410
(- But Mai’s little dream turns out to be something I admire.)
- 	Right! So I can tell the wives of your uncles,

480
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,240
(- He tried to change his family’s perception to accept his little dream.)
- 	that Mai is the first in the family to get a doctoral degree in magic tricks.

481
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,570
(And he succeeded.)

482
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,890
I’ll become the best magician.

483
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,960
Is there such a thing as a doctoral degree in magic tricks?

484
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,250
You guys.

485
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,060
Hmm?

486
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Why do my parents laugh at me?

487
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,720
Is my dream to study abroad sound that funny?

488
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,340
What was going on in your head that made you want to study abroad?

489
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,670
Why?

490
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,930
Why can’t I want to study abroad?

491
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,660
Even you want to get into the NBA,

492
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,380
then I should be able to study abroad too.

493
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,000
Then, have you managed to recite A-Z?

494
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,920
If not then I think it’s better to stay in Thailand.

495
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,380
Your parents are already happy that you managed to graduate from a university.

496
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,000
Why would you want to try so hard?

497
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,850
Guys.

498
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,000
I really want to study abroad.

499
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,670
This is the first time I know what I want to do.

500
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,830
Then have you thought about what you want to study,

501
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,700
like, which field of study?

502
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,140
I want to study in Britain.

503
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,710
I want to study English as a major.

504
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,240
I will pursue that field.

505
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,000
You know, I’m so into the British accent.

506
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,560
On top of that, the British accent sounds the nicest.

507
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,420
British?

508
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,760
Then what’s the 9th alphabet in English?

509
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,550
Q.

510
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,080
Well done.

511
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,960
Here’s your prize.

512
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,520
Well done my butt.

513
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,320
The 9th is ‘I’.

514
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,310
You can’t even get your A-Z straight

515
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,670
and you’re dreaming about ‘British’ and stuff?

516
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,620
Will you be able to survive?

517
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,360
That was just A-Z.

518
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,070
Then let me ask you too.

519
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,910
What’s the 45th alphabet in Thai?

520
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,650
Hold on.

521
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,820
There are 44 alphabets.

522
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,700
(Though Dong’s dream seems out of reach,)

523
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,290
Yeah, whatever.

524
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,450
- (I’m happy for him to finally have his dream.)
- You can’t tell just from that. I didn’t even know even when I’m Thai.

525
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,840
Britain is just right around the corner.

526
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,160
This is driving me nuts.

527
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,160
4 packs of that, Ma?

528
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,240
That’s right, Pa.

529
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,720
Pa, Ma!

530
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,600
Lin!

531
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,920
Hello there!

532
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,990
We’ve missed you.

533
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,370
I’ve missed you so much.

534
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,840
That’s a handful.

535
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,100
Whose favorite is this?

536
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,910
My favorite.

537
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,800
Mine as well.

538
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,500
Let’s see.

539
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,780
Give me a hug.

540
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,030
You’re right, Pa.

541
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,080
You’re the best, Lin.

542
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,480
But our Ton Liu is nothing like her sister.

543
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,740
That’s fine, Pa.

544
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,250
Right?

545
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,250
Where’s Ton Liu, by the way?

546
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,920
She’s the school’s athlete.

547
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:33,960
A volleyball player.

548
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,570
She’s at the sports camp with the school right now.

549
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,670
She plays volleyball?

550
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,360
That’s right!

551
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,160
She keeps switching up.

552
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,180
She wouldn’t see anything all the way through.

553
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,680
She’s probably trying to find her identity.

554
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,500
I can’t let that slide.

555
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,500
I’ll have to talk to her when she gets back.

556
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,500
Aw.

557
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,320
You’re stricter than Pa and Ma.

558
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,940
We can’t let that slide, Ma.

559
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,180
Someone like Ton Liu will definitely get carried away if we’re not strict with her.

560
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,160
Come on, just let her live her teenage life.

561
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,640
By the way, will you proceed with your further studies right away?

562
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,040
Is anything wrong?

563
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,120
The thing is, I think I will put aside my studies for now.

564
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,640
Why?

565
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,490
It’s about Petch.

566
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,290
Petch?

567
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:03,720
Lin.

568
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,056
Do you believe in a parallel universe?

569
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:11,784
Perhaps,

570
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:15,472
in another universe

571
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,344
we are together.

572
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:27,720
I’m envious of them.

573
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:53,896
THIS IS THE STORY OF TONG AND LIN IN THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE.

574
00:36:56,224 --> 00:37:00,224
I’m Tong, a boy from Sukhothai who’s the luckiest man in the universe.

575
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,584
Why?

576
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,856
That’s because I get to be Lin’s boyfriend now,

577
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:14,520
after we almost broke up when I was in my first year of university

578
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,608
because I was always acting so childishly.

579
00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:26,856
How was today?

580
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,656
Was it tiring?

581
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:29,224
Yes.

582
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,480
But not anymore.

583
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:33,544
You’re exaggerating.

584
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,432
Hold on.

585
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:36,792
- Why? - 	We can’t get in yet.

586
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:44,816
Hey!

587
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,050
You’re so bold now.

588
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:49,050
You’re not shy like when you were younger.

589
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:50,864
Because I’m all grown up now.

590
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:52,048
Come on.

591
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:53,872
Hurry up.

592
00:37:58,992 --> 00:37:59,624
There.

593
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:00,720
That’s it?

594
00:38:02,608 --> 00:38:04,168
One more time.

595
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:04,680
Please?

596
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:05,632
No.

597
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:06,224
Please, Lin.

598
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:06,600
No.

599
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:07,368
I’m going inside.

600
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:11,744
Hey!

601
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:13,808
Nobody sees.

602
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:16,640
Get inside the house.

603
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:28,304
(Tong’s Diary.)

604
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,440
Babe.

605
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,560
I got you some instant noodles.

606
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:49,976
I was hungry.

607
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:52,056
You’re so lovely.

608
00:38:58,824 --> 00:39:01,050
Let’s see.

609
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:06,176
This reminds me of Uncle Khai’s.

610
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:08,392
Mine is better than Uncle Khai’s.

611
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:09,520
Really?

612
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:10,936
If you don’t trust me then don’t eat it.

613
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,264
Aw, no, I’ll eat it.

614
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,096
Blow it before you eat.

615
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:28,824
This is yummy.

616
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,176
As yummy as Uncle Khai’s.

617
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,840
It reminds me of the old days.

618
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,600
You’re exaggerating again.

619
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:37,544
They’re instant noodles, all the same,

620
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,050
I just added some boiled eggs.

621
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,816
Because it’s the same, it reminds me of my friends,

622
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:49,824
my family,

623
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,280
the time when I was a child,

624
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,144
and also of…

625
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:03,968
Of what?

626
00:40:15,184 --> 00:40:16,352
Of our first love.

627
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:27,336
Have your instant noodles.

628
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,304
Let’s see.

629
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:33,176
Ouch, my hands hurt.

630
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,768
Why? Why did your hands hurt?

631
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:36,792
My hands hurt so I can’t eat.

632
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:38,984
- Come, I’ll feed you. - I can’t eat.

633
00:40:39,008 --> 00:40:39,968
- Blow it first. - 	I can’t eat.

634
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:41,904
Ouch, my mouth hurts.

635
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,050
Yum!

636
00:40:56,256 --> 00:40:57,488
Good job!

637
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,168
How was it?

638
00:40:58,192 --> 00:40:58,970
So yummy.

639
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,740
(After graduating, I get to live the life of an adult.)

640
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,800
(I get the taste of being unemployed.)

641
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,920
You? Studying abroad? First, try graduating within this year.

642
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,580
What are you doing, Tong?

643
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,570
Doing something an unemployed person does, Dad.

644
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,340
You’re just like your Mom.

645
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,200
Who are you talking crap about?

646
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,200
Who are you talking crap about?

647
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,640
(But then suddenly,)

648
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,600
(Nonthawat Kiatpeera)

649
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,890
(Lin poked a pen on my back and woke me up.)
