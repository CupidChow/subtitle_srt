Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,985
I want to be a marine scientist

5
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:21,112
I want the marine animals to stay with us for a long time.

6
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:21,756
What about you, Tong?

7
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:23,054
What do you want to do when you grow up?

8
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:24,383
Lin doesn’t like me.

9
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:25,928
But I think she likes you.

10
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,651
You should grow up.

11
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,041
Otherwise, you’re going to break Lin’s heart.

12
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:36,025
(That year, each of us has to separate and pursue our own journeys.)

13
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:38,459
(Pao made it into Business Administration at Chiangmai.)

14
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,581
(Ja-Oh made it into the faculty of fine arts.)

15
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:43,680
(Mai the Scratcher made it into the faculty of engineering.)

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,800
(Bank made it into the faculty of political science)

17
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,032
(Oh, I almost forgot about Boner Dong.)

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,870
(He’s the only one who didn’t make it into any university.)

19
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:00,483
Come in.

20
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:04,852
Hi.

21
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:08,940
You can leave your shoes there.

22
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:15,604
Hi, I’m Nicky.

23
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:16,656
I’m Tong.

24
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:17,469
Tong?

25
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:19,589
Your name is pretty weird.

26
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:21,444
Where are you from?

27
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:22,857
Chiang Mai.

28
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:24,834
I’m from Sukhothai.

29
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,452
Sukhothai?

30
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,287
I have Sai Uai, do you want some?

31
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:29,557
Sure.

32
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,000
That’s Pod from Phang Na.

33
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:39,078
I’m from Phang Nga.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,957
Not freaking Phang Na.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,846
Hi.

36
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:48,646
Where can I sleep?

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,860
Me and Pod took these two.

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,683
So you can choose among either one of these.

39
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:55,288
Alright.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,899
Hey.

41
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,842
You can let me know if you need my hands on anything.

42
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:03,867
It’s alright. No big deal.

43
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:13,311
What was his name again?

44
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:14,865
Pod.

45
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:17,312
Pod.

46
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:17,883
Pod.

47
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:19,026
Huh?

48
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:21,282
What’s the movie?

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,363
This?

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,410
You don’t know?

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,645
This is a legendary Thai movie.

52
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:30,313
The three of us have to see it, as a film student.

53
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:32,541
I’m into action movies.

54
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,160
I like Panna Rittikrai’s movies.

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,174
“Born To Fight”?

56
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:37,229
Yes!

57
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,457
Super awesome!

58
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:39,183
The GOAT.

59
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:41,148
I’ve never seen any of them.

60
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:42,220
Can you guys show it to me?

61
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,281
I will show it to you.

62
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,816
I will open up your horizon.

63
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:50,730
CHILDISH

64
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:57,868
Lin.

65
00:03:58,594 --> 00:03:59,651
It’s 8 PM.

66
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,734
Are you done with study?

67
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:02,525
Almost done.

68
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,870
Don’t you do anything else?

69
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,531
Aren’t you bored of only studying?

70
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:09,578
Nope.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,789
What about you?

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,148
Why aren’t you studying?

73
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,893
I don’t have any time for studying.

74
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:20,098
I miss you every hour of the day.

75
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,908
That’s 24 times a day.

76
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,164
Isn’t that too much?

77
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,777
Don’t laugh at me.

78
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:26,857
I’m serious.

79
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:30,514
We’re so far apart, do you miss me?

80
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,712
Not really.

81
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:34,666
You’re so mean.

82
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,665
Did you join the freshmen welcoming event?

83
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,991
I did but it was boring.

84
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,289
Are you going?

85
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:43,682
Of course.

86
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,405
So I would get to know the seniors.

87
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:49,325
Don’t let any man try to hit on you.

88
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:51,091
The seniors and stuff.

89
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,249
Don’t let them hold your hands.

90
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,614
Why should I not let them?

91
00:04:57,989 --> 00:04:58,739
Well,

92
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,560
I still couldn’t even win your heart.

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,888
I haven’t even got to hold your hands.

94
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:07,577
How can I let other guys hold your hands before me?

95
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:08,993
What about you?

96
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:11,270
Did you hold the other girl’s hands?

97
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:12,951
Well

98
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,240
I did when I was blindfolded during the activity.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,735
But I was thinking that she was you.

100
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:20,357
Then

101
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,491
I would think that that senior is you too.

102
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,315
No!

103
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,340
It’s not the same.

104
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,000
You can’t let anyone hold your hands.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,384
I’m very serious about this.

106
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:39,280
What would you give me if I did as you told me?

107
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:49,108
I’m taking you out for Loy Krathong together, just the two of us.

108
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:57,986
Then I will give you the answer later.

109
00:05:58,612 --> 00:05:59,772
Come on.

110
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,499
I’ll have to study now, Tong.

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,091
Fine.

112
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:09,561
Don’t stay up too late.

113
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,430
Yep.

114
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,359
Don’t overdo yourself with studying.

115
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,737
Don’t stay up too late as well.

116
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:18,243
Good night.

117
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,679
Good night to you too, Tong.

118
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:30,616
This is for you, Lin.

119
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,077
Thanks.

120
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,539
[Let’s go out for Loy Krathong]

121
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:02,811
Lin!

122
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:04,613
Have you been waiting for long?

123
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:07,048
No.

124
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,632
You’re still wearing your hair like this?

125
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,187
Yeah.

126
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:15,290
I think I like this hair.

127
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:18,236
I like it too.

128
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:22,767
I mean, I like your hair like this.

129
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:25,802
That’s all you that you like?

130
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,618
And I like this too.

131
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:33,434
You like my shirt?

132
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:36,602
I like everything about you.

133
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:46,836
How much do you like me, Tong?

134
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,349
I like you so much.

135
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,810
I like you a lot.

136
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:58,979
Why do you ask?

137
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:06,497
I’ve always been thinking

138
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:09,623
that you think too highly of me.

139
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,046
Actually,

140
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,061
I might not be as good a person as you think.

141
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:26,622
So I don’t feel so confident that you like me like this.

142
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,736
Why aren’t you confident?

143
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:45,453
I still have another side to me that you never know.

144
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:55,620
I’m actually an untidy person.

145
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,723
I always make a mess of my room.

146
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:04,377
And I would be so annoyed if I had to wake up too early

147
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:06,840
or when the food is not good.

148
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,874
I also like to make my sister angry for fun.

149
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:20,296
I’m actually just a girl.

150
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:29,324
The person you like might be the person who’s only in your imagination.

151
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,411
No.

152
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,747
I think I’m well aware of my own feelings.

153
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:37,676
I like everything that you are.

154
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:42,034
Do you like me that much?

155
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,645
I like you sooooooo much.

156
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,245
I like you as much as a house.

157
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:50,790
You’re giving me a childish answer.

158
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,509
Think carefully before you answer.

159
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,310
(Sometime,)

160
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,742
Lin, where are you going?
(I don’t quite understand)

161
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:01,881
(what Lin meant.)

162
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:06,520
(Or is she trying to test me?)

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,919
Lin.

164
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,180
I can like you as much as the ocean.

165
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,666
No!

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,932
Lin.

167
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:16,968
Lin!

168
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:17,833
Don’t touch me.

169
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:26,684
Hey, don’t peak.

170
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:28,789
What are you writing?

171
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:31,555
I’m not telling you.

172
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:33,981
Who gives away about such things?

173
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:39,337
Done.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,168
Are you really not telling me what you wrote?

175
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,420
No, I’m not.

176
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:25,437
Lin.

177
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:31,708
I will make you love me someday.

178
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:41,295
(I’ve always thought that I was a confident person)

179
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:43,268
(and a brave person.)

180
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,092
Do you want to know my answer, Tong?

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,536
I can answer you now.

182
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,384
(But I know now)

183
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,749
(that I’m the biggest coward)

184
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:04,416
(when I’m in front of the girl I love.)

185
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:08,402
No.

186
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:15,952
I’m not looking for an answer.

187
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,574
So you can’t say no to me.

188
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,590
Alright?

189
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:32,314
Do you really not want to know?

190
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:38,600
Yes.

191
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,984
Just let me go on with my feelings for you like this.

192
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:54,498
Let’s float this away.

193
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:32,212
Go.

194
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,616
Fetch the Krathong.

195
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,108
Huh?

196
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:39,633
Why are you ‘Huh’-ing?

197
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:40,903
Go and fetch the Krathong.

198
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,321
Are you serious?

199
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,750
Yeah.

200
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:46,845
You will contaminate the ocean.

201
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:47,738
Hurry up!

202
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:48,823
There.

203
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:50,731
Hurry up!

204
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,800
Hurry up, Tong.

205
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:52,616
Seriously?

206
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:53,278
Yes.

207
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:05,256
What do you say we create Fight Club?

208
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:06,405
It’s going to be awesome!

209
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:07,968
Who’s going to be your first fighters?

210
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:09,767
What about you and I?

211
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,240
Of course.

212
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:45,240
The other rooms are fully booked

213
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,392
so I had to book this room.

214
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:50,501
Well, it’s Loy Krathong season.

215
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,594
A lot of people travel.

216
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:57,248
It’s only normal.

217
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:03,994
Just take the bed, I can sleep on the floor.

218
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:05,362
Not a problem.

219
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,094
But I can also sleep on the floor.

220
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:08,719
You’re joking.

221
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:11,752
No man would ever let a girl sleep on the floor.

222
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:18,961
Are you letting me sleep comfortably while you suffer?

223
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,772
Who said I’m suffering?

224
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,903
I can’t sleep on a bed that’s too soft.

225
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:26,702
My back hurts.

226
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,978
You sound like an old person.

227
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,191
I’m an old person.

228
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:09,166
Tong.

229
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:10,188
Are you asleep?

230
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,183
No.

231
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,519
Do you want to sleep on the bed?

232
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,019
What?

233
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:28,939
I’m not as easy as you think.

234
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,439
I’m just letting you sleep on the bed.

235
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:35,210
What are you taking it for?

236
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:37,652
Well

237
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,966
you caught me off guard when you said that.

238
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:47,159
I’m a man.

239
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,373
You can’t invite me to join you like that.

240
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:52,489
You know what?

241
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,669
I asked because I trust in you.

242
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:01,382
So what do you say?

243
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:21,202
Try not to fall off the bed.

244
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:30,566
Goodnight, Tong.

245
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:33,158
Yeah.

246
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:34,556
Goodnight.

247
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,603
You said goodnight but why aren’t you sleeping?

248
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,017
Because I’m not sleepy.

249
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:15,229
What’s wrong, Tong?

250
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,130
I

251
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,646
I don’t want to cut the steps.

252
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:30,917
What steps?

253
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,542
I think I should

254
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:41,666
start with holding your hands.

255
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,590
Aren’t you going to hold it?

256
00:19:55,573 --> 00:20:00,599
I think I should ask you to be my girlfriend

257
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:03,714
before I can touch you.

258
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:08,023
You sound like a kid.

259
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,603
What kid?

260
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:12,666
I’m a gentleman.

261
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:15,181
No one’s as good as I am.

262
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:23,635
Stop laughing I want to sleep.

263
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:25,013
Right,

264
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:26,856
let’s sleep.

265
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:37,169
Goodnight.

266
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,438
Yes. Goodnight.

267
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:10,455
Study hard when you get back.

268
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:12,460
Don’t just play.

269
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:16,317
What kind of person do you think I am?

270
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:19,037
I think of you as who you are.

271
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:23,013
If you don’t have me to nag and boss you around,

272
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:24,947
you wouldn’t get things done, am I right?

273
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:30,429
It’d be nice to have you by my side nagging me like before.

274
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,132
Aww.

275
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,887
You’re such a kid.

276
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,301
You’re petting me like I’m a puppy.

277
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,221
Oh, so you do realize that.

278
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:48,938
If you don’t want me to pet you

279
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:50,881
then what about a hug?

280
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:54,698
No.

281
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,655
Why not?

282
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,143
Just no.

283
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:02,807
Oh?

284
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:03,662
Tong?

285
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:07,146
I’ve got to go.

286
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,036
Yeah.

287
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,934
Bye-bye.

288
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,042
(After coming back from Songkhla,)

289
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,140
(I never felt confident)

290
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:36,402
(until I get to watch Fight Club.)

291
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,579
It would be such a waste

292
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:44,426
if you’re a film student but have never watched Fight Club.

293
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,358
(This film and Brad Pitt opened up a new world to me.)

294
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,575
Brad Pitt is so cool.

295
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:52,551
(I realized that I want to become a cool and awesome person)

296
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:54,227
(like Tyler Durden.)

297
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,813
(I have to get back to being cool and awesome for Lin.)

298
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:01,080
Dude.

299
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:02,038
What?

300
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:03,884
What do you say we create Fight Club?

301
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:09,533
Invite the boys in the dorm to an underground fight.

302
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:10,798
Just like in the movie.

303
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,282
It’s going to be awesome.

304
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:13,688
Damn.

305
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,235
Who’s going to be your first fighters?

306
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:24,319
What about you and I?

307
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:27,191
Of course.

308
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:34,345
So awesome.

309
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:44,233
What’s the first rule of Fight Club?

310
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,026
You do not talk about Fight Club.

311
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:47,879
Tong,

312
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:49,889
when will you grow up?

313
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:51,407
Why are you accusing me of that word again?

314
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:12,481
Lin.

315
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,369
You’re coming to Bangkok next week, right?

316
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,085
Come and cheer for me.

317
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,356
I guarantee it’s going to be fun.

318
00:24:20,203 --> 00:24:21,989
Why would you do that?

319
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:24,342
Wouldn’t it be better to use this time for study?

320
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,654
It’s boring to just be studying.

321
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:30,941
I’m just trying to find something fun to do.

322
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:32,843
But to fight?

323
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:35,014
Yeah.

324
00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:36,674
We’re boys.

325
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:38,094
Would you rather have us play Barbie dollhouses?

326
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:40,852
Tong.

327
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,533
I sometimes don’t understand you at all.

328
00:24:44,993 --> 00:24:46,276
Haven’t you heard?

329
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,401
You don’t have to understand love

330
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,347
you just have to feel it.

331
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,770
How was that?

332
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,494
Cool, right?

333
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:53,705
Oh?

334
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:54,750
Lin?

335
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:55,806
Lin?

336
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:58,825
Hey, Nicky.

337
00:24:59,211 --> 00:24:59,972
What?

338
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:01,102
Are you done?

339
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:02,783
Why, are you in a hurry?

340
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,739
It’s scorching here.

341
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:12,927
Just wait.

342
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:15,806
You should start with learning how to fight, bastard.

343
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,910
Hey, let’s go. I’m hungry.

344
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,719
What’s the first rule of Fight Club?

345
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,612
You do not talk about Fight Club.

346
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,879
Are you guys ready?

347
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:36,539
Fight!

348
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:03,316
That was all you can do?

349
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:07,923
Alright.

350
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:26,247
Nicky!

351
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:39,889
Nicky!

352
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,347
Tong!

353
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:54,670
Tong!

354
00:27:02,927 --> 00:27:03,690
Tong!

355
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,661
I said to stop.

356
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:14,826
Tong!

357
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:16,197
Enough.

358
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:38,919
(And my stupid thoughts)

359
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:42,134
(ruined everything.)

360
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,010
If it didn’t rain, we would get another 2 more rounds.

361
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,977
You’re right.

362
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:58,044
Tong is that your girl?

363
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:00,066
Don’t be nosy get the hell up.

364
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:01,900
Go.

365
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:10,060
Have you been here for long?

366
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,324
I didn’t see you after my fight.

367
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:14,397
Did you see when I was knocked out?

368
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:16,075
Nicky was beating me up.

369
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:19,035
Then I fell back and blacked out.

370
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:21,370
Nicky was punching so hard.

371
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,129
- It was awesome.
- Did you have a lot of fun?

372
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:23,622
It was, of course.

373
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,860
When you came to watch me, I was so excited.

374
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,510
I was so happy you came.

375
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:31,292
Why did you do something like this?

376
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:35,715
What’s wrong?

377
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:37,872
Answer me.

378
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,275
Why did you do that?

379
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:46,964
Why would you guys beat each other up?

380
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:50,201
The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.

381
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:51,006
What are you even saying?

382
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,316
Well…

383
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,765
Quit playing.

384
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:55,754
It’s Fight Club.

385
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:57,919
Haven’t you seen it?

386
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,749
It’s an awesome film.

387
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:06,468
Tong.

388
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:08,401
When will you grow up?

389
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:16,213
Why are you accusing me of that word again?

390
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,550
Because you keep acting like a child who wouldn’t grow up.

391
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,734
Why?

392
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:24,386
I just want to have fun.

393
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:25,815
Why would you put so much thought into it?

394
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:26,843
It’s no big deal.

395
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,919
You’re saying this because you’re just going to do it again, are you?

396
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:31,578
Right.

397
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,141
Because the others are doing it.

398
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:37,643
The others you’re talking about are a bunch of boys who wouldn’t grow up.

399
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,710
Grow up already, Tong.

400
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:42,857
Stop acting like a chil–

401
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:43,535
Fine.

402
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,818
I’m childish and immature.

403
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:51,039
It’s all because I’m childish that makes me so dumb as to like you.

404
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,952
Are you saying it’s foolish to like me?

405
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:17,746
Huh?

406
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:28,122
You fool.

407
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:29,462
Right, I’m a fool.

408
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,661
You’re so foolish, Tong.

409
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:33,738
I was foolish to love you.

410
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,810
You never understand anything.

411
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,223
I’ve never understood a damn thing.

412
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:43,066
(The cruelest thing about becoming an adult)

413
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:48,461
So foolish.
(even though we’re the same age, )

414
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:53,244
(girls are more mature than boys.)

415
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:01,108
Try to understand me for once.

416
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:19,189
(So I started to believe that no boy can make a relationship with a girl his age work.)

417
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:43,286
Lin is that mad at you?

418
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:46,491
Huh?

419
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,730
You guys aren’t together yet?

420
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,056
Are you sure you’re not going to apologize to her?

421
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,925
Then I stand a chance.

422
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,820
(And when Bank heard the news, he rode his bike to Lin right away.)

423
00:31:57,392 --> 00:31:59,392
(He rode from Bangkok to Songkhla,)

424
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
(hoping to make her see how ambitious he was.)

425
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:04,309
(Then he would confess to Lin.)

426
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:09,743
(Little did he know that Pao was also taking the Train from Chiang Mai to Lin.)

427
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:16,346
(For some reason, the train from Chiang Mai got to her first.)

428
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:24,213
I know that Tong is the right one for you.

429
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:30,092
You told me that you don’t like an immature boy.

430
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:33,535
But you know what?

431
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,338
No matter how childish Tong was,

432
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,978
you liked him.

433
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:43,623
I used to try,

434
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:47,163
try behaving the way Tong does.

435
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,089
But I couldn’t do it.

436
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:03,207
Why are you saying that to me now?

437
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:10,520
If I didn’t do anything, you guys would get back together eventually.

438
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:20,982
Give me a chance, Lin.

439
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:42,023
(When Bank saw Pao holding Lin’s hand, he couldn’t take it.)

440
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,472
(He went back to Bangkok right away.)

441
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:53,738
(Despite not having any sleep for 13 hours.)

442
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:57,508
(He took 13 hours to get back to Bangkok.)

443
00:33:57,508 --> 00:34:01,454
(He rode 26 hours in total to take me somewhere.)

444
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,427
Tong, you bastard.

445
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:07,128
(And he slammed my face.)

446
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:08,714
What was that for?
(I didn’t know why he did that.)

447
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,316
Because you’re stupid.

448
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:12,900
(And we fought.)

449
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,381
(Without knowing what it was for.)

450
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,480
What the hell’s wrong with you?

451
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:32,026
(We still don’t know why we fought that day even until now.)

452
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,756
What the hell’s wrong with you?

453
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:41,416
Welcome, my friends.
(Welkom, heartbroken people.)

454
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:42,654
You horrible friend.

455
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:45,780
Do you think Lin and Pao will last?

456
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:09,251
Tong.

457
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:12,734
Why would you follow me around?

458
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:17,828
I drove from Bangkok to Songkhla

459
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,328
and from Songkhla to Bangkok.

460
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,507
Don’t you feel sorry for me?

461
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:26,246
No.

462
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:29,254
Because you are a fool

463
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:35,844
I might be a fool

464
00:35:36,654 --> 00:35:38,361
but I’m a fool because I love her.

465
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:44,723
Do you want some peas?I

466
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:49,001
I don’t want any peas, I’m heartbroken.

467
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:50,592
No?

468
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,672
You might be all broken inside

469
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:54,163
but my peas aren’t.

470
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:54,833
Don’t you want some?

471
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,319
It’s alright, it’s alright.

472
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:00,130
This one’s for you.

473
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:02,954
Console your friend.

474
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,264
I wish you the best.

475
00:36:07,804 --> 00:36:09,160
Do you want some peas?

476
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,030
Do you want some peas?

477
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,289
I don’t want to be broken inside.

478
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,384
Tong!

479
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:22,378
(In the end,)

480
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:24,365
(we accepted Don’t invitation)

481
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,635
(and went back to our home to heal our broken hearts)

482
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,798
(I don’t think I’m the one who’s in a critical stage.)

483
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:33,017
This is rotten.

484
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:33,674
Damn it.

485
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,896
He tricked me into buying the peas.

486
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:36,963
Tong!

487
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:41,353
What the hell is wrong with you?

488
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:42,025
Bastard.

489
00:36:43,353 --> 00:36:44,300
Eat the damn thing up.

490
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,605
You eat this damn thing up.

491
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:46,383
These peas.

492
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:48,217
All of them.

493
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:49,120
Damn it.

494
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:51,751
Are you the only one who’s heartbroken?

495
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,894
I’m also heartbroken.

496
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,757
The peas are rotten inside.

497
00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:00,583
I want to go to Songkhla, Tong.

498
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,922
Why would you want to go there?

499
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:04,398
I want to see Lin.

500
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:05,990
Tong.

501
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:07,299
I want to go to Songkhla

502
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:08,775
Tong!

503
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,136
Go!

504
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:11,694
Go ahead.

505
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:13,861
Aren’t you going to try to stop me?

506
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:14,780
Why would I?

507
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,955
Go ahead if you want.

508
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:22,110
Welcome, my friends.
(Welkom, heartbroken people.)

509
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,381
You horrible friend.

510
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,434
Are you rubbing salt on my wound?

511
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,274
I’m not.

512
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:31,271
But everyone knows about you too getting your hearts broken.

513
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:34,089
How did the others know?

514
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:36,036
Everyone in the town knows.

515
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:37,847
Damn it, did you leak the news?

516
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,631
I didn’t.

517
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,333
I just told Uncle Haeb.

518
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:45,110
Then he told everyone in the town.

519
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:49,242
That includes the story about Bank riding from Bangkok to Songkhla

520
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:50,582
and from Songkhla to Bangkok.

521
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:51,976
Everyone knows about it too.

522
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,176
My brothers.

523
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:00,919
Don’t be sad.

524
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,538
Getting your heart broken is normal.

525
00:38:02,718 --> 00:38:06,278
Uncle Haeb said that boys around here have a way to heal.

526
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,831
You can heal a broken arm

527
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:12,906
but you can’t heal a broken heart.

528
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:16,238
Bank,

529
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:19,699
we don’t call your case a heartbreak case.

530
00:38:20,494 --> 00:38:21,327
What do you call it, then?

531
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:22,606
Being stupid.

532
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:32,293
What do boys around here do when they’re heartbroken?

533
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,818
Do you know about “Saying Goodbye to Your Love in Sawakhalok”?

534
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:41,499
Alright.

535
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,557
(‘Wankhalok)

536
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:46,010
Cheers to Pao who stole our love.

537
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,853
That’s right.

538
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:52,264
And cheers for me who drove from Bangkok to Songkhla.

539
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:55,398
Cheers for you guys’ stupidity.

540
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:56,068
Yay!

541
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,290
Cheers for their stupidity.

542
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:13,819
The boys have grown up, Tao.

543
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:19,372
They get to have their heartbroken and turned down by a girl.

544
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:24,279
The pain makes you grow.

545
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:28,551
It makes you tougher.

546
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,238
Look at Tao and Toei.

547
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:31,856
Hey.

548
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,745
Tao, look at Toei. What’s up with him?

549
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:35,292
Toei.

550
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,053
I feel the ache.

551
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:39,328
Headache?

552
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,507
The ache to use to the toilet.

553
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:43,297
Can I just take a leak here?

554
00:39:43,944 --> 00:39:44,591
No problem.

555
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,794
What’s going to be so bad about leaking on a computer?

556
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:48,566
You even took a dump on my barber chair yesterday.

557
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:50,077
Don’t encourage him!

558
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:51,509
I’m opening my shop tomorrow.

559
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:54,138
Dong.

560
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:58,083
Looking at the boys reminds me of when we were young

561
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:04,546
when the four of us fell for the same girl and got our hearts broken at the same time.

562
00:40:04,546 --> 00:40:06,003
That’s right.

563
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:09,364
And that girl has a daughter.

564
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:13,163
And her daughter broke my son’s heart.

565
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,809
Can you not mention that woman right now?

566
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:18,448
I miss Ping.

567
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:20,427
You idiot.

568
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:22,707
Why would you mention Ping?

569
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,553
Oh, my Ping.

570
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:25,968
I was Ping’s.

571
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:27,352
My Ping.

572
00:40:27,352 --> 00:40:28,735
Ping!

573
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:29,725
Stop!

574
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:31,439
My Ping!

575
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:34,339
(On that day, I came to realize that)

576
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:42,247
(whether we are disappointed or heartbroken, drinking doesn’t help.)

577
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,217
(It was just a drink that made your personality change.)

578
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,310
I told you.

579
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:57,650
Are you alright?

580
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,462
Of course I am.

581
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,806
Why didn’t you invite Mai?

582
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:05,146
You’re asking a stupid question again.

583
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:05,905
What?

584
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:07,455
How?

585
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:10,894
If we invite Mai then how would Pao feel?

586
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,478
He would be the only one uninvited.

587
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:15,964
Screw him.

588
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:17,753
He got there before me.

589
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:19,297
Hey.

590
00:41:19,553 --> 00:41:20,738
He’s our friend.

591
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:23,316
Don’t be vengeful of a friend.

592
00:41:26,646 --> 00:41:28,025
Calm down.

593
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,744
Do you think

594
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,356
Lin and Pao would last?

595
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,015
I don’t know.

596
00:41:44,883 --> 00:41:47,008
A part of me doesn’t want them to be happy

597
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,364
but another part of me

598
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:52,311
doesn’t want Lin to be sad.

599
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,949
Do you think Lin really likes Pao?

600
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:01,300
No way.

601
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,105
Then why would Lin go out with Pao?

602
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,041
Because Pao is mature.

603
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:12,353
Lin doesn’t like someone childish like us.

604
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:15,934
Is that all it takes for one to be in a relationship?

605
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:19,759
Doesn’t it have to do with feelings of like or not like?

606
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:22,313
It’s all about maturity?

607
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:23,501
Really?

608
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:04,459
The worst earthquake in the history of Thailand hit the country followed by a huge wave hitting the coasts

609
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:05,449
including Phuket,

610
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:05,949
What’s going on?

611
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:06,642
Phang Gna

612
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:07,335
and Krabi…

613
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,223
A giant wave.

614
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:10,206
They’re covering the news about it now, you should join us.

615
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:11,440
How was it?

616
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:12,958
Can you contact Lin?

617
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,377
I can’t, Mom.

618
00:43:14,787 --> 00:43:16,449
Lin’s going to be fine.

619
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:18,283
Lin is great.

620
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:19,953
Aren’t you worried?

621
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,518
She was your first love.

622
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,633
Hello, Lin?

623
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:27,667
How are you doing?

624
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,672
I heard you’re doing an internship in Ranong.

625
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,607
I just watched the news and…

626
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:32,951
how is Ranong?

627
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:33,867
Are you in Ranong right now?

628
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:34,625
Are you alright?

629
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,403
(After graduating from university,)

630
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:41,705
(meeting your high school friends just means turning into boys yet again.)

631
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:44,287
Uncle Toei!

632
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:45,710
What is it, homeboy?

633
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:47,894
Tong has graduated from university.

634
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:49,921
With a first-class honor as well.

635
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:52,193
Congrat-ulation.

636
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:55,263
Fuck you!
