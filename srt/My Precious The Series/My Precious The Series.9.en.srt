1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,560
(After graduating from university,)

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,000
(meeting the same group of friends just means turning into boys yet again.)

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,600
Uncle Toei!

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,280
What is it, homeboy?

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,240
Tong has graduated from university.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,160
With a first-class honor as well.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,520
Congrat-ulation.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,480
Fuck you, you little shit.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,640
Is anything wrong?

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,760
The thing is, I think I will put aside my studies for now.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,400
Why?

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,800
It’s about Petch.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,320
You? Studying abroad? First, try graduating within this year.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,639
Yes, someone like me.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,240
Would you like to have a taste?

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
By the way, what are you guys planning to do next?

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,200
Would you guys continue your studies like Dong or work?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,440
I want to learn magic tricks.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,560
I’m looking for a place to learn that.

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,920
Why would you want to learn magic tricks?

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Didn’t you just graduate from an engineering school?

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,480
Well, can’t we learn magic tricks if we graduate from an engineering school?

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,160
It’s a special talent for showing off when you’re trying to get a job.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
I’ve run out of words to tell you off.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,440
No one likes your lame magic tricks.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,080
Lin does.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,720
Lin likes my tricks.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,480
She was always laughing.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
She was laughing because she felt sorry for you.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
Ja-Oh, talk to Mai nicely.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,840
That’s right.

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,560
He has always been buying you stuff.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
What?

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
Well.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,800
What’s going on between these two?

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,520
Nothing.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,239
I just buy stuff for Mom and Dad.

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,320
What?

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,760
Hold on.

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,800
You’re calling them ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad’?

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,280
You call my parents ‘Uncle’ and ‘Aunty’.

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
You can call me ‘Mom’, that’s alright.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
‘Mom and Dad’ will take it with pleasure.

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
This is going too far.

45
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Please leave, Mom and Dad.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,360
What’s going on between you two?

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
You guys too.

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,440
Stop talking and eat up.

49
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,800
Mai.

50
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,480
Think it through.

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,600
Ja-Oh is as tough as my Mom.

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,880
I’ve heard that giraffes are herbivores,

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
they shouldn’t be aggressive.

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
Mai,

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,920
don’t you back down.

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
If you back down on her now,

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,760
you will always have to back down.

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
That’s right.

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,600
Fight for yourself, Mai.

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,040
Fight!

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,680
Go!

62
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,360
Go!

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,760
Energy recharge!

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,240
Do you think I would always back down for you?

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,720
Alright!

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
Let’s see who’s the one dominating.

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,760
Are you asking for it right now?

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,000
Alright!

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
Go! Go!

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,960
Go!

71
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
Mai, you go!

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
I can’t take this anymore.

73
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,680
Go, Mai. Go.

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,040
Go.

75
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,160
I’m not having this anymore.

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,520
Lin?

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,440
Hey, Lin.

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Lin!

79
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Mai, you’re beaten.

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
I don’t even get to put up a fight.

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,760
If I get to open my mouth, you’re done for.

82
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,680
I’m telling you.

83
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,000
STILL SMILING

84
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
Giraffe~

85
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,160
I want to eat that.

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,640
- Come and pick it up yourself. - Sure.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Not from you.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,840
Oops.

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,600
That’s a miss.

90
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,000
I’m safe.

91
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Bank.

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,680
Yeah?

93
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,920
Is it true that you drove all the way to Songkhla and returned on the same day?

94
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,800
Right.

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
And can you get there after Pao?

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
Doesn’t the train take longer time?

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,320
Thing is, if you’re not the right one, you can never get to her.

98
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,400
Bastards.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
You guys keep stepping on me.

100
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,520
Lin.

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
I did that for you.

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,840
He just wouldn’t stop being corny.

103
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,039
Are you all getting a job in Bangkok?

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,240
No, it’s not me.

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,520
Because I’m going to America.

106
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,240
I’m going to become an NBA basketball player.

107
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,120
What’s “it’s not me”?

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
Screw it.

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,560
I’m going to England.

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,720
I’m going to watch Manchester United.

111
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
That’s is if someone like you manages to graduate within this year.

112
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,560
By the way, Tong.

113
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,280
What are you going to do next?

114
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,320
I’ll be making films.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,080
I’ll probably be in Bangkok.

116
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,600
What about Ja-Oh?

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Me?

118
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I’ll be looking for a job in Bangkok as well.

119
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,440
I was thinking about making lots of money to help my family out.

120
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,080
Same here.

121
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,080
I don’t want my Ma to work be working her back off anymore.

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
Same here.

123
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,720
If I’m still here, my parents would make me continue my studies.

124
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,960
My greatest dream is I will not study.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So, when are you going to start with your further studies?

126
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,320
That’s right.

127
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,520
I’m not telling you guys.

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,120
Oh?

129
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,399
Why are you being mysterious?

130
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,440
I’m not being mysterious

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,360
but sometimes, life is just uncertain.

132
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,840
I feel like,

133
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,160
as we get older,

134
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,160
things are not as easy as when we were in school.

135
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,400
Sorry, Lin.

136
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,880
But I don’t understand.

137
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
Oh, Dong.

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,880
Guys, shall we take a photo together as a keepsake?

139
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,560
Sure.

140
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
Sure.

141
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
I brought a camera.

142
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,240
Wait, I don’t have a tripod.

143
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,640
Here is one.

144
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,840
I’m the first!

145
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,200
Go, go.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,399
Move a little to this side.

147
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,880
Where?

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
All sorted out?

149
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,920
Stand up.

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
Stand up. I am standing up!

151
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, you are standing up?

152
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,680
I am!

153
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,520
Alright, 1...2…

154
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,840
Let’s go.

155
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,560
10…9…

156
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
- Hurry up! - 8

157
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,080
7

158
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,560
6

159
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,240
5

160
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,920
4

161
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,720
3

162
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,280
2

163
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,960
1

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,480
Yay!

165
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,920
(On that day,)

166
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,360
(we were together until morning came.)

167
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
- I will see you again.
- 	(We were talking,)

168
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,040
(teasing each other,)

169
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
(and laughing like when we were in school.)

170
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
Bye-bye.

171
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,200
I’ll get going.

172
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,200
Bye-bye.

173
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,680
I’ll see you.

174
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,680
I’ll give you a lift home.

175
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Bye-bye.

176
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,320
(But in the end,)

177
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,440
(we have to part)

178
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Bye-bye.

179
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,840
(to live our own lives.)

180
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,400
Take good care of yourself.

181
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,680
Yeah.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
You too, Lin.

183
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,520
Yeah.

184
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,920
I’ll see you again.

185
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,240
Bye-bye.

186
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:42,480
2007

187
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,800
(After graduating, I get to live the life of an adult.)

188
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,920
(I get the taste of being unemployed.)

189
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,000
(But I was living my life day by day without a rush,)

190
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
(just like when I was still in school.)

191
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
Let’s go out and have some fried oyster.

192
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,400
What are you doing, Tong?

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,080
Doing something an unemployed person does, Dad.

194
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,760
Could you pick that up for me, Dad?

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,040
You’re just like your Mom.

196
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,640
Who are you talking crap about?

197
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,760
Who are you talking crap about?

198
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,880
What are you doing?

199
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,560
Who are you talking crap about?

200
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,360
I said, what are you doing?

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800
Who are you talking crap about?

202
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,880
That hurts!

203
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,520
Who are you talking crap about?

204
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
About me.

205
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,720
Don’t you dare, Tao.

206
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,960
Go and wipe the floor.

207
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
What are you doing?

208
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,160
Go and wipe the floor.

209
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,440
You can just hit me in the head

210
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,080
it stings when you whip it right at the tip of my nose.

211
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,280
You got it.

212
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,560
Go and wipe the floor.

213
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,360
Since I’m the husband, I’d like to ask you one thing.

214
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,520
Where is the sweeper?

215
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,480
Here.

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,920
You are getting worse, Tao.

217
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,520
What about fried oysters, Dad?

218
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,960
I don’t want to eat it anymore.

219
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,280
Here.

220
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Lin left this for you.

221
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
(Nonthawat Kiatpeera)

222
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
(But then suddenly,)

223
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,360
(Lin poked a pen on my back and woke me up.)

224
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,480
(But this time,)

225
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,960
(it was a pretty harsh poke.)

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,320
(MARRIAGE OF PIMNARA AND PETCH-ARUN, FEBRUARY 25th, 2007.)

227
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,600
Tong.

228
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,400
How are you doing?

229
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,353
- Hey, Tong. - Have you eaten?

230
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,360
Not yet.

231
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,880
Hey, cheers!

232
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,280
Yay!

233
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
Hey, I can’t be the only one thinking that

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,080
the groom’s name sounds so old!

235
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
It sounds like Mai’s Dad’s name, Saksit.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
How old is he? Probably 50?

237
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,200
You bastard!

238
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,680
We’re all grown up yet you’re still using parents’ names as a joke?

239
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,040
You’re always childish.

240
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,200
I was just kidding, sir Mai.

241
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,320
By the way,

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,800
we’re such losers.

243
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,600
Look,

244
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,720
Lin is getting married and having a family.

245
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,600
All of us here don’t even have a girlfriend.

246
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,320
We don’t even know what we want to do after we’ve graduated.

247
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,320
It’s the time we search for our identity.

248
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,080
Is that so?

249
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,280
I just want to laugh to death.

250
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,400
You guys were so hard chasing after Lin

251
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,760
but none of you is here groom in the end.

252
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,640
Hey, but I got to be her boyfriend.

253
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,040
We call your case taking advantage of the opportunity, Pao.

254
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,480
And you even cut my queue.

255
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,760
I even drove from Bangkok to Songkhla.

256
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,760
But I think the biggest queue cutter is the groom.

257
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,520
Who the heck is he that he can steal our Lin?

258
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
Do you have anything about it?

259
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,080
He was her senior during the internship in Ranong.

260
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,720
He often got sick and he was quite frail

261
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,320
so Lin had to take care of him and they got together.

262
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,880
They’ve been together for 4 years.

263
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,160
I thought Lin was going to continue her study abroad.

264
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,160
Yes, that’s what Lin told me at first.

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,160
But then she suddenly told me she was getting married.

266
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,960
I think he wants to marry Lin before she continues her studies.

267
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
Because it will take 6 years for Lin to finish her PhD.

268
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,600
Hey.

269
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,920
Then we have to take revenge on the groom.

270
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,840
I have a plan.

271
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,040
What’s the plan?

272
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,560
We will do rock-paper-scissors.

273
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,840
The loser will have to do a jump-kick on the groom.

274
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
You are so childish.

275
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
But I’m down.

276
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,760
You guys.

277
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,480
This is Lin’s wedding day.

278
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,840
You guys should be happy for her not trying to harm her groom.

279
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,160
Hey, Ja-Oh, you don’t understand.

280
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,480
Guys can’t stand seeing the one they love marry another man.

281
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,280
That’s right.

282
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,200
That’s right.

283
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,960
Let’s do it.

284
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,840
Let’s get it.

285
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,480
Rock-paper…

286
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,760
Hey!

287
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,000
I’ve heard that you have met a new friend

288
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,160
and you’re doing well with that person

289
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,760
I won’t blame you for loving him more than you love me

290
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,360
It hurts but I can understand

291
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,920
It’s okay to leave when you’ve fallen out of love

292
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,920
Don’t worry that I won’t be able to handle it

293
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I just want to remind you that your friend still cares

294
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,240
No matter how much it hurts, I still miss you

295
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,680
If you happen to come by this way, please send me some greetings

296
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,040
There might still be a place in between for you to put your heart at rest

297
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:29,040
Please don’t act like we’re strangers without any ties

298
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,160
If you happen to come by, I’d still be welcoming

299
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,200
The same person will remain for you to find and meet

300
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,000
and there will still be love for you

301
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,320
(Actually,)

302
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,040
(I don’t know what to say.)

303
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,080
(If you really love someone,)

304
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,440
(you will always be happy for them.)

305
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,400
(You will want that person to be with the loved one,)

306
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,760
(and want to see that person smiling happily.)

307
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,520
If you happen to come by this way, please send me some greetings

308
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,240
There might still be a place in between for you to put your heart at rest

309
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,960
Please don’t act like we’re strangers without any ties

310
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,040
If you happen to come by, I’d still be welcoming

311
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,280
If you happen to come by this way, please send me some greetings

312
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,600
There might still be a place in between for you to put your heart at rest

313
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,520
Please don’t act like we’re strangers without any ties

314
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,240
I’d still be welcoming if we were to meet again

315
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,840
Thank you so much.

316
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,200
Please get home safe.

317
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,720
Yes.

318
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,240
Hello, Mr. Groom.

319
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,360
Hello.

320
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,560
We have something to discuss.

321
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
What is it?

322
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,640
The thing is

323
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,920
we put in a lot of congratulating money.

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
Like, a lot.

325
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,520
A big amount.

326
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,720
We were wondering if we could kiss Lin.

327
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,600
If Lin is down then I have nothing against it.

328
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
Sure.

329
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,720
Hold on.

330
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,720
I’ll let you kiss Lin

331
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,360
if you’re brave enough to kiss me before you get to her.

332
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,240
Do you guys dare?

333
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
If so then go ahead.

334
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,200
Excuse me,

335
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,800
what sort of condition is this, sir?

336
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,080
Then you guys probably won’t get to kiss her.

337
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,520
I’m sorry.

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
(Back then,)

339
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,960
(I thought it was just an exercise)

340
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
(that made me feel like when I was 16.)

341
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,000
(Ton’s Exercise Book)

342
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,280
An exercise for my heart?

343
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,440
A genius like me can solve such kiddy problems.

344
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,439
You got almost everything wrong.

345
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:48,880
What?

346
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,040
You didn’t take any peak into your textbook, did you?

347
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Hey you guys,

348
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,560
I got 18.

349
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,560
I got 18.

350
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,440
I got 18.

351
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,160
I got 18.

352
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,440
A New Year’s present.

353
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,440
(Lin is my first love.)

354
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,560
(A beautiful memory.)

355
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,520
(And it would be impossible)

356
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
(for me to wipe her smile off my memory.)

357
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,560
First love is always hard

358
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,680
Hard to move on, even if time flies

359
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:43,200
It’ll never leave your mind

360
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I painted this shirt just for you.

361
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,440
It’s a limited edition.

362
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,600
So who’s your pick?

363
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,680
If Tong confesses to me,

364
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
I’d be so happy.

365
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,640
Do you want to know my answer?

366
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,840
(I hope we are each other’s first love.)

367
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,400
I can give you the answer now.

368
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,000
You’re such a baby.

369
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,600
You fool.

370
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,000
Right, I’m a fool.

371
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,840
You’re so foolish, Tong.

372
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,920
I was foolish to love you.

373
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,120
You never understand anything.

374
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,320
I’ve never understood a damn thing.

375
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
So foolish.

376
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,680
You never understand anything.

377
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,600
Lin.

378
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,200
Do you believe in a parallel universe?

379
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,880
(If there was a parallel universe)

380
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,160
(the groom in today’s wedding might have been me.)

381
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,240
(My first love is just like the questions in Lin’s exercise.)

382
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,280
(Ones I have to figure out.)

383
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,800
Try to understand me for once.

384
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
(And to that question)

385
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,120
(there is only one right answer.)

386
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,640
I’m sorry, Lin.

387
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,040
I was stupid.

388
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,200
I was childish.

389
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,280
I’m sorry.

390
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,000
We are not together, but we have our memories

391
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:26,440
They are here to stay

392
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,880
Are you doing all right?

393
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,440
That question keeps repeating in my mind

394
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,560
Just wanna know when you’re there, Without me there

395
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
I want to be on top of the other boys too!

396
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,040
Mai!

397
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,880
I’m sorry, I still can’t stop being childish.

398
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
That’s fine.

399
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,600
Lin.

400
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
I don’t want to be an awesome person anymore.

401
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,240
I want to become a writer.

402
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,520
I will write about us for you to read one day.

403
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,360
I promise.

404
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,080
I’ll be waiting.

405
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,720
Congratulations, Lin.

406
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,640
You will always be my super awesome first love.

407
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,160
Thanks, Tong.

408
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,520
(Sawankhalok)

409
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
(After that,)

410
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,960
(I started writing the story about us)

411
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,400
(ever since I got back from Lin’s wedding.)

412
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,720
(But I didn’t think that fulfilling my promise)

413
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,400
(would take such a long time that I almost turned 30.)

414
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,080
Tong!

415
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
How did you get here?

416
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,600
Are you doing alright?

417
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,999
I’m fine.

418
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
Make yourself at home, Tong.

419
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,120
Thank you.

420
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
(Once I arrived in my hometown,)

421
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,880
(I realized that despite many things that have changed,)

422
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,320
(some things still remain the same.)

423
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,400
(At J’Phon’s milk shop,)

424
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,280
(kids are still lining up.)

425
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,800
(But more trendy menus are being added to the list.)

426
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,120
J’Lee.

427
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,280
Tong!

428
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,800
Hello.

429
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,240
Have you eaten?

430
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,920
Are you hungry?

431
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,560
I haven’t eaten.

432
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,560
I was planning to eat here.

433
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,120
Sure.

434
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:32,160
Take your seat, I’ll make something for you.

435
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,760
- Take a seat.
- 	Sure.

436
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,720
Thank you.

437
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,360
I’ve missed you.

438
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,600
It’s been so long since we last met.

439
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,480
You can’t find this in Bangkok.

440
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,080
I have to come and eat it here.

441
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,640
See?

442
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,320
Then come back to eat it more frequently.

443
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,520
I haven’t seen you in a while. How have you been doing?

444
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,920
Eat up.

445
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:48,000
- Yes.
- (No matter how many places I’ve been to,)

446
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,320
(her Khao-Perb is still the best.)

447
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,080
(But sometimes, time destroys things.)

448
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,080
(When the internet becomes more prevalent in people’s life,)

449
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,240
(Uncle Haeb’s bookshop is no longer needed.)

450
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,360
(Business for sale)

451
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,399
(Uncle Khai Nephew’s Game Room)

452
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,600
(And time takes things away.)

453
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,040
(A few years ago,)

454
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,880
(Uncle Khai passed away due to a fatal disease.)

455
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,120
(But he left the game room as a legacy for his nephew.)

456
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,080
Hey! Time’s up.

457
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
Hey! Number 2. You.

458
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,360
Time’s up.

459
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,240
Would you like to extend the time?

460
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,480
Extension?

461
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,760
Would you like to play?

462
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,040
30 Baht per hour.

463
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,280
No.

464
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,280
Then why are you here?

465
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,000
These as well, Pa.

466
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,600
You can leave it right here.

467
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Hello, Uncle and Aunty.

468
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
Hey, Tong.

469
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,080
Tong.

470
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,200
I got these for you.

471
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Crispy pork wafers.

472
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,200
Thanks, Tong.

473
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,240
No problem.

474
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,320
Then what about staying for dinner, Tong?

475
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,840
Maybe next time.

476
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,000
I was going to go to Ja-Oh’s mom’s restaurant.

477
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,320
I haven’t eaten there in a while.

478
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,040
That’s okay.

479
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,800
Stop by again sometimes.

480
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,360
Sure.

481
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,600
Lin would be happy to know you’ve stopped by.

482
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,320
Goodbye.

483
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,400
Goodbye.

484
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,600
Good luck.

485
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,799
Would you like anything else?

486
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
It’s my treat.

487
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,000
That’s okay.

488
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,840
I’m full.

489
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,360
Are you here to visit your parents?

490
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
I’m here to write a novel.

491
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,200
Are you still working on your novel?

492
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,760
Ja-Oh has been telling me since a while ago that you’re writing a novel.

493
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,040
You’re right.

494
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
I don’t know when I will finish it either.

495
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,800
People say that haste makes waste, though.

496
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,600
That’s true.

497
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,160
Can I ask you something?

498
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,760
What is it?

499
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Why are you still selling in the same place?

500
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,880
You could have moved somewhere that you can sell more.

501
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,000
Ja-Oh once said something like this too.

502
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
But I asked her one question.

503
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,360
What did you ask me?

504
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,280
If we move then what will people in the neighborhood eat?

505
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
People around here trust us for their meals.

506
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,840
They’re hoping to eat something delicious at a cheap price.

507
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,400
People in this neighborhood aren’t rich people.

508
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,920
If we move, they will be sad.

509
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,880
We have been selling the food at our house for a long time

510
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,040
and we think we will keep doing that.

511
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,560
Tong!

512
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,680
Mister Sommai.

513
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,800
Hello.

514
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,720
Hi.

515
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,840
(Once I’m back at my old school,)

516
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,040
(the memories of the old days are starting to become more vivid.)

517
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,560
The school is still the same.

518
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Nothing has changed.

519
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,200
The school is the same. Even better.

520
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
But what’s changed is me.

521
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,440
I’ve gotten older.

522
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,480
What about “The Sword”?

523
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,480
The Sword?

524
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,720
It’s retired.

525
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
The kids are not as naughty.

526
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,560
What about you, Tong?

527
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,400
How are you doing?

528
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
- What do you do for a living?
- 	(What makes me feel so happy is to know that)

529
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,160
(every teacher always remembers their students.)

530
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,320
I’m a writer.

531
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,120
A writer?

532
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,200
- I’m a screenwriter and a novel writer.
- (So on that day, I get to tell Mr. Sommai about what my friends have been up to.)

533
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,480
Hello, Mom and Dad.

534
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,160
I’m Bank, Ja-Oh’s friend.

535
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,200
Today, I have something great to show you.

536
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,320
It’s this.

537
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,160
(Bank doesn’t get to be a basketball player as he has hoped.)

538
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,400
(Neither did he get to do anything related to what he studied.)

539
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080
(He ended up being a water filter salesman.)

540
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,960
(But indeed, he’s a match for the job)

541
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,680
(since he has been good at selling things ever since we were in school.)

542
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,680
(As for Mai, I can’t believe he actually became an engineer.)

543
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Come on, Mai.

544
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Can’t you try convincing your client?

545
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,360
You’re an engineer who builds houses.

546
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,880
They’d take whatever you propose.

547
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,520
After the industrial sector’s production has been greatly affected

548
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,920
(Pao didn’t study abroad as he had planned.)

549
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,760
(He works at an investment consulting company.)

550
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,400
(He likes to brag that his information is the most reliable one.)

551
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,080
Here we are.

552
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,360
Where’s everyone?

553
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,880
(It turns out that Dong was the only one who gets to study abroad.)

554
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,440
(Though he doesn’t have the brain for languages.)

555
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,440
(Yet he managed to complete his studies.)

556
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,000
Dong! My son.

557
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
(As for Ja-Oh,)

558
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,640
(she’s the owner of a famous Facebook Page posting 3-panel gag comic strips.)

559
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,960
(She didn’t get married to a rich husband and have cute babies as she had hoped)

560
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,600
(but unbelievably happens to end up with Mai.)

561
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,600
Do you know what?

562
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,120
Even though they didn’t end up the way they had dreamed of,

563
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,720
they still found their own ways.

564
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
That’s life, Tong.

565
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,040
That’s a classic line.

566
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,800
I heard it a lot from old people.

567
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,800
Tong.

568
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,560
Are you saying that I’m old?

569
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,240
But there’s one person

570
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,360
who has a dream

571
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,240
and managed to make it come true.

572
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,120
Do you remember Lin?

573
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
She’s a marine life researcher now.

574
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
She gets to be near the ocean that she loves.

575
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,440
She’s making the world a nicer place to live in.

576
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
For me,

577
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Lin is the most awesome person.

578
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,960
When will Lin be back?

579
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,720
How long has she been studying abroad?

580
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,800
For 5 years.

581
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,840
Have you guys been in contact?

582
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,400
Well

583
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,440
we haven’t met

584
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,760
ever since the funeral.

585
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,960
(Petch-arun Jitweeraphat)

586
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,600
(The reason why Lin decided to marry before she left to study)

587
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,200
(was because she wants to spend the last days with her loved ones.)

588
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
(Though it was a short time,)

589
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
(she wanted to make him as happy as possible.)

590
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,400
(Some people don’t understand why Lin did that.)

591
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,800
(But for me, what she did was so awesome.)

592
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,760
BANGKOK… IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE
-	Cheers.

593
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,640
I don’t get to see you often so we have to celebrate.

594
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,080
It’s been so hard to gather after we’ve graduated.

595
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,320
Pao has his business to do.

596
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,720
Dong went abroad, I can’t believe it.

597
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,360
By the way,

598
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
I’m a little envious of you.

599
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,800
To be honest, do you know who surprised me the most?

600
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,920
Mai the Scratcher.

601
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,840
Dude, he’s the first one to get married.

602
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,520
That’s crazy.

603
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,320
But his bride was Ja-Oh.

604
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,000
Serves him right.

605
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,680
He liked to make fun of her when they were young.

606
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,880
“Giraffe. Giraffe.”

607
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,880
Giraffes eat leaves.

608
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,560
He ends up marrying the giraffe. Done.

609
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,760
I bet he’s eating leaves all day.

610
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,920
Don’t make fun of him.

611
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,880
Oh, babe?

612
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,120
What’s wrong?

613
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,840
Are you sick, Lin?

614
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,240
Do you want to take some medicines?

615
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,360
Yeah, I have a bit of a headache.

616
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,560
Do you want to take some more meds?

617
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:29,880
Yeah.

618
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,120
I guess the party ends here.

619
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,120
Right. Sorry.

620
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,520
It’s totally okay.

621
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,400
You should go ahead, babe.

622
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,040
It’s been a while since you last seen Bank.

623
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,440
I think I’d better leave.

624
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,560
So you can get some rest too.

625
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,560
I said it’s fine.

626
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,680
I just want something to eat.

627
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,200
I should be fine after taking some meds.

628
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,159
What do you want to eat?

629
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,120
Should I go out and buy you something?

630
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,520
I want something simple.

631
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,040
What about noodles?

632
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
I don’t want to eat noodles.

633
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,560
What about steamed eggs?

634
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,160
It’s pretty easy to eat.

635
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,160
I don’t want any eggs.

636
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,600
Then what about soup with pork balls, seaweed, glass noodles, and tofu?

637
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,920
I think it’s too bland.

638
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,680
Too bland? Then what about some spicy soup?

639
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,440
Hey, Bank.

640
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,440
I’m sick.

641
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,720
I can’t handle spicy soup.

642
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,440
I just want something simple.

643
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,520
But babe,

644
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,960
you don’t want noodles, you don’t want steamed eggs,

645
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,319
you don’t like soup, and you don’t want spicy soup.

646
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,280
I don’t think that’s anything simple.

647
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,000
Then I won’t eat anymore.

648
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,960
No, no.

649
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,960
No, No.

650
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,560
No, No.

651
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,880
I won’t blame you.

652
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,640
Come here.

653
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,040
I’m sorry.

654
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,600
Lin, I’m sorry.

655
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,120
You stop.

656
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,280
Right.

657
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,200
You stop right there.

658
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,920
You’ve been like this ever since we were in school.

659
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,800
Get the heck out.

660
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,080
I’m sorry, my dude.

661
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,920
Hey.

662
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,560
Stop fooling around.

663
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,640
I’m hungry.

664
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,160
Something came to mind.

665
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,160
This one is definitely simple.

666
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,960
Good for sick people as well.

667
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,440
Here.

668
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,960
How is this?

669
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,200
Is this as simple as you want?

670
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,200
Yep.

671
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Eat a lot so you can take your meds.

672
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,680
Tong.

673
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,120
I want something simple too.

674
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,360
Make me something.

675
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,360
That’s your problem.

676
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,200
What?

677
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
It’s over there, make one for yourself.

678
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,240
I only cook for my girlfriend.

679
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,440
Right.

680
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,800
I’m not Lin.

681
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Well, you do realize that.

682
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,000
Why are you so good to me?

683
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,280
Because I want to see you smile.

684
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,480
Isn’t it delicious?

685
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,200
You should have some too.

686
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,040
I’ll feed you.

687
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,040
It’s pretty delicious, Bank.

688
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,720
Do you smell something stink in here?

689
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,560
What stinks?

690
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,760
The smell of love stinks.

691
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,200
Ow, it’s so hot.

692
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,080
Can you just give me the wind?

693
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,640
Why?

694
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,720
I don’t need the liquid part.

695
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,480
My bad.

696
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,440
I was afraid it wouldn’t get cold.

697
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,560
Do you want to eat, Mr. Handsome Bank?

698
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,320
Oh, of course.

699
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,480
Are you and your friends coming to the alumni party on the 20th?

700
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,480
Of course.

701
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,400
Me and the boys, we have an appointment.

702
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,440
And now, Bank is ready to join the alumni party.

703
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,120
Hello, Mr. Sommai Saisuwan.

704
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,720
You guys are calling me in full.

705
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,440
I want to meet her one more time.

706
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,400
I want to see her smile again.
