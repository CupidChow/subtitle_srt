4
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:18,734
Hey, hey, calm down.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,390
We still have the University Entrance Exam.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,087
Huh?

7
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:23,400
I’m so jealous of you.

8
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:26,944
You have boys trailing behind you from the first day until the graduation day.

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,300
So which one are you choosing?

10
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,618
(While everyone’s waiting for their university entrance result,)

11
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:35,769
(we decided to go on a trip to the beach together.)

12
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:40,669
(We meant to make this trip the most fun memories of our school days)

13
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,172
(before we part ways to grow in our own separate paths.)

14
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:00,502
Look at them.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,332
They’re fooling around like a child.

16
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:03,831
You’re right.

17
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,191
They’re so childish.

18
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:05,752
Look.

19
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:12,876
By the way.

20
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,246
You don’t like childish boys, right?

21
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:17,308
Yeah.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,134
Then, who do you think is the most childish one in our group?

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,196
Probably Tong?

24
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,470
Look!

25
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,240
Tong, be careful!

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,097
Don’t go too far.

27
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:10,962
A NEW JOURNEY

28
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,839
I can’t believe we’ve graduated.

29
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:24,190
Have you guys ever thought about what you want to do when you grow up?

30
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:30,528
I want to be an engineer who’s also the best magician in the country.

31
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,950
So I can ask for Lin’s hand.

32
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,930
Who would want to marry Mai the Scratcher?

33
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,051
Ja-Oh!

34
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:48,617
I want to win a scholarship and continue my studies in the US.

35
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:52,121
I want to study abroad too.

36
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:54,292
Going to the US?

37
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,038
Going Abroad?

38
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,979
You’d better start by getting your A-Z right.

39
00:03:57,548 --> 00:03:58,612
Aren’t you being too harsh, Bank?

40
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:00,425
My dream

41
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:03,102
is to become a professional basketball player.

42
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:06,665
Keep going until I get to the NBA.

43
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:07,702
Bank.

44
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:08,241
Huh?

45
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:09,520
Yours is even harder than Dong’s.

46
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,041
What about you, Ja-Oh?

47
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,604
Hmm.

48
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:24,728
I want to be an ordinary housewife to a rich husband.

49
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:26,369
That’s enough.

50
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,260
So I can draw to my heart’s content.

51
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,078
That seems relaxing.

52
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:36,559
What about you, Lin?

53
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,284
I want to be a marine scientist

54
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,001
because I love the ocean.

55
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:47,715
I want the marine animals to stay with us for a long time.

56
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:54,561
What about you, Tong?

57
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:55,984
What do you want to do when you grow up?

58
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:06,569
I want to be an awesome person.

59
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:08,853
Why would you want to become an awesome person?

60
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:16,260
Because someone awesome makes the world a better place to live.

61
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,337
Wave, wave, wave, wave.

62
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:45,040
Wave, wave, wave, wave.

63
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,153
Damn it.

64
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,490
Mai, are you asking for it?

65
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:09,510
Why are you laughing?

66
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,285
Why so serious?

67
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:13,505
You’re just grilling some porkballs.

68
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,391
I don’t want it to get burned.

69
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:24,760
Sometimes if you let it get burned, you’ll get another taste.

70
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:29,173
Leave it to char a little, you’ll get a little taste of life.

71
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:30,841
That’s how life is.

72
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,770
But if you leave them for too long, they’re inedible.

73
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:36,299
You have to get it just right.

74
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,862
Sounds complicated.

75
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:48,007
There’s actually nothing complicated.

76
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,209
You just have to put your best effort into doing it.

77
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:56,868
When you have the chance to choose what you want to do,

78
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,284
then you should do your best.

79
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:02,991
That’s what an adult’s life is like.

80
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,655
We’re still on the subject of porkballs, right?

81
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:14,866
Hey, what are you guys doing?

82
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:18,793
- Mai, you bastard.
- Lin!

83
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:22,607
These porkballs only have flour in them but they’re so delicious.

84
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:28,802
Hey, are the porkballs delicious because the one cooking them is cute?

85
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,881
Are you talking about me?

86
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,379
You are nasty.

87
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,000
Here.

88
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,075
That’s enough.

89
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:39,607
Hey!

90
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,195
Where are you going, Tong?

91
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:47,555
Leave me alone.

92
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:50,950
Tong, don’t eat while playing.

93
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,426
Lin, did you even eat?

94
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,519
It’s fine, go ahead.

95
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,215
Do you want some more?

96
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:04,068
This one’s not burnt either.

97
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,190
Here.

98
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,934
Let’s get into the tent.

99
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:15,220
Pao.

100
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,051
What are you doing here by yourself?

101
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:26,733
Lin doesn’t like me.

102
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:33,993
How do you know?

103
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:36,618
Have you confessed to her?

104
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:39,348
No,

105
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,330
I could just feel it.

106
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:48,379
That’s good.

107
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,548
At least you can still be friends with her.

108
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
But I think she likes you.

109
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,170
Though, you’re not her type.

110
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:04,749
You should grow up.

111
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,256
Otherwise, you’re going to break Lin’s heart.

112
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,817
Yay!

113
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,497
Tong made it!

114
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:45,990
Tong mated?

115
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:48,040
Tong made it into university.

116
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:49,863
Hello?

117
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,437
Lin.

118
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,905
[Closed for today to check the university entrance exam results.]

119
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,542
Did I really make it?

120
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:48,843
Here it is.

121
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,804
Nontawat Kiatpeera.

122
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,412
You made it!

123
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:56,596
He made it!

124
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:59,449
You made it, Tong!

125
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,009
Yay!

126
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,782
Tong made it into university.

127
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:06,000
He’s going to be studying in Bangkok!

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,439
Toey!

129
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,424
Toey! Did you hear me?

130
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:12,015
Tong made it!

131
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:13,759
Tong mated?

132
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:16,902
Tong made it into university.

133
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,774
Tong made it into university?

134
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,677
That means he doesn’t have to study at night anymore?

135
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:22,403
Yes.

136
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:24,921
I’m so glad.

137
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:27,465
Toey, you’re being loud again.

138
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,309
Well, I’m glad.

139
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,701
He doesn’t have to study at night so I can sleep.

140
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:34,563
I’m so happy.

141
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:37,071
(I surprisingly made it into the faculty of communication arts.)

142
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:41,936
(I was determined to make a cool action movie, just like Panna Rittikrai’s, my hero.)

143
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:48,885
Hello.

144
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:51,514
Lin?

145
00:12:58,213 --> 00:12:58,995
Tong.

146
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,230
Where are you going?

147
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,049
I’ll be right back, Mom.

148
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:09,443
Nontawat Kiatpeera.

149
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:11,862
Number 52.

150
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:14,715
5 - 2 - 7.

151
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:22,321
Hello.

152
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:24,798
Darunee, am I too late?

153
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,337
No, you’re not. What’s your bet?

154
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:27,598
7.

155
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,586
Where did you get the number?

156
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,101
Tong made it into university.

157
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:33,942
Did Dong make it?

158
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,007
I have no idea.

159
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,039
By the way, if you’re going to make a bet now,

160
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,060
I’m paying only half the winning prize.

161
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,645
What?

162
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:42,643
Only a half?

163
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,390
Damn it.

164
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,797
Mama!

165
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,546
Ma!

166
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:51,860
I made it, Ma!

167
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,278
I made it.

168
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:54,692
What did you do, meatball?

169
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:55,894
Don’t tell me it’s…

170
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:56,729
That’s right.

171
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:57,751
That’s right, Ma!

172
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,790
You’ve managed to do 10 push-ups?

173
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:01,754
That’s not it, Ma!

174
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,809
I made it into university, Ma.

175
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,791
Everyone, I made it to university.

176
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:13,889
To celebrate my Meatball getting into university,

177
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,198
it’s on the house for everyone today.

178
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:17,551
You can have as many as you want, it’s on me.

179
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:18,395
Eat up!

180
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,266
Yay!

181
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:34,514
My daughter made it to university.

182
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:35,978
I made it to university, Mom.

183
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:36,478
Really?

184
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:37,352
I made it!

185
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:38,665
We have to celebrate.

186
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:40,100
I’ll take you out for some celebration.

187
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:41,658
Honey.

188
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,851
You have to be careful.

189
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:46,893
Come on.

190
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:48,548
I’m fine.

191
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,819
My daughter made it to university, we have to celebrate.

192
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:53,685
Is that right?

193
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,525
That’s right, Dad.

194
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:57,074
We’d better celebrate for 7 days and 7 nights straight.

195
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:57,987
Great!

196
00:14:57,987 --> 00:14:59,002
That’s not possible.

197
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,476
Because you have to go return the blessing with me first.

198
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:03,877
I asked for a blessing for you to get into the university.

199
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:08,047
If you make it, you have to stay at the temple for 7 days and 7 nights.

200
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,141
Oh.

201
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,470
So sacred.

202
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:14,925
Amen.

203
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,416
She finally made it.

204
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:25,777
It sure runs in the blood.

205
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:27,143
Everyone in the family is so smart.

206
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:34,382
I finally get to send all of my kids to university.

207
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:37,422
Your Grandma can finally rest in peace.

208
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:43,694
You’re talking rubbish.

209
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:44,590
Right,

210
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:47,108
I have to let your siblings know.

211
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:50,879
And also your uncles and aunties.

212
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:54,204
I don’t think you have to tell everyone, Ma.

213
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,828
Oh, your other aunty-in-law too, we haven’t met in a while.

214
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,486
My sister too.

215
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:00,662
Your sister too? Alright.

216
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:02,303
Did I do well, Grandma?

217
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:04,657
You are the best.

218
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,611
Good that I got your genetics.

219
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:09,273
If I had Dad’s, I would have been dumb.

220
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:16,213
Here, dumb, huh?

221
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:17,163
There you go.

222
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:17,824
Hey!

223
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:19,382
Hey! Be quiet.

224
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:24,869
It itches again

225
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,360
It’s itchy.

226
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,351
Here, get the stuff for Dao’s house and have it delivered.

227
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:37,615
Aren’t you going to your friends today?

228
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,073
No, I’m too lazy to.

229
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:40,971
Is that so?

230
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:44,755
Then should we have a late-night movie tonight, son?

231
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:47,649
Shall we do it in the afternoon?

232
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:48,881
You got it.

233
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,632
You guys.

234
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,139
It’s broad daylight.

235
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:54,448
Don’t you have any thoughts about helping me with work?

236
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:56,206
Do you want to join us?

237
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,223
We can have a separate room.

238
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:01,208
When’s your result coming out?

239
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:03,454
What result, Mom?

240
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:05,653
Well, your university entrance exam’s result.

241
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:06,634
Don’t tell me you forgot.

242
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,149
Right,

243
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:10,358
when was that?

244
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:11,862
I knew it.

245
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:12,698
You forgot, didn’t you?

246
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:17,209
Why are you looking at me?

247
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:18,173
I’m not the one going to school.

248
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:19,570
My, you guys.

249
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,672
What the heck?

250
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:26,295
Dad, who’s Mom mad at?

251
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:27,372
I have no idea.

252
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:28,141
Oh?

253
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:29,476
How can I know if you don’t?

254
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:30,862
How can I know?

255
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:31,904
She’s not mad at me.

256
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:32,636
She’s mad at you.

257
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,850
How can I know what she’s mad about?

258
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:35,036
Why’s she mad at me, then?

259
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:36,615
I don’t know.

260
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,495
If you don’t know then how can I know?

261
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,277
It’s not about father or son.

262
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,782
But I don’t know and you have to know because she’s mad at you.

263
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:43,520
How can I know?

264
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,854
If you don’t know then how can I know?

265
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,816
Well, I don’t know.

266
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,655
If you don’t know then how can I know?

267
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:51,231
How then hell would I know?

268
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,315
I’m getting a headache the more I talk to you.

269
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,570
Honey, wait for me.

270
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:57,407
Dad, let me go with you.

271
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:58,247
Don’t!

272
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,659
You stay outside.

273
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:02,840
I’ve always concentrated on my study, Tong.

274
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:07,957
I’ve been studying and studying all day every day.

275
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:14,671
Why don’t I get to study in the faculty I wanted to?

276
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,280
I didn’t make it, Tong.

277
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:31,739
I don’t get to study marine science at Kasetsart University.

278
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,424
But…

279
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:47,716
at least you get to be close to what you love.

280
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:53,142
Also, Songkhla is closer to the ocean than Bangkok.

281
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,613
Isn’t that a good thing?

282
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:04,835
I’ve put all my efforts into it all this time.

283
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,434
You know that too, right?

284
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,687
I put so much effort into studying.

285
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,383
I’ve been trying so hard throughout these 12 years.

286
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,887
In the end, I just failed.

287
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:16,682
Lin.

288
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,815
I have something to tell you.

289
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:24,531
The thing is…

290
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:28,890
Can you not say you like me now?

291
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:05,264
Why?

292
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:08,533
Why?

293
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:46,363
You said you wanted to protect marine lives like us, right?

294
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:49,001
We think what you want to do is great.

295
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:50,140
Keep it up, Lin.

296
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:51,862
Make the world a nicer place to live.

297
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:48,802
Tong! Tong!

298
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,961
Halt!

299
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,344
Are you guys heading to a Temple Fair?

300
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,642
I’m going to cheer my girlfriend up.

301
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:00,852
You? Have a girlfriend?

302
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:02,218
I don’t buy that.

303
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:03,372
- I’m heading off!
- I don’t buy that.

304
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:05,628
I’m heading off.

305
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:09,659
Let’s go!

306
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:14,142
Honey, the bee wax is almost out.

307
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:15,947
Then please refill it, honey.

308
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:16,449
Sure.

309
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:22,634
Lin.

310
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,629
You can take a rest, you don’t have to help us out.

311
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,464
It’s alright, I can do it.

312
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:36,547
Don’t be sad.

313
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,813
It's not like you didn't make it into university at all.

314
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:45,190
You still get to study what you want to study.

315
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,390
I understand, Pa.

316
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:52,689
But I’m still disappointed.

317
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:12,926
Lin.

318
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:14,332
Lin.

319
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,026
Look behind you.

320
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:17,543
Over there.

321
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,278
You guys.

322
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:30,153
Lin.

323
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,306
You said you wanted to protect marine lives like us, right?

324
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:36,066
We think what you want to do is great.

325
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:37,330
Don’t be sad.

326
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:38,685
Keep it up, Lin.

327
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,230
Make the world a nicer place to live.

328
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:41,692
That’s right.

329
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:44,908
Keep on protecting the ocean and the marine life, Lin.

330
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:47,598
It doesn’t matter where you are.

331
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:49,369
You can do it wherever.

332
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:52,189
Only you can define your worth,

333
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:53,868
not by where you are.

334
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:55,291
Damn.

335
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,703
That’s the first time Dong says anything logical.

336
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:07,163
Lin, you are an awesome person for us no matter what.

337
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,328
That’s right.

338
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:14,565
Thank you, guys.

339
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:21,027
Tong’s so funny.

340
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:27,676
In return for you protecting the marine lives like us all this time,

341
00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:29,812
we would like to dedicate this song to you.

Go, go.

344
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:38,310
Are you alright?

345
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,177
Got it.

346
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:40,870
Hurry up.

347
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:44,719
Ready, guys?

348
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:45,395

354
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:41,869
Ma.

355
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,113
I’m just off to study.

356
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,748
I’m just going away to study, I’m not going anywhere.

357
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:00,534
I’ll be back when I’ve finished my study.

358
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:01,581
It’s not going to be long.

359

My Meatball.

360
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,062
It’s alright, Ma.

361
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:09,272
I won’t be away for long.

362
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:09,885
I will definitely miss you.

363
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:12,948
Ma!

364
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,388
That’s enough, I will miss my train.

365
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:16,792
I’ve been raising you for so long

366
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,427
ever since you don't know how to wipe your own butt.

367
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:19,482
Ma!

368
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:21,640
What are you saying, that’s embarrassing.

369
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,049
Don’t forget to call me when you’ve arrived.

370
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,309
You must send me a letter as well.

371
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:27,909
Yes.

372
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:29,109
Postcards too.

373
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,314
Telegrams too.

374
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:32,113
That’s too much, Ma.

375
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:35,393
Ma.

376
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:36,767
Ow!

377
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:43,960
Travel in peace, Meatball.

378
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,185
Ow.

379
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:51,336
I’m sorry that I can’t take you to Bangkok with me, Roger.

380
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:55,471
He’s not even saying goodbye to his parents.

381
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,591
- Take good care of yourself in the meantime.
- I told you not to buy it for him.

382
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:02,761
He made it into the university so I bought it for him.

383
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:04,992
Mom. Dad.

384
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:13,268
When you send Roger to Bangkok, please send it properly.

385
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:14,755
Take good care of it.

386
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:16,649
Please don’t let there be any scratches, not even a little bit.

387
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:19,261
Oh, my baby. I’m not leaving.

388
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:20,314
There, there.

389
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:22,302
Don’t miss me.

390
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:27,012
Do I look good yet, Pa?

391
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,379
You’re the most handsome one.

392
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:30,386
You’re all set.

393
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:31,844
Mai, here you go.

394
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:33,799
Oh?

395
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,988
My, why is it so heavy?

396
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,785
Ma, I'm going away to university

397
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:40,927
not settling into somewhere new.

398
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:41,644
Right.

399
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:43,951
Oh, hold on, hold on.

400
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:45,167
I forgot Grandpa’s picture.

401
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:48,843
You’ll need his picture for good blessings.

402
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:49,829
Grandpa’s picture as well?

403
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:50,647
Yeah!

404
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,898
Bring the one that he looks handsome.

405
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:55,628
Alright!

406
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:56,274
Ma!

407
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:59,287
Not only handsome but bring one that’s small in size, Ma.

408
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:00,270
A small one?

409
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:00,776
A small one.

410
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,295
To put in my pocket and stuff.

411
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,196
Fine, fine.

412
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:05,868
It’s no good when it’s too big, Pa.

413
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:15,468
Are you really going to go by yourself?

414
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:17,922
We can take you there.

415
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:20,037
It’s alright, Mom.

416
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:22,041
I’m all grown up now.

417
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:25,434
She’s going to be fine, honey.

418
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,548
She’s just going to be in Chiangmai, not so far away.

419
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:29,907
That’s right, I’m right around the corner.

420
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,889
You should worry about Dad.

421
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:33,628
Take good care of each other.

422
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,067
You don’t have to worry about me.

423
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:38,471
I’m much healthier than before.

424
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,572
I want to see you graduate.

425
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:50,597
Take good care of yourself.

426
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:04,399
There,

427
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,982
why are you crying?

428
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:09,643
We’ll be fine.

429
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:14,914
I’ll quickly finish my study and get back to take care of you guys.

430
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,963
Live your own life.

431
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,798
Live your life happily.

432
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:24,648
Do what you love.

433
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:28,421
Call us if you miss us.

434
00:32:28,957 --> 00:32:30,225
Or perhaps, visit us.

435
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,735
Don’t worry about Mom and Dad.

436
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:36,749
Live your life to the fullest.

437
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:49,000
May the odd be ever in your favor.

438
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:51,878
Take care of yourself.

439
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:10,821
Sis.

440
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,444
What is it?

441
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,208
I’ll just leave to study for a little while.

442
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,149
I’ll be back in a heartbeat.

443
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,438
Once you've arrived in Hat Yai,

444
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:22,988
don’t forget to send me some fried chicken.

445
00:33:23,623 --> 00:33:24,452
Hey.

446
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:26,755
You sure put food first.

447
00:33:27,746 --> 00:33:28,658
Alright.

448
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:31,193
But in return, you have to study hard.

449
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,508
Alright?

450
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:34,233
I got it.

451
00:33:35,962 --> 00:33:37,262
Hey there.

452
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:38,967
Have you finished packing up, Lin?

453
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,037
Yes, Ma.

454
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:42,341
Come, let me help you.

455
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:47,468
Don't overdo yourself while you're there.

456
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:51,001
Don’t skip your meals and get lots of rest.

457
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:52,335
Alright, Ma.

458
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:57,626
Here, take some medicine with you.

459
00:33:58,151 --> 00:34:00,151
Don’t forget to take some medicine when you’re sick.

460
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,901
Alright, Pa.

461
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,584
And don't overdo yourself, just like your Ma said.

462
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,580
I got it.

463
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,170
Thank you.

464
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:11,490
I will take good care of myself

465
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,884
and have my meals on time.

466
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:16,076
You don’t have to worry about me, Pa, Ma.

467
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:17,244
Yes.

468
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:20,574
Give me a hug.

469
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,268
Come in here.

470
00:34:25,424 --> 00:34:26,496
Let me join in the hug too.

471
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,282
You want to join the hug too?

472
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:29,632
You’ll have to stay here.

473
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,093
Don’t forget the fried chicken, Sis.

474
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:33,268
Alright.

475
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:34,943
With lots of fried red onion, okay?

476
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,502
Look at her, Ma.

477
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,778
You want lots of fried onion?

478
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:39,126
Then I’ll let you have only fried onion and not the chicken.

479
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:39,717
Sounds good.

480
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,531
No.

481
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:42,717
No?

482
00:34:42,718 --> 00:34:46,650
(Finally, it’s time for us to embark on the journey.)

483
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:15,696
(Though interesting things are awaiting ahead of us,)

484
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,516
(I still miss the old things here.)

485
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:24,830
[Tong’s Excercise book.]

486
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:38,694
Tong.

487
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:40,374
- Yes, Mom?
- Hurry up.

488
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:41,817
You’ll miss your train.

489
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,580
I’m almost done. I won’t miss my train.

490
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:50,664
Tong.

491
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:53,638
When you live in Bangkok

492
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:57,064
you have to wear underwear, you got that?

493
00:36:58,614 --> 00:36:59,181
Yes.

494
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:01,530
Go, your Dad’s waiting.

495
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,282
Let’s go.

496
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:14,693
Don’t get a girlfriend yet.

497
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:17,283
Don’t let anyone touch your crotch.

498
00:37:17,283 --> 00:37:18,476
I know that.

499
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:20,487
I’ll miss you.

500
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:22,355
Visit me sometimes.

501
00:37:22,355 --> 00:37:23,118
I got that.

502
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:30,118
Let’s retake the university entrance exam, friends.

503
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:31,322
Dong! What are you doing here?

504
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:33,373
It’s called “entrance”.

505
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:34,748
Entranth.

506
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:37,040
Entrance.

507
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,882
Entran.

508
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:38,789
Entrance.

509
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,589
Not ‘trann’.

510
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:40,315
Entrance.

511
00:37:56,752 --> 00:38:01,693
(That year, each of us has to separate and pursue our journeys.)

512
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:05,726
(Pao made it into Business Administration at Chiangmai.)

513
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:07,838
(One can say he's a step closer to his dream of studying abroad.)

514
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,348
2 tickets to Chiangmai, please.
(One can say he's a step closer to his dream of studying abroad.)

515
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,212
(Ja-Oh made it into the faculty of fine arts.)

516
00:38:17,774 --> 00:38:20,346
(She’d probably get to draw all day long just as she wanted.)

517
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,197
(Mai the Scratcher made it into the faculty of engineering.)

518
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:35,267
(It seems he’s getting to be an engineer just as he wished.)

519
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:44,513
[Lin]
(Bank made it into the faculty of political science)

520
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:46,632
(which he has never thought of studying)

521
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,971
(but he doesn’t seem bothered.)

522
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:58,173
Excuse me.

523
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,977
Are you traveling alone?

524
00:39:03,814 --> 00:39:06,772
Let’s retake the university entrance exam, friends.
[Let’s retake the entant exam.]

525
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,112
Let’s retake the exam! Yay!
(Oh, I almost forgot about Boner Dong.)

526
00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:13,747
Let’s retake the exam.
(He’s the only one who didn’t make it into any university.)

527
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:16,220
(So he decided to wait and retake the exam next year.)

528
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:17,402
Friends!

529
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:18,616
Friends!

530
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,423
Dong!

531
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,273
What are you doing here?

532
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:25,348
I’m inviting friends to retake the entrance exam.

533
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:26,533
Let me see what the sign says.

534
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:28,454
‘Entant’.

535
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:30,997
Who wrote that for you?

536
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,134
I wrote it myself.

537
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:32,878
You wrote it yourself?

538
00:39:33,368 --> 00:39:35,030
It’s called “entrance”.

539
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:36,553
Entranth.

540
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:38,656
Entrance.

541
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:39,529
Entran.

542
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:40,726
Entrance.

543
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:41,511
Not ‘trann’.

544
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:42,291
Entrance.

545
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:43,319
Entranth.

546
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:45,727
My!

547
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:47,161
Sir, what about my friends?

548
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:48,942
They’re all going to university.

549
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:50,862
They’re all going to university?

550
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,728
They’re all gone.

551
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,012
You’re not my student.

552
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:56,557
You’re really something, Dong.

553
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:15,686
[Sawankhalok]

554
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:27,477
Lin.

555
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:30,530
Tong.

556
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,995
Have you been here for long?

557
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:46,999
A little while.

558
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,146
This is for you.

559
00:41:11,353 --> 00:41:11,991
What’s this?

560
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,363
A shirt I especially painted for you.

561
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,526
This one’s a limited edition.

562
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:32,399
Thanks.

563
00:41:59,130 --> 00:41:59,707
Lin.

564
00:42:02,158 --> 00:42:02,746
Yeah?

565
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,757
Can you promise me one thing?

566
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,335
What is it?

567
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:18,762
When you are studying there

568
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,549
don’t fall in love with someone else.

569
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:32,089
You’re crazy.

570
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:33,153
What are you saying?

571
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:34,583
Lin,

572
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,513
I’m not joking.

573
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:48,913
Okay.

574
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:21,807
I’m leaving.

575
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:25,172
Okay.

576
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:34,219
(Though Lin didn't make it into the faculty of Marine Science as she'd hoped,)

577
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:37,477
(she gets to study natural resources in Songkhla.)

578
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:41,460
(I believe that she would be so happy)

579
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,418
(to be living near the sea that she loves.)

580
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,092
I’m taking you out...

581
00:44:26,092 --> 00:44:27,630
- This is for you, Lin.
- ...for Loy Krathong together,

582
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:29,512
just the two of us.

583
00:44:29,512 --> 00:44:30,273
[Let’s go out for Loy Krathong]

584
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,478
I like your hair like this.

585
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:36,094
That’s all you that you like?

586
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:39,895
And I like this too.

587
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:45,128
The person you like might be the person who’s only in your imagination.

588
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:46,969
I think I’m well aware of my own feelings.

589
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:48,856
I like everything that you are.

590
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:51,541
Do you like me that much?
