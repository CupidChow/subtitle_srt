Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:16,822
Let’s make a bet.

5
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:20,388
If you get the highest score on the final exam this time,

6
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:21,775
you can do anything to me.

7
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,457
But if I get the highest score,

8
00:00:23,787 --> 00:00:25,170
you have to cut your hair into a bob.

9
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:26,970
I think you look cute in this hair.

10
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:32,589
Tong, your hair!

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,246
Try looking at the shelf above.

12
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,891
Can you find it, Miss On?

13
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:57,909
No.

14
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:04,337
Pimnara.

15
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:09,356
Are you sure you put it here?

16
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:12,071
I’m positive I left it here.

17
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,316
That’s right. I’m her witness.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,894
We saw it here just yesterday.

19
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:19,894
But it’s gone.

20
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:21,953
That was a lot of money.

21
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:24,005
Why are you so careless?

22
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:25,997
I apologize.

23
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:30,476
Who else in the class knows that you left the money here?

24
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:33,807
Everyone knows.

25
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:39,277
Then the one who took the money

26
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,877
must be someone from the class.

27
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:46,452
Follow me.

28
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,481
GRADUATION

29
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:04,879
How can the class’s money disappear?

30
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,444
Someone must have taken it.

31
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:11,810
Whoever took the money

32
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:13,884
had better turn themselves in right now.

33
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,014
Otherwise, everyone in the class

34
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,610
shall be punished.

35
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,379
I’m giving you the chance.

36
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,707
Does anyone feel the urge to own up to their action?

37
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:32,967
If no one’s going to own up to it, that’s fine.

38
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:38,142
Everyone, bring out a piece of paper and a pen

39
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:43,880
then write down 3 names of the person you suspect to be the thief.

40
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,168
The one whose name was mentioned most often

41
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,966
will have to give their bag up for me to search.

42
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:50,414
Sir.

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,380
What right have you to suspect us?

44
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,309
I’m your homeroom teacher, why can’t I suspect you guys?

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Especially when you’re our homeroom teacher,

46
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:03,501
don’t you have to trust your students?

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,084
Do you want to get punished so badly, Tong?

48
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:09,675
That’s because you’re blaming the students.

49
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,364
How dare you guys talk to me like that?

50
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:16,265
I’m the grown-up, you are just kids.

51
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:17,381
You’re not supposed to address me like that.

52
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,198
Why does it have to be that adults are always right?

53
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:21,006
Do kids have to be on the wrong all the time?

54
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:22,633
Tong.

55
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:24,188
You’re the worst one.

56
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:28,319
You’re the one I’m most suspicious of among all the people in this class.

57
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,200
Excuse me, but you have no right to do this.

58
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:34,934
Why?

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,627
What don’t I have the right to?

60
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,560
You don’t have the right to make us write and vote.

61
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:44,163
You don’t have the right to make us suspect other students in the class.

62
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:47,745
Even though the money is gone, we can collect it again.

63
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,000
That’s true.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,768
We can gather up the money again.

65
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:53,894
Pimnara.

66
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:58,481
You are the class’ president yet you dare go against my command?

67
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:00,188
Yes.

68
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,617
As a class president,

69
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:05,323
I’m protecting my fellow classmates.

70
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,203
We’re not thieves, sir.

71
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,166
That’s right, we’re not thieves, sir.

72
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:19,546
You can’t blame us like this.

73
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:21,494
That’s right.

74
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,519
You don’t have the right to do this to us.

75
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,680
We’re not accepting this.

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,344
Hey!

77
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,664
You guys are beyond yourselves.

78
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,654
How dare you raise your voice with a grown-up.

79
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:32,318
But the grown-up is the one who’s blaming the kids.

80
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:50,666
Tong.

81
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:54,704
Everyone, I command you to sit down, right now.

82
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:56,221
No.

83
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:11,724
I told you to sit down.

84
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,610
Sit down, this is a command.

85
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,121
Stop staring at me already.

86
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:16,551
If my parents saw this, I would be scolded.

87
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,000
There’s nothing wrong with it.

88
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,086
I think you’re cool.

89
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,581
Don’t be sad, Lin.

90
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,262
I think you’re a very cool class present.

91
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:35,317
Yes, getting punished for protecting your classmates is so awesome, Lin.

92
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,214
Lin.

93
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,792
You’re the best class president.

94
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:44,780
Ever since I’ve known you since middle school

95
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:48,178
,I’ve just realized now that you’re this awesome.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,496
you’re so damn cool.

97
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:56,378
You’re cool even when you’re crying.

98
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:59,823
How is it cool?

99
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,339
You’re so damn cool.

100
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,686
No, I’m not.

101
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,822
You’re really cool, Lin

102
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,694
(I don’t think life is like taking tests.)

103
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,578
(We might not find the right answer.)

104
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,280
You’re so awesome, Lin.

105
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:29,054
(Back then, no one knows who took the money.)

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,113
(But I don’t care.)

107
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,172
(Because the only thing I could remember on that day,)

108
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,890
(was Lin’s courage)(

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,517
that was stamped onto my mind.)

110
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:47,994
FINAL EXAM’S DAY.

111
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,046
Done with the exams!

112
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,458
Finally done with the 12th grade!

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,648
No more studying!

114
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:04,313
Yay!

115
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:05,606
Hey, hey, calm down.

116
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,193
We still have the University Entrance Exam.

117
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,069
Huh?

118
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:08,863
Huh?

119
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:09,774
What are you ‘huh’ing for?

120
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:10,640
You could fail to get into university.

121
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:12,243
He’s right.

122
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:13,860
Help me gather up these notes.

123
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,000
Why the heck did you throw it?

124
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:22,958
You guys do act like a child from primary to graduating high school.

125
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:27,798
But there’s someone who behaves like a giraffe

126
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:29,466
from kindergarten to graduating high school.

127
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:41,142
Help!

128
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:42,616
Did you ask for help?

129
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:44,405
How was it?

130
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:45,396
Could you figure the questions out?

131
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,654
I did the exercises you gave me

132
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,116
so I was able to solve all the questions.

133
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,313
Really? Great job.

134
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,272
Hey, don’t bully your friend.

135
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:02,600
Don’t.

136
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,097
Ja-Oh.

137
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,788
I’m going down the stairs~

138
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:14,738
6 years ago

139
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,954
when we were just kids,

140
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,593
we get to take different classes,

141
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,360
learn about the life,

142
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,291
learn about friendship from friends,

143
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,659
learn about mistakes,

144
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:36,627
and learn to dream.

145
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:40,440
But today,

146
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:45,705
the kids from that day are about to leave the school

147
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,133
as an adult.

148
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:57,304
Until that day, the day when our dreams come true,

149
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:02,523
the day we get to become the adults we dreamed of,

150
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:10,284
When I think of not being able to see you guys again,

151
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,548
it makes my heart sink.

152
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:30,479
I hope everyone will keep the time and days in this school

153
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:33,926
in their memory forever.

154
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,247
Ready?

155
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:48,899
1…2…3…

156
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,161
Let’s go!

157
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,094
1…2…3…

158
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,384
Hooray!

159
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,266
(Back then, I didn’t understand why people were crying.)

160
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,531
(We’re just graduating.)

161
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,283
(It’s not like anyone’s dying.)

162
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:28,817
(But when I grow up,)

163
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,361
(I come to understand those tears.)

164
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,786
Good luck, everyone.

165
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:50,000
I hope we’ll get to meet again one day.

166
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:04,348
(On that day, we didn’t cry because we were afraid we’d never meet again.)

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,341
(We cried because we knew,)

168
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,626
(we would never meet again with the same feeling.)

169
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:37,600
I’m so jealous of you.

170
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,742
You have boys trailing behind you from the first day until the graduation day.

171
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:45,942
There’s nothing to be jealous of.

172
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,070
Is that so?

173
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,133
So which one are you choosing?

174
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,778
Tell me.

175
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:52,880
I won’t tell anyone.

176
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:56,637
Fine.

177
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,113
I knew it.

178
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:11,290
Ja-Oh!

179
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:29,431
She’s good with her words.

180
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,413
Ja-Oh’s not only good at talking,

181
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,240
she’s also a s—

182
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:35,408
sweet talker.

183
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:58,341
Here you go.

184
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,873
No change, right?

185
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:09,691
Tong!

186
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,415
Hmm?

187
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:12,965
Where did your dad go?

188
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,569
He’s your husband, why are you asking the son?

189
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:16,810
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

190
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,572
Calm down.

191
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:19,455
I’m just kidding.

192
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:20,722
Where are you going?

193
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,400
Your university entrance exams are coming up.

194
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,609
Aren’t you going to study?

195
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,026
I’m heading to a study session.

196
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:35,712
You’re proud, aren’t you?

197
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,728
That your son is so studious?

198
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,678
Go, go.

199
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,190
Just go wherever you want.

200
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,256
Mom.

201
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:41,756
Hmm?

202
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:42,428
Come here for a second.

203
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:43,834
Come here.

204
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:46,266
I’m off now!

205
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,124
Teach your dad to do something like this too.

206
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:56,173
Buy me a new auto bike, Mom.

207
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
I barely have enough to eat,

208
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,983
yet you want me to buy you a new auto bike?

209
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:02,868
You bastard.

210
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,389
(After graduating from the 12th Grade,)

211
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
(we have to get ready for the entrance exam.)

212
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:17,870
(Everyone says that it’s the exam that decides your future)

213
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:23,153
(and the person you will grow up to become from now on.)

214
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:31,512
It’s as tasty as usual.

215
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,309
Thank you.

216
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:33,943
Please stop by again.

217
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,100
Ja-Oh, you don’t have to help out here.

218
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,538
Go and study for your exam.

219
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:49,562
It’s alright, Mom.

220
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,183
I can study later.

221
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:56,244
Are you alright, Dad?

222
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,247
Have you taken your medicine?

223
00:16:59,136 --> 00:16:59,984
I have, of course.

224
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,332
I’m fine.

225
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,909
Just a little cough.

226
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,828
You should take good care of yourself.

227
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:10,864
What would you do when I go to university and can’t look after you anymore?

228
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:16,265
Don’t worry about me, just worry about yourself.

229
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:19,390
Have you decided what you want to study?

230
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,986
I can study anything.

231
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,726
As long as I can get a high salary after graduating.

232
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,709
Why are you thinking that way?

233
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:34,102
Because if I’m rich, you guys would be able to live well.

234
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:38,582
Should I study something to become the state’s officer?

235
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,548
People say that the benefit is good, Dad.

236
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,313
Ja-Oh,

237
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:48,033
you don’t have to study for our sake.

238
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:51,284
Just study whatever you want.

239
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:53,609
It’s your life.

240
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:56,174
It’s your dream.

241
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:58,331
Not ours.

242
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,935
Go ahead and study.

243
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,677
We’ve got it covered here.

244
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,247
Ja-Oh!

245
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:18,149
Mai!

246
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,803
What are you doing here?

247
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:21,452
I’m taking my parents to have a meal here.

248
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,346
Huh?

249
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:23,808
At my restaurant?

250
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:24,642
Yes.

251
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:26,290
Pa. Ma.

252
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,931
Coming.

253
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:29,402
Be right there.

254
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,095
Why are you in such a hurry, Mai?

255
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:31,645
Hurry up.

256
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:33,416
I’m here.

257
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,055
Our entire house is here.

258
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:36,720
We’re here as a family.

259
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:38,691
Hello.

260
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:39,891
Hello, hello.

261
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:40,637
Hello.

262
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:41,947
Please come in.

263
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,066
Come, Pa, Ma.

264
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:46,149
Hey, stop scratching.

265
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:48,025
It’s itchy.

266
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,590
Fine, fine, I’ll stop scratching.

267
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,992
What would you like to have?

268
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,178
Bring us whatever you recommend.

269
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,493
I’d recommend you try Green Curry, Palo,

270
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,722
and our restaurant’s special recipe of Nam Prik Ong.

271
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:05,166
Guaranteed they’re delicious and good for your health.

272
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:07,798
Oh my.

273
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:11,509
She’s good with her words.

274
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:14,588
Ja-Oh’s not only good at talking,

275
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,143
she’s also a s—

276
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:18,870
What is it?

277
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:20,768
What is it?

278
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:21,814
S– what?

279
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:24,936
She’s rather pretty

280
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:27,517
A sweet talker.

281
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:28,257
Sweet?

282
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,730
Is there anything wrong?

283
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:31,944
Nothing, Mom.

284
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:34,531
Then. bring me everything.

285
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,314
Please have it separately to eat with rice.

286
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,236
Sure.

287
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,163
Please wait a minute.

288
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,418
Mai.

289
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,783
This friend of yours is very diligent.

290
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,672
You should look up to her as an example.

291
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,249
Your siblings are doing well because they’re diligent.

292
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:53,356
That’s right.

293
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,813
You have to try very hard.

294
00:19:55,813 --> 00:20:00,709
When you graduate, your grandmother will no longer have any worries.

295
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,764
Grandma is still alive and well, Pa.

296
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:09,188
I mean she would be happy to have a grandson who’s a doctor.

297
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:11,650
Me? Becoming a doctor?

298
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:15,866
You’re the one who’s most fitting to become a doctor.

299
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,261
When you graduate, you will get a job right away,

300
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,687
people will respect you, and also, you can treat Pa and Grandma.

301
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,572
Right.

302
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:26,421
You’re saying something without considering your son’s intelligence.

303
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:29,588
Then try hard.

304
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:30,579
Try hard.

305
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,716
I’m studying every day.

306
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:35,232
Huh?

307
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:37,324
I have a great dream.

308
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:38,957
What dream?

309
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,329
I will become a world’s class magician.

310
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:46,066
Oh?

311
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,622
A word’s class magician?

312
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:52,056
The one with this song, right?

313
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:55,790
Honey.

314
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:00,196
Honey.

315
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,735
Honey!

316
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:04,599
Enough!

317
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,112
[BABY BANK’S HOUSE]

318
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:12,497
This one will get the girls screaming.

319
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:17,725
Oops. Toh, my boy.

320
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:20,213
Shoot!

321
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:22,872
Oops! I’m sorry, Mom.

322
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:27,626
You’re taking the entrance exam soon, aren’t you going to study, Bank?

323
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,626
The only ‘en’ I’m interested in is, NBA.

324
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:38,028
If you can’t get into university, I’ll send you away.

325
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:39,379
You’ll send me to America?

326
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,735
I’ll send you far away from my face.

327
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:42,702
Go and study already.

328
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:43,561
Don’t just play.

329
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:46,503
Let me play first.

330
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:49,458
I’ve studied before, I can just do that later.

331
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:52,779
Mom, scream for me.

332
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,628
There we go, we’ve got a girl screaming for me.

333
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:56,739
Oh ho!

334
00:21:58,148 --> 00:21:59,145
The first girl is Mom, though.

335
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,108
Eat up, my Meatball.

336
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:10,039
So you’ll have the strength to study.

337
00:22:10,165 --> 00:22:11,165
Thank you, Ma.

338
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:15,108
I promise to get into a good university and go study abroad.

339
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:16,774
My!

340
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:21,067
Our meatball’s going to become the first person in our family to graduate from abroad?

341
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:22,405
That’s right, Ma.

342
00:22:22,578 --> 00:22:24,470
I’ll be the pride of our family.

343
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,440
I will not disappoint Pa because I will not fool around with life

344
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,417
just as Pa said before he passed away.

345
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:34,588
Papa must be smiling from ear to ear in heaven right now.

346
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,087
That’s great, Son.

347
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,588
But before anything else, an army marches on its stomach.

348
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,748
Eat up, eat a lot.

349
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:43,256
Tell me whatever you want to eat.

350
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:43,756
Sure, Ma.

351
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:44,383
I’ll cater it to you.

352
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:45,346
Sure, Ma.

353
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:46,746
Thank you.

354
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,733
Meatball!

355
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,588
Meatball, my baby!

356
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:05,414
Meatball!

357
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:08,142
Help!

358
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:09,699
Help my son!

359
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:10,199
Meatball!

360
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:10,986
Ma’am, here are the meatballs.

361
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,371
Not these!

362
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,358
Meatball!

363
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,586
- Meatball!
- Help!

364
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:16,858
Help Meatball!

365
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:19,548
Help!

366
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:23,490
Meatball!

367
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,428
Meatball!

368
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,217
Meatball!

369
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:35,252
My son!

370
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:40,241
You almost get to meet your Papa in heaven.

371
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:42,839
Here are some more meatballs.

372
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:44,588
I wasn’t talking about this meatball.

373
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:45,253
Go!

374
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,295
I never thought I would see my son studying like the others.

375
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:13,703
I’ve always liked reading, actually.

376
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:16,116
Is that so?

377
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:21,022
That means you’ll get into a good university and make us proud, right?

378
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:23,275
But I don’t know what I want to study yet.

379
00:24:24,077 --> 00:24:25,726
Anywhere that you manage to get into.

380
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,269
“Any” is a broad term.

381
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:31,852
I don’t know what I want to do for work yet.

382
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:36,639
You have to think of what you want to do.

383
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:39,806
You don’t like thinking about stuff like this ever since you were a child.

384
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:41,344
It’d be nice if you’d give it a try.

385
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:44,386
By the way,

386
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:46,499
have you seen your dad around?

387
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,003
He’s been missing since the morning.

388
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:52,709
He’s probably out to buy something to make it up to you.

389
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,221
Then go back to your reading, I won’t get in the way.

390
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:21,298
Cheers.

391
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:23,024
Why do you have so many things to celebrate?

392
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:23,939
What’s the occasion?

393
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,340
We need to celebrate our boy graduating high school.

394
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,791
So I invited friends for some drinks.

395
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,240
Why aren’t you going home?

396
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:49,257
CLOSED FOR A DAY.

397
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:52,372
Come on, cheers.

398
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:53,719
Don’t just stay still there.

399
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:55,833
We’ve just gotten started.

400
00:25:57,217 --> 00:26:01,798
I’m curious, what are we celebrating?

401
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,160
You forced me to close my shop since noon.

402
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,043
You know nothing.

403
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:10,211
To celebrate my son and Chen’s son graduating from high school.

404
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:13,136
I’m so proud.

405
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,611
Talking about which, though,

406
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:18,460
I can’t believe my son, Dong, would graduate high school like the others.

407
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:18,986
Right.

408
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,075
I thought he was dumb just like you are.

409
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:24,433
I only see him getting in and out of Haeb’s place.

410
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,931
What’s up with my place?

411
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:26,710
What’s up with it?

412
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,396
That’s right.

413
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:30,166
His place is full of entertainment.

414
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:30,666
That’s right.

415
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,421
All the dirty and nasty things happen at Haeb’s.

416
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:35,177
How could you say that, are you out of your mind?

417
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,106
Come, cheers!

418
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,039
Let’s go all the way.

419
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:45,981
Chen!

420
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:48,531
Why aren’t you going home?

421
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,434
I definitely will be going back home.

422
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:52,888
But I’m just meeting up with my friends for a bit.

423
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,191
Why do you have so many things to celebrate?

424
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:55,085
What’s the occasion?

425
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:59,649
Babe, our son’s just graduated from high school so I’ve invited my friends for a drink.

426
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,234
I know that you are glad.

427
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:07,155
But can't you just have a little drink and get back to helping me with work?

428
00:27:07,663 --> 00:27:09,663
I normally stay at the shop, Babe.

429
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:12,197
But let me have just today, to be with my friends for a day.

430
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:13,573
Fine.

431
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:16,639
You’re choosing your friends over me, huh?

432
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:18,688
Fine.

433
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:22,973
I’m announcing it right here with everyone as my witness.

434
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:28,155
I’ve been giving it to you every night from 8 to 10 PM.

435
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,625
But from now on, that’s not happening anymore.

436
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,987
My dear wife!

437
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,661
No, no. Please, don’t say that.

438
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:35,871
Please don’t joke around about such a thing.

439
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:36,422
Please?

440
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,131
I’m begging you.

441
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:38,807
You just said you’re choosing your friends over me.

442
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:40,450
Those are two different things.

443
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,685
I just wanted to be with my friends for a little while

444
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:43,094
then I’ll get back to work.

445
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,114
Can I have everything as it is?

446
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,097
I have an offer.

447
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:47,922
If you come home with me right now,

448
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,946
I’ll give it to you non-stop from 8 PM to 5 AM.

449
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:52,854
Are you taking it?

450
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:53,851
Yes, I am.

451
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:55,760
You really have to do it.

452
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:56,674
Should I get undressed right here?

453
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,702
Oh! No, no.

454
00:27:58,189 --> 00:27:58,871
Do you want it right here, right now?

455
00:27:58,871 --> 00:27:59,806
No, people are watching.

456
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:00,526
Hey! Turn away.

457
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:01,359
This is my wife.

458
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,334
No, my dear wife.

459
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:03,109
Don’t get undressed here.

460
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:03,998
Let’s get undressed at home.

461
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:04,509
Fine.

462
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:05,785
Then follow me.

463
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:06,337
Yes, yes.

464
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:07,106
Hurry up.

465
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:07,792
Yes.

466
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:09,956
Alright, my friends.

467
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,547
I love my friends but I’m choosing my wife.

468
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:12,354
I’m off now.

469
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,137
Wifey, wait for me!

470
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Oh, Chen.

471
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:21,755
Husbands have to stay above their wives.

472
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:23,431
if you’re under your wife’s control from the beginning,

473
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:25,891
you will always be under her for the rest of your life.

474
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:27,071
You have to stay above your wife.

475
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:30,089
Look at me, my wife does not dare do anything to me.

476
00:28:30,445 --> 00:28:32,445
Because I’m above her.

477
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:35,682
You guys have no idea how I treat my wife back at home.

478
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,883
She doesn’t even dare say a word to me.

479
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,222
Does she even dare do anything to me?

480
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:47,011
I’m telling you, yesterday, we were having a meal and she was yapping too much.

481
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:48,825
So I made her dine in tears.

482
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:54,422
I’m telling you, if she ever has a problem, I’m kicking right up here.

483
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:56,914
Right in the chin.

484
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:59,635
When her nose bleeds like dip drops, dip drops,

485
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:02,393
I’d take a glass to collect them and drink her blood up.

486
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,621
I’m not Chen.

487
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:06,656
Someone like Chen…

488
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,395
I’ll just be dead.

489
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,433
Hold on, Tao.

490
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,826
You can’t just simply die.

491
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,363
Well, well.

492
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:33,304
Are you showing off to your friends?

493
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:36,854
You said I was dining in tears.

494
00:29:37,136 --> 00:29:39,373
Were you telling the truth?

495
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:41,704
I wasn’t.

496
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:43,352
Khai,

497
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:45,229
I wasn’t saying that, right?

498
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:46,592
You did.

499
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:49,398
That wasn’t all.

500
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:53,606
You kicked right in my chin and my blood was dripping,

501
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:55,678
Dip drops, dip drops.

502
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,162
You said that, didn’t you?

503
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:02,488
I must admit, I didn’t say that.

504
00:30:02,488 --> 00:30:04,411
I didn’t say that.

505
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:06,253
You did.

506
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:09,013
Clean up.

507
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:10,629
Yes, ma’am.

508
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:20,992
This is just a little indoor part.

509
00:30:21,597 --> 00:30:23,833
I’ll give you a big outdoor set when we go out.

510
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:24,754
I’ll see you outside.

511
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:25,555
Follow me.

512
00:30:33,354 --> 00:30:33,985
Khai.

513
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:36,068
Can you come with me?

514
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:38,608
I have to stay with him.

515
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:42,158
Haeb, come with me.

516
00:30:44,154 --> 00:30:45,550
If I go, he’d be lonely.

517
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:01,062
Do you plan to always keep on being studious?

518
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:04,075
Yeah.

519
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,235
I like studying.

520
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:09,662
When I like anything, I should put my mind to it.

521
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,127
That’s what my parents told me.

522
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:18,428
If you like it so much, why don't you study all the way to PhD?

523
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:20,626
That's what I'm planning to do.

524
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,501
I think I'd study up to a PhD.

525
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:27,927
I want to become the country’s best marine scientist.

526
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,196
Wow.

527
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,669
Don’t you have to be studying until you’re old?

528
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:36,121
Hey.

529
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:39,376
When it comes to studying, it doesn’t matter how old you are.

530
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,108
There’s nothing to be ashamed of.

531
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,927
That’s what my parents told me.

532
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,077
And how long would it take

533
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:55,482
until you’ve managed to become a marine scientist

534
00:31:57,845 --> 00:31:59,225
or whatever that you said?

535
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,493
4 years of undergrads here.

536
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:05,889
2 years of master’s degree abroad.

537
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:09,340
And a minimum of 4 years for the PhD.

538
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,146
10 years?

539
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,822
And you even have to study abroad?

540
00:32:19,697 --> 00:32:21,693
I would not be able to see you for a long time.

541
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:29,040
But first, I have to get into the Marine Science Programme at Kasetsart University.

542
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,906
That’s why I have to study very hard.

543
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,452
Why Kaset, though?

544
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:39,925
Can’t it be anywhere else?

545
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,164
Because the professor I admire is working there.

546
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,374
He’s helped our ocean in so many ways.

547
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,307
I want to be a great marine scientist like he is.

548
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,037
What about you, Tong? What do you want to study?

549
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,411
I want to study communication arts.

550
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:06,968
I want to make awesome action movies.

551
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:08,982
Like Panna Rittikrai’s movies.

552
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:11,070
I’ve seen his movies at the screening when I was younger.

553
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:18,914
Then you have to study hard so you can make it into university and make great movies.

554
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,103
If you only play like this, then how can you get into university?

555
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:24,828
Put your head into the books.

556
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:28,371
Have some snacks, kids.

557
00:33:28,795 --> 00:33:29,704
Thank you.

558
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,617
Thank you, Pa.

559
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:32,945
Dig in.

560
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,098
Aren’t you going to eat?

561
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,274
You go ahead.

562
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:46,899
I’m not hungry.

563
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,099
Eat some, child.

564
00:33:51,724 --> 00:33:53,984
You’re not eating much these days.

565
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:55,668
You could get sick.

566
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:59,219
Your body needs nutrition

567
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,855
So you would have the strength to study.

568
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:03,984
I will eat later, Pa.

569
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:05,746
Have you heard?

570
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,594
An army marches on its stomach.

571
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:11,530
And the brain marches on eating too.

572
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,647
My dad told me this.

573
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,594
This is not the time to eat.

574
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,786
This is the time to pursue your dream.

575
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:22,086
Come, Sis.

576
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,723
I’ll eat on your behalf.

577
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,349
Because my dream right now is to eat.

578
00:34:30,394 --> 00:34:32,083
Hey, hey.

579
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:33,739
Sure, Ton Liu.

580
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:36,580
Go for it.

581
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,676
(While everyone’s waiting for their university entrance result,)

582
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,969
(we decided to go on a trip to the beach together.)

583
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:47,729
Who’s going to cook?

584
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:08,972
(Finally,)

585
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,113
(the day of the university entrance exam has come.)

586
00:35:12,897 --> 00:35:17,548
(For me, the exam is just like doing Lin’s exercise.)

587
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,374
(Perhaps,)

588
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:22,492
(it’s even easier.)

589
00:35:58,588 --> 00:35:59,185
Bank.

590
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:00,023
Ow! Dong, ow!

591
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,889
- Hurry up, what’s going on?
- Bank!

592
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,795
I’m sorry.

593
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:05,659
What’s all the noise about?

594
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:09,746
Ow! I’m sitting right here.

595
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:11,189
Oh? Sorry, sorry.

596
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:12,499
My face almost went inside.

597
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:14,748
May I sit with you, Ja-Oh?

598
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:18,731
You’re sure making yourself at home.

599
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:22,557
By the way, where’s Mai?

600
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,254
Right.

601
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:25,674
He’s having a dump in the toilet ever since we got on the train.

602
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:33,470
Mai!

603
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,996
Mai, don’t fart!

604
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:35,496
Mai!

605
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:36,073
Where are they going?

606
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:36,702
Mai!

607
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:37,596
Come out!

608
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:39,309
Mai!

609
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:41,223
Mai, are you taking a dump?

610
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:42,068
Mai!

611
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:43,308
Come on out.

612
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:44,077
Come out.

613
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,434
Do you think they would keep on playing until we get to the beach?

614
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,064
Damn it.

615
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:07,574
That’s a loud snore.

616
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:17,187
Bank.

617
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:18,678
Let me go to the toilet.

618
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:19,356
I need to pee.

619
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:22,147
Bank.

620
00:37:26,585 --> 00:37:27,478
Hey!

621
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,309
Sit still, Tong.

622
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:31,536
I need to pee, Bank.

623
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,657
I need to pee.

624
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:34,931
Tong!

625
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:40,202
Tong!

626
00:37:40,202 --> 00:37:41,773
I need to sleep.

627
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,357
What the hell is up with you guys?

628
00:37:43,357 --> 00:37:43,971
Damn it.

629
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,018
I need to pee, let me go.

630
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:47,821
I need to pee.

631
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:49,741
Hey. Hold it in.

632
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:50,806
I need to pee, bastard.

633
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,120
Where are you going?

634
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:53,718
Where are you going?

635
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:54,412
Mai!

636
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:55,737
Mai’s still in the toilet.

637
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:56,245
Mai!

638
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:57,074
Is that so?

639
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,959
How can the smell come all the way here?

640
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:00,254
Why isn’t Mai out yet?

641
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:03,814
Did Mai fall asleep in the toilet?

642
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:05,305
I need to pee.

643
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:08,188
Come and help me wake him up.

644
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:09,227
Do you have a hairband?

645
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:11,913
Help me wake Mai up, hurry up!

646
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:14,895
Hey! Dong!

647
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:16,247
Dong, a storm’s coming.

648
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:18,302
I’m using my legs here.

649
00:38:18,302 --> 00:38:19,154
Do the three of us have to fit in here?

650
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:22,853
A storm’s coming! A storm’s coming.

651
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:28,320
Are you guys done?

652
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,969
So we can get changed and go for a dip.

653
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:31,194
I’m in!

654
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,507
Hold on, let’s grab something to eat.

655
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:34,665
That’s right.

656
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:35,591
I’d lose weight.

657
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:37,401
Right.

658
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,768
We haven’t eaten anything.

659
00:38:39,993 --> 00:38:41,770
Then, who’s going to cook?

660
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:04,665
No, no.

661
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:06,622
Then who should it be?

662
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,526
I think I know.

663
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:21,019
Not you.

664
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:22,209
Her.

665
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:27,964
Me?

666
00:39:28,228 --> 00:39:29,397
That’s right.

667
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:31,419
Your mom’s the best cook.

668
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:32,515
So the daughter should…

669
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:34,146
an apple wouldn’t fall far from the tree.

670
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:34,769
That’s right.

671
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:35,546
That’s true!

672
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:36,265
Go for it.

673
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:40,318
Then take my coal.

674
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,508
Some crispy leaves for while you are cooking.

675
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:55,122
Sorry, I won’t tease you anymore.

676
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:04,015
What are you looking for?

677
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:05,873
I’m looking for some crabs for Ja-Oh.

678
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,905
Everyone, it’s done.

679
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:09,738
You can come and eat.

680
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:28,259
Ja-Oh,

681
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:29,765
these are not food.

682
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:31,417
These are poison.

683
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,429
I was afraid they wouldn’t be cooked through.

684
00:40:34,544 --> 00:40:36,812
This is beyond cooked through, this is burnt.

685
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:40,108
I knew, that giraffes only eat leaves

686
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,541
they wouldn’t know how to cook.

687
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:43,502
I’ll get you some leaves, Ja-Oh.

688
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,071
Mai!

689
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:51,414
Dong!

690
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:52,592
That part of yours is poking me!

691
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:55,538
Dong!

692
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,944
Dong, that part of yours is poking me.

693
00:41:00,814 --> 00:41:02,983
So, what do we do now?

694
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:04,926
Is it edible?

695
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,255
(While everyone’s waiting for their university entrance result,)

696
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:13,687
(we decided to go on a trip to the beach together.)

697
00:41:55,946 --> 00:42:02,272
(We meant to make this trip the most fun memories of our school days)

698
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:05,927
(before we part ways to grow in our own separate paths.)

699
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:21,023
Pao.

700
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,299
What are you doing here by yourself?

701
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:35,589
Lin doesn’t like me.

702
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:41,994
But I think she likes you.

703
00:43:09,182 --> 00:43:11,182
I want to become a marine scientist.

704
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:14,004
I want the marine animals to stay with us for a long time.

705
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:15,037
What about you, Tong?

706
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:16,372
What do you want to do when you grow up?

707
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:19,859
Yay!

708
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,641
Tong made it into university.

709
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,477
He’s made it!

710
00:43:23,722 --> 00:43:24,494
Hello?

711
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:27,135
Lin.

712
00:43:28,176 --> 00:43:31,186
I couldn’t get into that faculty, Tong.

713
00:43:33,474 --> 00:43:35,474
I have something to tell you.

714
00:43:38,592 --> 00:43:40,235
The thing is…

715
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,973
Can you not say you like me now?
