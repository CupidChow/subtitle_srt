Ja-Oh.

5
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:18,525
Where are the boys going?

6
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:22,315
Well, the boys are “into the eggs” these days.

7
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:25,000
We just wanted to make history

8
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,273
by playing games into the year 2000.

9
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,656
The food for the New Year’s event is pride.

10
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:37,160
Since it’s New Year, we, the Jarasjam Family, are giving you 100 Baht each.

11
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,001
Hand it over to the client if it’s ready.

12
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:50,074
Here you go.

13
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:51,389
Thank you.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,159
Off you go, Sing.

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,996
Once you get the money,

16
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:57,564
give it to me.

17
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,680
Take care when you ride.

18
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:07,233
Babe.

19
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,262
What do you think our son would buy for his friends?

20
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,120
Would he buy anything, though?

21
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,400
Are you saying that he would scam my money?

22
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:16,940
That’s not it.

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,857
I mean would he be able to come up with anything to buy?

24
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,941
He would probably be handing out money to his friend at this point.

25
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,735
How do you know?

26
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:27,202
Would he be acting just like me?

27
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,282
How can I not know?

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,654
I’m his mom.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,281
An apple never falls far from its tree.

30
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:33,852
There’s no need to be so alike, actually.

31
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:36,642
What’s so bad about taking after my personality, though?

32
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:41,319
I’m lovable that’s why you fell for me.

33
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,194
You’re so full of yourself.

34
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:43,905
It’s so hot out here.

35
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:45,000
Shall we close the shop for a little while?

36
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:47,244
We just got downstairs.

37
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:49,231
I’m not satisfied yet.

38
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,057
Yeah?

39
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:50,822
I have to get the work done first.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,803
I’ll be waiting in the room.

41
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:53,180
Follow me in.

42
00:01:58,304 --> 00:01:59,070
Damn it.

43
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,966
(The New Year’s Night.)

44
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:17,339
Something got stuck in my teeth.

45
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:18,979
What did?

46
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,745
Hey. Hey.

47
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,221
What do you have to complain about me again?

48
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,507
Hey, there’s no need to be so alarmed.

49
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,201
I just have something to ask you.

50
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:33,964
Here, take a seat.

51
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,524
Take your seat right here, Lin.

52
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:36,267
Out with you.

53
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:39,669
Here, right here, Lin.

54
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,561
You can sit here.

55
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,646
What did you want to ask, Lin?

56
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:49,249
You can ask me as well.

57
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:51,684
The thing is,

58
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,000
are you guys still going to play games over New Year’s Night?

59
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:57,250
Of course, we are.

60
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:01,452
I’m telling you, us playing games this time is nothing ordinary.

61
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,443
It’s the making of history.

62
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,350
How’s that?

63
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,560
Sounds awesome already.

64
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,117
Are you guys not afraid?

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,322
What’s there to be afraid of?

66
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:16,485
The Y2K Ghost.

67
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:19,149
The people in Bangkok are so paranoid about it.

68
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:20,860
Rumors are going around.

69
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:23,019
Ghosts aren’t real Ja-Oh.

70
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:25,711
Right, there are no ghosts.

71
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:26,938
Right.

72
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,489
I don’t know if it’s true

73
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:36,089
but the story I’ve heard is really scary.

74
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:42,879
What’s the story about?

75
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,555
Have you guys seen the movie “The Ring”?

76
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:48,936
Oh,

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
the one that a ghost comes out from a TV?

78
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,624
My dad showed me.

79
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:56,097
Even my dad got scared.

80
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,355
That movie was really scary.

81
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,446
Uncle Haeb has the movie for rent.

82
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:03,298
There’s also the novel version.

83
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,009
Even Uncle Haeb thinks it’s scary.

84
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,260
Is it the one you showed me yesterday?

85
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,160
One with a woman who died in a pond?

86
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:15,570
Lin,

87
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,789
how does the story go after that?

88
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:23,852
It goes like this, guys.

89
00:05:24,017 --> 00:05:32,720
It’s a curse of a woman who got electrified by the computer.

90
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:40,965
On New Year’s Night, her ghost will manifest in the internet system.

91
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:55,440
The female ghost will kill whoever has their computer on over New Year’s Night.

92
00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:04,415
Ow!

93
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,013
It’s not raining but why was there a sound of thunder?

94
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,840
Sorry, I just moved my chair.

95
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,794
Damn it, Ja-Oh!

96
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:33,237
You guys are scared to death just because of that?

97
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:34,987
Are you guys still thinking of playing games, then?

98
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:35,975
Hey.

99
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:38,746
Hey, hey.

100
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:39,795
Who’s scared?

101
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:41,306
No one is.

102
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:42,800
Right, dude?

103
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:45,184
Ghosts aren’t real.

104
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:46,563
That’s right.

105
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:48,560
Are you scared?

106
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,488
I’m… I’m not scared at all.

107
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:54,991
Are you scared?

108
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,139
No.

109
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,697
I’m not scared, not at all.

110
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,257
What is it?

111
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,000
Just get in there.

112
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,850
You scared me, Uncle.

113
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:27,680
Why is it so dark in here, Uncle?

114
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,166
How can it not be, I didn’t turn on the light.

115
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:36,840
Damn it, I thought this was a horror movie.

116
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:38,638
What are you so afraid of?

117
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,560
My shop doesn’t have a gh–

118
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,067
U, U, Uncle?

119
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,004
How did the computer turn on by itself?

120
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:53,885
Tong.

121
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:55,240
Tong, where are you going?

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,508
Pao, you too.

123
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,840
Hurry up.

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,340
Tong.

125
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,398
You have an amulet, bastard.

126
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:01,184
No! No!

127
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:02,107
You lead the way.

128
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,041
Dong has an amulet.

129
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:03,819
You lead the way.

130
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:05,517
Ghosts are scared of a Buddhist amulet, Dong.

131
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,481
Ghosts are scared of a Buddhist amulet.

132
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,019
so go, Dong.

133
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:11,343
Hurry up.

134
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:13,169
Where are we going?

135
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,352
Where did Uncle go?

136
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,917
I’m scared.

137
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:46,200
I’m scared.

138
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,891
I’m scared.

139
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,418
I’m sorry.

140
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:07,773
Ja-Oh!

141
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,779
Ja-Oh! What’s wrong?

142
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,424
What is it, Ja-Oh?

143
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,154
What is it?

144
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,675
What’s wrong, Ja-Oh?

145
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,087
What’s wrong, Ja-Oh?

146
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,640
Is it out yet?

147
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:35,746
It won’t go away if you just rub it like that, Mai.

148
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:36,489
Do it harder!

149
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:37,157
Fine.

150
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:38,049
Hang on.

151
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:39,250
Mai!

152
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,927
You want it hard, huh?

153
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,644
Mai!

154
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:46,531
Calm down, Ja-Oh.

155
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:47,362
Mai!

156
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:52,481
Pao!

157
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,478
Here you go, Pao!

158
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:55,655
Where are you going?

159
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:57,046
Where are you going, Pao?

160
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:57,645
Pao!

161
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:06,539
You are quite sly for teaming up with Uncle Khai to get us.

162
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:08,319
I’m good, aren’t I?

163
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:21,538
Here.

164
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,593
A New Year’s present.

165
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,098
For you.

166
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:33,750
I haven’t received a New Year’s card since I was in grade 4.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,991
Your present is so childish.

168
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,732
It’s so childish,

169
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,157
that’s why it suits you well.

170
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,289
It’s nowhere near as awesome as mine, though.

171
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:49,820
You’ve prepared something?

172
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,797
For real?

173
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:57,694
Here.

174
00:10:58,822 --> 00:10:59,688
Hey!

175
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:05,940
Give it, I’ll show you.

176
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,635
This is how you look at it.

177
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:27,993
This is what you’ve always wanted to do, right?

178
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,532
It’s a cartoon so I can do anything with it.

179
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,681
It’s cute.

180
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,760
Thanks.

181
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:41,322
Yeah.

182
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,193
Happy New Year.

183
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:51,809
Same to you.

184
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,387
What are you looking at?

185
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:23,453
Nothing.

186
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:28,333
You seem so close with Lin these days.

187
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,467
Can you…

188
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,600
help me get together with Lin?

189
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,801
What’s this?

190
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:15,023
I’ve just bought a new shirt, are you still going to poke it?

191
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:17,521
It’s the mark for good students.

192
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:18,566
There’s nothing wrong.

193
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:19,971
It’s actually cool.

194
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:21,063
Are you done with your work?

195
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,001
Hey, Tong!

196
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,114
Ow!

197
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:31,496
What’s wrong?

198
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,719
Finish your work, you won’t get it done.

199
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,496
I can do that later.

200
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,271
No.

201
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:37,933
No “Later” and no slacking.

202
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:38,943
Hurry up!

203
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,131
You poke all my shirts until there’s none left at home

204
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:43,223
You’ve been poking it for the entire year, and now you’re poking it too?

205
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:44,547
Take out your work and start working on it, then.

206
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:45,687
So I won’t have to poke you.

207
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,081
Do you want me to poke you, huh?

208
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:48,898
Ow!

209
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,192
Tong.

210
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,487
Which number do you want?

211
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:53,230
How many shuffles?

212
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,895
None of your business.

213
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:54,746
What?

214
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,224
What about you, Bank?

215
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:56,875
None of your business.

216
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,411
What the heck, why’s no one playing with me?

217
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,399
You poor bastard.

218
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,253
Fine, I’ll play with you.

219
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,565
Hey, which number do you want?

220
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:03,459
3.

221
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:04,386
How many shuffles?

222
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,106
Well, Tong.

223
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:07,497
Hmm?

224
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,571
You seem so close with Lin these days.

225
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,249
Will you just cut to the chase?

226
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,663
Can you…

227
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:20,969
help me get together with Lin?

228
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,451
What do you want me to do?

229
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,495
Write a love letter for you?

230
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:27,031
Hey,

231
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,425
that sounds alright.

232
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,604
But put my name on the sender at the end.

233
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:31,754
I was being sarcastic.

234
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:32,710
Oh?

235
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:35,702
Let’s do this.

236
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:38,602
If you help me write a letter to Lin,

237
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,675
I will

238
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,761
buy you 3 porn

239
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,129
and with it, I’m giving you one set of Champagne X posters.

240
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:48,152
Okay?

241
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:50,507
Are those enough?

242
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,459
Then,

243
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,681
I’ll buy it for you for the whole year.

244
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,212
Love is about pricing.

245
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:07,445
How much?

246
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:09,501
500.

247
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,681
Can I bargain?

248
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:14,936
A half of that, maybe?

249
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:20,433
Love can’t be bargained.

250
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:22,962
It’s not about business.

251
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:26,270
It’s about feelings.

252
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:28,682
My ass.

253
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:35,771
Keep the change.

254
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,110
You can leave it to me.

255
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:43,837
When are you getting started?

256
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,804
Love is about feelings.

257
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:51,255
So it will take some time.

258
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,617
Sis, someone asks me to deliver you a letter.

259
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:16,103
Who is it?

260
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:17,581
The name’s Bank.

261
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:19,662
I saw him waiting in front of our house for a while

262
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,474
but just wouldn’t ring the doorbell to call you.

263
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:24,441
I got annoyed so I took it from him.

264
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,948
Then why did you take it from him?

265
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,643
Because if I don’t,  he would be there all day.

266
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,231
I’m off to play football.

267
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:37,945
Hold on, Ton Liu, have you studied?

268
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,416
Bring me the yellow.

269
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,864
There’s none.

270
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,240
Mai.

271
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:31,321
I told you to get it from in front of the science room, didn’t I?

272
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:32,211
When did you tell me that?

273
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,162
You forgot, didn’t you?

274
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,521
I didn’t. When did you ever tell me?

275
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,228
You forgot.

276
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:38,080
I told you from the start to get yellow from in front of the science room.

277
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,921
Who would want to go there now, it’s so damn dark.

278
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,321
You forgot to bring it so you should go.

279
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:42,837
Stop!

280
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:44,071
You should go.

281
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:44,899
You left it out there.

282
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:45,722
You forgot.

283
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:47,263
Then both of you go and get it with me.

284
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,211
You too, Ja-Oh.

285
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:49,820
I’m not going alone with you.

286
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,537
Why not?

287
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:53,055
Are you afraid you’d fall for me, Giraffe?

288
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:54,618
Shut it.

289
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,221
Come. You and I.

290
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:57,072
I have to go as well?

291
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:57,733
Yeah.

292
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,969
- The trouble falls on me again.
- Let’s all go.

293
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:00,983
Right.

294
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,430
Just step right on it, it’s your work after all.

295
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,226
I’m hungry.

296
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:08,841
- Lin.
- Bank

297
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:09,916
grab something to eat with me.

298
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:11,724
You go. I’m not hungry.

299
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:14,691
Lin, are you tired?

300
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:15,693
Lin, are you hungry?

301
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:17,838
I’m pretty hungry.

302
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,193
I’ll get you something to eat.

303
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:20,345
Sure thing.

304
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:20,857
Thanks.

305
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:22,623
Dong, I happen to be hungry too.

306
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:23,926
You are so damn nosy.

307
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:25,071
Dong, come here!

308
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,171
Dong!

309
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:37,931
Hey, Lin.

310
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,679
Where did everyone go?

311
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:43,193
They went to grab stuff and find something to eat.

312
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,459
Good that you’re here. Help us out.

313
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,201
So we can quickly finish this and go home.

314
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:52,759
(Quickly finish this and go home.)

315
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:55,960
By the way, Tong.

316
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,815
Have you registered for any extra tutoring classes?

317
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,329
Nope.

318
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,385
Why should I?

319
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:04,386
It’s far. We have to drive to another city.

320
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,285
But everyone does that.

321
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,454
It so happens that ‘everyone’ does not include me.

322
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:20,631
Then you should come and study with me.

323
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:26,685
Why should I study?

324
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
Bank brought me a letter at home yesterday.

325
00:19:58,961 --> 00:19:59,779
What does that have to do with me?

326
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:03,046
He even wrote me a poem.

327
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,678
No one has ever written me a poem.

328
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:17,396
“Help me, I have fallen for this girl,”

329
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:20,872
“She’s so pretty, smart, and lovable,”

330
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:24,640
“With study, she’s unmistakable,”

331
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:28,180
“Not to mention she’s one kind-hearted girl.”

332
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:32,822
Bank’s good at this.

333
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,919
“I want to invite her out for snacks”

334
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:40,533
“Savor the wind and watch this and that”

335
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,142
“I will take care, you won’t get a bug’s bite”

336
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,943
“If that’s alright for you, my awesome girl.”

337
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,832
He’s the modern-day Shakespeare.

338
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,887
But this is your handwriting, isn’t it, Tong?

339
00:20:56,285 --> 00:21:00,079
And you’re the only one who says “awesome”.

340
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,535
If you have time at hand, use it to study.

341
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,679
You should read more.

342
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,475
You’re talented.

343
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:08,921
You can become a writer, perhaps.

344
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:10,408
A writer?

345
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:12,562
No, no. That’s not cool at all.

346
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:14,374
Hey.

347
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:19,024
If you put your mind to it, anything can become awesome.

348
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:20,533
Come on.

349
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:22,124
Let’s study hard.

350
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:27,308
Why aren’t you taking tutoring classes?

351
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,622
Why are you here?

352
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:33,330
Because you said it’s far.

353
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,390
Doing it this way is pretty good too.

354
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:37,721
We don’t have to spend lots of money.

355
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,878
Isn’t it because you wanted to be alone with me?

356
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:49,558
Admit it, I’m pretty cute, right?

357
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:51,641
Oh.

358
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:54,515
I have no interest in boys who are dumber than me.

359
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,222
That’s crazy.

360
00:21:59,222 --> 00:22:00,485
I’m pretty smart.

361
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,235
I just let you win.

362
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,216
If I win, you might be sad.

363
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:07,128
Is that so?

364
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,421
Then tell me when you get serious.

365
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:12,886
Let’s make a bet.

366
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:19,001
If I win, you have to do whatever I ask you to.

367
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,801
What should we bet on, then?

368
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:27,115
If you get the highest score on the final exam this time,

369
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:29,712
you can do anything to me.

370
00:22:31,135 --> 00:22:32,786
But if I get the highest score,

371
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,294
you have to cut your hair into a bob.

372
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,380
Why a bob?

373
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,870
I want to see you in short hair.

374
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:48,011
Sure.

375
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,554
Because I would win anyway.

376
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:56,515
Let’s see.

377
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:02,600
When the next Olympic Games begins…

378
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:10,612
(And during 2000-2001, I stepped up to become Lin’s rival in studying.)

379
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:22,069
I’m definitely getting it this time.

380
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,363
I’m getting you.

381
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:26,249
Mai!

382
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:27,941
Let’s do it.

383
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:28,841
H

384
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:29,789
Hydrogen.

385
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:30,498
Li.

386
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:31,406
Lithium.

387
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:32,578
2…1…

388
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,890
Do you

389
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:39,085
Believe

390
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,610
I’m getting you this time.

391
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,861
I looked it up in the dictionary, Tong.

392
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:52,854
Hey!

393
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:57,325
I fuck you!

394
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:58,601
I cucumber you!

395
00:23:58,601 --> 00:23:59,983
I zucchini you!

396
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:00,691
You stupid!

397
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,288
I fuck you too!

398
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:03,175
Na.

399
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:03,935
Sodium.

400
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:04,841
Dy.

401
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,003
Delicious.

402
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:07,276
Delicious!

403
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:08,482
Bank.

404
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:09,940
Do you need my help?

405
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:12,427
Study.

406
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:14,877
Tong, you bastard!

407
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,233
I hope you fail your exams!

408
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:18,512
Toey, it’s a sin to say that.

409
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:28,961
Dy.

410
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:29,767
Delicious.

411
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,366
Alright, Dysprosium, Dysprosium.

412
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,147
Close the door.

413
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:37,002
Hey, Uncle Toey, what about Grandma?

414
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:38,749
Get in here!

415
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:40,046
Damn you!

416
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,021
Tong, you bastard.

417
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:52,931
I’ve finished my studies.

418
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,688
Love’s here.

419
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:56,484
We wanted to put a sticker on you.

420
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:57,744
I’m the first one.

421
00:24:57,744 --> 00:24:58,707
No, no. I’m the first one.

422
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:00,643
Me first.

423
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:01,772
You come over here.

424
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:03,039
Me first.

425
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,351
Look.

426
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,071
They come in pairs.

427
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:29,809
So sweet.

428
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,146
Go ahead and only put on stickers for each other.

429
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,422
What’s going on?

430
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:35,530
Why isn’t anyone putting stickers on us?

431
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:37,342
I’m quite handsome.

432
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:40,576
Just sit down.

433
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:43,207
No one dares put stickers on you because of your crotch.

434
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:44,664
Get down.

435
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:45,913
Right, you bastard Dong.

436
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,210
That’s why no one wants to put stickers on us.

437
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,717
You too, Mai.

438
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:51,432
You’ve been scratching your crotch all day, no one wants to put stickers on us.

439
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:56,938
Well, this one too.

440
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:58,740
You keep studying.

441
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,734
It’s Valentine’s Day!

442
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,751
It’s the day of love.

443
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,097
You’re corny from primary school up to high school.

444
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,895
I might be corny but I’m never lonely, though.

445
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:15,156
That’s because Lin’s always in my heart.

446
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,704
You guys want stickers?

447
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:21,658
Put it on among yourselves then.

448
00:26:22,293 --> 00:26:23,329
That’s sad.

449
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:26,846
You can put it on for me, Mai.

450
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,330
I’ll do it for you, you do it for me.

451
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:33,389
Mai, let me do it for you.

452
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:35,697
You want this one, right?

453
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:36,689
Easy with it.

454
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,957
Are you getting a good look?

455
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:40,821
Hey, Pao.

456
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,419
Here it is.

457
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,436
More of it, this one’s from a 10th-grader.

458
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:56,175
I’m so sick of this Miss Popular.

459
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:58,723
You got all the cut stuff.

460
00:26:58,866 --> 00:26:59,965
I’m so jealous.

461
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,860
Well, Ja-Oh. You’re one to talk.

462
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:06,032
I saw you getting a chocolate.

463
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:07,706
Did you get it from a 12th-grader?

464
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:09,605
Do you want some?

465
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,151
No! He gave it to you.

466
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:15,431
So what?

467
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,510
If he gave it to me then I have the right to share it with my best friend.

468
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,036
On top of that,

469
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,311
we have to share the fat.

470
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:25,751
Am I not fat enough already?

471
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:26,455
Eat up.

472
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,109
It’s good, right?

473
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:39,744
By the way,

474
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,385
did you give chocolate to anyone?

475
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,221
No.

476
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:50,926
Why not?

477
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,110
I don’t have time for that.

478
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:56,502
I have to study for the university entrance exam.

479
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:01,888
You are so not romantic.

480
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:04,763
A time like this only comes once.

481
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:06,583
Don’t regret it later.

482
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,824
I don’t think I will regret it.

483
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,116
Because I’m happy with the way my life is right now.

484
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:13,299
Another thing, Ja-Oh,

485
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:16,907
Valentine's isn’t all about romantic love.

486
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,203
It can be for friendship too.

487
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:21,471
There are various kinds of love.

488
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,778
Are you happy thinking that way?

489
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:25,988
Which part of it makes you happy?

490
00:28:27,284 --> 00:28:28,793
I am happy.

491
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:33,978
Happy to learn, to play, and to see my friends.

492
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:36,130
And to see you.

493
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,239
Lin!

494
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:42,305
Are you confessing to me?

495
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:47,000
I got caught.

496
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,244
I’ve been hiding my love for you for a long time.

497
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:53,220
I’m not easy.

498
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:57,192
Don’t you like me a little, Ja-Oh?

499
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:01,902
I’m so sad, Ja-Oh doesn’t like me.

500
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:05,543
I like you too.

501
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:07,891
Here you go!

502
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,130
You’re always teasing me.

503
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:13,719
Why isn’t there anyone pretty and cute?

504
00:29:14,947 --> 00:29:16,084
Hey, dude!

505
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:17,375
Love’s here.

506
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:19,588
I can hold it myself.

507
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,227
What are you guys doing standing in the way?

508
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,517
Who’s standing in the way?

509
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:32,954
Isn’t that you who’s standing in our way of love?

510
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,882
When will you stop being so corny, Bank?

511
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:40,527
I might be corny, but Lin is the only one I see.

512
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:45,149
Enough, let’s cut to the chase.

513
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,375
What is it?

514
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:52,219
We wanted to put a sticker on you.

515
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,167
Only for me?

516
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:56,267
What about Ja-Oh?

517
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,475
Uh, yeah.

518
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,168
But I wanted to put it on you first.

519
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,921
I want to be the first one in the group to put a sticker on you.

520
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:07,601
Hey, I’m the first one.

521
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,005
No, no. I’m the first one.

522
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:09,573
What are you talking about?

523
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:10,391
There’s no need to fight.

524
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:13,758
Hey.

525
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,244
What is it, Tong?

526
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:20,572
When there's an argument, we need to use the fairest way of judgment.

527
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:22,130
What’s that?

528
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,188
Rock-paper-scissors.

529
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:27,027
So fair.

530
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:27,946
Come on.

531
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:28,901
- Don’t be slow.
- Come at me.

532
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:29,679
Bring it.

533
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:37,804
Rock-paper…

534
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,579
Rock-paper…

535
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:40,612
Hey!

536
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:41,849
What are you just rock-paper-ing for?

537
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,050
I almost peed my pants.

538
00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:44,769
I’ll do it.

539
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:47,538
Rock-paper-scissors.

540
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:51,705
I won.

541
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:54,052
If you’re going to put on stickers then hurry up.

542
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:54,740
I want to go home already.

543
00:30:56,072 --> 00:31:03,026
I won.

544
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:10,204
Hey, damn you, Dong.

545
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,309
I almost hit my head.

546
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:13,024
It’s good that I held on to a pole.

547
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:27,506
Mai!

548
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,027
Today’s when you die!

549
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:31,686
Ja-Oh!

550
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:34,304
Why did you put a sticker in my mouth?

551
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:35,678
I didn’t mean to.

552
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:36,339
Mai!

553
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,968
- I didn’t even want to put a sticker on you.
- Ja-Oh!

554
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:38,986
You stop right there!

555
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,619
I was going to put it on Lin, not you!

556
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:41,376
Mai!

557
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:42,523
Mai’s gone.

558
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:43,546
Lin.

559
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,362
Hey, I’m the first one.

560
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,305
No, no.

561
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,673
You come here.

562
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:50,690
You too.

563
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:51,938
Come here.

564
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:54,037
Calm down, you’ll hurt yourselves.

565
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:59,829
Tong, hold on.

566
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:02,378
Don’t pull it.

567
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:03,448
Don’t pull!

568
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:04,450
You come here.

569
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,326
Hold him.

570
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,883
He’s getting there.

571
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:12,043
He’s approaching her.

572
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,744
I’m the first one to put a sticker on Lin.

573
00:32:22,514 --> 00:32:23,859
Tong put a sticker on Lin.

574
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:26,411
Me first.

575
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,582
I’m giving you my heart.

576
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:29,808
Put it on here.

577
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:31,423
Where?

578
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:33,029
Hey, you’re cutting my cue, Pao?

579
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,851
Come back here.

580
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,797
Ja-Oh!

581
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,141
Help me.

582
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,490
Happy Valentine’s.

583
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:51,714
Happy Valentine’s.

584
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:54,553
Thank you.

585
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:57,604
I’m back.

586
00:32:58,193 --> 00:33:01,956
Oh ho! What have you got there so much in your hands?

587
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:03,732
The Valentine’s stuff, Mom.

588
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:07,651
Seeing you like this reminds me of your mom.

589
00:33:07,938 --> 00:33:10,725
She was so popular when she was a young lady.

590
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,564
All the boys in town were trying to win her over.

591
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,204
You’re exaggerating.

592
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:18,034
Let me help you carry it, sister.

593
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:22,366
Well, Ton Liu, I know you want something in return for the help.

594
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:23,313
No, I don’t.

595
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:24,969
But can I have some of the snacks?

596
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:25,998
There we go.

597
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:28,468
Yeah, take it.

598
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:34,113
She even knows there’s one more right here.

599
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,143
You said you were going to help your sister.

600
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:39,228
Here, put it down here.

601
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:40,229
There we go.

602
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:44,712
This is cute.

603
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:02,527
This is cute.

604
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,223
So cute.

605
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,213
Let me put my stuff away.

606
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:26,897
Are you the Valentine’s Day star?

607
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:29,513
Here, careful not to drop it.

608
00:34:29,513 --> 00:34:30,204
Thank you.

609
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:32,091
Do you want my sister to be impressed?

610
00:34:32,316 --> 00:34:33,724
Do you know J’Rock?

611
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,282
Are you sure you know what J’Rock is?

612
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,213
Not only J’Rock, I also know JJ.

613
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:39,231
Who’s JJ?

614
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:42,044
JJ, the son of Joom who sells Jim-Joom at the Jarket.

615
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:42,680
Market!

616
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:00,668
(Final Exam’s result announcement day.)

617
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:02,668
You’re amazing, my son.

618
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,666
Just like your dad.

619
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,437
You even got the second place.

620
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,135
Hey, Tong came second.

621
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:08,860
Yay!

622
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,984
Tong came second!

623
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:10,686
Yay!

624
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:13,061
That’s amazing.

625
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:19,503
Tong got the second place.

626
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:22,340
From the last to the second place.

627
00:35:22,774 --> 00:35:24,774
That’s a leap.

628
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:28,653
Unlike yours, she used to come first and now she’s still the first.

629
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:30,796
That’s like staying in the exact same place.

630
00:35:31,985 --> 00:35:35,007
Congratulations on your son becoming hard-working.

631
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:39,169
Ping.

632
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:44,058
You’re here as well?

633
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:45,440
Yes.

634
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:53,596
Hey.

635
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,915
That year we had the beauty pageant, I was having diarrhea.

636
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,677
Otherwise, I’d have won.

637
00:35:58,997 --> 00:36:00,452
You’d have been the second.

638
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:05,590
It was a relief you had diarrhea, otherwise, I wouldn't have won.

639
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:06,672
Thank you.

640
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:07,498
Yeah.

641
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:13,291
Well, Yong.

642
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:15,839
Would you like to switch?

643
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:20,819
Hey, we can’t switch.

644
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:23,754
Our son is so good, why would you want to switch?

645
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,268
I meant the wife.

646
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,283
Tao, you bastard.

647
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:29,448
I’m, your wife.

648
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:32,358
People all over the town wanted to have me.

649
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:33,760
You…!

650
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:36,503
Well, he deserves a kick.

651
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:40,240
He never changes, just like that from when he was a young boy until old.

652
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:42,592
But that was fun.

653
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:45,361
I don’t want to go home, Sis.

654
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,619
Shall I take you to J’Phon’s Milk Place?

655
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:50,831
Let’s go.

656
00:36:52,447 --> 00:36:53,230
Oh?

657
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,957
What are you girls talking about?

658
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,014
Let’s go home, Ton Liu.

659
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,729
You can head home first, Mom and Dad.

660
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:04,751
I’ll take Ton Liu to J’Phon’s Milk Place.

661
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,222
I’ll take her home.

662
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,385
Take good care of your sister.

663
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,800
Sure, I will take good care of her.

664
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,096
Don’t stay out too late.

665
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:16,046
Sure, Mom.

666
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:17,212
I’ll see you at home.

667
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,300
Let’s go.

668
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:19,565
Here, Papa.

669
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,804
What should we eat, Ton Liu?

670
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,125
Just say it to your sister.

671
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,238
I’ll have everything.

672
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,960
Everything?

673
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:34,569
I was thinking of Kaya Toast and Milk with syrup.

674
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:35,643
Do you want that too?

675
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:36,297
Yes.

676
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:42,171
Give me a minute.

677
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:47,908
You’re good.

678
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,034
You came second.

679
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,417
I know I lost, you don’t have to rub it on me.

680
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:54,625
What do you want me to do?

681
00:37:56,323 --> 00:37:57,417
What to do?

682
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:00,453
What should it be?

683
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:02,092
Should I shave?

684
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,442
Or I can do a buzz cut if you want.

685
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:07,368
Why the haircut?

686
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:08,915
Can’t it be anything else?

687
00:38:11,426 --> 00:38:13,247
That’s because I bet on a haircut with you.

688
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,106
Or do you want money?

689
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,587
I don’t have any money.

690
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,385
Hey, Tong! What sort of person do you think I am?

691
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:25,471
Then what do you want me to do?

692
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,306
You don’t have to do anything for me.

693
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:31,305
I actually got what I wanted from you.

694
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:32,688
Huh?

695
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:35,007
What’s that?

696
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:35,862
Lin!

697
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:39,706
Mr. Sommai wanted to see me, can you come alone?

698
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:40,889
Sure.

699
00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:43,120
Ton Liu, I’ll be right back.

700
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:45,378
Lin.

701
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,483
Lin, Lin.

702
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:47,559
What is it? Tell me before you go.

703
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:48,317
Lin!

704
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:51,990
Lin!

705
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,848
Do you want my sister to be impressed?

706
00:39:02,205 --> 00:39:03,032
What is it, little one?

707
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,284
Do you know J’Rock?

708
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,689
A snack?

709
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,888
J’Rock!

710
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:16,949
You’re doing that as if it’s some soy sauce.

711
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:18,269
I want it J’Rock.

712
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:19,589
Problems.

713
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:20,324
Do you mean, “No problem”?

714
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:21,279
Thanks for the correction.

715
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:23,606
Are you sure you know what J’Rock is?

716
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:25,877
You’re looking down on me, boy.

717
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,916
Not only J’Rock, I also know JJ.

718
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:30,917
Who’s JJ?

719
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:33,967
JJ, the son of Joom who sells Jim-Joom at the Jarket.

720
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,110
Market!

721
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,884
Come on, Uncle. It’s J’Rock.

722
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:37,775
Right, right.

723
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,400
You’d better get it straight.

724
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,297
Don’t worry.

725
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:40,176
Leave it to me.

726
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:55,827
Tong!

727
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,657
I don’t owe you anything anymore.

728
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:04,270
What’s with your hair?

729
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:05,697
And what’s this costume?

730
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:06,499
Well,

731
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:08,902
you like J’Rock, don’t you?

732
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,127
The little one told me that.

733
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:15,882
So awesome.

734
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:22,236
Why are you laughing?

735
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,555
You got played.

736
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,621
Little one!

737
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:35,290
I was bleaching it for hours.

738
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,708
My scalp was all burning.

739
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:39,126
This jacket is so hot.

740
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,006
These pants are so tight.

741
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:46,248
People were staring at me when I was driving down the street.

742
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:47,718
That’s pretty awesome though, Tong.

743
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,432
So awesome.

744
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:02,778
Hey!

745
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,285
Stop playing with my hair.

746
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:07,183
Tong.

747
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:10,047
Whichever devil’s gotten into you that made you do this hair?

748
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:10,773
Right.

749
00:41:11,191 --> 00:41:14,466
Oh, you must have tried to copy Sakuraki.

750
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,453
Me?

751
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:21,316
I’m cooler than that, of course.

752
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:22,714
My ass.

753
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,638
Aren’t you afraid of Sommai?

754
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:26,774
Why would I be?

755
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:31,400
If someone like me were to get my hair colored, everyone in school has to know.

756
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:32,628
My ass.

757
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:34,193
What do you mean you’re not scared?

758
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:35,928
I saw you sitting in the toilet since 5 AM.

759
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:39,040
Such a sucker.

760
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,291
Pao!

761
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:42,007
What is it?

762
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:46,248
What is it?

763
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,894
(On that day, I didn’t understand why Lin cut her hair short)

764
00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:14,497
(when she actually won the bet.)

765
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:20,820
Tong!

766
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:22,961
Shit!

767
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:26,267
What did you do to your hair?

768
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:28,875
Tong’s done for.

769
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,781
This is my natural hair color, Sir.

770
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,426
Do you think I have short legs that I wouldn't catch up, huh?

771
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:37,347
I trust you now, Mai.

772
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:37,882
Trust me on what?

773
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:39,382
He wouldn’t be able to catch up.

774
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:45,164
(From then on, I wanted to study hard)

775
00:42:45,705 --> 00:42:49,922
(because I knew that it’s what made Lin happy.)

776
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:52,089
You’re still smiling, are you?

777
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:55,770
Buy me a new shoe polish, understand?

778
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,247
Do you understand?

779
00:42:57,715 --> 00:42:58,738
Turn this way.

780
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,005
No one’s as naughty as you are.

781
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,738
You’re the most naughty one in the 3 realms.

782
00:43:04,903 --> 00:43:06,288
Here.

783
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,581
I think the reason why Lin cut her hair short

784
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,060
is because she has feelings for me.

785
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,572
Oh, Lin.

786
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:18,693
Why didn’t you just tell me you like me?

787
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:19,887
What?

788
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:25,252
It’s obvious that Lin cut her hair short to please me.

789
00:43:25,252 --> 00:43:26,309
Huh?

790
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,534
Lin likes me.

791
00:43:28,854 --> 00:43:29,816
Huh?

792
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,703
What are you ‘Huh’-ing for?

793
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:35,700
Shall we just ask Lin why she cut her hair short?

794
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,727
Let’s do it.

795
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:38,682
Come on.

796
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,412
Lin,

797
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:42,317
we have something to ask you.

798
00:43:44,507 --> 00:43:45,352
What is it?

799
00:43:45,746 --> 00:43:48,988
We were wondering why you decided to cut your hair short.

800
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:50,669
That’s right, that’s right.

801
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,425
Oh.

802
00:43:51,425 --> 00:43:52,790
Right.

803
00:43:58,451 --> 00:43:59,541
It’s fine.

804
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:03,167
You don’t have to answer, I do understand.

805
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:07,662
And I wanted to let you know that I’m just like you.

806
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,014
I like you too, Lin.

807
00:44:10,802 --> 00:44:11,868
Ew.

808
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:12,786
What’s up with you?

809
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:15,917
Do you all have a narcissistic complex?

810
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:19,340
I didn't know it was contagious.

811
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:22,613
And what’s wrong with that, Giraffe?

812
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:24,448
Do you want to get kicked by a Giraffe, Mai?

813
00:44:24,448 --> 00:44:25,274
Hey!

814
00:44:25,274 --> 00:44:26,051
Ja-Oh!

815
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:27,007
Help!

816
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,599
Lin!

817
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:31,892
Can I ask you frankly?

818
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,549
Why did you cut your hair?

819
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:41,511
I cut my hair because…

820
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:42,788
Because…

821
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:44,753
Because…

822
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:46,978
Because…

823
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:51,046
Because short hair is trendy right now

824
00:44:51,415 --> 00:44:53,144
and I wanted to switch up my look a little.

825
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:53,906
What do you think?

826
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:54,552
Is it nice?

827
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:55,371
Yeah.

828
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:57,752
I think you look cute in this hair.

829
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:02,136
Tong!

830
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:03,207
Your hair!

831
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:05,418
Why is it like that?

832
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:09,460
Why?

833
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:10,606
Not cool?

834
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:21,617
It’s cooler than my hair.

835
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:25,544
Mai!

836
00:45:26,274 --> 00:45:27,142
Shit!

837
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:48,570
It’s over!

838
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,987
Hey, hey, calm down.

839
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:51,438
We still have the University Entrance Exam.

840
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:51,994
Huh?

841
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:54,534
I’m so jealous of you.

842
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,087
You have boys trailing behind you from the first day until the graduation day.

843
00:45:58,087 --> 00:45:59,419
So which one are you choosing?

844
00:46:02,418 --> 00:46:04,787
When I think of not being able to see you guys again,

845
00:46:05,217 --> 00:46:06,971
it makes my heart sink.
