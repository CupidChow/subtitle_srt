187
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:09,162
Thank you.

188
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,571
Be careful not to touch the pot, it’s hot.

189
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:14,182
Ma’am,

190
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:16,953
can I get one more of the Longan drink?

191
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,566
I’m Kayan.

192
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,273
I mean, my friend wants one more of the Longan drink, please.

193
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:33,926
I’m Kayan.

194
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:36,706
Excuse me.

195
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:40,466
Yes? I’m Khon Dee.

196
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,903
My friend wants to order a drink.

197
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:49,234
A Longan drink.

198
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,109
Drinks?

199
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,143
Drinks, yes.

200
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:54,564
Drinks.

201
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:57,654
What did you want?

202
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,823
A Longan drink.

203
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:00,916
A Longan drink, please.

204
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:03,452
A Longan drink.

205
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:05,822
Well,

206
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,038
a Longan drink.

207
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:10,029
Longan-drink.

208
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,526
Go and do the dishes.

209
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:14,160
Mom wanted some meatballs, didn’t she?

210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,837
Meatballs.

211
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:18,959
Go, go and get the meatballs.

212
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:24,949
Meatballs.

213
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,158
What’s wrong with them?

214
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,962
That’s all the Thai words they know.

215
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:28,685
I see.

216
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:30,166
Their names are Khon Dee and Kayan.

217
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,693
Why did they take those names?

218
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:32,902
Did your mom name them?

219
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:35,833
When they came and asked for jobs, they only said,

220
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:36,870
“I’m a good person.”

221
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:38,564
“I’m diligent.”

222
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,191
So what should my mom call them?

223
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,364
Then if they came and said “I’m a bad person.” when they asked for jobs,

224
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:46,809
would your mom call them “Khun Shua”?

225
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,290
Maybe.

226
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:52,163
Then you can’t ask for a job here.

227
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:52,739
Why?

228
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,927
Because you would go “My crotch is itchy. My crotch is itchy.”

229
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:57,087
Damn you.

230
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,782
I’m starting to feel it when you mention it.

231
00:14:59,072 --> 00:14:59,758
My crotch itches.

232
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,840
What else did you want to order?

233
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:02,767
Fried eggs.

234
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,575
Hamburger.

235
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,222
Chicken rice.

236
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:06,556
We sell Khao Perp here.

237
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,017
Then I’m not having any.

238
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,531
If you don’t have it, we’re not having anything else.

239
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,595
If not then would you want to pay altogether or separately?

240
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,840
Hey.

241
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,330
What do you mean by paying separately?

242
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,784
Your mom’s treating us.

243
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,753
Thank you.

244
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:31,324
Let’s go!

245
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:35,265
You evil friends!

246
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:36,676
I will go cash your butts.

247
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:38,314
Mine was egg noodles!

248
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:40,738
Calm down, my boy.

249
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:41,378
There, there.

250
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:44,435
Mom! How can you let them eat for free?

251
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:45,897
Listen, Pao.

252
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,494
As a man, you have to be kind and sharing,

253
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:51,903
that’s what girls like.

254
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,059
Really, Mom?

255
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:54,912
Yeah.

256
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,044
Then shall we treat the entire class?

257
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:01,193
But if too much, we can be stripped bare, my meatball.

258
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,064
Then what should I do, Mom?

259
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,704
Oh, my boy.

260
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:06,769
You can’t come up with anything?

261
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,027
You must be hungry so you can’t think straight.

262
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:11,585
Sit down, I’ll make you something to eat so that you can think straight.

263
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:12,584
Sit down.

264
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,635
Sit down.

265
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:14,424
Wait a minute.

266
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,043
I’ll make one in an extra portion for you.

267
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,612
Just a second.

268
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,479
(Back then, for a 16-year-old like us,)

269
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:24,792
(the toughest thing and the thing we wanted to understand the most)

270
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,742
(was love.)

271
00:16:58,824 --> 00:16:59,565
Bank!

272
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,066
Dad!

273
00:17:01,877 --> 00:17:03,038
You almost hit my motorbike.

274
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,795
Don’t you feel like greeting your parents when you arrive?

275
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,007
You shouldn’t have bought him the motorbike, honey.

276
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,464
But you’re the one who bought it for me, Mom.

277
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,003
Right, it’s my fault then.

278
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:15,168
Come on.

279
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,233
It’s not your fault, Mom, Dad.

280
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:19,565
And you don’t have to worry.

281
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:21,223
Because

282
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,708
I’ve found a smart daughter-in-law for you.

283
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,950
My.

284
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,075
Where did you get the confidence that she’d like someone like you?

285
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,722
Right now, I have the 3 things girls like.

286
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:39,298
What’s that?

287
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:40,113
Yeah, what are they?

288
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,727
The first thing is the handsome face you guys gave me.

289
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:53,175
The second thing is girls like boys who play basketball.

290
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:56,465
The third is,

291
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:01,993
this steaming motorbike that takes girls places.

292
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,777
With these three things that father and mother gave me,

293
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,037
it’s just

294
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,113
Perfect.

295
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:20,192
I’m tired of listening to you.

296
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:23,434
It’s my fault that I bought him the motorbike.

297
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:24,254
I shouldn’t have.

298
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,167
Just let him be.

299
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:41,851
Lovely.

300
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:46,984
Clack!

301
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:48,073
Ooh!

302
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:54,113
I’ll have my boys delicious to you.

303
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
What did you say, sir?

304
00:18:57,854 --> 00:19:01,902
He said he would have his boys deliver the stuff to your house.

305
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,832
Can’t you understand that?

306
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:05,244
Okay.

307
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,465
So how much was that?

308
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,625
12,650.

309
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,365
12,650.

310
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:14,930
Can you give me a discount, ma’am?

311
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:18,797
I can’t. The woods are so expensive these days.

312
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:21,043
- I hardly make any profit from it.
- Hello, Granny.

313
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:25,094
- (There are also people who just don’t care about first love.)
- You’re so stingy. Didn’t you say your oldest daughter’s working in Bangkok and became rich?

314
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:29,129
(Because their first love is the family.)

315
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:37,768
Ranee is working in a big company with a secured position.

316
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:45,048
And Mai is going to take the university entrance exam in 3 years.

317
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:50,857
I’m sure he would make it into a great university because his smartness was passed on in the DNA.

318
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,934
Grandma, let’s get inside.

319
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:54,870
I think they’re going to have a long talk.

320
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,156
If his girlfriend is not someone smart, I wouldn’t let him have one.

321
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:56,707
Let’s go.

322
00:19:58,255 --> 00:19:58,814
That’s right.

323
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,450
If she’s not smart, they’re not going out.

324
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,078
No way.

325
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:04,376
Because our business is so prosperous,

326
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:06,883
we need someone smart to take care of our business.

327
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:07,969
That’s right.

328
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:10,329
Because for our generation, we’re both smart.

329
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:13,148
Honey, stop scratching!

330
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,344
Then please give me some discounts.

331
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,212
(Darunee’s rice shop.)

332
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:22,583
1 KG and 300 grams, right?

333
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,142
Here it is.

334
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:26,370
My, it’s pointing right at me.

335
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,255
I’m sorry, I can’t hide it.

336
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,670
Sing, go tidy up the stocking area.

337
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:51,508
Honey, I’ll go out and rent some movies with our boy.

338
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:53,682
What movie?

339
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,226
A new one, they said it’s really fun.

340
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,178
Please, Mom?

341
00:20:58,608 --> 00:20:59,530
An action movie?

342
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,195
Yes, an action movie.

343
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:03,532
They said it’s full of fight scenes, it’s gushing everywhere.

344
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:06,504
Guaranteed by the director, John Van.

345
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,915
You guys must be looking forward to it.

346
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:11,553
You guys must really be dying to see it.

347
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,098
Yes.

348
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:16,158
It’s superb.

349
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:18,984
There you go.

350
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:20,406
Missed the mark.

351
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,015
You deserved that.

352
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:24,488
It’s all because your dad’s like this.

353
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,367
Will our son ever be able to find us a daughter-in-law?

354
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,433
Why not?

355
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:29,546
Look at you.

356
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:30,985
Even you’ve agreed to become my wife.

357
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:34,299
Talking back, are you now?

358
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,404
Let’s go, son. We’ll miss it.

359
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:38,382
(I’ll get going, Mom.)

360
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:40,769
You’re so proud of it.

361
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:47,680
Hold on.

362
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,753
Come over here.

363
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:50,788
Where’s the money?

364
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:52,468
What money?

365
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,652
A customer came in just now.

366
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:55,896
The rice.

367
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:56,520
Yeah.

368
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,144
I’m keeping it right here, I was afraid it’d get lost.

369
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,614
Not even a single Baht was lost.

370
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:01,420
Here you go.

371
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:02,617
You wouldn’t have given me if I hadn’t asked.

372
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:06,753
Then how would we pay for the movie rental?

373
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:07,989
I got it, Dad.

374
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,377
When did you manage to get it?

375
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:11,384
When Mom went to the toilet. I took 3 notes.

376
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:13,757
You’re Daddy’s boy after all.

377
00:22:19,427 --> 00:22:20,125
See you!

378
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:28,126
(And there’s the 16-year-old who doesn’t care about anything.)

379
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:32,312
(Like me.)

380
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,595
Hey! Tong!

381
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,955
- Tong! What happened?
- Tong! Tong!

382
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:44,967
Miss, he got possessed!

383
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,002
Are you okay, Tong?

384
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,350
I’m not Tong.

385
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:19,439
(For troublemakers like us, we obviously did outstandingly naughty things.)

386
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:30,993
- Hurry up, Dong!
- Easy! Easy!

387
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:34,938
Hurry up, Pao!

388
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:35,900
Hurry up!

389
00:23:37,508 --> 00:23:38,982
Hurry up, Pao!

390
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:40,813
I should help push other friends up.

391
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:46,962
(For example, sneaking out of school for rice noodles during lunch)

392
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:49,546
(then climb back in for the afternoon class.)

393
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:55,488
Damn it.

394
00:23:56,655 --> 00:23:58,412
I shouldn’t have lost to Bank in black-and-whites.

395
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,608
I wanted to have the other sauce so badly.

396
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,312
What a bummer.

397
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:07,396
(To be quick, we would order the same sauce.)

398
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,787
(Even though some don’t like it,)

399
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,305
(it was never a problem.)

400
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,345
(For me, sneaking out of school for rice noodles during lunch and getting back for the afternoon class)

401
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:28,872
(was something super awesome that everyone in the school should praise us.)

402
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:30,932
Didn’t get caught.

403
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,588
Hurry up!

404
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,199
Wait for me, Pao!

405
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:42,985
Pao!

406
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,255
(But something awesome is always followed by)

407
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:51,501
(Teacher Sommai.)

408
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:09,901
Kleshas is something that clouds your mind.

409
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:15,413
(At that time, I didn’t feel like there was any difference between middle and high school.)

410
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,628
(They’re just as boring.)

411
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,491
(Just studying and taking exams.)

412
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:25,207
It spoils your mind, making it goes impure.
(Study and exams. So boring.)

413
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:32,440
Kleshas is not just an act of possession but also a sad mind.
(Nonetheless, we managed to find something fun to do.)

414
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:44,593
Not only the past or the present but also something that would affect or cause ripple effects on things to come in the future as well.

415
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,700
Hey! Tong!

416
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,413
Tong! What happened?

417
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:54,901
Tong! Tong!

418
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,936
Are you okay?

419
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:57,343
What’s going on?

420
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:04,006
Tong!

421
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:08,454
What’s wrong with Tong?

422
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:09,321
Are you okay, Tong?

423
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:10,279
I’m not Tong.

424
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:13,643
Miss, he got possessed!

425
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,562
Here we go!

426
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:26,541
I’m Sem the God.

427
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:29,513
Sem the God?

428
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,485
You!

429
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:36,265
Stop teaching right now.

430
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:38,109
It’s boring.

431
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:40,979
Yes. Yes.

432
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:49,815
What are you trying to do?

433
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:51,386
Pimnara.

434
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:55,101
Don’t make the God angry, Pimnara.

435
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,783
There’s no Sem the God, Miss.

436
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:59,439
There’s nothing but Phlegm in this guy.

437
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:00,416
Outrageous!

438
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:07,058
Pimnara! That’s enough.

439
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:10,032
Hey!

440
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:16,991
He’s possessed!

441
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:25,524
I’m the Naconda God.

442
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:32,417
You poisonous snake, I’m going to kill you!

443
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,599
Class is canceled today. Let’s just go home.

444
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,248
Are you done fooling around?

445
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:57,600
Are you still possessed?

446
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,633
Not anymore.

447
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:01,736
The God’s out.

448
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:04,439
Hey! How dare you kick me?

449
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:06,821
Oh, you’re not Sem the God anymore huh, Tong?

450
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:13,063
Hey!

451
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:16,377
Sit down.

452
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:18,009
Nicely.

453
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,009
Now.

454
00:28:26,844 --> 00:28:27,488
It’s alright now, miss.

455
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:41,137
Possessed? What were you even thinking?

456
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,955
You can’t fool a teacher like this.

457
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:45,725
It’s disrespectful.

458
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:47,457
You got that, Tong?

459
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:49,783
I’m not Tong.

460
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,659
If you’re not Tong then who are you?

461
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,006
Huh? Who are you?

462
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:54,357
I’m Nontawat.

463
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,652
Sir, I was just coming up with something fun to kill the boredom.

464
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:00,653
That’s right, sir.

465
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:02,267
We were just looking for something fun to do.

466
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,116
Nonsense!

467
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,141
It’s not playtime, it’s study time.

468
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:10,976
I’ve never seen anyone as troublesome as you guys.

469
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,592
Lin,

470
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:18,499
do you think there’s a ghost in our school?

471
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:23,908
Lin?

472
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:26,627
Did you hear what I asked?

473
00:29:27,947 --> 00:29:29,178
I have no idea either.

474
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:33,696
Pimnara, come here.

475
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:38,861
Stand here.

476
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,058
From now on, I will have Tong sit in front of you.

477
00:29:49,363 --> 00:29:54,539
Since you’re the class president, I assign you to get Tong to study.

478
00:29:54,902 --> 00:29:55,781
Can you do that?

479
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:02,081
For you, Teeradon,

480
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:03,928
go sit in front of Danai.

481
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:07,099
And don’t you do anything crazy like this again.

482
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:08,192
You got that?

483
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:11,195
Come, Miss.

484
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:13,315
This is huge.

485
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:22,143
Hey, what’s wrong?

486
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:23,283
It hurts.

487
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:31,432
Don’t rub salt in the wound!

488
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:36,512
Don’t rub salt in the wound!

489
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:41,549
Oh no, Dong.

490
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:43,561
What about our back-seat clan?

491
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:46,091
Do I have to move already?

492
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:47,130
Dong!

493
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,022
He’s not dead yet.

494
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:49,726
Dong!

495
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:50,891
He’s not dying.

496
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:51,995
Hey!

497
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,133
What did I do?

498
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,580
Our meatball~

499
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:00,041
Please take care of me.

500
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:02,863
(Though me and Lin has been in the same class since middle school)

501
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:06,054
(and now I’m getting moved to sit in front of her with less than a meter’s distance,)

502
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:12,181
(the distance between a model student like Lin and a troublemaker like me)

503
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:14,570
(is still as far.)

504
00:31:17,246 --> 00:31:18,298
Who actually should be the one complaining?

505
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,661
Stop whining like a baby already.

506
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:27,741
Do you think you’re better than others just because you’re the class president?

507
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:32,187
At least I’m better than you.

508
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:36,922
Don’t pay Tong any mind, Lin.

509
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,635
He’s just full of nonsense.

510
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:39,889
That’s right.

511
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,684
He does nothing but play with his rocket.

512
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,130
Shut up, Dong.

513
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:03,656
Are you asking for it?

514
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,046
Are you asking for it?

515
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:07,442
These childish boys.

516
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,181
They think girls would like it when they do that.

517
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:10,498
You can count me out.

518
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:12,592
I’d never like boys like that.

519
00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:14,940
Then what kind of boy do you like?

520
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:39,838
Don’t you think you owe me an apology?

521
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,533
Hey, don’t pick up on me.

522
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,957
I’ve had a rough day.

523
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:46,817
Who’s actually having it rough here?

524
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:48,142
I have to be taking care of you.

525
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:49,237
Such a burden.

526
00:32:50,192 --> 00:32:50,977
Burden?

527
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:52,548
I’m a burden?

528
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:53,643
That’s right.

529
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:55,627
Someone who needs another to look after him,

530
00:32:55,627 --> 00:32:57,027
what else would you call that if not a burden?

531
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:00,342
Then you don’t have to look after me.

532
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,854
I’m not someone who needs to be looked after.

533
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,085
Someone who only grows physically doesn’t usually know himself.

534
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:11,903
Are you giving me crap here?

535
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,131
Ouch!

536
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:18,691
Ow! That hurts!

537
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:20,116
That hurts so badly!

538
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:22,423
I’m sorry.

539
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:25,845
I just happen to be born big, and not short.

540
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:29,753
I meant your brain is small.

541
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,212
You didn’t even get that?

542
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:32,612
Hey, you!

543
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:33,419
Tong.

544
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,296
Don’t you touch my friend.

545
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:38,841
Hey! Hey! Hey!

546
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:40,681
Don’t be too confident.

547
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:41,443
You will…

548
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:41,943
Ow!

549
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:42,473
You will…

550
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:42,973
You.

551
00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:43,473
Don’t.

552
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:43,973
You will.

553
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:44,542
Ow!

554
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:47,430
Don’t you want to help me out?

555
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,260
That’s enough, Tong.

556
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:52,028
Don’t be childish.

557
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:52,884
That’s right.

558
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,097
You’re in grade 10, not 10 years old.

559
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,566
Hey, Pao. Whose side are you taking?

560
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:58,664
Are you even my friend?

561
00:33:58,664 --> 00:33:59,812
I’m not taking any sides.

562
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:01,492
We’re classmates.

563
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:04,195
Another thing, Lin and Ja-Oh are girls.

564
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:05,205
That’s right.

565
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:06,569
Hold on.

566
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:08,213
I haven’t even done anything.

567
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,586
You guys haven’t done anything, there’s only me who’s been taking slaps.

568
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,854
What are you looking at?

569
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,547
Let the boys be.

570
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:19,074
Hold up.

571
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:21,503
Where are you going, traitor?

572
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:23,961
Aren’t we going to Auntie Phon’s, my dude?

573
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,176
Come on.

574
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:28,744
Cool guys like us aren’t going to Auntie Phon’s.

575
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:30,582
That’s right.

576
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,278
Let’s go!

577
00:34:33,278 --> 00:34:34,203
Go!

578
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,420
Lin, do you want to come with me?

579
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,813
I’ve got a seat.

580
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,105
My motorbike’s available too.

581
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,721
You guys have so much free time, huh?

582
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:13,288
Do you guys have plenty of free time?

583
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:14,784
Get lost.

584
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:15,320
Go!

585
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,935
Bank! Bank!

586
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:24,275
They have lots of time on their hands, do they?

587
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,491
These childish boys.

588
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:32,030
They think girls would like it when they do that.

589
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:34,040
That’s not true.

590
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,693
You can count me out.

591
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,629
I’d never like boys like that.

592
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:41,952
Then what kind of boy do you like?

593
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:45,015
I don’t know.

594
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,890
I only know that I don’t like a boy who’s dumber than me.

595
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:52,315
Let them be, Lin.

596
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,342
Let’s go to Auntie Phon’s.

597
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:21,093
(After school, kids in the neighborhood would gather at Auntie Phon’s milk shop.)

598
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:22,155
The usual, right?

599
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:26,276
(It’s where you can find pretty people and delicious food.)

600
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,957
I’m so annoyed.

601
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:34,262
Why would Mr. Sommai have me look after Tong?

602
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:36,765
I think Tong’s kind of cute.

603
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:39,233
How’s he cute?

604
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:41,585
He keeps sticking things up his nose.

605
00:36:41,725 --> 00:36:42,918
That’s disgusting.

606
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:46,671
Like this?

607
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,881
Yes, exactly.

608
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,633
Why would you want to stick that into your nostrils?

609
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,413
Come on.

610
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,259
He can’t be of any harm.

611
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:58,659
He’s probably just fooling around just as Dong said.

612
00:36:59,943 --> 00:37:04,753
And what did they mean when they said “Playing with his rocket”?

613
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,605
[Haeb’s Salon]

614
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:11,296
But for trashy guys like us,

615
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,181
we would gather at Uncle Haeb’s salon.

616
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:17,593
Why?

617
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:20,948
Because he’s got some good stuff.

618
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:21,997
Uncle Haeb!

619
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:24,189
What’s up, Dong?

620
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,986
You’re funny just like your dad, Dong.

621
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,530
Do you have any new and good movies, uncle?

622
00:37:32,956 --> 00:37:34,338
A new lot.

623
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:39,245
Do you want a cartoon one or something special?

624
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:41,852
Something special.

625
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:44,843
Spatial?

626
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:47,366
Not that! You dummy!

627
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:50,755
I wonder how special it is already, Uncle.

628
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:54,218
You sure are eager about it, Dong.

629
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:55,993
I’ve prepared it for you.

630
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:58,125
Over there.

631
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,214
Where? The backdoor?

632
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:02,767
There’s no backdoor! Get behind the store.

633
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:03,484
Oh, behind the door.

634
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:06,393
Keep it down or ‘Sunk’ will be here.

635
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:08,120
You’re in a hurry, aren’t you?

636
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:13,096
What’s ‘Sunk’?

637
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:15,445
That’s a word during my dad’s time.

638
00:38:15,445 --> 00:38:16,831
He could have just said ‘the police’.

639
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:18,032
Oh, it means the police?

640
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:18,867
Mm-hm.

641
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:19,367
Let’s go.

642
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:24,777
[Rhino’s power.]

643
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:28,519
Hey, guys, have you watched this?

644
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:31,584
The love volcano.

645
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:32,692
Balcony!

646
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:37,615
I’m sorry, Mai, I only watch AV.

647
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:39,627
What’s AV?

648
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,468
AV is the abbreviation of Adult Video.

649
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:46,849
It means videos that adults watch.

650
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:48,332
About Video?

651
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:49,684
Adult!

652
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:51,685
But we’re 16, how can we watch that?

653
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:53,511
Oh, Mai the Scratcher.

654
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,511
It’s like you’re studying in advance.

655
00:38:56,011 --> 00:38:57,112
After you study,

656
00:38:57,112 --> 00:39:02,005
you’ll understand everything clearly when you grow into an adult.

657
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:02,835
Damn!

658
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,085
But I don’t like studying.

659
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:08,014
That was metaphorical!

660
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,762
You sure are Gim-Hea’s nephew.

661
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:11,509
Dong, you crazy boy.

662
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,919
Take the cat collar off. I can’t breathe.

663
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,603
It won’t come off, Uncle.

664
00:39:16,142 --> 00:39:17,468
It won’t come off.

665
00:39:17,786 --> 00:39:19,533
I’m not a cat. Get it off!

666
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:20,522
Uncle!

667
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,200
I’ll take  F16.

668
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,917
You got it.

669
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,565
Uncle! Please let me take this as a plus-one.

670
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:28,141
You’re joking. 80 Baht for that.

671
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:29,600
Uncle, can I have this one for free?

672
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,293
Fine, that one’s for the fatty.

673
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:55,039
(My house is downtown, next to the market in the living quarter.)

674
00:39:55,765 --> 00:40:02,401
(Actually, I was considered a very cool guy from the girl’s point of view.)

675
00:40:03,446 --> 00:40:07,805
(But to get there, I had to train very hard.)

676
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,499
I am back.

677
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,384
Keep it down. It’s a waste of gas.

678
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:27,417
You bastard.

679
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:31,090
Whose mom is this? She’s so lovely.

680
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,743
(Because for me,)

681
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:34,167
Get watched and do your homework.

682
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:35,426
Got it!
(the coolest guy)

683
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:37,485
(is a strong guy.)

684
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:43,484
(I have a dream of becoming as strong as the Thai action film’s hero,)

685
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,180
(Panna Rittikrai.)

686
00:40:56,543 --> 00:41:00,285
(I got this idea from my Mom,)

687
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:04,196
(the strongest and most awesome person in the house.)

688
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:07,860
(Actually, maybe she’s stronger than anyone in town.)

689
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:08,948
Mom!

690
00:41:08,948 --> 00:41:09,808
Yeah?

691
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:10,599
Is dinner done?

692
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:12,223
No.

693
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:17,767
This looks delicious.

694
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:21,152
Tong! I told you to put something on.

695
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:23,323
You’re all grown up now.

696
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:24,835
It’s not only my body that grew up, though.

697
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:27,024
That’s hot!

698
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:28,249
No, no, Mom!

699
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:30,804
That’s dangerous.

700
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:34,605
Tong. The school called today.

701
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:37,023
How could you do that?

702
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,553
Didn’t you feel embarrassed in front of the teachers?

703
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,367
Save my face for a little when you do things.

704
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,632
I’m embarrassed.

705
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:50,023
Where did you get such a filthy personality?

706
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:54,483
From you, old cow.

707
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,246
You’re all old and wrinkled yet still go around naked.

708
00:41:57,486 --> 00:41:58,965
That’s why he took after you.

709
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:00,104
Sit your butt down!

710
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:11,144
Your grade dropped because you’ve been chasing girls, haven’t you?

711
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,267
I have no interest in girls.

712
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,325
I have no interest in boys either.

713
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:29,987
Why is your front door closed?

714
00:42:29,987 --> 00:42:31,919
I brought you some bananas.

715
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:35,978
Oh, my.

716
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,964
You have some of your own.

717
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:39,974
Two of them.

718
00:42:41,753 --> 00:42:43,445
This just ripens.

719
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,593
This one you have to hurry up and eat it.

720
00:42:45,593 --> 00:42:46,305
Why’s that?

721
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:48,485
It’s beyond ripened.

722
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:53,016
You have your own already so I’m not giving you any.

723
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:54,045
Oh? Granny?

724
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:09,285
(Talking about girls,)

725
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:13,706
(the boys in my gang have their ways of hitting on Lin.)

726
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,885
Girls, I have something to show you.

727
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:19,383
What is it this time, Mai?

728
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:24,145
Lin, I came up with a new magic trick and wanted to be the first to see it.

729
00:43:26,162 --> 00:43:27,245
Look at this, Lin.

730
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:30,160
The rubber band is on the right right now.

731
00:43:31,223 --> 00:43:33,685
I will move it to the left.

732
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:39,445
How’s that, Lin?

733
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,009
Welp, Mai.

734
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:43,166
You just switched your fingers.

735
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:43,971
So lame.

736
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:47,754
If it’s not satisfying for you, Ja-Oh.

737
00:43:48,474 --> 00:43:50,081
I have one just for you.
(For Mai,)

738
00:43:50,624 --> 00:43:53,245
(he believes that girls like boys who are good at magic tricks.)

739
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:54,072
Watch this, Ja-Oh.

740
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:56,537
(But the problem is…)

741
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:57,960
Burrp.

742
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:00,995
Mai!!

743
00:44:03,394 --> 00:44:04,411
Ja-Oh.

744
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:05,472
(He doesn’t know how to do magic tricks.)

745
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,996
(Apart from a boy like Mai,)

746
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:16,477
(there’s Bank who thinks girls will like a cool boy like him.)

747
00:44:16,477 --> 00:44:17,084
Hey!

748
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:17,752
- Oops.
- My!

749
00:44:22,123 --> 00:44:23,218
I’m sorry, Lin.

750
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:25,303
Did you have anything to say, Bank?

751
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,700
When a ball falls, I can still pick it up.

752
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:37,398
But for my heart that fell for you, just keep it.

753
00:44:37,623 --> 00:44:41,205
(But he never knows that girls find it super corny.)

754
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:45,445
Bank, stop being corny.

755
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,056
Go!

756
00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:49,477
Love destroyer.

757
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,160
Let’s go, Lin.

758
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,312
We have to start planning our future.

759
00:44:56,312 --> 00:44:59,070
(For Pao, he uses maturity as strength.)

760
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:04,033
Where are we going to study? Which faculty?
(He’s hitting on girls based on the theory that girls like mature guys.)

761
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,029
In theory, we should choose a stable job that provides nice welfare.

762
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:13,212
(But Pao’s theory is so boring.)

763
00:45:14,038 --> 00:45:17,274
Or choose something that secures you a job after graduation.

764
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:20,932
And what’s that?

765
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:23,160
A factory.

766
00:45:23,576 --> 00:45:24,871
He was talking about the ‘faculty’!

767
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:26,363
I was talking about something serious, Dong.

768
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:27,693
I’m being serious.

769
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:28,477
Sit down.

770
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:29,409
I want to lie down.

771
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:32,762
Lin, Ja-Oh.

772
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:35,328
We have to carefully plan our future.

773
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:40,195
My dad told me before he died, that you shouldn’t joke around with life.

774
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:43,053
Otherwise, your life will turn into a joke.

775
00:45:44,612 --> 00:45:46,921
Teacher! Teeradon’s smoking!

776
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:49,743
A big one as that!

777
00:45:56,657 --> 00:46:00,202
(The one with the weirdest way of flirting is Dong.)

778
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:02,690
(He thinks that girls like someone who can play an instrument.)

779
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:04,132
(He was right.)

780
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:07,951
(But this was his choice of music.)

781
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:25,839
Dong!

782
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,186
I don’t like it.

783
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:31,211
Oh, you don’t like this song?

784
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:32,765
I’ll play something else.

785
00:46:38,723 --> 00:46:40,835
Hey! Whose mom just died?

786
00:46:48,229 --> 00:46:50,875
(For me? I don’t do things that they do.)

787
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:55,525
(Because a legendarily dreamy girl is waiting for me in my room.)

788
00:47:28,747 --> 00:47:30,297
I want to give you a tryout.

789
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:31,859
Is this a love tryout?
[Tong’s exercise book.]

790
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:33,686
A brain tryout.

791
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:36,969
(From now on, do anything to make him concentrate on his studies.)

792
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:37,876
The exercise.

793
00:47:37,876 --> 00:47:40,894
Why would you want another student to look after me?

794
00:47:40,894 --> 00:47:42,834
Why don’t you like studying?

795
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:46,160
I was afraid that if I was studious, I would become smarter than you.

796
00:47:46,403 --> 00:47:48,628
Can I ask you something very serious?

797
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:51,006
You like Lin, right?
