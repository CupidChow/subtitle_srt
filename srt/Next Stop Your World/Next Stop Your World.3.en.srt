is that she saved my life twice.

She's my rescuer.

Why?

00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,839
Because my identity is special.

104

Can you help me

105

106
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,920
Your identity is special.

to prove his innocence.

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
I saved you twice.

don't you?

114
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,000
You know me well.

115
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,000
And I know you said

116

that I am the key to your life.

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
I really have to go now.

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,920
Just believe me.

119
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,120
I'll explain it to you

120

when the time is right.

121
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,040
When the time is right.

122
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,560
When?

123
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,519
Give me a specific time

124

if you want me to believe you.

125

How about this?

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,079
After I'm discharged from the hospital?

127
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,319
Okay.

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,800

How do I go back?

Miss Wu.

144
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,560
I am...

145
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240
I am at the bus stop
in front of the hospital.

We'll see each other soon.

Have you been waiting
for me these two months?

148
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,639
I...

149
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,160
Otherwise,

150
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,040
why are you still wearing
the same clothes?

151
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,399
Well...

152
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,879
I don't have many clothes.

153
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,079

and these three.

159

Okay.

160
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,680
She'll try them all.

161

Miss Wu, please come with me.

162
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,199
Two months passed in the comic.

163
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,920
What about in the real world?

164
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,319
I'm not reported missing, am I?

165
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,560
How can I go back?

166
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,519
Miss Wu.

167
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,519
Do you need any help?

168
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,199
I'll go out right away.

169

Let me see.

170
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,319
Usually, a chapter of a comic

171
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,360
ends with a suspenseful point.

172
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,480
That means

173
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,360
if I want to go back,

174
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,920
