17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,200
suddenly appeared
in the detention house.

18
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,920
Now she is under guard.

19

You mean she's been hiding there?

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,640
Get me a meeting with her.

21

I'll see her right away.

22

Hey.

00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:15,920
Okay.

Are you okay?

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,200
Why did you do that?

26
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,159
I'm happy

27
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,599
to see you okay now.

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,840
Why didn't I...?

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,359
Why didn't you die?

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
Because it just happened

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,959
that a runner who could swim passed by

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,480
when you jumped into the lake,

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,719
so you were saved luckily.

34
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,920
How is your dad?

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,319
He has recovered.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,560
He told me

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,159
you were not gonna kill him.

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,439
So,

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
your dad saved me?

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,799
It was me.

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,439
So,

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,760
I saved you three times.

You can find

another goal in life.

46
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,239
Why do you have to end your life

47
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,200
to escape?

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,079
How can a person
live his life with just hate?

49
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,079
If you really don't find a goal,

50
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,159
how about thinking
of a way to get me out of here?

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,520
In a legitimate manner.

52
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,080
Then I won't
have to be chased by the police

53

to save a suspect?

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,479
It's hard, so you should do it.

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,879
Then

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,599
I won't think about anything else.

A sequel?

69
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,159
I'm different from my dad.

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,360
I don't like revenge and homicide.

71
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,199
I prefer sweet love stories.

I'm pulled in here.

154
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
I was last time
at the bottom of the lake,

and this time.

156

I am afraid.

So I've listed a few options.

Number one, Cinderella

Number two, romantic self-guided tour.

Number three, simple romance.

171
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
What are you exactly

172
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,799
talking about?

173
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,279
Number four, sexy, X-rated style.

174
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,919
Tell her what I just said.

175
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,039
I've got things to do.

176
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,039
Which of these four options

177
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
do you choose?

178
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,360
What does it mean?

179
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,320
He's gonna return the favor

180
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,279
with something sweet and romantic.

181
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,200
That's too formulaic.

182
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,360
He can't just make four plans

183
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,559
for me to choose from.

184
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,799
It's not work,
requiring him to write a proposal.

185
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,519
Come on.

186
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,200
Choose quickly.

187
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
We need to prepare in advance.

188
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,519
Do I really have to choose?

189
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah.

190
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,879
Well,

191
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,200
I choose number three.

192
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,519
That's number four.

193
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,799
Number three, number three.

194
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
Okay.

195
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,720
The lawyer's gonna tell you

196
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
something.

197
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,039
