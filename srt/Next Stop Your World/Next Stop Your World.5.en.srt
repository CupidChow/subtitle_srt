Are you better?

17

Still dizzy.

18
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,040
It's probably because of the pill.

Aren't you a doctor?

20

How come you don't go to the doctor

Where am I?

22
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,760
This is my home.

23
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,519
I live here.

24
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,400
Zhongye Villa.

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,920
Away from the bustle of the city.

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,040
Top-class security system.

27
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,439
There's nothing you don't know.

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,719
What else do you know?

29
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,599
You were traumatized

30
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,159
after your family got murdered.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
So you bought this villa

32
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,439
away from downtown.

33
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,240
How do you know?

34
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,560
Back then,

35
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,000
you stood on the roof.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
I was so afraid that you would jump.

37
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,719
That scene

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,759
made me so sad.

39
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,360
And I cried.

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,599
Zhe.

41
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,280
Where did you go?

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,680
I told you to guard the gate.

43
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,680
Zicheng texted us

44
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,879
to see him in the garden.

45
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,400
We went there

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,080
but didn't see him.

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,599
Where is he?

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,000
I contacted him.

49
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,159
He said he didn't text us.

50
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,960
But the message was sent from his phone.

51
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,479
(I swear I'll find you.)

52
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,120
Where am I?

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,040
Jiang Zhe's home?

54
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,120
I knew it.

55
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,759
Why am I in the comics again?

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,600
Why?

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
You're up.

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,199
How do you feel?

59
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,839
Fine.

60
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,360
Did something happen to me?

61
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,360
You had a fever due to fatigue.

62
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,079
But you're fine now.

63
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,160
Fatigue?

64
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,480
You've been in bed for two days.

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,720
Maybe something made you exhausted.

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,199
Do you need anything?

67
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:05,720
I...

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,600
Can I have a shower?

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,920
We prepared some clothes for you.

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
Take your time.

71
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,800
Wow.

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
This is way too luxurious.

73
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,560
Sis, aren't you scared

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,560
that things may lose control

75
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
when you're dragged into the comics?

She's having a shower.

Didn't I tell you

not to leave her alone

84

I can't watch her shower.

What now?

N-Nothing.

You did what you did.

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,199
That's not "nothing".

93
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,000
Stay back.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
Or I'll shoot you.

95
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,120
Really?

96
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,439
You appeared out of nowhere,

97
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,240
slapped me for no reason,

98
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,920
kissed me against my will,

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,439
and disappeared into thin air.

100
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,959
Now you're standing here in pajamas,

101
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,079
pointing a gun at me.

102
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,399
What are you trying to do?

103
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,519
I know it's hard to comprehend.

104
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,720
It's the same for me.

105
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,480
But I'm doing this

106
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,439
for a good reason.

107
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,240
What is it?

108
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,639
Stay back.

109
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,680
I swear I'll shoot.

110
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Why bother talking

111
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,879
if you're going to shoot?

112
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
I...

113
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,920
How can you shoot someone

114
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,079
without bullets?

115
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,480
Don't you have common sense?

116
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,360
What are you doing?

117
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,319
I have 100 questions for you.

118
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,439
But you only need to
answer one of them first.

119
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,639
How did you
disappear from the fitting room?

120
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,920
Tell me the truth.

121
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,680
Or I'll have to call the police.

122
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,079
That is outrageous.

123
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
You said I was your savior.

124
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,800
You did save my life.

125
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,920
That's why I bought you clothes.

126
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,279
But why did you disappear

127
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,519
without a word?

128
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,199
And why did you

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
slap me in the face

130
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,480
and then kiss me?

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,919
Take your time.

132
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,639
Don't worry.

133
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,600
I have plenty of time.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,159
Because that was the only way

135
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,960
for me to disappear.

136
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,080
To disappear?

137
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
That kiss.

138
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,519
So you're saying

139
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
that you'll disappear

140
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,399
if you kiss me.

141
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,080
Is that right?

142
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,879
Yeah.

143
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,559
So stop questioning me.

144
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,519
Let me go.

145
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,960
