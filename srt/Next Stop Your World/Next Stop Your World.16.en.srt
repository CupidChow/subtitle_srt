=Episode 16=

16
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,920
A real gun.

17
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,400
The bathroom?

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
She's not there.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,120
I'm here.

20
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,239
I found her.

21
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,079
Talk later.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,200
Are you okay?

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,040
I almost died.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,920
The murderer shot at me.

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,920
Where?

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,040
In my world.

27
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,200
He called me.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
I got terrified

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
and tried to escape.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,319
While we were starting the car,

31
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,680
he appeared right in front of us

32
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,079
and shot at me.

33
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,400
I got here

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,680
before

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,239
I was shot.

36
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,280
What about Liu Feng?

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
He's still in the car.

38
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,680
I apologize.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,879
Don't kill me.

41
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,519
Spare my life.

42
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,640
Spare my life.

43
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,640
Spare my life.

44
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,360
What if he shoots Liu Feng?

45
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,039
You're the target.

46
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,080
Not Liu.

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,280
Oh,

48
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,800
did your dad say anything

49
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,919
about this?

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,719
No.

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,759
And I don't know when he'll be back.

52
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:24,879
Okay.

53
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,000
Let me check on Shenshen first.

54
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,680
I'll go with you.

55
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,080
Shenshen, it's me.

56
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,280
Open up.

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,479
The code is 0412.

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,919
Liu Feng likes Lu Shenshen,

59
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,479
so he made the code his birthday.

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Shenshen.

61
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,840
Shenshen.

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,639
Jiang Zhe.

63
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,240
I think I'm dying.

64
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,319
My hands are gone.

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,280
And my body is starting to disappear.

66
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,919
Shenshen, you're just drunk.

67
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,319
Is that right?

68
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,199
Yeah.

69
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,719
You're fine.

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
You're totally fine.

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,639
But you don't want me anymore.

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,360
I thought you'd marry me.

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,599
Why would you marry Wu Yanzhu?

74
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,719
I...

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Shenshen, you got me wrong.

76
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,000
I won't marry Wu Yanzhu.

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,879
We're pretending to get married.

78
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,400
You're the most important one to me.

79
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,080
Really?

80
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,360
Do you need me?

81
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,039
Of course.

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,199
I need you.

83
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,919
Sleep.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
It's all gonna be fine.

85
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,960
Shenshen used to be the heroine.

86
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,439
I guess she's disappearing

87
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,280
because of me.

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
This is the setting of this world.

89
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,080
Irrelevant characters

90
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,879
simply disappear.

91
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,960
Cruel, huh?

92
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,759
But this is not how I want it to be.

93
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,959
Let's get some fresh air.

94
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,839
Do you remember this place?

95
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,560
Of course.

96
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,680
I thought you'd die here.

97
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,000
I was scared to death.

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,160
Okay.

99
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,160
One less thing to do.

100
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,600
Is it really a good time for this?

101
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,600
Yanzhu.

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,120
Once you

103
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
return to the real world,

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,199
can you do me a favor?

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,519
Draw a chapter for me.

106
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,519
About what?

107
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,160
A dream.

108
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,680
Make everything from the moment we met

109
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,040
to the last second

110
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,639
into a dream.

111
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,319
A very long dream.

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,920
It shouldn't be hard for you.

113
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,720
Why?

114
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,079
The murderer

115
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,399
went to your world because of me.

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,759
And my friend almost disappeared.

117
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,000
Most importantly,

118
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,160
I don't want you to die.

119
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,720
If it's my fate

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,839
to be chasing after

121
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,040
a phantom,

122
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,399
then I'll accept it.

123
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,879
Do you understand, Yanzhu?

124
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,360
I...

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
I understand.

126
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
Take this flash drive.

127
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,720
Once you go back,

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,319
start drawing right away.

129
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,680
No hesitation.

130
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,920
Because the murderer
may show up anytime anywhere.

131
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Can you do that?

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Yanzhu.

133
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,319
There are so many things

134
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,199
I'd like to do with you.

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,199
But

136
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,800
we have no time.

137
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,439
I'd really love to hug you again.

138
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,279
But I'm afraid I won't be able to let go

139
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,480
if I hug you.

140
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,199
I'm just a comic character.

141
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,759
Come and visit

142
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,240
whenever you miss me.

143
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,040
But don't tell anyone

144
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,959
that you remember me.

145
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,480
That may put you

146
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,000
in danger.

147
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,399
Forget me.

148
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,560
Wu Yanzhu.

149
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,160
Bye.

150
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,600
You woke up.

151
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,839
How are you?

152
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,680
Are you okay?

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Yeah.

154
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,680
Did you find the person
who stabbed me on the rooftop?

155
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,439
No.

156
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,040
It may take quite a while

157
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,199
to go through the surveillance record.

158
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,759
There are too many things
to take care of now.

159
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,560
Are you

160
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,040
crying?

161
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't know why.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,879
But it feels like a long dream.

163
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
What kind of dream?

164
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,519
Don't be sad.

165
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,480
I don't remember.

166
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,360
Anyway,

167
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,839
you're just way too bold.

168
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560
You didn't even know who that was

169
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,959
and just went on the rooftop.

170
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,720
That was

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,959
totally suicidal.

172
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,879
You know?

173
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
Thankfully, someone found you.

174
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,439
Do you know
