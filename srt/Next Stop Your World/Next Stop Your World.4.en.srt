(To be continued)

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,439
What did she mean?

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,159
What is going on?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,120
Mr. Wu, the editor just called.

20
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,680
The manuscript got uploaded.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,640
Tell them

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,280
it's a mistake.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,159
Withdraw it now.

24
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,799
But there're already 100,000 views.

25
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,959
I said withdraw it.

26
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,239
Okay.

27
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
Dad, did you see the update?

28
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,080
Do you still think
that Jiang Zhe is only a character?

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,560
I've seen him in person twice.

30
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,840
And I saved him both times.

31
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,520
Are you

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,479
calling me a murderer?

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
I created the story.

34
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm just taking out a character.

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
How is that murder?

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
A comic character

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,479
became a monster.

38
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,960
I should have
made him jump off the roof back then.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,919
That's enough.

40
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,159
Think of this as a fantasy.

41
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,039
Forget him.

42
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,879
But dad,

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
I've lived through those scenarios.

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,639
How can I think of it as a fantasy?

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,439
Have you found her?

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Find her

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,120
no matter what.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,839
Who are you?

49
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,639
Liu Feng,

50
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,199
where's my dad?

51
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,279
He went out.

52
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,399
Where did he go again?

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,480
No idea.

54
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,600
He left with his luggage
and the drawing tablet.

55
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,319
Yanzhu,

56
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,480
there's something wrong.

57
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,759
If your dad wanted Jiang Zhe dead,

58
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,199
why did he make you save him?

59
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,040
And the comics have been uploaded.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,360
You...

61
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,240
Liu Feng,

62
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,800
do you think I'd wear dresses and shoes

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,959
like these?

64
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,279
Do you think

65
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,560
I'd buy a dress like this?

66
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,879
Do you know how pricy it is?

67
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,800
Among the people I know,

68
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
who could afford a dress like this?

69
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,600
Your dad?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Don't tell me it's Jiang Zhe.

71
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,120
That's right.

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,000
It's him.

73
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,839
It's not that my dad drew the comics.

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,680
I got dragged into the comics.

75
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,920
What's going on here?

76
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,199
Do you believe in paranormal events?

77
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,439
You still haven't found Wu Yanzhu?

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,439
No.

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,959
It's like she just disappeared.

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,199
Yanzhu,

81
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,040
how did you get into the comics?

82
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,800
I have no idea.

83
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,879
But I know one thing for sure.

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,360
Jiang Zhe is the center of that world.

85
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
Anything unrelated to him

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,879
won't be in the update.

87
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,720
For example,

88
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,439
the places I visit on my own

89
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,000
and the things on my mind

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,040
aren't shown in the comics.

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,639
Is that even possible?

92
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,000
That's how it is.

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,639
And the chapter ends only when Jiang Zhe

94
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,079
gets emotional.

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
Then I can come back.

96
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,000
So I had to do that.

97
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,199
Do what?

98
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,680
Don't tell me

99
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,079
you kissed him for real.

100
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,839
Come on.

101
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,319
I had to do something.

102
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,680
Or I'll have to scare him and stuff.

103
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,800
Come on.

104
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,360
You did it on purpose.

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
I know you're a fan of his.

106
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,279
How did it feel?

107
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,759
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,360
What was it like to kiss

109
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,879
a comic character?

110
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,399
Come on, that was an urgent situation.

111
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,600
I didn't pay attention.

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,360
I was desperate to come back here.

113
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,240
By the way,

114
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,199
your dad wanted to finish this today

115
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,879
with a new ending.

116
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,040
Now that I think of it,

117
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,800
he wants to kill Jiang Zhe.

118
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
Again?

119
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,600
Where are you going?

120
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,319
I must check
Jiang Zhe's character settings

121
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,720
(Jiang Zhe's character settings)
to see why it's happening.

122
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,519
Sis, aren't you scared
that something may go wrong

123
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,199
when you're with Jiang Zhe?

124
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,360
What do you mean?

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,519
I mean

126
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,879
aren't you scared
that things may lose control

127
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,600
when you're dragged into the comics?

128
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,079
(Guarded luxurious residence)
I could only leave

129
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,800
when the protagonist got emotional.

130
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,040
But how did I enter that world?

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,199
They kissed?

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,040
Mr. Jiang followed her
to the fitting room

133
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,600
and came out alone.

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
That lady seemed to have disappeared.

135
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,680
Disappeared?

136
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,279
Yeah.

137
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,439
Show me where it is.

138
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:26,920
Hello.

139
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
I found Wu Yanzhu.

140
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,720
What?

141
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,319
On my way.

142
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,080
What's going on?

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,919
That's something I'd like to know.

144
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,759
Why did you say

145
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,679
that she disappeared?

146
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,679
Wu Yanzhu?

147
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,919
She doesn't wake up.

148
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,639
Where are you going?

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,799
Home.

150
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,080
Stay here and handle it.

151
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,399
Where is Yanzhu?

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,919
Jiang Zhe, isn't...

153
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,080
Isn't she Wu Yanzhu?

154
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,600
What's going on?

155
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,799
Finally,

156
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,519
she's in my arms.

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
