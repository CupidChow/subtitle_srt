=Episode 6=

16
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,359
You didn't disappear.

17
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,040
I can't disappear just from kissing.

18
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,040
You have to have emotional turbulence.

19
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,840
Emotional turbulence?

20
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,480
I didn't feel that great at the time.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,480
You didn't feel great.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,959
But at least you should be shocked.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,719
Yeah, I was shocked.

24
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,879
That's right.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,400
As long as you have
emotional turbulence like that,

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,280
I will disappear.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,239
But you have emotional
turbulence as well.

28
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,319
Your face is bright red.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,959
It's not about me.

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,319
You are the one who needs to do it.

31
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,200
Why must I have emotional turbulence

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,239
for it to work?

33
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,799
Because you are the protagonist.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,359
Protagonist?

35
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,319
Do you realize what you just did there

37
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,680
is sexual harassment?

38
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,759
I can sue you for this.

39
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,560
You are the one who harassed me.

40
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,599
And you

41
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,719
used violence on me.

42
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,080
I was only experimenting

43
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
your theory.

44
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,919
And your theory

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,159
is that you only disappear

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,599
when I have emotional turbulence.

47
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,919
So you pointing the gun at me

48
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,199
and also

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,759
taking your clothes off

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,159
were for me to have
emotional turbulence.

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
I'm not lying.

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,879
Everything I said is true.

53
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,680
Even if you didn't lie,

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,319
you still haven't explained

55
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,719
why I have to have

56
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,400
emotional turbulence

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,919
for you to disappear.

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,080
You have to tell me.

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,960
Zicheng, is she awake?

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
Wait a second.

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,240
Why? What are they doing?

62
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,439
They are

63
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,800
talking about something

64
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,240
very honestly.

65
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
In the bathroom?

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
What happened?

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,159
Get out.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,879
Jiang Zhe?

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,639
What are you doing?

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,759
Are you okay?

71
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,479
I told you to get out.

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,919
Let's go.

73
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,759
Even though you saved me twice,

74
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,560
you still have to tell me the truth.

75
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,719
Otherwise,

76
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,000
your existence will be a threat to me.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
I will shoot

78
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,759
if you don't tell.

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,719
What kind of secret can
make you stay silent

80
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,879
even when your life is at stake?

81
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,439
One.

82
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,680
Two.

83
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,280
You won't shoot me.

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,199
I know that's not who you are.

85
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,360
Really?

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,439
Seems like you don't know me that well.

87
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,639
Three.

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,560
I know this can't hurt you.

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,479
You don't know much
about your power, do you?

90
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
Are you mad?

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
It's not about me being mad or not.

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,319
You just shot me.

93
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,639
Sorry to startle you.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,319
But I know you will be fine

95
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,879
even if I shoot you.

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,879
How do you know that?

97
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,360
I think you probably
aren't from this world.

98
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,000
You are from another world, aren't you?

99
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,920
It's okay if you don't want to tell.

100
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,000
Because I know you
won't be able to escape.

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
When I know

102
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,560
your existence

103
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,720
is related

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,759
to my emotions,

105
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,000
you can't run away anymore.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,240
I think you know this about me.

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm a person who doesn't waver.

108
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,920
You can live with me

109
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,720
before you answer all my questions.

110
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,879
Live... with you?

111
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,639
But you can choose to
answer my questions now.

112
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,079
Maybe I'll be surprised by the truth.

113
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,439
You'll be able to go home.

114
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,680
And I will find out

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,439
the answers I've been searching for.

116
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,800
A win-win situation.

117
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Isn't it nice?

118
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,439
Is it really that hard

119
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,720
for you to tell the truth?

120
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,959
It is.

121
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,360
Okay.

122
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,680
Then stay with me

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,199
until you decide to tell me.

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,279
It's all ready.

125
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,360
I wanted to have a meal with you.

126
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,759
But something came up.

127
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
I got you a phone.

128
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,800
Use this to contact me

129
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,040
if there's anything.

130
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,600
I love you!

131
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,000
Wu Yanzhu.

132
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,879
Are you trying to shock me again?

133
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
I... I just wanted to

134
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,920
have a try.

135
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,040
What was I doing?

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Jiang Zhe.

137
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,279
You have to be careful on the road.

138
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,199
Why?

139
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,839
Are you afraid something
will happen to me?

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,079
A train crash?

141
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,800
A car accident?

142
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
Or people in black pointing guns at me?

143
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I can't be sure

144
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,680
when I'm here.

145
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,920
And you can when you are over there?

146
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah.

147
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,879
I'm even more curious now.

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
You won't tell me the truth.

149
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,959
And you care about me so much.

150
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,199
What's your intention?

151
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,439
Because I want you
to have a happy ending.

152
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,160
Did you forget?

153
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm your fan.

154
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,959
So you have to be careful.

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,399
Okay.

156
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,279
Thank you.

157
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,120
Oh right.

158
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,199
One more thing.

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,839
What's your age?

160
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,639
I'm 30.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Me too.

162
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,040
Are you married?

163
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,279
No.

164
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,199
