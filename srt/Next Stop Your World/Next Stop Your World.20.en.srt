Dad! Liu Feng!

Dad, didn't you say

that you wanted a happy ending?

21
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,000

Dad.

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,640
Dad.

25
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,359
Ah!

26
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,200
Hello, Yanzhu.

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,120
(Hello, Liu Feng.)

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,840
(What happened to my dad?)

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,000
You saw it too, right?

30
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,280
His face is gone.

31
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,159
Shoot Lu Shenshen dead with a gun

32
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,120
and paint a gun in Jiang Zhe's hand.

33
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,639
Then let the police chase him.

34
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,439
I heard a voice

35
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,879
giving orders to Mr. Wu.

36
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,240
(It seemed like he was manipulated,)

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,759
(drawing as requested.)

38
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,680
That means

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,479
my dad's face became like that

40
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,919
because of the murderer.

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,960
Where is the murderer now?

42
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,840
How does he manipulate my dad?

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,759
How can I help my dad?

44
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,719
(Yanzhu, don't be worried.)

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
(I haven't figured it out.)

46
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,159
But now it's clear

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,240
that those things
that happened in the comic world

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,479
were drawn by my dad

49
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,080
on the orders of the murderer.

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,439
What happened to Jiang Zhe?

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
The murderer killed Lu Shenshen

52
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,520
and pinned it on Jiang Zhe.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,199
What?

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,159
Lu Shenshen is dead?

55
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,319
That bad man!

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,639
How could he kill her?

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Yanzhu.

58
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,319
You'd better leave there.

59
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,159
It's quite dangerous.

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,840
No, I can't.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,759
Now only Jiang Zhe can save my dad,

62
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,879
so I have to save him.

63
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,520
Take care of yourself first.

64
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,479
Yanzhu.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,199
Is it you?

66
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,120
Where are you?

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,599
Answer me.

68
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,560
(Pull yourself together.)

69
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,919
(I can't be there now,)

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,280
(so you have to treat yourself.)

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,319
(First, remember to inject antibiotics.)

72
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,759
(Then take the bullet out.)

73
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,600
(It hurts, but hang in there,)

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
(or the wound will fester.)

75
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,600
(After removing the bullet,)

76
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,959
(disinfect the wound with alcohol)

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,639
(and suture it
with suture thread and needle.)

78
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,480
(I will be there as soon as possible.)

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,160
(Take good care of yourself.)

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,959
Wu Yanzhu.

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,959
Where are you?

82
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,040
Yanzhu.

83
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:16,959
What happened?

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,160
The murderer

85
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,319
just tried to drag me

86
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,759
to the comic world
through the drawing tablet.

87
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,199
I turned off the power,

88
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,920
and he disappeared.

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,399
That means you can cut off contact

90
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,600
with the murderer by that.

91
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,600
I think so.

92
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,879
What do we do with Mr. Wu?

93
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,920
I want to try again with a dream.

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,639
Right.

95
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,120
You can go back to a very early time

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,600
and change the dream

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,759
which Jiang Zhe had
before his family died

98
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,959
to permanently cut it off.

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,639
Right?

100
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:44,839
Right.

101
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,759
But now I dare not turn on the tablet.

102
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm afraid that the murderer

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
is just waiting for me.

104
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,199
What should I do?

105
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't draw anything now.

106
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,240
Hmm.

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,040
Wu Yanzhu.

108
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,639
It's been a month.

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,600
Wu Yanzhu.

110
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,360
It's been a month?

111
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,639
I finally see you.

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,040
How are you?

113
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,560
Let's go somewhere.

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,720
How are you doing?

115
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,600
I haven't talked
to anyone for a long time.

116
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,199
I'm quite happy.

117
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:45,839
I thought

118
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,560
you were...

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,560
Why?

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,839
You gave me medicine

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,759
and told me the treatment.

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,279
How could I die?

123
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,079
But judging by the look on your face,

124
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,199
you haven't found a solution yet.

125
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,720
I was looking forward to it.

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,920
After all,

127
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,120
when everyone
suspected that I was the murderer,

128
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,680
only you saved me without hesitation.

129
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,000
Sorry.

130
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,160
You don't need to apologize.

131
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,600
You have saved me many times.

132
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,680
Hungry?

133
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,879
Let's go get something to eat.

134
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,480
There's nothing at home.

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,720
Here.

136
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,000
But you're wanted now

137
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,879
and have been hunted down for a month.

138
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,199
Instead of thinking
about how to clear your name,

139
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,399
you're eating ice cream with me.

140
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,079
What are you thinking?

141
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,439
Maybe I'm set

142
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,560
to have a sad ending.

143
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,759
It doesn't matter.

144
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,360
How about going shopping together

145
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,959
after we eat up ice cream?

146
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,279
In such a situation,

147
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,240
you're still thinking about shopping?

148
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,240
As long as I'm with you,

149
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,879
I don't care.

150
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,199
Probably I can't
buy you expensive clothes.

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,399
Save a little money for us.

152
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,079
