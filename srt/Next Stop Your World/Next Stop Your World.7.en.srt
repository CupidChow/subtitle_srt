15
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:02,624
=Episode 7=

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,920
Okay, I got it.

17
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,359
No truck information was found.

18
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,400
It's like it appeared out of nowhere

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,519
and disappeared the same way.

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,799
Don't bother looking for it.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,959
Perhaps the perpetrator

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,799
never existed at all.

23
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,239
Never existed?

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,400
Think about how many strange
things have happened to me recently.

25
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,079
Stabbed.

26
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,560
Saved.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,599
Hit by a truck.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,599
Everything feels like already written.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,400
Just like 10 years ago.

30
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,959
I was on my way to
the shooting competition.

31
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,400
But somehow I ended up home

32
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,239
and became a suspect
who killed his whole family.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,120
For 10 years,

34
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,879
we kept looking.

35
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,000
But we couldn't find one single lead.

36
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,200
Not even a motive.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,959
So?

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,079
So I think,

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
the person we've been looking for

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,200
probably came from another world.

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,719
You mean an alien?

42
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:03,519
Yeah.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,239
But probably

44
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,439
not the kind of alien we would imagine.

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
But like Wu Yanzhu.

46
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,479
With an appearance just like us.

47
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,719
Wu Yanzhu?

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,000
She knows everything about me.

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,639
It's like she sees me from
an omniscient perspective.

50
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,080
(At that time,)

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,879
you stood on the roof.

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,560
I was so afraid that you would jump.

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,639
She even knows things

54
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,080
that I've never told anyone.

55
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
Thankfully she doesn't
have ill will towards me.

56
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,759
She just wants to save me.

57
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,919
But there must be someone who does.

58
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,120
This is

59
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,319
unbelievable.

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,240
So I think she's the key to my life.

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,479
The only way for me to
find the answer to the secret.

62
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,639
Stop there!

63
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,599
What?

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,719
Are you going to confess again?

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,599
No.

66
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,599
The police came looking for me.

67
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,639
What should I do?

68
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,639
What happened?

69
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,759
Lu Shenshen...

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,680
It doesn't matter.

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,039
What should I do now?

72
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,879
Calm down.

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,800
Where are you now?

74
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,159
On the road in front
of the main entrance.

75
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,120
I'll contact you later.

76
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,599
Okay.

77
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,319
Go to the road in front of the house.

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,080
Don't let the police take her away.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,599
Okay.

80
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,199
We need you to come with us, miss.

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Where are you now?

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,159
How is it?

83
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,520
Mr. Jiang.

84
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,680
The police took her.

85
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,199
Why do you have her phone?

86
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,479
I found it in the grass.

87
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,919
(Police)

88
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,159
Visitors please wait here.

89
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:16,600
Hello.

90
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,439
Lu Shenshen.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,399
I told you I'll take care of her.

92
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,639
Why did you tell the police?

93
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,839
She came out of nowhere

94
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,639
and means possible danger to you.

95
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,079
Why shouldn't I tell the police?

96
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,839
I was evaluating what's best for you

97
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,480
and I made the right decision.

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,839
If she's not dangerous,

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,680
we can all rest assured

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,079
after the police finish
the investigation, right?

101
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
Why can't she just tell us who she is?

102
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,800
Maybe,

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,439
she's not a witness

104
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,279
but the real murderer.

105
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,959
You believed her lies.

106
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,600
When I look at Wu Yanzhu

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,639
and those strange things she did,

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
it's like I'm looking at my old self.

109
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you know that

110
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,920
she threw away the phone I gave her

111
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,759
before the police got her?

112
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,600
She did it to not get me involved.

113
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,120
How can she be the suspect?

114
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,879
How can you be so impulsive

115
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,519
as my secretary?

116
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,480
Jiang Zhe.

117
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,240
Jiang Zhe.

118
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,160
Sorry I'm late. Are you okay?

119
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,879
How can I be?

120
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
These things only happen in movies.

121
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360
I never thought

122
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,920
I would be here one day.

123
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,399
Things are very serious now.

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,639
You can't explain your identity.

125
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,920
It's possible that they'll see
you as the potential suspect.

126
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,439
The only way

127
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,360
for me to help you

128
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,639
is to tell me the truth.

129
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
I can't.

130
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,759
If I say it,

131
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,639
you'll be unfortunate.

132
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,560
Well,

133
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
I'm not that fortunate now either.

134
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,680
I have trouble sleeping every night

135
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,560
because I don't know when I will die.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,399
Look where you are now.

137
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,240
So please tell me.

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,959
Why do you know me so well?

139
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,680
You'll regret this.

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,439
I won't.

141
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,319
I've been waiting for
the answer for ten years.

142
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,120
It's a comic.

143
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,519
Comic?

144
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,319
Do you mean

145
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
you came from a comic?

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,759
No.

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
This is.

148
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,839
What do you mean?

149
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,639
This world is from a comic.

150
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,240
A comic that I'm reading.

151
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,639
And you, Jiang Zhe,

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,720
are the protagonist.

153
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,040
Why must I have emotional turbulence

154
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,879
for it to work?

155
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,560
Because you are the protagonist.

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,504
(To be continued)

157
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,279
Did you really go to
the detention center?

158
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,199
But you've only
disappeared for 30 minutes.

159
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,279
How could you have stayed
three days in the villa

160
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,040
and two days in the detention center

161
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,680
in the comic world?

162
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
That doesn't make sense.

163
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,199
I remember every single day

164
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,720
I've spent in there.

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
This is my first time
in a detention center.

166
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,879
Do you know how that feels?

167
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,319
I couldn't stay there another second.

168
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,480
So you told Jiang Zhe everything

169
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,279
to get yourself out?

170
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,079
