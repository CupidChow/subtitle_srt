disguised himself as Mr. Wu

Save her.

Behave.

Wow, so swollen.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
Jiang Zhe forgot you.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,960
So

43
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,120
there was no need to kill you.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,759
But now he remembered.

45
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,759
Things became interesting.

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,599
What do you want?

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
I was designed

48
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,199
to kill Jiang Zhe's family.

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,599
But things have changed.

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,360
I will be the real protagonist

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,159
of the comic.

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,439
So

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,000
all of you must die.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Why did you marry Jiang Zhe?

55
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,479
Why did you become the heroine?

56
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,520
You think it's gonna end well?

57
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,199
Huh?

58
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,400
The real fun starts now.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
Finally.

60
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,879
I've been waiting.

61
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,439
Jiang Zhe.

62
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,039
You'd better drop the gun.

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,879
Argh.

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm the one you want.

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,599
Let her go.

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,599
I just love to see you

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,599
in misery.

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,960
What should I do?

69
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,920
You want to be
the protagonist, don't you?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,759
Tell me

71
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,319
what to do.

72
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,879
Kill yourself right now.

73
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,759
I'm warning you.

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,000
No tricks.

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,720
Or...

76
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:45,759
Jiang Zhe.

77

Go.

78

83

It's okay.

84
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,600
It's okay.

Yanzhu.

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,079
Hang in there, Yanzhu.

88
