16
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,600
Today,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,920
the police started an operation

18
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,040
and caught a suspect
who has been at large for ten years.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,560
In the suspect's home,

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,680
the police found some weapons,
including knives and guns.

21
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:11,879
It is confirmed

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,400
that this suspect is the murderer

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,840
who killed the family
of Jiang Zhe, CEO of Group W.

24
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,640
The suspect and Jiang Zhe's father

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,280
worked together as shooting competitors.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,439
The suspect suffers from
persecutory delusional disorder

27
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,840
and has been in long-term treatment.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,120
Further report from Ding Xiao
will be on this channel.

29
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,040
I did it.

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,879
I was only going to kill your father.

31
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,040
But I ended up killing them all.

32
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,760
If you were there,

33
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,640
you'd be dead as well.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,480
I just didn't except

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,159
you'd be looking for me for ten years.

36
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,000
How annoying.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,040
So,

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,799
I led you to the rooftop
and stabbed you.

39
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:50,920
However,

40
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,280
you got lucky and lived.

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,519
I should have shot you,

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,040
just like how I killed your family.

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,439
Bad guy!

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,200
I'll kill you!

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,040
I'll kill you!

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,400
Calm down!

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,280
I'll kill you!

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,239
Sit down.

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,200
Sit down.

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,439
It's not enough to put him in the jail.

51
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,719
I have to make him die in the comic.

52
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,479
That's the only way to end the story.

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
You'll make Jiang Zhe kill him?

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,639
No.

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,159
It won't be a happy ending if he does.

56
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:28,288
The suspect committed suicide!

57
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:28,928
Come here!

58
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,280

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,560
(Yeah.)

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,120
What's the last scene?

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,240
(The ending of Jiang Zhe?)

62

Hmm.

63
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,400
The murder killed himself after all.

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,199
That's not a bad ending, is it?

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,439
Is it a wedding with Lu Shenshen?

66
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think so.

67

80

Wait.

81
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
How is it?

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,280
No heavy hemorrhage.

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,199
No mortal danger.

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,879
But an operation is required.

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,000

Yes.

96
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,160
What happened?

97
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,279
There was a guy
on the street shooting people.

98

What?

99
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:45,959
According to some sources,

on the day of the crime,

101
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,439
the murderer met
Jiang Zhe's father nearby

102
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,399
and decided to harm him.

103
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,439
He followed the victim all the way...

104

Jiang Zhe.

105
