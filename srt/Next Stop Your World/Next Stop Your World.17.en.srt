So

exclude every trait

Jiang Zhe would get suspicious again.

If he develops consciousness again,

00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,759
we'll have to go through

everything again.

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,240
But no matter how hard
we try to recreate the murderer,

124
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
there will be bugs.

125
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,839

That's the Wu Chengwu I know.

133
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
The previous chapters

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,160
have been ridiculous.

135
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,759
The comic lost so many readers

136
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,680
after he introduced Wu Yanzhu.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,399
These few months,

138
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,399
the comic made me so irritated.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,560
Thankfully,

140
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,399
Mr. Wu made it into a dream.

141
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,800
Now we can start afresh.

142
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
Jiang Zhe catches the murderer

143
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
and marries Lu Shenshen.

144
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
That's great, right?

145
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,959
Oh,

Yeah.

Tell him

150
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
to take great care of himself.

151
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,079
Ah, also,

152
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
tell him

153
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,959
that I'm earnestly waiting
for the updates.

154
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,680
Okay?

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,240
Okay.

156
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,200
This is awesome.

157
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,080
Long live Jiang Zhe!

158
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I hate Wu Yanzhu.

159
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,039
By the way,

160
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,279
why does the murderer

161
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
look exactly like Mr. Wu?

162
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,679
What?

163
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,799
What's wrong?

164
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,000
That night,

165
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,519
the surveillance camera

166
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,200
captured a suspicious man
leaving the hotel.

167
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,000
Mr. Wu,

168
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
isn't that you?

169
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,759
How else would

170
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,879
Jiang Zhe be convinced?

171
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,320
The only suspect he's seen is me.

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,320
I've seen him.

173
