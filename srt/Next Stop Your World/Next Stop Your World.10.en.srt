16
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,040
Let's end this.

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,760
Who would have thought

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,519
there were two people
who stabbed me that day?

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,040
I never told anyone about this

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,599
due to the lack of proof.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
But my instinct tells me

22
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,200
the one who's trying
everything to kill me

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,159
is you,

24
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,400
Wu Chengwu.

25
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,760
You created me here, right?

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,359
And this is where

27
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,079
you thought of every
possible way to torture me.

28
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,239
Stabbed me.

29
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,680
Hit me with a truck.

30
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,879
And you tried to kill
me with your own hands.

31
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,000
Hem.

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,920
You seem to know me well.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,879
Then let me know you a little.

34
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,719
Wu Chengwu.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,040
You are so famous.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
Everything about you is on the internet.

37
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,480
You are good for nothing.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
You are trying to numb
your senses with alcohol.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,639
That's why you created me,

40
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,520
a person who's the
exact opposite of you.

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,199
Isn't it?

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,199
You gained popularity using my life.

43
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,439
But you didn't expect

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,360
that your wife still left
you with your daughter.

45
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,439
You are such a coward.

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,639
You couldn't even make
the move to kill yourself.

47
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,000
That's why all you do is torturing me.

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,639
Because you know I'm the only person

49
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,319
that you get to have control over.

50
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,400
But,

51
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,919
why did you save me?

52
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,080
I didn't save you.

53
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,439
You wanted to live yourself.

54
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,000
That day,

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,000
I was going to kill you.

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
But you asked me for help.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
So I couldn't make myself do it.

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,439
That's where the problem is.

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,719
From that day,

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,719
you started to develop
self-consciousness.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,879
Just like now.

62
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,520
And that's wrong.

63
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,960
You are a comic character I created.

64
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,879
You are not a real person.

65
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,400
And now you are trying to control me.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,240
Do you think you are
the only one in pain?

67
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,919
I'm in pain as well.

68
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,800
I can't sleep all night.

69
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,319
I think

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,199
I have some mental issues.

71
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,840
I went to see a psychiatrist

72
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,879
and ask my friends.

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
They all told me I'm joking.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
I got afraid. I wanted to run away.

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,919
(But I have to hold on)

76
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,080
(for Yanzhu.)

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,159
(I can make money from
this to take care of her.)

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,479
This comic still hasn't ended.

79
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,400
It's a torture for me as well.

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,719
But,

81
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,040
why did you suddenly come to me

82
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,519
and even get Yanzhu involved?

83
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,079
You are a character in my comic.

84
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,040
You are not a real person.

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,160
Understand?

86
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,639
So,

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,079
can you tell me

88
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,000
who the murderer is?

89
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,959
There is none.

90
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,439
This is just a setting to
make the protagonist stronger.

91
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,920
It's a typical trope in hero comic.

92
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,920
I don't know

93
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,319
who the murderer is.

94
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
How can I believe that?

95
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,920
That's the truth.

96
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,480
When the protagonist
catches the murderer,

97
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,199
this comic will end.

98
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,560
So,

99
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,079
do you mean that

100
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,839
my parents being murdered

101
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,040
and I being mistaken as the killer

102
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,519
are just the settings of the comic?

103
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,040
All the pain I had to go through
over the last ten years

104
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,000
is only a setting of the comic?

105
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,720
You won't shoot.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
This is your setting.

107
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,839
I created you as a merciful person.

108
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
That's the way to
make the readers like you.

109
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,519
You must be angry.

110
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
Shoot me.

111
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,639
Kill me.

112
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,600
I've had enough anyway.

113
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:09,879
Haha.

114
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,839
What's wrong

115
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
with this world?

116
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,480
Go see him.

117
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
He might live

118
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
if he's lucky.

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,519
Yanzhu.

120
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,480
I have something to say to you.

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,279
Oh.

122
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,040
How did your dad get hurt?

123
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
I don't know.

124
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,120
It looks like a gunshot wound.

125
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,639
But we didn't find the bullet.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
So we can't be sure either.

127
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,519
We are thinking

128
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,439
if we should call the police.

129
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,120
How about this?

130
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,439
Tell them

131
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,959
they can ask him after he wakes up.

132
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,199
Okay.

133
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,079
Take care of him for now.

134
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,519
Call me anytime if there's anything.

135
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,279
Yeah.

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Thank you.

137
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,920
Take care of him.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,199
Thank god. He's fine.

139
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,040
Yanzhu.

140
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,920
What should we do now?

141
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,319
And Jiang Zhe.

142
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,519
How did he come to our world?

143
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,120
I don't know either.

144
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,439
Hello, Editor.

145
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,000
(Hello.)

(who uploaded the latest chapter of W?)

152
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,319
Ah?

153
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,240
A new chapter?

154
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,199
Okay, thank you.

155
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,720
The editor said

156
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,439
there's a new chapter of W.

157
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,639
What?

158
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,319
Look.

(The end)

160
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,799
This world is from a comic.

161

And you,

162
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
Jiang Zhe,

163
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,000
are the protagonist.

There is none.

This is just a setting to

of all this?
