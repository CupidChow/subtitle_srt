16
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,679
Dad.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,000
Did something happen?

18
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,079
Where did Jiang Zhe go?

19
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,560
The comics ended.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
For some reason,

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,280
the two worlds
completely lost their connection.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,519
I tried to pull him back

23
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,040
into the world in many ways.

24
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,280
But nothing worked.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,640
This is

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,040
the end of the story.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,640
Jiang Zhe

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,719
gave up his life to save yours.

29
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,519
It's all my fault.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,280
I shouldn't have

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,680
ever started this comic.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,199
Yanzhu once said

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
as long as she could enter
the comic world,

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,680
she wouldn't die in there.

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,919
So she won't die

36
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,759
if I take her there.

37
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,000
Just draw it.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,680
But when he took control over me,

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,199
the drawing tablet

40
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,199
got smashed.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,759
No.

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,000
The murderer could enter your world,

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,639
so there must be a drawing tablet

44
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,199
in the comic world

45
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,520
that is identical to this one.

46
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,439
As long as I find it,

47
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,120
she can be saved.

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,879
But the murderer died.

49
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,879
And the comic

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,719
is about to end.

51
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,919
If you bring me the drawing tablet,

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,120
you won't be able to come back

53
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,319
after the final chapter.

54
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,000
I must save her

55
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,800
no matter what.

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,840
Doctor.

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,319
She's seriously injured.

58
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,520
Please save her.

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,199
Freeze!

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,240
Stop there!

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,759
Yanzhu.

62
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,879
Please hang in there.

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Please

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
save her.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,839
Jiang Zhe.

66
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,240
You've been encircled.

67
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,199
I love you.

68
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,040
I love you too.

69
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Jiang Zhe risked his life

70
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,879
and got the drawing tablet

71
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,800
for me to change the plot

72
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,920
and wipe out the wound.

73
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,199
That's why

74
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,480
there isn't a single scratch on you.

75
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,560
The murderer died.

76
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,680
Jiang Zhe was put in jail.

77
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,879
The comics should end here.

78
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,240
The two worlds

79
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,319
have lost connection.

80
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,720
You have to accept it.

that we're finally together,

we've been pushed forward by something.

00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,120
Do you remember

97
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,040
how I proposed to you

98
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,720
and offered you the ring

99
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,160
in front of my home

100
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,959
with all the media people there?

101
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,439
Of course.

102
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,160
I didn't know

103
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,399
what to do at that moment.

104
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:30,959

we've been

through a lot.

I know you care about
the ceremonial touch in life.

109
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,360
I think

110
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,080
I should do a formal proposal.

111
