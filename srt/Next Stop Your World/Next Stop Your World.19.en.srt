16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,719
Wu Yanzhu?

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,760
Hi.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,319
Why are you here?

19
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,159
I'm so hungry.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,319
I haven't eaten anything in four days.

21
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,040
If you are hungry,

22
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,079
you can buy food
in the convenience store.

23
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,120
What are you doing
in other people's house?

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,959
Because I don't have any money on me.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,519
You are a doctor. How's that possible?

26
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,159
I'm not a doctor in that hospital.

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,319
You misunderstood.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,799
Even if you have no money,

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,680
what you did is still trespassing.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,719
I have to call the police.

31
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,000
We'll talk about this
in the police station.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,760
That's good.

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,359
At least they have food there.

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,840
But can you just let me

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,040
finish the noodles

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,000
I just made?

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm so hungry.

38
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,439
Ah!

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,560
It's so hot.

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,519
Of course it's hot.

41
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,920
Come here.

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,719
We agreed to forget each other.

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,879
Why do you still touch me?

44
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,280
What?

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
I've tried so hard to avoid you.

46
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,680
I even slept on the street for days.

47
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,199
But why do you have to show up

48
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,360
and rub the ointment on me?

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,199
Do you have to do this?

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,439
Ms. Wu Yanzhu.

51
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you being mad at me now?

52
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,719
No.

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,639
I'm married.

54
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,560
But my husband is gone.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360
So I can't find anyone to help me.

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,680
Why is your husband gone?

57
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,039
He's just gone.

58
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,719
He's not dead and we are
not divorced. He's just gone.

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
He didn't do much for me.

60
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,520
Not much that can be called sweet.

61
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,280
He disappeared even before
telling me he loves me.

62
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,560
Fiancee? I'm Jiang Zhe's fiancee?

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,319
Yeah.

64
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,719
It's your first time, right?

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,400
I don't know why I'm here.

66
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,280
And I can't find a way to go home.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,439
Just take me to the police.

68
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,159
It'll be easier for me that way.

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,759
Didn't you say you called the police?

70
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,199
I realized you are not
afraid of the police at all.

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,279
So,

72
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,800
I decided to keep you
by my side for now.

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,680
I told you not to care for me.

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,639
I don't care for you.

76
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,959
I'm just keeping you under my watch.

77
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,399
So where are we going?

78
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,399
To the hospital first.

79
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,759
Shenshen is waiting for me.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,519
Okay.

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,920
Wait for me in the car.

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,959
Don't go anywhere.

83
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,439
Oh.

84
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,480
I don't think you have anywhere to go.

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,319
Shenshen.

86
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
How did it go?

87
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,920
What did the police say?

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,560
They've taken care of
the family members.

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
The investigation is still ongoing.

90
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,040
That's good.

91
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:44,959
Oh.

92
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,199
Why do you want me here?

93
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,600
I got an email.

94
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,040
Someone reported to me.

95
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,759
Report?

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,319
About the murderer?

97
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,360
Yes.

98
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,399
But not about the mass shooting.

99
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,480
It's about the case ten years ago.

100
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,600
This is a recording.

101
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,639
Listen to it.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,439
Now write down everything I say.

103
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,480
First, Jiang Zhe's lines
in the recording from ten years ago.

104
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,800
(I told you to leave me alone.)

105
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
(You have no right to interfere, dad.)

106
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,160
(All you do is drinking.)

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
(And now you are
telling me what to do?)

108
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,279
(I've told you.)

109
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,600
(If you hit me one more time,)

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
(I won't let it pass.)

111
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:27,759
(Jiang Zhe!)

112
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,079
(What are you doing?)

113
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,519
What's this?

114
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,279
Jiang Zhe.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,480
I've known you

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,360
for so many years.

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,839
I've never doubted you.

118
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,560
But now...

119
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,319
No, Shenshen!

120
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,839
Someone forged this to set me up!

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,079
But I know your father.

122
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,759
I can recognize his voice.

123
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,199
Shenshen!

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,920
There's a gunshot!

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,079
There is a killer!

126
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,040
Call the police!

127
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,800
Draw policemen.

128
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,680
Make them chase him.

129
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,759
Stop there!

130
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:26,920
Stop there!

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,040
What's wrong?

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
What happened?

133
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,600
Why are you injured?

134
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Shenshen got killed.

135
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,279
Come.

136
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,199
Be careful.

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,079
Here.

138
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,160
Sit down.

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,040
Let me take a look.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,560
Ah!

141
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,560
It's gonna hurt a little.

142
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,919
Ah!

143
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,039
Why are you crying?

144
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not like I'm dying.

145
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,720
I'm not crying.

146
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,919
You were talking about
giving me to the police.

147
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,639
Why would I cry for you?

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,519
Who are you trying to fool?

149
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,919
I can see how sad you are.

150
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,120
Are you okay?

151
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,480
Have some water.

152
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,320
Be careful.

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,480
I feel like I'm really dying.

154
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,600
Don't say that.

155
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,639
I'll find a way to save you.

156
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,559
Still not willing to admit it?

157
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,080
Look how much you are worried about me.

158
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
I tried my best

159
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
to find a place that
wouldn't attract attention.

160
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,120
But I still feel like

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,279
it's not safe enough here.

162
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,000
So I have to find a way
to make you get better soon

163
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,120
so that we can leave here.

164
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,399
I can't buy too much stuff

165
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,360
in this situation.

166
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
So I only bought some for emergency.

167
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
Wu Yanzhu.

168
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,840
Thank you.

169
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,399
I'll find a way to figure out

170
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,480
what exactly happened.

171
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,840
And I will help you.

172
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,240
You need further treatment

173
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,639
and more medicine.

174
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,600
So I have to leave now.

175
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,480
Promise me.

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,639
Hang in there.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,720
What if I can't?

178
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,759
You can.

179
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,759
Trust me.

180
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,039
I will find a way.

181
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,919
I have to go now.

182
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,600
I hope this works.
