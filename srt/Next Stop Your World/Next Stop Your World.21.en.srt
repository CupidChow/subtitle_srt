16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,640
Should we dress like this?

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,480
It's good.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,519
Don't you think it looks good?

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,480
It's good.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,120
But people may misunderstand.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,079
What?

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,560
We shared critical moments.

23
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,799
Does that matter?

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,640
That's right.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,400
Okay.

26
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,200
What do you want for lunch?

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,879
Pasta?

28
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,159
To record our another reunion.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,719
But you don't know how to cook.

30
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:39,959
No.

31
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,159
But,

32
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,120
I learned it for you.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,920
I want to cook for you.

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,319
Why do you want to cook for me?

35
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,400
Because

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,799
I can get an assignment done.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,959
What did you say?

38
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,519
An assignment?

39
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,319
100 little things to do when in love.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,919
I know

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,560
your ex-husband

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,080
just finished a few of them
with you and then disappeared,

43
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,800
so I want to replace him

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
and finish the rest.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
You saved my life.

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,879
You're my rescuer.

47
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,840
And didn't you say

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,479
I look like him?

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,759
But I don't think I've ever told you

50
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,199
about the assignments.

51
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,439
How do you know that?

52
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,800
Because I saw it.

53
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,840
Where?

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,879
Jiang Zhe.

55
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,240
Are you okay?

56
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,120
Yeah.

57
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,159
Did you bring it?

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Shenshen...

59
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,840
Believe it or not,

60
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,680
it was not done by me.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,479
But I can't explain it now.

62
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,840
Please give me some time

63
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,680
and trust me.

64
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,759
I trust you.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,879
Thanks.

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,000
Jiang Zhe.

67
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,919
This is for you.

68
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,879
Although I am curious
about what this is,

69
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,280
I think

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,759
I should bring it to you.

71
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,199
Judging by your expression,

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,759
you must have read this comic too.

73
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,280
I just saw it from inside.

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,280
Inside the comic,

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,479
your husband only
did a few sweet things with you

76
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
and just disappeared.

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,560
How could he do that to you?

78
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,039
You didn't show up,

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,680
and I can't go out,

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,159
so I spent all my time reading it

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,240
and

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,360
I've even memorized all the lines.

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
(Sorry.)

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
(I'm late.)

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,479
(Are you okay?)

86
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,960
How can I be?

87
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,560
(This is a scene
that only happens in movies.)

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,159
(All the pain I had to go through
over the last ten years)

89
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,639
is only a setting of the comic?

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
(You won't shoot.)

91
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,520
(This is your setting.)

92
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,920
Is the husband

93
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,439
in the comic

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,560
me?

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,879
You remembered all?

96
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,879
Not yet.

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,519
But,

98
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,639
many of the memories
related to me in the book

99
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,439
popped into my mind.

100
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,160
I'm very confused.

101
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,240
Can you tell me
what the next comic is about?

102
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,759
Also,

103
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,639
did Jiang Zhe

104
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,439
really lose all his memory?

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It's a hard question?

106
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,279
Then let's go and check it out.

107
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,879
So this is your dad's studio,

108
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,360
right?

109
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,600
Sorry.

110
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,480
I brought the book with me by accident

111
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,040
and let you face
these complicated things again.

112
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,680
It's okay.

113
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,800
At least,

114
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,759
everything that happened to me

115
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,759
can be rationally explained.

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,120
By the way,

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,240
your dad.

118
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,360
Where is he now?

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,879
I want to see him.

120
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,000
Why?

121
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,240
Don't worry.

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,639
I won't hurt him.

123
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,480
I won't do the same stupid thing

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
twice.

125
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,560
My dad didn't cause Shenshen's death,

126
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,040
and he didn't pin it on you,

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,040
so,

128
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,639
don't get him wrong.

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,399
I know.

130
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,800
Come with me somewhere.

131
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:41,639
Okay.

132
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,720
Is this

133
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,120
your dad?

134
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,639
Yes.

135
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,759
Why is he like this?

136
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,360
After my dad painted
his own face on the murderer,

137
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,639
his own face is gone.

138
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,639
He's just a puppet of the murderer now.

139
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,120
If I didn't lock him up here,

140
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,360
he would draw day and night,

141
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,639
trying

142
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,079
to kill you.

143
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,439
J-J-Jiang Zhe.

144
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,639
Be quiet.

145
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,279
You are Jiang Zhe!

146
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,199
Be quiet.

147
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,360
What happened to her?

148
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,720
I think she's too tired.

149
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,160
Can I

150
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
shake hands with you?

151
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,199
I've been your fan

152
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,519
for a long time.

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Hmm.

154
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,199
I painted your villa.

155
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,639
Well...

156
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Could I get a glass of water?

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,879
I'm a little thirsty.

158
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

159
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,560
I shook hands with Jiang Zhe!

160
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,720
Here you are.

161
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,120
Thank you.

162
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,360
Well...

163
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,039
Could I know

164
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,679
how you planned to end the comic?

165
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,960
Here's the draft
and image for the ending.

166
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,919
Mr. Wu wanted to kill
the murderer in the book,

167
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,519
and to make you believe him,

168
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,759
he made the murderer look like himself.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,399
Okay.

170
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,559
Can I take a look at it

171
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,159
myself?

172
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay.

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,679
