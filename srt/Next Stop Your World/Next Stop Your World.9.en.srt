I was curious what happened

you are doing just fine.

Am I in the comic again?

But this is the hospital I work in.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,719
And I was just talking to my colleague.

23
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,159
I came to your world.

24

How did you come here?

My world

stopped.

27
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,120
Everything went still

Only I can move.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,959
Everything around me stopped moving.

31
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,959
That's why I came here
without a second thought.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,719
In fact,

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,480
I don't understand
why I'm still alive either.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,239
But it's probably just like what you said.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,519
I'm the protagonist.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
This is probably the
protagonist's privilege.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,360
I came to your world

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,680
and read the rest of the comic W.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,919
Now I know

40
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,639
why you know me so well.

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,879
You've seen everything about me.

42

Are you okay?

43
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,080
I regret it a lot.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,520
I regret that I didn't listen to you.

45

I wanted to know the truth so much,

46
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,120
but I never could have thought

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
the truth would be like this.

48
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,759
You refused to answer my questions

49
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,719
for my own good.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,439
I remember you said

51
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,159
you work in the
Chizhou People's Hospital.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,039
So I chose to come here by instinct.

53
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,439
Seems like I have a good instinct

54
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,080
and also good luck.

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,919
I'm here to say goodbye.
