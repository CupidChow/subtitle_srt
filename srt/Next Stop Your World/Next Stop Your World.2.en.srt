but I didn't come up with a good one,

105

so I took you as a prototype.

113
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,759

then anyone does.

fell in love with her at first sight.

173
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,320
Why?

174
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,600
Isn't he the protagonist?

175
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,039
Does a protagonist never die?

176
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,840
But he was just saved.

177
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
If he dies

178
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,360
after two chapters,

179
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
the readers will be angry.

180
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
Stay out of this.

181
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,279
Mind your own business.

182
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,240
What do you mean by that?

183
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
You know I saved him

184
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,559
and that it was a real thing.

185
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,159
It was not painted by you.

186
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,200
What did you say?

187
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,600
How did you know what I wore that day?

188
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,120
That was the first time I wore it.

189
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,320
You have seen the living Jiang Zhe, too.

190
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,879
Right?

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,320
His life is gonna end

192
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,080
soon.

193
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,919
No.

194
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,320
He is a real person.

195
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,879
You're killing someone.

196
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,159
Dad.
