Liu Feng and I

took him to a nearby hut.

Thanks.

Let's go on a date.

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,719
What?

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,479
While you've been asleep,

55
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,879
I've learned everything.

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,199
Now I know

57
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,759
in the comic book,

58
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,280
I am your husband.

59
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,520
You know me well,

60
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,120
but I don't know you well enough,

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,560
so let's go on a date.

62
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,919
I heard that it can reinforce bonds.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,439
I'm so hungry.

64
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,840
We'll have a meal
and then come back, okay?

65
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,120
Go change your clothes.

66
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Or you want the sexy, X-rated style?

67
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,520
No.

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,719
This restaurant is not bad.

69
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,159
We can be dining here quite a bit.

70
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,639
What's wrong?

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,639
You are upset?

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,599
What happened to your hand?

73
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,879
Do you want to keep it from me?

74
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,479
I was going to tell you after dinner.

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,919
Since Shenshen's death,

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,280
it's been like this.

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,159
Why is it like this?

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,080
Yesterday,

79
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,639
I had a talk with the murderer,

80
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,560
and I learned a secret.

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,240
Your father met the murderer

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,520
years ago,

83
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,960
and he made a deal with him.

84
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,400
It's over now.

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,719
Who are you?

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,159
I will kill Jiang Zhe.

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,639
Why are you meddling?

88
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,519
Why are you still alive

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,600
after being stabbed?

90
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,920
Who are you?

91
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,360
Spare my life.

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,319
I will make you
the master of this world.

93
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,319
(Jiang Zhe.)

94
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,560
(As long as you are dead,)

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,560
(I will be the protagonist.)

96
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,800
(This is what he said.)

97
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,639
(But he betrayed me after he went back.)

98
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,560
(So,)

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
(I could only devour him.)

100
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,360
(Because your father agreed to that deal,)

101
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,480
the setting to make our meeting

102
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
a dream

103
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,839
is invalid.

104
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,519
Besides,

105
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,120
the murderer is getting
stronger and stronger,

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,800
but I

107
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,160
lost my memory.

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,000
So,

109
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,319
this is not a good time.

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,839
What do we do now?

111
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,399
Do you remember it?

112
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,240
It was your father's tablet

113
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,639
that connected the two worlds,

114
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,079
and you only returned to the real world

115
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,639
at the end of each chapter.

116
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,879
But then there was a twist.

117
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,519
We're going to use it.

118
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,360
How?

119
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,360
I need you to draw for me.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,839
Another dream?

121
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,560
You will forget me

122
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
and live your own life,

123
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
leaving me alone with our memories.

124
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,160
If you've already made a decision,

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
why are you dating me?

126
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,560
You're still

127
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
making a joke right now?

128
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,000
I read online

129
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
that this can calm a girl down.

130
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,519
It does seem to work.

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,120
I know what you're worried about,

132
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
but I'm not going to do that.

133
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,639
I don't want to live the same life

134
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,560
over and over again.

135
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,040
I hope

136
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,319
there will be a happy ending
between you and me.

137
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,680
Your father can only be resurrected

138
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,199
after the murderer dies,

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,639
so you must help me.

140
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,480
How?

141
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
I have a hypothesis.

142
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm in the real world now.

143
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,839
At the same time,

144
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,319
I am the protagonist in the comic.

145
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,519
Now that

146
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,399
I can take people from the real world

147
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,040
into the comic,

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,680
I think I can take advantage of it

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,279
and get into the comic anytime.

150
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,959
Let's use this.

I'd like to report a crime.

Yes.

159
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,199
What happened to my dad?

160
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,160
H-H-He looks

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
a bit strange.

162
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,120
Haha.

163
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,759
Dad.

164
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,800
Dad, you are finally back.

165
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,160
Come and sit down.

166
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,480
That's great.

167
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,160
Your face finally returned.

168
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,040
Dad?

169
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,079
Who is your dad?

170
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,160
You are not him.

171
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,519
It's been a long time.

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,720

173

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
who created the chaos.

175
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,000
I could have gotten rid

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
of Jiang Zhe long ago,

177
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,839
but you hid him and revived him,

178
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,240
and you lured me out and woke me up.

179
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,199
Without you,

180
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,600
the comic

181
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,080
should have ended.

182
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,600
Why are you so nosy?

183
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,759
Liu Feng.

184
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,559
Jiang Zhe

185
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,120
is not the only one who knows

186
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,000
how to enter this world.

187
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,360
Too naive.

188
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
That's not difficult.

189
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,840
I can do it too.

190
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,279
Don't forget

191
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,759
there is another me

192
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,519
in this world.

193
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,600
You...

194
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,600
Haha.

195
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,080
Too weak.

196
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,840
Haha.

197
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,519
It's time for me

198
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
to settle the score with you.

199
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,000
Go.

200
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,879
Go quickly.

201
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,480
Go.
