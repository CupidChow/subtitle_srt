(Adapted from the TV series W – Two Worlds)

15
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:03,196
=Episode 13=

16
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:04,599
Getting married?

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,319
Yes.

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:05,959
Mr. Jiang told me

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,599
you have registered
your marriage abroad,

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,400
so there is no record in our country.

21
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,480
So you told the public

22
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,400
we already got married,

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,079
not that we're getting married.

24
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,680
Two issues should be resolved

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,680
before your name is cleared.

26
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,439
One is to prove your identity.

27
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,680
Another one

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,159
is to give the reason why you fled.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,519
You were worried

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,120
that the secret marriage
between the two of you would be exposed,

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
so you didn't go to make a statement.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,640
All you need to do is to
sign your name on this piece of paper.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,959
I'll fix this for you soon,

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,640
and this will get you identified.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
It's the best way.

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,799
Mr. Jiang is coming over
to take you home.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,519
You have to be prepared.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,959
There may be some trouble

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,239
ahead.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,359
Here you are.

41
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,280
Your favorite drink.

42
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,640
Put it here.

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,319
-Shenshen, I...
-I...

44
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:10,960
I know.

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
Zicheng told me about it.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,520
Are you really gonna marry Wu Yanzhu?

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,680
Yes.

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
But you don't know her identity.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,319
I already know.

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,199
What?

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,479
She has no ill intentions toward me,

52
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,400
and

53
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,000
I probably won't find the killer.

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,080
Jiang Zhe.

55
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,759
Shenshen.

56
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,319
I don't want to do anything worthless.

57
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,719
Don't ask me

58
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,520
the reason.

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
What about me?

60
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,960
I always see you as my family.

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,879
They're coming.

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
Do you plan to get married?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,520
Out of the way, please.

64
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,439
You didn't tell me it's such a hassle.

65
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,240
Are you really married, Mr. Jiang?

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,000
Is this your girlfriend?

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,479
Mr. Jiang.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,319
Let's go.

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,759
I know

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,879
you have a lot of questions

71
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,960
about me and my wife.

72
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,680
Today,

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,120
I'd like you all

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,719
to be witnesses.

75
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,080
It turns out to be true.

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,680
A ring.

77
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,439
Is he gonna propose?

78
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,080
Wait.

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,120
It requires binding an ID card, right?

80
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,800
And

81
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,400
this is the first time
I've ever worn a ring.

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
It lacks any sense of occasion.

83
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,639
It's my first time too.

84
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,079
But a relationship based on lies

85
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,720
is not good, right?

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,480
But,

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,120
the ring is real.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,800
I know.

89
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,560
You have so many assets here.

90
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
You definitely wouldn't
fool me with a fake ring.

91
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,199
But,

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,600
do you know
what it means to give a girl a DR ring?

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,279
One can only buy a DR ring per lifetime.

94
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,959
This means the woman

95
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
is the only love of his life.

96
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,759
This is our engagement ring

97
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,040
which represents

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
my love for her.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Oh, my god.

100
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,560
Does it look good?

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,879
This interview is over. Thank you all.

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
Mrs. Jiang.

103
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,600
Mrs. Jiang?

104
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,279
Yeah.

105
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,959
They are all waiting
for you to come back

106
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,639
and say hello to them.

107
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
Hello.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Hello.

109
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,680
Bye.

110
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
Are you serious?

111
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,480
Let me

112
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,519
live in a room with you?

113
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,480
Of course.

114
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,560
We're already married anyway.

115
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,279
Of course we have to share a room.

116
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,199
Besides,

117
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,560
people are watching.

118
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,959
But...

119
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,040
I've run a bath, ma'am.

120
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,360
You can go to the bathroom now.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,120
Take some rest.

122
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm going out for a while.

123
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,439
Yeah!

124
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,279
I'm married.

125
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,079
I'm really married.

126
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,240
So you like
the number four, sexy, X-rated style?

127
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,439
When did you come here?

128
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,839
I heard you want simple romance,

129
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,959
but now it seems not.

130
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,319
I just wanted to know

131
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,839
what it is.

132
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,360
Is there no men's underwear
in your world?

133
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,120
Forget it, please.

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,720
What are you laughing at?

135
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
Seeing you makes me happy.

136
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,360
But you

137
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,879
picked me up so late today.

138
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,079
It's really hard to prepare a wedding
in such a short time,

139
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,120
and I had to make up
a story of our relationship

140
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,319
based on my travel records.

141
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,199
But

142
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,920
don't you think it's too much?

143
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,720
I said I wanted a sweet love story.

144
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,439
I didn't say I was going to get married.

145
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,920
A sweet love story

146
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,360
starts now.

147
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,560
Just a minute.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,439
Sit.

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,360
I don't know

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
if this is enough.

151
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
What?

152
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,639
I asked the women in my company

153
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,399
what simple romance is,

154
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,879
and they gave me this book,

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,720
saying this is all the simple

156
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,399
and romantic things women love.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,639
Are you going to tie up my hair?

158
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,079
Yeah.

159
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,039
It's your first time, right?

160
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,399
Yes.

161
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,679
Take a look at it.

162
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,120
Is there anything
you want to do in the book?

163
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,279
Let's do it all together

164
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,120
while we still can.

165
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,919
Don't look at me like that,

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
or my heart will shake again.

167
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,039
Then I will never see you again.

168
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,200
So

169
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,360
never say you love me.

170
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,759
Hey.

171
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,519
Watch it, man!
