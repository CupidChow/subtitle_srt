=Episode 11=

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,599
Dad.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,480
Why can't we find Jiang Zhe?

18
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,120
It's been a month.

19
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,200
Did he go back to the comic

20
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,760
when he jumped?

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,560
He's a comic character after all.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,760
That's where he'll go back to, right?

23
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,480
That's hard to tell.

24
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,680
Dad.

25
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,959
I have a question actually.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,439
Now that the comic has ended.

27
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,719
What about the world in the comic?

28
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,920
Do the people there
still live their life?

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,920
Or does their life stop

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,640
at the last frame?

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,079
Yanzhu.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,879
Do you want me to draw something

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,319
just like the other readers?

34
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,400
To bring him back to life?

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,240
Not really.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,479
I've thought about
bringing him back to life.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,280
He's so good with guns.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,039
He could've killed me easily.

39
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,719
I asked him to shoot me.

40
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,599
Shoot me.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Kill me.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,639
Otherwise, he would never shoot.

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,280
I know what kind of person he is.

44
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,879
For me,

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,479
the comic is only a fiction.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,520
But for him,

47
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,159
I'm the one who destroyed his family.

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,199
He let me alive.

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,199
I wanted to let him alive too.

50
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,759
But I can't change the ending
no matter how hard I try.

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,879
So,

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,560
I had to give up.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,479
But I don't want to

54
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,680
get you involved in all this.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you understand?

56
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,560
Yanzhu.

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,319
This is Mr. Li.

58
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,759
He graduated from a top school,
and has a well-paid job.

59
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,159
You don't have to do anything
after you marry him.

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,360
You can just stay home as a housewife.

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,919
Hello, Miss Wu.

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,039
Um.

63
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,560
You are very pretty, Miss Wu.

64
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,719
Haha.

65
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,560
Haha.

66
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,439
Hello? Yeah?

67
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,759
Please wait a second.

68
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,919
Excuse me.

69
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,719
I have to answer this call.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Okay.

71
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,199
I'm on my way there.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Okay.

73
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,800
She's so pretty.

74
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,839
Hello, Liu Feng.

75
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,040
Call me in 20 minutes.

76
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,839
Just say the hospital is asking for me.

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Don't ask why. Just do it.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Hello, Liu Feng?

79
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:30,959
Hello?

80
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,199
Hello?

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,079
Can you hear me?

82
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,439
Hello?

83
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,199
Yuanyuan.

84
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:44,720
Yanzhu.

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,240
Miss Wu.

86
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,759
Give me your phone.

87
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,439
What's wrong?

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
(The end)

89
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,784
(To be continued)

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,639
Yanzhu?

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,360
What...

92
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Sorry, Mr. Li.

93
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,800
There must be some
emergency at her hospital.

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,639
Dad!

95
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,959
Mr. Wu said he's going
to travel for a bit

96
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,959
and left early in the morning.

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,920
Sis.

98
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,920
Why is your hair wet?

99
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,959
Is it raining out there?

100
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,639
Liu Feng.

101
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,560
Come here.

102
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,680
Save Jiang Zhe.

103
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,959
Hurry up.

104
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,519
Jiang Zhe's body was found?

105
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,680
The last month didn't pass

106
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,079
in the comic world.

107
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,360
The world stopped.

108
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,720
If the comic ends there,

109
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,800
everything will stop at the last frame.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
I just saw it.

112
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,680
I saw Jiang Zhe in the lake.

113
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,639
I got dragged into that world again.

114
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,279
Again?

115
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,680
I don't understand.

116
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,759
The protagonist chose to commit suicide.

117
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,720
And the comic has ended.

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,319
Why does it say
it is to be continued here?

119
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,600
Is it because

120
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,839
there's a reason it can't end here?

121
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,759
What could be the reason?

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,879
What are you doing there?

123
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,519
Ah!

124
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,319
I remember Mr. Wu said

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,759
the character Jiang Zhe

126
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,839
is based on a picture you drew
when you were little.

127
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
That means

128
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,519
it's you who created him.

129
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Maybe

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,560
you should be the one to draw.

131
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,319
But I haven't drawn anything in ages.

132
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,439
Have a try.

133
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,240
Okay.

134
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,319
I have to save him.

135
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,439
The doctors have checked.

136
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,720
They said he's fine.

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,360
You woke up.

138
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,439
Thank god. You are fine.

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,120
What happened?

140
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,360
Why are you in the lake?

141
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,639
Why am I here?

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Someone saved you from the lake.

143
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,160
Hey, you!

144
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
Don't do it!

145
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,040
You disappeared

146
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,279
after going to visit Wu Yanzhu.

147
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,839
What happened exactly?

148
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,759
Wu Yanzhu...

149
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,199
You woke up.

150
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,720
What were you saying about Wu Yanzhu?

151
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,519
Wu Yanzhu

152
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,800
showed up in the detention house.

153
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,680
