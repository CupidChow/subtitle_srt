194
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,310
He used your mother

195
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,190
to threaten me

196
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,280
and force me to give him money.

197
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,790
Then, I really had no choice,

198
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,550
so I gave him a very risky solution,

199
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,000
but

200
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,710
I really didn't expect

201
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,790
that he would commit arson to cheat the insurance payout.

202
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,280
Forget that.

203
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,040
- Let's go. - Let's go.

204
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,190
Did you bring that notebook with you?

205
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,280
Notebook...

206
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,670
Bank card?

207
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,280
You don't have it?

208
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,430
Oh, no. I forgot my Optimus Prime at home.

209
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,070
Yi, good boy.

210
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,950
We have to hurry.

211
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,480
Forget that.

212
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,120
Come on. Hold him.

213
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,430
What are you doing?

214
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,590
I'm going back and get it.

215
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,520
Get what? Just go.

216
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,430
Your life is more important.

217
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,430
If I don't get it,

218
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,520
how will you live?

219
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,360
Let's go.

220
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,880
The fire is not that bad now.

221
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:30,790
Son.

222
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,360
I'll get you the Optimus Prime.

223
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,670
Be careful.

224
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,120
Go with Lin Yi first.

225
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,430
Be careful.

226
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,000
I was about to send him the money

227
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,910
when I got it,

228
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,590
but by the time

229
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,070
I got to his house,

230
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,430
it was already too late.

231
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,880
I heard that his wife

232
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,520
and Lin Yi finally escaped.

233
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,880
Later, I looked for them

234
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,360
for years

235
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,400
but never found them.

236
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,640
Jiahe.

237
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,430
I know what I did was wrong.

238
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,430
I've always really thought of Chongshan

239
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,550
as my friend,

240
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,400
and how could I possibly do anything

241
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,910
like killing someone

242
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,280
or setting fire?

243
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,070
Besides, I'm your father.

244
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,310
Xu Mingli, listen.

245
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,040
I will never recognize you

246
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,190
as my father in my life.

247
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,360
For what you did to my mom,

248
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,310
I'll make you pay twice.

249
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,360
You and Lin Chongshan

250
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,590
are both evil

251
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,880
and selfish.

252
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,640
And

253
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,640
don't let Nuo know

254
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,910
what we said today.

255
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,640
Do you hear me?

256
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,280
Answer me.

257
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,760
OK.

258
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,160
Do you love me?

259
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,910
I want you to say it yourself.

260
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,160
I love you.

261
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,950
I love you too.

262
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,280
Nuo.

263
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,520
You're the only one for me.

264
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,520
I love you.
