in Singapore,

194
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,390
so...

195
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,220
so...

196
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,030
so we can have Chairman Xu's daughter,

197
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,950

198
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,670
act as chairman.

[Yuanfei Group board meeting]

200
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,860
We can still make another decision

201
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,070
once the investigation results are in.

202
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,150
Me?

203
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,390
I have no objection.

204
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,620
I agree.

[Yuanfei Group board meeting]

206
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,790
What happened between Shen Jiahe

207
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,270
and my father?

208
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,390
They don't seem

209
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,860
to be the same as before.

210
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,620
What happened in the board meeting?

211
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,150
Why does Su Ting have evidence

212
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,430
of Xu Mingli laundering money overseas?

213
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,430
I'm not sure,

214
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,740
but I swear

215
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,950
I never

216
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,310
sent that information to anyone.

217
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,950
Was your e-mail hacked?

218
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,310
No way.

219
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,550
I've checked it.

220
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,460
Did Su Ting personally hire someone to investigate?

221
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,820
I think no matter who

222
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,860
found this evidence,

223
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,580
it is good for you.

224
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,100
But what are you worried about?

225
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,950
Neither Xu Mingli

226
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
nor Xu Nuo

227
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,310
will blame you.

228
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,310
That's not what I'm worried about.

229
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,740
Then what is it?

230
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,950
It happened so suddenly

231
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,460
that I always felt something was wrong.

232
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,310
What's wrong?

233
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,910
So do you think

234
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,100
Shen Jiahe was the one

235
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,190
who set your dad up?

236
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,500
Only Shen Jiahe was handling

237
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,580
the unmanned supermarket program,

238
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,700
so only he had access

239
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,220
to the financial information.

240
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,740
But haven't you said

241
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,550
he didn't admit that he reported it?

242
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,670
I was with him at the time.

243
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,670
Based on his reaction,

244
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,070
it's not like he was pretending.

245
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,580
I think

246
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,620
it was possible that your uncle

247
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,430
got it through other channels.

248
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
No one will know it

249
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,070
if you don't do it.

250
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,950
You're right.

251
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,030
If he wasn't greedy,

252
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,030
how could he be caught?

253
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,070
Don't think about it.

254
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,980
You're a real

I've treated you well

260

all these years, right?

261
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,910
Why do you say that?

262
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,980
Of course.

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,910

All the shareholders supported that.

267
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,580
Even if I had voted against it,

268
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,740
it wouldn't have helped.

276
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,100
It's better for you to pledge it

277
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,820
to me than to someone else, isn't it?

278
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,790
Do you think I don't know

279
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,340
that the evidence about the overseas funds

280
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,910
was given to Su Ting by you?

This is what happens to greed.

I've raised you all these years,

290
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,390
but is this how you repay me?

291
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,950
I've been very considerate

292
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,500
of your nurturing of me.

What do you mean?

294
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,580

to build good fame.

is not the same

as what actually happened.

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,010
Then tell me

after all these years

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,620
that you found my mom?

apologizing to you today.

It was me...

to apologize through words?

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,930

Kneel for my mom.

Why do I need to kneel?

why you're still here

372
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,860
talking to me now?

373
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,890
Because of Nuo.

374
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,490
You're her father,

375
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,140
