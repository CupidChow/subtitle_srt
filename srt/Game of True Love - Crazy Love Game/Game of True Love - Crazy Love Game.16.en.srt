00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,180
to have met too late.

194
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,620
Zhang Shuyu

195
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,300
of Senwei Capital

196
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,940
is a notorious investor

197
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,570
in the industry.

198
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,370
He's either going to take liberties with you

199
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,620
or sell you out.

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,570
Xia.

201
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,500
Don't fall for him.

202
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,900
A friend of mine

203
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,850
has a good project and

204
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,850
is looking for investment recently.

205
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,940
What kind of program?

206
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,570
Eco-friendly skin care products.

207
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,940
Edible lipstick.

208
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,330
I'm really busy these days

209
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,020
and have too many projects.

210
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,140
OK.

211
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,210
I'll contact you later.

212
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,610
Okay. See you.

213
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,210
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,420
Are you blind?

215
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,570
It's you?

216
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,300
Aren't you Miss Xu who changes boyfriends

217
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,730
as often as she changes clothes?

218
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,660
Aren't you the suitor who gave me

219
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,260
a fake bag on my birthday?

220
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,780
I didn't know the bag was fake.

221
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,690
Good point.

222
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,940
How can a bag that was brought

223
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,090
all the way from the wholesale market

224
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,330
to Britain be fake?

225
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,490
Why did you come to my company?

226
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,090
Do you work for this company too?

227
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,260
Mr. Zhang from your company's

228
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,380
Project Department 1

229
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,060
says it's Senwei

230
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,900
who's interested

231
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,490
in our new beauty program.

232
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,490
Edible lipstick?

233
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,020
How did you know?

234
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,180
What a coincidence.

235
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,730
Zhang Shuyu,

236
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,060
head of Project 1 at Senwei Capital.

237
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,540
Nice to meet you, Xu Nuo.

238
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,730
She went to Zhang Shuyu?

239
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,180
One of her scumbag suitors?

240
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,260
That's what I heard from a friend

241
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,260
of mine at Senwei Capital.

242
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,810
She may not have any other options.

243
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,090
Zhang Shuyu.

244
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,060
A sleazy investor in the industry.

245
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,140
What can Nuo gain

246
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,060
from him?

247
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,810
Nuo would rather turn

248
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,850
to an underhanded investor

249
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,020
than you.

250
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,060
Doesn't that

251
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,660
say something already?

252
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,610
Seems I'm right.

253
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,810
I'm kidding.

254
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,300
No.

255
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,300
I'll have to ask someone to keep an eye on her.

256
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,450
How's it going?

257
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,940
I got a block booking for you.

258
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,850
Satisfied?

259
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,090
Why are you so generous

260
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,570
all of a sudden?

261
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,690
I've always been generous.

262
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,020
How many times have I explained to you?

263
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,300
I really didn't know

264
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,780
the bag was fake.

265
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,570
Haven't you got a block booking?

266
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,380
Didn't they say no one bought tickets for this movie?

267
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,330
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,610
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,330
What are you doing?

270
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,570
I'm getting excited.

271
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,090
I'm so excited. I'm sorry.

272
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm going to the bathroom.

274
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,970
Who's there?

275
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,300
Open the door.

276
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,260
[Cleaning]

277
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,780
Help me.

278
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,060
[Cleaning]

279
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,420
Why you?

280
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,570
Why can't it be me?

281
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,300
Boring.

282
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,660
Nuo.

283
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,090
Nuo.

284
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,380
Nuo.

285
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,900
Don't be mad, okay?

286
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,570
Nuo.

287
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,940
You don't have anything better to do, do you?

288
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,180
I know you're still mad

289
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,210
about the funding.

290
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,810
I told you

291
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,850
this was your first project.

292
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,610
The rest of the money will be here soon.

293
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,780
No need.

294
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,570
After this,

295
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,810
I don't need you to worry about it.

296
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,090
Then you can't come to Zhang Shuyu.

297
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,180
He's known in the industry

298
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,780
for being a scoundrel

299
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,020
and doing anything for profit.

300
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,730
What other choice do I have?

301
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,450
No need to say more.

302
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,060
I know

303
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,490
that my dad is behind it.

304
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,140
He doesn't want to pay Bai Xia's debts

305
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,210
with his own money,

306
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,730
so he wants something from me,

307
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,540
right?

308
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,450
How do you know that?

309
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,090
That's why

310
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,940
your compromise didn't work

311
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,730
at all.

312
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,730
If you try to help my mom get her equity back,

313
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,380
you'll just get robbed of everything by him.

314
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,970
Shen Jiahe.

315
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,020
You need to think hard

316
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,730
about who you're really trying to help.

317
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,300
Nuo.

318
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,690
And

319
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,610
stop sending Ao Zhe to follow me.

320
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,540
I ordered you a latte.

321
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,020
Thanks.

322
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,260
By the way,

323
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,850
where were you yesterday?

324
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,210
I called you, but you didn't answer.

325
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,690
I was in the restroom

326
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,690
on a conference call.

327
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,260
In the end, my cell phone ran out of battery.

328
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,850
Talking business in the toilet?

329
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,970
You're such a habitual liar.

330
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,210
Have you read the project materials?

331
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,690
This is the draft contract.

332
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,300
Take a look.

333
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,340
[Rights and obligations of both parties]

334
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,260
Looks like you've gotten

335
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,210
some guidance from experts.

336
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,660
All other terms are negotiable,

337
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,490
but the decision-making power

338
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,690
of this future project

339
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,850
must belong to me.

340
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,540
Actually,

341
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,610
I'm more interested

342
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,450
in you than this project.

343
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,690
I'm here to talk about the project.

344
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,490
Mr. Zhang.

345
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,210
To be honest,

346
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,610
Senwei's assessment

347
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,180
of your project isn't very good,

348
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,570
but

349
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,540
as long as you

350
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,970
promise to fall in love

351
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,850
with me,

352
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,380
I'll give you

353
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,010
this.

354
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,620
Convince me with just 20 million?

355
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,180
Do you think you can

356
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,380
have it all with money?

357
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,860
That's not what I mean.

358
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,940
I want you to give me a chance

359
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,900
to court you.

360
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,970
When you first courted me,

361
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,100
I told you

362
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,380
we weren't meant to be in love.

363
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,140
About the project, that's all.

364
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:26,860
