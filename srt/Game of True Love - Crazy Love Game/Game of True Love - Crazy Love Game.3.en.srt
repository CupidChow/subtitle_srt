let's go.

194
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,630
Quick, take pictures.

195
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,540
[Send]

196
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,300
[Zhao Lin]

197
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,200
This is so shocking.

198
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,720
Yes. It's going to trend soon.

199
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,080
Shen Jiahe, put me down!

200
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,270
Put me down!

201
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,630
Are you crazy?

202
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,960
Can you stop going against me?

203
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,960
Nuo, can you stop causing trouble?

204
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,200
What are you doing?

205
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,200
It's not worth doing this.

206
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,870
Let go!

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,960
Don't go!

208
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Let go!

209
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,600
Be careful!

210
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,120
Are you all right?

211
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,150
Look!

212
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,910
She got on top of him!

213
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,200
Shen Jiahe!

214
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,480
Look what you did!

215
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,670
Enough!

216
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,840
Nuo, enough!

217
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,960
That's enough.

218
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,030
If you want pictures of you being taken,

219
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,870
do whatever you like.

220
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,240
Hurting others at your own expense.

221
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,750
Apart from...

222
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,960
I just want to avenge my mother.

223
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,910
Shen Jiahe,

224
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,000
you are still protecting Bai Xia.

225
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,910
Do you still have feelings for her?

226
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,790
Why do you still let her and my father...

227
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,510
I was protecting you.

228
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,360
Hello.

229
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,390
Mr. Shen,

230
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm asking them to delete the videos one by one

231
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,270
but some media outlets

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,910
are not cooperating.

233
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,120
Get Lawyer Xing to deal with it.

234
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Don't let any video

235
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,790
get uploaded on the internet.

236
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,600
Do you hear me?

237
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,240
Understood.

238
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,390
There's no use deleting them now.

239
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,480
Perhaps

240
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,720
they are all over the internet now.

241
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,630
Do you want

242
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,720
everyone to treat you like a laughing stock

243
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,600
on the internet?

244
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,480
It's great to have it posted on the internet.

245
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,960
We'll get everyone to be the judge.

246
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,790
Get in.

247
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,630
How can I explain this

248
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,790
to Mr. Xu if you look like this?

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,320
Go and get changed.

250
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,510
A sly rabbit has many burrows.

251
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,630
Is this a place

252
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,670
where you date other women?

253
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,960
Go and take a hot shower

254
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,720
and get changed.

255
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,720
Don't catch a cold.

256
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,120
I got the video.

257
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,440
[Dan]

258
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
Thankfully, you reminded me

259
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,870
to ask reporters to bring a backup phone.

260
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,270
Shen Jiahe got someone

261
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,510
to install signal jammers there.

262
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,030
Blow it up as much as possible.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,910
Whether I can join Yuanfei or not

264
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,600
depends on this.

265
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,870
Don't worry.

266
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,360
Just leave the rest to me.

267
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,240
No one can stop

268
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,080
what I'm trying to do.

269
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,150
The ginger tea will be ready soon.

270
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,790
Go and take a seat.

271
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,670
Nuo.

272
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,910
What are you doing acting so mysteriously?

273
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
Dorfler's Master Bow?

274
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,390
Where did you get it?

275
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,510
I've been saving up for a long time

276
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,480
before I could buy it.

277
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,910
Look and see if you like it or not.

278
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,240
I like it.

279
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,360
Have some ginger tea to warm up.

280
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,270
Don't catch a cold.

281
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,840
You haven't told me

282
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,840
why you protected Bai Xia

283
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,670
in public today.

284
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:26,910
Are you jealous?

285
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,910
The one who should be jealous

286
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,840
is the daughter of Wansheng Group.

287
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,270
Why should I be jealous?

288
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,630
I've canceled my marriage with her.

289
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,870
When?

290
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,670
A day before you returned to the country.

291
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,390
No wonder.

292
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,120
He purposely lured me to catch him in an affair

293
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,320
but he made me

294
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,150
realize how my father was having an affair.

295
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,720
If he was the one who arranged Bai Xai there

296
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,150
to let me find out,

297
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,080
how did it benefit them?

298
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,790
Is he trying to make do the dirty work?

299
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,840
Why are you looking at me?

300
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,240
Mr. Shen.

301
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,630
[Ao Zhe]

302
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,270
Sorry.

303
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,150
Someone still uploaded the video

304
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,750
Today,

305
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,000
Xu Nuo, the daughter of Yuanfei Group's chairman

306
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,510
made a scene at the grand opening

307
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,270
of Bai Xia's beauty club

308
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,270
to accuse Bai Xia of breaking her parents' marriage.

309
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,910
Their argument

310
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,390
was recorded by every reporter present.

311
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,790
Did you do this?

312
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,840
Shen Jiahe,

313
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,030
how about a wager?

314
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,510
What are you wagering?

315
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,310
You used me in a deceptive scheme

316
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,270
to get Bai Xia to marry into the Xu family.

317
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,510
I'm betting that your plan

318
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,150
will end up in failure.

319
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,030
I'm leaving.

320
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,270
Are you going back just like this?

321
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,000
Mr. Xu is still angry.

322
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,630
Hello.

323
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,720
Hello.

324
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,790
Jiahe,

325
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
why did that happen?

326
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,910
If it blows up,

327
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,000
how can I still live my life?

328
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,270
You are not a mistress.

329
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,630
The innocent need no defense.

330
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,320
That might be the case,

331
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,960
but people might not believe me.

332
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,670
Instead of worrying,

333
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,550
you should

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,870
