00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,600
No need.

196
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,360

200
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,270
Nuo.

201
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,720
Why are you so noisy this early in the morning?

202
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,870
Why is he here?

203
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,870
What's he got to do with you?

204
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,510
What are you doing?

205
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,840
Jiahe.

206
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080

Happy birthday.

216
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,790
Thank you.

217
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,790
Make a wish.

218
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,030
Look at that.

219
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,480
It's beautiful.

220
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,440
It's beautiful.

221
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,910
So is this one.

222
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,030
Doesn't Chi Ye know

223
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,910
that Nuo hates fireworks?

224
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,550
He's finished.

225
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,360
Shut up.

226
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,360
Nuo.

227
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,720
I've always loved you,

228
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,870
so can you give me a chance

229
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,440
to love you openly and properly?

230
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,030
Chi Ye.

231
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,720
I don't like fireworks,

232
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,670
but since you gave me this,

233
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,270
I'm going to start

234
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,270
liking it from today.

235
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,240
Bro.

236
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,510
So it's not fireworks

237
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,270
that Nuo doesn't like

238
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,880
but you.

239
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,310
Where are you going?

240
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
I'm kidding, Jiahe.

241
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,030
Where are you going?

242
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,200
Nuo.

243
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,200
Shen Jiahe is gone.

244
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,960
Well done.

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,550
It was my honor.

246
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
I hope we're not playing along.

247
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,640
What did you say?

248
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:53,920
