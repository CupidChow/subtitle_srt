[Episode 15]

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,820
Dad.

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,220
Don't throw them away.

14
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,250
This room has to be reserved

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,140
for Jiahe,

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,700
or he won't have a place to stay.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,340
OK?

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,910
You'll have a brother in the future,

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,680
so you don't need to play with toys all the time,

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,110
do you?

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,440
He's not my brother.

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,170
Dad.

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,340
Don't take them away.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,840
He's not my brother.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,900
Here, candy.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,500
Who wants your candy?

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,650
What's wrong? What's going on?

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,500
Who broke this vase?

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,250
Who did it?

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,090
Was it you, Jiahe?

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,730
It was me.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,500
You did it?

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,730
Why were you so careless?

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,810
Did you hurt your hand?

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,250
I'm sorry, Dad.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,090
It's okay.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,500
We can buy a new one,

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,500
okay?

39
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,420
I'll ask a nanny to clean it.

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,730
Thank you.

41
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,700
Because that's what I did.

42
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,410
Actually, I knew

43
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,410
at that time that was your duplicity.

44
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,850
You always say you hate me

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,250
but have actually been helping me.

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,970
I'm a person

47
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,250
who knows right from wrong,

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,130
is reasonable, and will admit

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,340
when I've done something wrong.

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,810
I know that.

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,300
When you apologized to me

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,490
in the auditorium,

53
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,250
I had a hard time accepting it

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,130
and said a lot of hurtful things.

55
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,250
It seems like

56
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,500
that's when we started

57
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,900
to have a bad relationship.

58
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,970
Later, Bai Xia appeared,

59
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,280
and it got worse.

60
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,300
Actually, nothing happened

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,250
between Bai Xia and me.

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,610
What you saw was all done

63
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,130
by me to rile you.

64
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,930
What about now?

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,610
Since nothing happened then,

66
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,620
it's even more so now.

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,940
Otherwise,

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,620
would she be your dad's fiancee?

69
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,570
Actually, that's not

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,220
what I really care about.

71
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,180
You want to talk about the fact

72
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,780
that I stayed neutral when Uncle Xu

73
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,410
and Aunt Rong got divorced, right?

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,620
When I was a kid, you know,

75
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,130
my dad

76
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,250
killed himself out of debt.

77
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,850
When I was five,

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,370
my mom couldn't hold out

79
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,010
and abandoned me.

80
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,690
For all the years I lived in your home,

81
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,100
Aunt Rong

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,420
treated me like my own mother.

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,690
I share your frustration

84
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,180
at seeing Aunt Rong now,

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,660
but I don't want to disobey

86
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,620
your father now.

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,810
I want to stay

88
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,690
and look for opportunities

89
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,690
to help Aunt Rong fight for more.

90
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,370
I can see

91
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,060
that you are true to my mom.

92
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,180
And I'm true to you.

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,100
Shen Jiahe.

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,690
Did we really break up

95
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,130
because of what I said

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,060
in the auditorium?

97
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,860
What do you mean?

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,690
I just feel

99
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,500
as if you've changed your attitude

100
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,210
towards my dad since then.

101
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,330
You're

102
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,570
polite

103
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,620
but seem hostile to him.

104
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,690
Do you have any more secrets?

105
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,130
It doesn't matter.

106
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,060
You don't have to tell me

107
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,540
if you don't want to.

108
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,180
I can tell you.

109
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,740
Jiahe.

110
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,770
I want to tell you something.

111
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,690
You and Nuo

112
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,010
are not children anymore.

113
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,810
You're adults.

114
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,210
She may be ignorant,

115
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,940
but you have to watch your behavior,

116
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,060
OK?

117
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,740
You mustn't

118
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,100
get too close.

119
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,420
You're brother and sister, after all.

120
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,860
If outsiders see that,

121
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,980
they'll say something bad about us,

122
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,810
understand?

123
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,860
But we're not related by blood.

124
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,570
What do you mean?

125
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,690
Listen.

126
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,300
If you want to stay in this family,

127
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,540
you can't have

128
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,810
any inappropriate ideas.

129
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:41,940
What if I don't stay

130
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,810
in this family anymore?

131
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,620
What?

132
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,660
You've grown up

133
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,860
and think you're good, don't you?

134
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,620
Do you believe I'll make it impossible

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,180
for you to find Nuo in Binhai?

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,660
Stop right there.

137
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,980
Listen.

138
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,940
If you keep

139
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,130
your brother-sister relationship

140
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,450
with Nuo

141
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,420
as per our agreement,

142
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,330
you'll always

143
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,500
be my son

144
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,500
and get a share

145
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,540
of my property.

146
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,890
If you do anything

147
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,370
to jeopardize my family,

148
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,010
don't blame me

149
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,060
for being unkind to you.

150
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,740
You should have told me earlier.

151
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,540
Good point.

152
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,860
How could someone as reputation-conscious

153
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,890
as my father approve of our relationship?

154
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,890
He adopted you back then

155
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,690
because of my mom's insistence.

156
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,540
Besides, he just wanted

157
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,690
good fame for himself.

158
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,570
Shen Jiahe.

159
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,130
Do you

160
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,180
really...

161
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,940
Yes.

162
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,860
Throughout,

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,450
I've always

164
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,100
loved only you.

165
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,660
There are only a few days left

166
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,940
before the deadline we agreed upon,

167
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,770
so I want to ask.

168
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,450
Do you love me?

169
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,540
I...

170
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,970
It doesn't matter.

171
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,140
You

172
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,300
don't have to answer me right away.

173
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,090
We've said so much today.

174
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,020
You can think it over again.

175
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,380
It just so happens

176
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,660
that I have a business trip tomorrow.

177
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,060
You can answer me

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,380
after you've thought it over.

179
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,490
By that time,

180
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,330
even if I lose,

181
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,780
I'll resign myself to my fate.

182
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,060
Do you

183
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,420
really...

184
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,090
Yes.

185
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,660
Throughout,

186
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,140
I've always

187
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,260
loved only you.

188
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,730
I want to ask.

189
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,090
Do you love me?

190
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,610
It's not easy for a strong-willed person

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,970
like Shen Jiahe

192
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,450
to make it this far.

193
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,380
But it all happens

194
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,300
