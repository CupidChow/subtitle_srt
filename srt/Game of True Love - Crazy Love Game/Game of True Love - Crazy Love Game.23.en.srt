I'm going out for afternoon tea,

195
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,960
and I can wear them.

196
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,870
You are back.

197
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,200
Have you had lunch?

198
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
There's no food left for you.

199
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,150
Hello?

200
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,270
Hello? Nuo.

201
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,790
Have you found a place?

202
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,840
I'm too busy during the day.

203
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,320
I haven't

204
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,120
had time yet.

205
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,120
If you've been

206
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,550
bullied by those two,

207
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,080
you can move in

208
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
with me for now.

209
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Aright.

210
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,080
I'll pack my things

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,870
and go find you later.

212
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,840
Okay, be careful on the way.

213
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,200
She's finally leaving.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,390
Men

215
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,360
are just something to have fun with.

216
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,030
No big deal.

217
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,750
Where are my earrings?

218
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,960
What are you doing?

219
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,030
These were my grandmother's

220
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,390
birthday gift to me.

221
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,750
How dare you steal them?

222
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,630
You...

223
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,000
You're slandering me!

224
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm slandering you?

225
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,360
These are mine.

226
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,200
I have surveillance on my phone.

227
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,630
Let's go.

228
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,870
I...

229
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,720
I didn't steal them.

230
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,670
I found them under the couch.

231
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,510
You can go talk to the police.

232
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,790
Come with me.

233
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,600
I really didn't steal them.

234
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
Let go of me.

235
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,630
I really found them

236
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,000
under the couch.

237
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,000
What's going on?

238
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,840
Xia, you're finally back.

239
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,390
She's taking me to the police station.

240
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,360
Why?

241
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,000
Your mom stole my stuff!

242
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
What do you mean, stole?

243
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,030
Watch your mouth.

244
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,670
Everything in this house

245
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
was bought by your dad.

246
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,200
What's your dad's is Xia's.

247
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,720
And what's Xia's is mine.

248
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,510
Fine, explain it to the police then.

249
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,600
Seriously.

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:27,840
Come on.

251
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,750
Come with me.

252
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,480
I really didn't steal them.

253
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,000
Come with me.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,790
Let go of me.

255
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,510
I have evidence.

256
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,200
I told you I found them.

257
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,000
Stop lying.

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,910
Don't you slander me.

259
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,390
Oh, no! Xia!

260
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,240
Xia!

261
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,630
Xia!

262
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,320
Xia!

263
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,480
Xia!

264
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,440
Xia!

265
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,200
Xia!

266
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,080
Xia,

267
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,150
are you okay?

268
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Did you get hurt?

269
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:50,960
Xia!

270
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,790
My belly hurts.

271
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
What happened to her?

272
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,840
Nuo.

273
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,910
Call an ambulance!

274
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,910
Right now!

275
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,030
What's going on?

276
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,630
Call an ambulance!

277
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,390
Hurry!

278
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,510
Hello?

279
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,670
We have a pregnant woman here

280
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,320
who fell and got hurt.

281
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,030
No. 1, Huaihai Road.

282
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,870
Please hurry!

283
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,150
Xu Mingli,

284
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,870
look what your daughter

285
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,960
has done to Xia.

286
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,320
Not only did she accuse me of stealing,

287
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,670
but she also pushed Xia

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,080
down the stairs

289
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,910
from such a height.

290
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,150
Who knows if the baby can survive?

291
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,750
From...

292
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,790
From such a high place...

293
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,510
Dad,

294
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,240
I...

295
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
I didn't mean to.

296
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,840
You didn't mean to?

297
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,960
Mr. Xu, what are you doing?

298
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,320
Dad, you hit me?

299
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,000
Hit you?

300
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,320
Yes, I did.

301
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,960
Don't you know Xia is pregnant?

302
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,750
How could you

303
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,840
push a pregnant woman

304
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,550
down the stairs?

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,960
What were you thinking?

306
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,320
I'm going to

307
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,720
beat you to death.

308
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,630
Mr. Xu.

309
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,270
Nuo didn't do it on purpose.

310
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,360
She didn't?

311
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,240
Ask her if she

312
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,270
did it on purpose.

313
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,150
It's not the first time she's picked on Xia.

314
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,390
You've always

315
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,440
been reckless,

316
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,240
willful, and out of control.

317
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,000
Let me tell you,

318
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,960
you're just like

319
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,840
your mother, Su Rong.

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,320
You are beyond help!

321
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,440
Xu Mingli.

322
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,240
She's bleeding!

323
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,360
She's bleeding!

324
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,510
She's bleeding!

325
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Hurry, the ambulance!

326
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,000
Is the ambulance here yet?

327
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
Jiahe, help.

328
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,320
Has the ambulance arrived?

329
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Nuo, wait for me to come back.

330
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,670
Quick, take her to the hospital.

331
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,440
Xia! Xia!

332
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,460
[Outpatient]

333
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,870
That really scared me.

334
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,270
Luckily, it's nothing serious.

335
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
The doctor said,

336
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,240
from now on,

337
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,390
you need to rest well,

338
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,240
and you'll be fine.

339
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,030
It's good for the baby too.

340
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,510
I'm fine now.

341
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,600
Mingli,

342
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,080
it's not that I'm petty,

343
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,440
but your daughter

344
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,720
is too much for us to handle.

345
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,550
This time, Xia was lucky.

346
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,840
But in the future,

347
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,750
who knows if the child

348
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,000
can be born safely?

349
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,910
Not to mention how much

350
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,320
she'll be picked on.

351
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,240
Mom,

352
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,390
don't talk nonsense.

353
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,510
Nuo was just agitated at the time.

354
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,750
She didn't do it on purpose.

355
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,390
I... I really need

356
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,870
to apologize to you.

357
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,270
I... I failed

358
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,120
to educate her well.

359
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,790
I'll discipline her properly when I get back.

360
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,030
I... I apologize to you.

361
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,120
I'm really sorry.

362
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,870
Mom,

363
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,670
Mingli has apologized.

364
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,120
Just let it go.

365
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,000
And I promise you,

366
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,670
this kind of thing will never

367
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,670
happen again.

368
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,000
I believe

369
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,080
I still have

370
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,440
the final say in my house.

371
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,480
You said it yourself.

372
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,360
Yes, I said it.

373
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,390
You promised me

374
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,480
you'd take good care of Xia,

375
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,670
and that's why I agreed to your marriage.

376
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,320
I know.

377
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,150
Let Xu Nuo

378
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,360
come over and apologize to Xia right now.

379
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,200
Apologize?

380
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,790
You all should apologize

381
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,080
to my daughter first.

382
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,120
She pushed her,

383
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,080
and she thinks she's in the right?

384
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,750
Let me tell you, Su Rong.

385
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,510
Xu Nuo turned out this way

386
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,870
because you spoiled her.

387
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,000
You...

388
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Mom.

389
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,840
She...

390
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,080
She...

391
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,270
She seemed hurt pretty bad at the time.

392
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,790
Don’t worry.

393
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,840
She's fine.

394
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
I can tell from your father's tone

395
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,600
that she's fine.

396
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,080
Mom,

397
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,320
I didn't do it on purpose.

398
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,720
I was just angry.

399
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,150
I was mad that her mom stole my earrings.

400
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,960
I know.

401
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,790
You definitely didn't mean to.

402
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,960
I forgot she was pregnant.

403
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,750
I forgot she... she...

404
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,600
I know.

405
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,120
You didn't do it on purpose.

406
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,630
But your dad went too far.

407
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,270
No matter what,

408
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,270
he shouldn't have hit you.

409
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,840
Mom,

410
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,510
dad has changed.

411
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,870
Ever since I was little,

412
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,750
he's never hit me

413
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,960
no matter how angry he was.

414
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,910
But after he met Bai Xia,

415
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
it's not the first time

416
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,550
he's hit me.

417
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
It's all my fault.

418
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,960
You suffered because of me.

419
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
Since he's this heartless,

420
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,200
there's no point

421
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,320
acknowledging him as your father anymore.

422
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,480
Mom.
