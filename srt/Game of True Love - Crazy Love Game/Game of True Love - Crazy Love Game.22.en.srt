00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,040
Xu Nuo, you're here.

197
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,270
Come here.

198
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,160
It's my daughter Xu Nuo.

199
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,830
Remember her?

200
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,240
I do.

201
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,430
When we worked together,

202
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,270
she was just

203
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,270
a little girl, right?

204
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,320
She's grown up.

205
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,550
It's Mr. Jiang.

206
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,360
Mr. Jiang.

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,030
Nice to see you.

208
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,750
I'm having lunch

209
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,440
with my daughter.

210
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,550
Why don't you join us?

211
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,510
No, it's fine.

212
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,790
I still have things to do.

213
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,840
I'm leaving.

214
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,600
We'll talk later then.

215
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Alright.

216
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,120
Take care.

217
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,960
Don't sit there.

218
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,000
Come sit next to me.

219
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,200
Waitress,

220
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,000
the dishes can be served now.

221
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,480
What is it, dad?

222
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,150
Why did you suddenly

223
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,960
decide to treat me to lunch?

224
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,750
We could've talked at home.

225
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,630
I called you out today

226
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,600
because I think there are two things

227
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,630
worth celebrating.

228
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,000
First, you've been promoted

229
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,840
to director

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,870
at the company.

231
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm really happy for you.

232
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,390
Here.

233
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,750
Thanks, dad.

234
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,910
Cheers.

235
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
You've really given those people

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
who thought you got

237
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,270
the position

238
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,030
through connections a slap in the face.

239
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,630
You've shown them what

240
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,120
"like father, like daughter" means.

241
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,390
Right?

242
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,960
No one in the company

243
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,550
doubts my abilities except you.

244
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,390
Come on.

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,750
And, I've got another good piece of news.

246
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Xia...

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,510
Xia is pregnant.

248
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
Pregnant?

249
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,750
Yes, we're planning

250
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,360
to get married soon.

251
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,240
We'll register first and have the wedding later.

252
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,000
Since she's pregnant,

253
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,440
we are practically family now.

254
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,200
So I talked to her,

255
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,390
and she agreed

256
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,630
to move in

257
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,270
with us.

258
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,200
Nuo,

259
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,200
she's already made a compromise.

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,120
Can you please meet her

261
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,240
halfway?

262
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,670
Just do it for me, okay?

263
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,150
I remember when you were little,

264
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,030
you always said,

265
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,200
"Dad, Dad,

266
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
I want a little brother."

267
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,200
Now your wish is coming true.

268
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,270
Your little brother is on the way.

269
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
A little brother from her?

270
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,120
I don't need it.

271
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:40,870
Dad,

272
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,840
I thought you invited me

273
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,240
to lunch to celebrate

274
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,440
my promotion.

275
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,870
Turns out you just wanted to tell me this.

276
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,390
Since you've made your decision,

277
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,120
what else do you want me to say?

278
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,390
I still have work to do. I'm leaving.

279
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,200
Nuo.

280
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,910
And,

281
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,390
I've got another good piece of news.

282
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,750
Xia is pregnant.

283
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,390
Your little brother is on the way.

284
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,790
Pei,

285
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,030
I'm not hungry.

286
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,150
Take it away.

287
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,270
It's me.

288
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,720
Why are you crying?

289
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,360
I've heard.

290
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,510
About Bai Xia's pregnancy, right?

291
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,030
I knew it.

292
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,630
My dad no longer cares

293
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,630
about me and my mother.

294
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,910
But at least

295
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm still his only daughter.

296
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,550
Once Bai Xia's child is born,

297
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,910
I'll probably mean

298
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,240
even less to him.

299
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,120
I know you're sad.

300
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,670
But deep down, you knew

301
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,750
this day would come,

302
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,790
right?

303
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,320
Even if they have a child,

304
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,790
you are still

305
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,870
Mr. Xu's daughter.

306
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,150
No one can change that.

307
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,550
Right?

308
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,200
Your mother

309
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,600
has moved on,

310
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
and you are doing better at Yuanfei.

311
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,200
Your world

312
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,960
isn't just about the Xu family anymore.

313
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,790
You have me now.

314
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,670
Don't worry.

315
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,750
As long as I'm here,

316
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
no one can shake your position.

317
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,440
Thank you.

318
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Now,

319
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,630
have some congee.

320
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,790
Let me feed you.

321
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,390
How is it?

322
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,480
I simmered it for a long time.

323
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,140
[Mom]

324
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,500
[Mom]

325
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,550
Xia,

326
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,080
you finally answered my call.

327
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,510
Xu Mingli told me

328
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,270
you're pregnant.

329
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,670
You shouldn't call him for no reason,

330
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,360
and don't ask him for money.

331
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,720
He wouldn't give me anyway.

332
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,390
I've got a match.

333
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,750
Hold on.

334
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,870
Anything else?

335
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,480
If not, I'm hanging up.

336
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,910
I heard you're moving

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
into Xu Mingli's villa.

338
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,720
Take me with you.

339
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,320
I can help take care of the baby.

340
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,360
No need,

341
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,750
I'll hire a nanny.

342
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,150
Listen to me.

343
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Xu Mingli's daughter

344
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,030
also lives there, right?

345
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm sure she'll

346
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,000
make things difficult for you.

347
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,750
What if you get bullied?

348
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,600
Take me with you.

349
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,200
I can have your back.

350
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,270
I'll think about it.

351
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,510
Okay,

352
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,120
I'll wait for your call.

353
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,550
Be careful when moving things.

354
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't damage anything.

355
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,240
Be careful over here.

356
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,510
Take these all out.

357
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,910
Throw them all away.

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
We'll get new ones.

359
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,630
Be careful.

360
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,030
Who are you?

361
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,600
Put that down.

362
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,270
Don't you hear me?

363
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,790
You are Xu Mingli's daughter

364
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,910
Xu Nuo, right?

365
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,390
Who are you?

366
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,030
I'm Xia's mother.

367
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,870
I'm here to take care of Xia

368
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,750
and help her

369
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,270
decorate the house.

370
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,480
These things belong to my mom.

371
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,870
As long as I'm here,

372
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,080
no one can take them away.

373
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,750
Out with the old,

374
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
in with the new.

375
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,080
They're getting married soon,

376
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,960
of course

377
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,390
they need new furniture.

378
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,080
Your dad already agreed.

379
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,120
Who gave you the right

380
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,120
to yell at us?

381
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,320
Enough, mom, stop talking.

382
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,240
Xu Nuo,

383
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,320
we'll soon be family.

384
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,550
It's better for us to accept each other.

385
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,960
Don't put Mingli

386
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,910
in the middle.

387
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,150
Oh, right.

388
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,440
I didn't think it through.

389
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,080
Xia is about to become

390
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,000
your stepmother,

391
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,240
the lady of the house.

392
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,150
My dad only agreed to let you move in.

393
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,840
You'd better let your mother

394
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,670
take her junk and get out of here

395
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,670
before I lose it.

396
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,610
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

397
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:57,660
♪'Til I forget who I am♪

398
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,410
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
