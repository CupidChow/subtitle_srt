You're free now,

is none of my business,

86

87
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,430
not to hurt Nuo for it.

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,310
that this is the agreement between us

91

Nuo is my daughter,

to marry within that time,

125
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,920

She doesn't need to be my assistant anymore.

194
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,840
Hand over

195
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,550
her work.

196
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,630
Any objection?

197
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,630
No.

198
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,790
I'll do it now.

199
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,000
What's wrong?

200
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Are you still mad at me?

201
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,440
I agreed to talk to you

202
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,240
but didn't say I'd make up with you.

203
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,200
Forgive me for my little mistake.

204
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,200
Don't be angry with me.

205
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,270
Don't give me that crap.

206
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,840
We agreed

207
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,200
that you have performance shares in our salon.

208
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,790
My livestream earnings were even counted,

209
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,200
but where is Yuanfei's investment?

210
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,030
You know

211
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,080
there was a financial audit some time ago.

212
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,150
Your studio owes four million,

213
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,240
but don't worry.

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,440
I've come up with a solution.

215
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,270
I'm going to pledge my shares

216
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,910
and pay it back for you.

217
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,840
How long are you going to make false promises?

218
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,240
You don't believe me?

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,200
Look.

220
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm going to pledge my shares

221
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,150
to a trust company.

222
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,600
The interest rate is low.

223
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,240
We'll sign next week.

224
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,150
Take a look.

225
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,790
Is it reliable?

226
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,840
Absolutely.

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,030
This company has a clean background.

228
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,150
I've looked into it,

229
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,200
but we have to make a deal.

230
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,960
After the money is in your account

231
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,200
and used by you,

232
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,510
you have to pay me back with interest.

233
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,790
You deserve to be a boss.

234
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,150
You're good at math.

235
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,000
All my stuff

236
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,030
will be yours in the future,

237
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,240
right?

238
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,630
Can we

239
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
make up then?

240
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,960
Yes.

241
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,030
Can I get a reward

242
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,360
from you?

243
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,080
Nuo, what's on your mind?

244
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,240
What's wrong with you?

245
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,080
Mom.

246
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,790
You look distracted.

247
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,750
Did you have a fight

248
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,670
with Shen Jiahe?

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,870
Last night,

250
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,480
I saw him with red eyes

251
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,120
when he was leaving.

252
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,720
Nuo.

253
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,440
My only wish now

254
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,840
is that you

255
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,910
can be happy

256
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,550
and have someone

257
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,910
who really loves you

258
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,870
and is loved by you.

259
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,720
But it's so hard to love someone.

260
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,720
Do you know

261
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,150
what the most important thing is?

262
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,320
Trust.

263
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,550
Love without trust

264
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,030
doesn't last long.

265
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,750
Just like me and your dad,

266
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,080
we didn't trust each other,

267
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,840
so we came

268
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,030
to this point.

269
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,120
I don't want you to make the same mistakes we made.

270
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,120
But how do I know

271
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,600
if that person can be trusted?

272
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,200
This is something

273
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,270
you need to experience with your heart.

274
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,670
The one who is truly right

275
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,240
will stand the test of time.

276
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,460
[We've known each other for 20 years.
Happy birthday. Nuo. Jiahe]

277
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Okay.

278
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,790
It's getting late.

279
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,510
Go get some rest.

280
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:11,960
Mom.

281
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,200
I'll stay here tomorrow too.

282
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,240
That's fine.

283
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,160
This is your home.

284
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,920
You can stay as long as you want.

285
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,160
I'd be happy.
