Yuanfei is merging with SJ.

Do you know

our relationship with SJ?

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,780
Of course,

The market is in a recession,

I wanted to ask you

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,810
if you're pushing for a merger

69
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,850
because you want a chance to investigate Chi Ye.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,300
The M&A was initiated by Chi Ye,

71
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,250
so I'm just going along for the ride,

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,620

of SJ's business operations,

74
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,450
and the M&A

75
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,940
doesn't do him any favors,

76
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,570
so I'm curious

77
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,450
as to why

78
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,540
he's so aggressively pushing

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,660
for this M&A.

80
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,010
He will have access

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,660
to SJ's detailed accounts during the M&A process,

82
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,770
so Chi Ye may be doing it

83
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,770
to get at Chi Hao.

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,740

may not be pushed through in a short time.

193
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,330
Okay.

194
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,180
Don't think about these things,

195
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,970
okay?

196
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,570
Just relax.

197
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,300
Let's go.

198
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,020
Have some fruit.

199
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,210
Relax

200
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,420
and don't think so much.

201
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,260
Are you tired?

202
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,690
Your massage was nice.

203
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,450
Sweet.

204
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,380
Isn't it?

205
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,420
Have another one.

206
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,260
Do you miss me?

207
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:25,980
[Chi Ye]

208
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,900
Miss Xu is not in the office today.

209
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,380
Hello, Chi Ye.

210
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,690
What's up?

211
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,690
I'm downstairs.

212
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,780
I've arranged to go to a concert with her.

213
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,180
Has she packed yet?

214
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,540
Actually,

215
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,180
she has a meeting today

216
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,780
and is working overtime at her company.

217
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,330
I'll pick her up there.

218
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,380
[Chi Ye]

219
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,970
Who is it?

220
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,380
It's me, Chi Ye.

221
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,140
Chi Ye?

222
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,730
He told me he had a meeting today

223
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,660
and that we couldn't meet.

224
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,940
I guess

225
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,140
maybe he saw my car

226
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,970
and made sure I was home.

227
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,420
Go upstairs. I'll meet him.

228
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,450
What are you doing here?

229
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,660
What? Can't I come in and sit down for a while?

230
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,300
You're not welcome.

231
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,490
You put your brother in jail,

232
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,780
and you now can't wait to get at me, right?

233
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,540
He's the one who laundered the money,

234
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,420
and the cops took him.

235
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,300
What's it got to do with me?

236
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,940
Non-biological brothers

237
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,940
can really fall out at any time,

238
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,610
right,

239
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,450
Lin Yi?

240
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,940
I haven't seen you for only a few days,

241
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,380
and you don't even remember

242
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,330
my name,

243
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,090
but Mr. Shen,

244
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,810
don't worry about Chi Hao.

245
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,450
You'd better take care of Uncle Xu first.

246
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,490
Maybe someday,

247
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,140
he'll be there to be my brother's companion.

248
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,660
That's what he deserves,

249
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,210
but I'm warning you.

250
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,330
Don't let this matter involve Nuo.

251
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,210
Nuo is my wife,

252
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,540
so I'll treasure her more than anyone else.

253
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,940
Anything else?

254
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,690
Fine.

255
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,570
Since my master doesn't welcome me,

256
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,490
I'm leaving.

257
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,780
Nuo.

258
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,660
Why did Chi Ye suddenly come over?

259
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,660
Maybe because

260
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,540
I silenced my cell phone

261
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,810
and didn't get his call.

262
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,380
Did he find anything just now?

263
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,850
No, he didn't. Don't worry.

264
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,330
I'm leaving.

265
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,780
Be careful.

266
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,570
Was everything in the past

267
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,380
a lie?

268
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,850
I see it's raining outside.

269
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,490
I bought coupled umbrellas.

270
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,660
Here you go.

271
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,210
Thank you.

272
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,380
Happy birthday, Chi Ye.

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,100
Nuo.

274
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,100
Will you marry me?

275
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,290
Yes.

276
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,420
He's my fiancé.

277
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,210
If you have anything against him,

278
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,250
just come at me.

279
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,580
Why

280
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,450
are you in love with my brother?

281
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,820
He's sincere

282
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,050
and persistent.

283
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,250
How can it be fake?

284
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,580
Nuo.

285
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,010
How could you lie to me like that?

286
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,480
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

287
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:42,330
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

288
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,000
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
