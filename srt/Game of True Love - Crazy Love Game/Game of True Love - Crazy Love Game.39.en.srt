but the source is related to SJ,

164

to make payments.

194
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,730
Chi Ye?

195
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,260
But why would he do that?

196
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,060
That's right.

197
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,900
Why?

198
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,570
Have you seen Chi Ye's assistant?

199
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,260
No, I haven't.

200
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,450
But I think I have.

201
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,090
Xu Mingli was arrested.

202
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,330
Aunt Rong had an accident.

203
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,450
Nuo and I were at odds.

204
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,420
Yuanfei is falling apart.

205
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,020
What kind of person

206
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,970
would want to see a situation

207
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,780
like today?

208
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,540
Only...

209
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,610
Only enemies.

210
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,090
People

211
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,610
who have a deep grudge against the Xu Family.

212
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,060
The people who have a deep grudge against Xu Mingli

213
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,540
are Lin Chongshan and his family.

214
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,020
So Chi Ye

215
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,330
is his vanished son,

216
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,570
Lin Yi?

217
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,690
What are you doing?

218
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,690
I'm taking back my own things.

219
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,690
Take back

220
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,780
your own what?

221
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,940
What's yours?

222
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,450
You and I have nothing to do

223
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,180
with each other now.

224
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,540
You broke into my house

225
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,900
without my permission.

226
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,450
I'll call the police.

227
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,660
What's wrong

228
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,970
with me getting

229
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,300
my own stuff back?

230
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,850
Is there anything here

231
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,210
that you paid for?

232
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,380
It's all paid for you by me.

233
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,780
But if you really want it back,

234
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,450
you can tell me.

235
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,490
I can gift it to you.

236
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,690
Do you know

237
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,940
why I'm thanking you

238
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,210
and gifting this to you?

239
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,940
Because you told Shen Jiahe

240
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,970
the truth

241
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,380
to stop them from getting married

242
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,450
and to make him recognize his real father.

243
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,420
Here you are.

244
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,090
Shen Jiahe recognized you?

245
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,850
Maybe in another life.

246
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,380
Why don't you see

247
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,850
what you are?

248
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,780
It doesn't matter what I am,

249
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,330
but I want to ask

250
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,300
what you are

251
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,090
and what the child

252
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,450
you gave birth to is.

253
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,020
Fortunately, I found out the truth,

254
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,090
so I won't leave her

255
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,330
a penny.

256
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,020
I finally see through you.

257
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,570
You're just

258
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,940
an extremely stingy jerk.

259
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,060
Extremely stingy?

260
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,450
Then I won't give these to you.

261
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,810
I really regret wasting so much time

262
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,970
on you.

263
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,540
Give it back.

264
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,450
Give it back.

265
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,210
Give it back.

266
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,540
Give it back.

267
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,210
- Stop it. - Give it back.

268
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,850
Xu Mingli.

269
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,970
You'll regret this.

270
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,570
Thank you

271
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,970
for coming to my rescue every time

272
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,690
I'm in trouble.

273
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,660
Aren't you afraid I'll misunderstand?

274
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,970
Do you still have time

275
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,300
to think about other things now?

276
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,450
You're right.

277
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,900
I have a child now

278
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,450
and have to devote all my attention to her,

279
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,140
so all the other grudges

280
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,330
don't matter.

281
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,810
Is the child

282
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,940
really not Xu Mingli's?

283
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,610
Why do you ask?

284
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,180
I saw you register her.

285
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,330
Her family name is still Xu.

286
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,490
By the way,

287
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,660
where's your father?

288
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,260
I don't remember seeing your dad

289
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,450
when I was in school.

290
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,450
I was very young

291
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,540
when they split up,

292
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,970
so I don't remember much about it.

293
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,490
So your mom never told you

294
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,490
about your dad?

295
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,690
She never said a good word about him.

296
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,730
My mom got pregnant before she married him

297
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,060
but didn't know

298
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,060
until they broke up.

299
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,300
Then,

300
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,660
he got married soon after

301
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,140
and had a son,

302
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,680
so he cut us off

303
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,780
completely.

304
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,450
So do you recognize the son?

305
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,020
I saw him when I was a kid,

306
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,450
but I don't remember much now.

307
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,780
What's wrong?

308
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,140
Nothing.

309
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,540
When you see your mom again,

310
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,570
contact her for me.

311
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,540
Take this.

312
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,780
No need.

313
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,260
The money from Xu Nuo's

314
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,380
charity foundation will be given

315
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,180
to me soon.

316
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,210
I know your house

317
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,610
will be repossessed soon.

318
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,380
Take it.

319
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,260
Consider it a loan from me.

320
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,540
You don't need to pay me back in a hurry.

321
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,780
Okay.

322
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,450
Didn't you tell her?

323
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,100
It's enough that I'm suffering alone.

324
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,660
Why does it have to be two people?

325
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,580
Shen Jiahe.

326
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,340
Doesn't Xu Nuo deserve to know the truth?

327
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,450
You make decisions for others

328
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,290
every time,

329
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,380
but have you asked her what she thinks?

330
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,580
Why do I feel

331
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,820
you're speaking for her?

332
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,140
Dare you say you've completely let her go?

333
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,250
Who can you fool with the way

334
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,940
you look at her?

335
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,290
Really?

336
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,730
Then I need to practice more.

337
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,290
What a sin.

338
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,290
It'll be gone when you get over and forget about it.

339
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,150
Let's go. I'll ask Ao Zhe to take you back.

340
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,650
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

341
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:32,500
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

342
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:38,520
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
