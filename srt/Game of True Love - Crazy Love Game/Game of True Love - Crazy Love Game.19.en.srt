12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,860
Thank you, Nuo.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,650
Mr. Shen, you first.

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,290
Sir,

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,010
face painting

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,650
requires points.

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Miss Xu, where's your conscience?

18
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,890
I helped you so much this afternoon.

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,290
Wait a second.

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,170
My face

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,450
represents Yuanfei's image.

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,420
You make it sound like I'm going to mess it up.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,980
I'm actually pretty good at this.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,980
If you mess it up,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,090
no one will come anymore.

26
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,290
Aren't you also

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,290
responsible for this event?

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,290
Then you're responsible for my face.

29
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,370
Take good care of it.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,940
Just wait till you see the result.

31

Come on.

32
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,530
Why do I have

33
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,620
a bad feeling about this?

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,940
What was that?

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,250
I said, I have

36
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,340
a bad feeling about this.

37
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,620
It looks great.

38
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,130
Mr. Shen, my turn now.

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,060

this engagement is fake, you know?

125

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,890
make it look real.

127
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,100

128
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,620
Cold?

129
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,860
Nuo,

130
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,770
that day

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,010
at the company, when the reporters

132
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,420
questioned us,

133
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,540
you chose me.

134
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,860
Was it because

135
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,130
you thought

136
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,730
I'd make a good husband?

137
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,690
I didn't think that far.

138
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,300
I just felt

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,450
safer choosing you.

140
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,570
The morning air by the sea is so refreshing.

141
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,780
I really don't want to leave.

142
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,730
If you like it so much,

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,660
we'll come here more often.

but this one's my favorite.

146
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,940
Then we'll live here after retirement.

147
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,570
Who said I'd live with you?

148
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,850
Let me.

149
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,810
Look at this one.

152
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,380
You look ridiculous.

153
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,660
And this one too.

154
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,090
Stop right there.

Hands off her.

158
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,780
Nuo, go to your room.

159
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,610
Jiahe, sit down.

160
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,540
I need to talk to you.

161
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,020
It's fine. You go ahead.

162
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,330
Uncle Xu, what's the matter?

163
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,940
Jiahe, tell me the truth.

164
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,330
Is this relationship

165
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,450
you two made public

166
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,900
just for show

167
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,660
or real?

168
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,570
Uncle Xu,

169
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,450
if it were real,

170
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,490
would that be so bad?

171
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,140
Do I have to spell it out?

172
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,660
You're both my children.

173
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,940
To outsiders,

174
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,260
this would be a complete joke.

175
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,210
Do you understand?

176
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,090
We had an agreement.

177
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,850
Break it, and you're out

178
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,260
of Yuanfei and this family.

179
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,210
Listen,

180
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,940
as long as you honor

181
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,210
our agreement

182
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,420
and maintain a sibling relationship

183
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,260
with Nuo,

184
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,090
you'll always

185
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,260
be my son.

186
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,180
But if you do anything to disgrace

187
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,140
the Xu family,

188
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,060
believe me,

189
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,140
I'll make sure

190
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,850
you never find Nuo in Binhai again.

191
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,690
Uncle Xu,

192
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,900
don't be mad.

193
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,090
Relax, alright?

194
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,210
I'm just

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,690
looking out

196
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,450
for Nuo's reputation.

197
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,180
Is that really what you think?

198
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,900
Of course.

199
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,090
You'd better not be lying to me.

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,900
I'm not.

201
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,900
Good. That's a relief.

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,020
By the way,

203
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,660
what's going on with the funds

204
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,780
for Nuo's project?

205
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,690
You haven't gotten back to me on that.

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,300
Nuo's project has been

207
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,780
gaining a lot of traction.

208
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,490
The company's shareholders

209
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,660
are watching it closely,

210
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,780
so moving the funds around won't be easy.

211
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,570
No wonder she looked so thrilled.

212
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,570
Guess she really does

213
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,780
have some talent.

214
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,020
But what about my money?

215
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,020
This is giving me a headache.

216
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,490
Alright, you go back to work.

217
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,420
What's on your mind? You were so lost in thought

218
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,180
you didn't even hear me come in.

219
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,090
What's the occasion?

220
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,690
Why all these gifts?

221
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,060
It doesn't matter if it's a special day

222
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,140
or just an ordinary one.

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,900
I just want you

224
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,850
to stay beautiful

225
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,570
like these flowers.

226
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,260
Why are you so sweet today?

227
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,900
Aren't I always?

228
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,540
Oh, um...

229
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,850
About that...

230
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,540
About that ¥4 million,

231
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,210
can we

232
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,570
push it back a little longer?

233
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm really

234
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,850
tight on cash right now.

235
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,020
Seriously?

236
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,450
How long are you going to keep stalling?

237
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,060
Mingli,

238
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,450
don't tell me you're backing out.

239
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,210
How could I?

240
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,180
I'll be honest with you.

241
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,810
Nuo's project is

242
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,850
progressing so smoothly

243
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,140
that I suddenly can't

244
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,940
pull the funds out.

245
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,090
I'm working on finding

246
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,850
another way

247
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,570
to get you the money.

248
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,570
How long have you

249
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,940
been "working on" it?

250
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,090
And still, you've got

251
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,540
nothing.

252
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,850
I'm working on it.

253
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,940
Don't rush me.

254
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,730
Do you even realize

255
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,780
that since Xiamei opened,

256
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,900
I've been covering all the expenses

257
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,780
through my

258
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,690
livestream earnings?

259
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,570
I know.

260
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,210
I know.

261
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,690
Do you have any idea

262
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,540
how much it costs a day

263
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,940
to run a place that big?

264
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,540
You don't seem the least bit worried!

265
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,330
When I wanted

266
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,810
Xiamei to be in the city center,

267
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,300
you called it tacky.

268
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,260
Now that it's in some rundown location,

269
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,420
there's barely any foot traffic!

270
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,570
Are you saying

271
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,180
it's my fault

272
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,940
that your business is failing?

273
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,810
If it's not working out, shut it down.

274
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,180
Do livestreams

275
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,330
or stay at home.

276
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,140
Do whatever you want.

277
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,420
Just don't make

278
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,610
every conversation about money.

279
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,850
It's always money, money, money!

280
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,210
Xu Mingli, what's that supposed to mean?

281
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,940
You were the one

282
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,810
who promised to help me build

283
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,380
the biggest beauty chain in Binhai!

284
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,490
Didn't you say you'd

285
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,570
take care of the investment from Yuanfei?

286
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,690
It's been so long.

287
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,450
Where's the money?

288
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,660
I haven't seen a dime.

289
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,690
And now you're blaming me

290
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,940
for bringing up money?

291
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,970
What do you mean

292
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,610
you haven't seen a dime?

293
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,900
Where do you think this villa came from?

294
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,180
Tell me!

295
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,210
I paid for it

296
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,810
with real cash,

297
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,730
didn't I?

298
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,090
Did I or did I not introduce you

299
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,540
to clients and connections

300
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,970
for your livestream business?

301
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,780
This bag,

302
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,780
everything you eat, drink, and use.

303
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,140
Do you think they come for free?

304
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,020
And now you have the nerve to say

305
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,330
I haven't given you any money?

306
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,940
Do you think all this didn't cost money?

307
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,610
And you're still not satisfied?

308
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,690
Are you saying

309
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,730
I'm being unreasonable now?

310
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,610
If this isn't unreasonable,

311
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,780
what is?

312
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,330
I came here in a good mood,

313
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,210
trying to explain things to you.

314
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,540
Do you think I was lying?

315
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,660
Get out.

316
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,330
Leave.

317
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,730
Oh, you want me to leave?

318
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,340
I'll go.

319
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:12,880
Fine.

320
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,870
I'll go.

321
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,970
I'm done

322
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,450
- putting up with your nonsense! - Get out!

323
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,610
Get out!

324
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,380
[Xiamei Beauty Club]

325
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,330
Fei,

326
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,260
what were you thinking picking these products?

327
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,780
How could you sell such cheap garbage

328
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,850
on my livestream?

329
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,210
Xia,

330
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,770
our old partners have been

331
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,210
pulling out one after another.

332
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,340
At this point,

333
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,250
we're not choosing products.

334
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,660
The products are choosing us.

335
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,100
What happened?

336
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,580
Yuanfei just signed some small-time streamers

337
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,690
and is aggressively pushing low prices.

338
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,580
It's cutting into our market share.

339
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,900
Buy one full-size product,

340
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,620
get another full-size sample for free!

341
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,660
Right now, Xiamei is surviving

342
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,730
purely on livestream sales.

343
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,450
If our revenue stream dries up here...

344
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,380
Fei,

345
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,140
see if we can

346
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,900
outsource Xiamei's

347
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,530
operations.

348
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,660
Live commerce

349
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,490
is our core business.

350
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,180
We can't lose it.

351
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,450
Got it.

352
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,450
I'll get on it.

353
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,140
Why are you calling me?

354
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,730
What?

355
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,730
You really have no shame!

356
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,490
Your husband is the shameless one!

357
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,180
Married and still

358
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,940
fooling around outside.

359
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,690
Disgusting!

360
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,370
And you think you're innocent?

361
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,050
You're both trash!

362
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,380
I'll

363
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,770
smash this place up!

364
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,250
