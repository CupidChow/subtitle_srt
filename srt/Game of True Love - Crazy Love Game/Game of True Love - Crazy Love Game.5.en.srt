00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,080
Yes,

193
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,550
I'm crazy.

194
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,670
Stop lying to yourself.

195
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
You clearly love me.

196
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,120
Shen Jiahe,

197
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,150
in the end, you're just insecure

198
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,440
and desperate for love.

199
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,030
You keep asking me

200
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,750
if I love you,

201
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,790
but you're the one who really cares.

202
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,200
Fine! I love you!

203
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,320
All right, then.

204
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,360
I'll give you a chance.

205
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Starting today,

206
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,390
let's make a deal.

207
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
Within three months,

208
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
if you can make me fall for you,

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,120
I'll marry you.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
But if you can't,

211
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,630
you'll leave Yuanfei Group,

212
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,630
leave the Xu family,

213
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,320
and disappear from my life.

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,360
Do you dare swear on it?

215
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,000
Three months, no going back.

216
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,600
Do you dare?

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,390
Why wouldn't I?

218
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,510
Shen Jiahe,

219
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,720
you'll regret this.

220
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,030
In my dictionary,

221
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,870
"regret" doesn't exist.

222
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,870
Within three months,

223
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,240
if you can make me fall for you,

224
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,550
I'll marry you.

225
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,600
But if you can't,

226
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,550
you'll leave Yuanfei Group,

227
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,720
leave the Xu family,

228
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240
and disappear from my life.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,790
Do you dare?

230
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,790
Why wouldn't I?

231
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200
Shen Jiahe,

232
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
just you wait.

233
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,790
I'll make sure

234
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,320
you leave with nothing.

235
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,510
Does it look good?

236
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
It looks amazing.

237
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,910
Diamonds symbolize eternity

238
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,840
and promises.

239
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,270
I swear,

240
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
in good times or bad,

241
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,390
rich or poor,

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,790
I, Xu Nuo,

243
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,510
will always be Shen Jiahe's family.

244
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,150
Want to get rid of me?

245
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,270
No way!

246
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,390
I'll get both Xu Nuo

247
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
and the Xu family.

248
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,870
You're awake?

249
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,000
Come have breakfast.

250
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,960
Oh, you're already making your move?

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,870
But you forgot

252
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,720
I only drink warm milk for breakfast.

253
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,390
That's mine.

254
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,480
You didn't kiss enough last night?

255
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,600
Look at your dark circles...

256
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,630
you didn't sleep well,

257
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,360
just thinking about how to win me over, huh?

258
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
Give me a hint.

259
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,120
Small tricks like making breakfast

260
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,320
are embarrassing.

261
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,670
You're flattering yourself.

262
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,240
Aunt Pei made the breakfast.

263
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,720
Right.

264
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,200
Since you'll lose anyway,

265
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,440
why bother trying?

266
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,790
Let me think.

267
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,320
Where will you go after leaving Yuanfei Group

268
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,440
in three months?

269
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,200
With your looks,

270
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,510
marrying into another family

271
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,670
might be an option.

272
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,670
Actually, I'm thinking

273
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
of marrying into yours.

274
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,870
Have you no shame?

275
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,960
Why get angry so easily?

276
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,440
Shen Jiahe,

277
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,630
stop right there!

278
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,870
This love game...

279
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,720
It's really explosive, isn't it?

280
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,240
But since the final decision is in her hands,

281
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,510
whether she loves you or not

282
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,550
is entirely up to her.

283
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,720
This time she won't lie.

284
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,240
You're that sure?

285
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,030
I never gamble without confidence.

286
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
Gamblers are doomed

287
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,550
to destroy themselves.

288
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,480
Turns out Shen Jiahe

289
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,750
is a hopeless romantic?

290
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,270
Gamblers never think they'll lose.

291
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
He thinks in three months,

292
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,600
I'll marry him,

293
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,480
and he'll control Yuanfei Group's assets.

294
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,600
Ambitious!

295
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,720
Here,

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,240
let me give you some tips.

297
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,150
First, find the key to solving the problem.

298
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,870
Between you and Xu Nuo,

299
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,120
there's Bai Xia standing in the way.

300
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,360
You've never explained the misunderstanding

301
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,600
from back then, have you?

302
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
He won't explain,

303
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
and I wouldn't believe him anyway.

304
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,550
Next,

305
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
he'll launch

306
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,200
an intense pursuit.

307
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,750
Play hard to get,

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
keep her hanging,

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
then take control.

310
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,910
No matter his tricks,

311
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,270
we won't lose out.

312
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,840
If you don't fall for him,

313
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,320
he'll have to hand over

314
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,630
his CEO position at Yuanfei Group.

315
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,600
Even if you do fall for him,

316
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,080
don't admit it easily.

317
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,670
After all, you're the one who decides.

318
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,670
No,

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,870
I won't fall for him.

320
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,790
It's impossible.

321
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,060
[CEO's Office]

322
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,240
"Last night, Mr. Shen and his assistant's

323
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,030
passionate moment against the office glass door

324
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,840
was 'thoughtfully' recorded by security cameras.

325
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,240
Poor glass doors!"

326
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,630
"It's just a stepping stone

327
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,960
in Mr. Shen's love chase."

328
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,840
That's so embarrassing.

329
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,720
Looks like Yuanfei Group's stock rose again.

330
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,910
It's now...

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,270
18.7 yuan per share.

332
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,390
As Mr. Shen's assistant,

333
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,360
if I don't

334

immediately understand

335
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,030
such simple things,

336
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,630
isn't that negligence?

337
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,400
Right, Mr. Shen?

338
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,350
Nicely done, Assistant Xu.

Hello?

Jiahe...

342
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,640
my mom came to see me again yesterday.

343
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,510
I couldn't sleep all night.

344
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,070
After thinking it over,

345
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,680
I decided to call you.

346
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,640
Get to the point.

347
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,030
She's asking for 300,000.

348
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,880
How does that concern me?

349
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,750
She threatened

350
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,110
if I don't pay,

351
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,750
she'll expose my fake education

352
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,550
and fake family background,

I'm hanging up.

357
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,070
Shen Jiahe,

358
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,030
you really know how to fool around.

359
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,720
You're completely shameless.

360
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,550
Compared to your ex-boyfriends,

361
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,920
I still have a long way to go.

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,480
True.

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,000
