Surprise!

14
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,290
How did you know I was here?

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,290
It's not hard to figure out if I wanted to.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,220
You just had a baby,

17
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,530
and now you're working so hard.

18
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,060
Can your body handle it?

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,220
I bought this especially for you.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,700
It's a nursing pillow.

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,170

When you needed him the most,

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,370
he asked for a divorce!

If you know what's good for you, get out.

Otherwise, when my son-in-law gets here,

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,370
you'll be sorry.

- Don't pull me! - Ma'am!

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,940

86
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,180
me alone,

87
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,970
who raised you

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,370
through thick and thin.

89
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,130
Lin Chongshan?

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,620

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,940
You make it sound so easy.

93
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,020
Do you even know

94
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,180
how hard it'll be

95
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,370
raising a child on your own?

96
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,740
Or how people will judge you?

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,130
Are you done putting on a show?

98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,740
Are you really thinking about my daughter,

99
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,420
or just looking out for yourself?

100
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,330
No rich son-in-law,

101
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,890
no more easy money, huh?

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,060
Is that how you see me?

103
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,100
Drop the act.

104
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,890
Let me tell you the truth...

105
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,810
Xu Mingli forced me to divorce.

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,740
He dumped all the debt on me.

107
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,980
The golden goose is gone.

108
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,420
What's left is a penny-pincher.

109
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,940
If you want to squeeze him, be my guest!

110
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,770
Why?

111
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,890
I brought this on myself.

112
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,100
From the start,

113
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,980
I never should've chased his money.

114
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,770
Now I've got nothing,

115
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,370
just a pile of debt.

116
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,010
Now, to him,

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,370
I'm just a burden

118
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,940
to shake off.

119
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,250
How could he treat you this way?

120
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,810
Even my own mom treats me like this,

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,370
why wouldn't he?

122
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,980
Take care after birth.

123
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,940
Don't let it mess up your health.

124
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,770
Mr. Shen,

125
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,810
Bai Lanhua once had a fling

126
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,300
with Lin Chongshan

127
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,450
and gave birth to Bai Xia.

128
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,330
But they never registered for marriage.

129
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,210
Lin Chongshan

130
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,570
didn't give Bai Lanhua much money either.

131
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,980
That's why

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,420
we couldn't trace Bai Xia

133
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,740
from Lin Chongshan's side.

134
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,180
Alright, got it.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,420
So Xu Mingli

136
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,860
never met Bai Lanhua before,

137
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,690
and didn't know

138
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,100
about her and Lin Chongshan.

139
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,940
You scared me.

140
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,420
What's wrong?

141
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,890
Shen Jiahe,

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,010
are you hiding something from me?

143
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,860
No, of course not.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,180
Then let me see your computer.

145
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,740
It's all confidential.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,940
I can't show you.

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,570
Let me see it.

148
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,210
Let me see it!

149
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,860
Show me!

150
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,620
Stop it!

151
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,300
Give it here!

152
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,810
Stop messing around...

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,690
Why's he calling you

154
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,010
this late at night?

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,300
It's confidential,

156
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,540
so I'm not telling you either.

157
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,060
Hello?

158
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,100
Okay.

159
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,250
Good night.

160
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,540
Good night?

161
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,500
What did he say to you?

162
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,620
You really want to know?

163
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,330
Then let's make a deal.

164
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,100
You tell me

165
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,210
what you were just looking at,

166
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,180
and I'll tell you

167
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,300
what he said to me.

168
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,420
I never should've agreed

169
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,010
to let you join Yuanfei Group.

170
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,330
Now you're a pro negotiator.

171
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,180
Come on, let me see!

172
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,770
Fine.

173
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,810
These are from our elementary school days.

174
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,690
Not just elementary.

175
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,900
Keep going.

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,020
Shen Jiahe,

177
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,420
you were way too adorable.

178
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,660
While I was abroad,

179
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,690
you actually edited

180
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,940
all our photos together?

181
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,730
Do you like it?

182
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,330
I love it.

183
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,210
I was saving it

184
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,450
to surprise you at the wedding.

185
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,060
Nuo,

186
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,490
can you promise me

187
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,330
that from now on,

188
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,490
we'll take a photo together every year?

189
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,450
Editing these pics is exhausting.

190
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,300
I promise,

191
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,610
a photo together every year.

192
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,810
Then can you

193
