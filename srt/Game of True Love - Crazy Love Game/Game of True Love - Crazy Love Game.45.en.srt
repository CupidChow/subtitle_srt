Xu Mingli's biological daughter.

196
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,190
My real father

197
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,520
died in an accident

198
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,760
shortly after I was born.

199
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,640
To protect

200
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,240
the Su family's reputation,

201
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,280
my grandmother

202
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,590
had Xu Mingli

203
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,190
adopt me.

204
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,480
She's not

205
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,670
Xu Mingli's daughter?

206
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,430
You've known all this time?

207
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,760
I only found out recently.

208
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,830
Ridiculous, isn't it?

209
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,240
All these years,

210
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,360
I was the only one who saw

211
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,790
Shen Jiahe and Xu Mingli as family,

212
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,550
yet they kept scheming

213
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,550
against me and my mom.

214
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,520
At today's board meeting,

215
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,590
they even tried to join forces

216
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,910
to kick me out of Yuanfei.

217
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,590
Xu Mingli, you despicable rat...

218
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,070
Nuo,

219
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,240
don't be upset.

220
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm here for you.

221
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,310
I've held on

222
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,640
to this photo for years.

223
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,280
Maybe it's time to delete it.

224
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,830
You were so cute.

225
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,280
Do you have any childhood photos?

226
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,480
Yeah.

227
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,480
Let me show you.

228
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,300
[Kindergarten Graduation Photo]

229
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,760
When was this?

230
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,400
That was taken

231
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,760
when I was in kindergarten.

232
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,550
That's me.

233
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,520
This is you?

234
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,400
Yeah, that's me.

235
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,280
This is Lin Yi's

236
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,280
graduation photo.

237
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,830
If you can get

238
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,550
a childhood photo of Chi Ye and compare the two,

239
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,240
the truth will be obvious.

240
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,710
He really is Lin Yi.

241
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,520
You were adorable,

242
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,830
all chubby and round.

243
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm taking a picture of this.

244
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,830
Next year on your birthday,

245
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,790
I'll post it on Moments.

246
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,710
Let's see other photos.

247
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,240
This one's cute too.

248
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,360
Nuo.

249
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,280
Come on.

250
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,670
I have a gift for you.

251
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,240
Close your eyes.

252
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,950
Close them.

253
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,310
No peeking.

254
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,880
Nuo.

255
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,790
Nuo,

256
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,880
will you marry me?

257
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,790
That day at the hospital,

258
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,670
I heard everything

259
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,430
you and Shen Jiahe said.

260
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,310
Deep down,

261
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,000
you still have feelings for me,

262
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,480
don't you?

263
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:50,950
Chi Ye,

264
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,160
I'm planning to kick

265
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,480
Shen Jiahe and Xu Mingli

266
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,480
out of Yuanfei.

267
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,760
It's going to be a tough battle.

268
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,880
I don't want to drag you into it.

269
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,000
Don't worry, Nuo.

270
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,360
Whatever you decide to do,

271
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,590
I'll stand by you.

272
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,400
I'll support you with everything I have.

273
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,830
Even if it means

274
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,590
I'm just using you?

275
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,950
Honestly,

276
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,240
I've always hoped

277
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,070
you'd use me,

278
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,360
because I think

279
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,830
I can really help you.

280
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,710
I'd do anything for you

281
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,830
in a heartbeat.

282
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,590
Will you end up deceiving me

283
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,950
like Shen Jiahe did?

284
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,280
Never.

285
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,160
I will always stand by you.

286
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,430
I'll give you everything I have.

287
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,400
All I want is for you

288
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,240
to fall in love with me one day.

289
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,550
Then I'll marry you.

290
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,000
Nuo,

291
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,760
thank you.

292
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,710
The Optimus Prime in my heart

293
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,640
has come back to life.

294
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,950
Maybe life

295
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,520
is worth living after all.

297
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:10,820

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,580
