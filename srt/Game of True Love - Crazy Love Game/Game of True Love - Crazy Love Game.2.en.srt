Stop pretending.

Xu Nuo.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,000
Stop it.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,200
- Nuo. - What are you doing?

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,470
What are you doing?

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,640
Are you out of your mind?

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,840
Xia, are you okay?

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,790
-- Xu Mingli. - Let me see.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,710
Mingli.

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,470
I didn't do anything,

22
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,670
but she hit me as soon as she saw me.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
What a nonsense.

24
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,920
Nuo, stop.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,560
Stop it.

26
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,240
Let go of me.

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you crazy, Nuo?

Xu Mingli.

29
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,150
Why did you do this to my mom?

30
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,310
Why are you protecting her?

31
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,920
Are you abandoning my mom?

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,950
What do you mean by "abandon her"?

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,790
Your mom and I divorced a long time ago.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,480
You're crazy.

35
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,230
That's a lie.

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,000
You don't believe me?

37
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,710
Then you can ask Jiahe.

38
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,230
Nuo.

39
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,710
OK.

Uncle Xu, let me go after her.

Nuo.

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,840
Why is my dad

50
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,870
with Bai Xia?

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,470
Don't say it has nothing to do with you.

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,800
Would you believe me

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,030
if I said that?

54
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,400
No wonder you are now

the president.

56
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,280
In order to please my dad,

57
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
you even offered your ex-girlfriend to him.

58
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,590
What other nasty things

59
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,190
are you incapable of doing?

Incompetently angry.

Right.

62
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,470
I'm incompetent,

63
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,240
unlike you.

Shen Jiahe.

65
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,960
My mom raised you,

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
but is this how you repay her

67
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,960
for raising you?

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Don't provoke me with Aunt Rong.

69
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,240
When Bai Xia fell in love

70
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,910
with your dad,

71
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,430
your mom and dad were already divorced.

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you think I'll take your word for it?

73
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
You're a liar.

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,560
What about you?

75
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,430
You spent five years abroad

76
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,590
to avoid me.

77
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,520
Aunt Rong couldn't even bear

78
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,680
to tell you about the divorce.

79
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,360
When she was sad and upset,

80
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,710
where were you having a good time?

81
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,910
Who are you to criticize me?

00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,800
Shen Jiahe.

83
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,870
You don't have parents,

84
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,960
so have you ever experienced family affection?

85
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,630
You just want to get back at me, don't you?

86
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,910
You want to get back at me

87
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,960
for saying in front of others

88
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,360
that you were a foster child in my home.

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,280
You let me

90
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,840
see all this today

91
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,750
on purpose,

92
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,240
right?

93
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
That's right.

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,840
I have nothing to lose,

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
so I wanted you to experience

96
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,590
what it's like to have your family torn apart.

97
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,120
How's that?

98
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,280
Satisfied?

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
You're hurting me.

100
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,470
Let go of me.

101
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,000
Shen Jiahe.

102
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,840
If you had anything

103
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,710
to do with this,

104
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,870
I'll never forgive you.

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,390
Nuo.

106
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,360
Don't be afraid.

107
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,120
I'm here.

108
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,560
I'll protect you.

109
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,120
Nuo, are you okay?

110
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,560
Nuo, are you okay?

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,720
Nuo.

[Mom]

114
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,270
Sorry.

115
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,390
The number you dialed...

116
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,120
How was it, Mr. Shen?

117
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,560
I played it well, didn't I?

118
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,800
Is that why

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,720
you called me?

120
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,510
What? Are you upset?

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,070
You're the one who offered to cooperate.

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,560
If Xu Nuo caused trouble,

123
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,870
it'd force Xu Mingli to marry me

124
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,560
and help you fight to get Xu Mingli

125
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,560
out of Yuanfei soon.

126
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,830
What?

127
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,240
You can't bear

128
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,830
to see Xu Nuo's

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,800
heartbroken face?

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,920
What do you want to say?

131
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,480
Nothing.

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,870
I just want to ask

133
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,560
when the new villa

134
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,000
will be under my name.

135
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,830
I don't feel comfortable

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,750
if it's with Xiamei.

137
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,070
Bai Xia.

138
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,240
I advise you

139
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,750
not to be too greedy.

140
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,720
You might not get anything at the end.

141
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
I'm only after a little money,

142
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,560
but you're after the whole of Yuanfei.

143
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,800
Don't be so stingy.

144
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,510
Do what you need to do.

145
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,510
Don't forget

146
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,750
how you got here.

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,750
You just want to get back at me, don't you?

148
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,830
You want to get back at me

149
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,950
for saying in front of others

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,430
that you were a foster child in my home.

151
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,430
That's right.

It's all in the plan.

156
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,630
Don't get ahead of yourself.

157

Nuo.

166
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,240
When did you get back?

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,790
Mom.

168
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,670
Mom.

169
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,510
I miss you.

170
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,910
I miss you too.

171
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,550
Why didn't you

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
tell me

173
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,630
before you came back?

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,670
Mom.

175
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,000
I know

176
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,790
you're divorced.

177
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,870
Mom.

178
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,000
It's my fault.

179
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
I didn't come back earlier.

180
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,840
You've suffered.

181
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,360
Mom.

182
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,870
What happened

183
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,080
between you and my dad?

184
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,200
I just wanted to give you

185
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,390
a whole family.

186
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,080
I thought that

187
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,080
as long as I

188
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
didn't care too much,

189
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,390
a lot of things would pass,

190
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,150
but I didn't realize that your dad

191
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,630
had been transferring property

192
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,120
behind my back for the past few years.

193
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,390
Mom.

194
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,120
It's all my dad's fault.

195
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,870
And it's not fair.

196
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,360
But luckily,

197
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,440
your grandmother had a will.

198
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,630
After you get married,

199
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,910
a portion of Yuanfei's equity

200
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,600
will be transferred to you

201
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,720
as a dowry.

202
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Don't ever fight

203
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,390
with your dad for me.

204
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,390
Mom.

205
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,240
Now, I'm back.

206
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,910
I won't let you

207
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,000
suffer anymore.

208
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,960
I'll join Yuenfei

209
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,550
and get back what's ours.

210
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,240
Dad.

211
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,000
You can go on the racket

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,510
outside,

213
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,910
but all these years,

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,720
without the support

215
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,720
of my mom and her family,

216
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,910
would you be here today?

217
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,360
Why did you abandon her like this?

218
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Aren't you ashamed?

219
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,840
Why do you talk like that?

220
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,080
What do you mean by her family's support?

221
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:50,960
Aunt Pei.

222
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,360
Mr. Shen.

223
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,240
Is Nuo back?

224
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,030
Please go to them now.

225
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,030
Listen.

226
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,960
Yuanfei is what it is today

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,240
because of the hard work

228
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,030
of your father, Xu Mingli.

229
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,030
Also,

230
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,030
your mom's shares

231
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,510
were transferred to me of her own free will.

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,750
Didn't she tell you?

233
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,200
Okay.

234
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,480
Let's not talk about my mom.

235
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,670
Do you know

236
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
what kind of person Bai Xia is?

237
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Do you know what kind of relationship

238
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,670
she has with Shen Jiahe?

239
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,480
What relationship?

240
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,480
I think you're so old that you

241
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,630
don't even know when you've been betrayed.

242
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
Why are you talking to your father like that?

243
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,120
If you want to know about Bai Xia,

244
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,480
let me join Yuanfei.

245
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
You're making a deal with your father,

246
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,150
aren't you?

247
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,270
Okay.

248
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,270
I can tell you now

249
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,120
that's not going to happen.

250
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
You won't let me join the company

251
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,790
no matter what, will you?

252
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,200
Based on the way

253
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,150
you're talking to me right now,

254
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,000
as long as I'm at Yuanfei,

255
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,000
there's absolutely no chance of that.

256
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,120
Is that clear?

257
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,870
Good.

258
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,600
Even without you, I can make it.

259
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,840
Wait a minute.

260
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,150
You said you could do it on your own.

261
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay.

262
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,390
Give me back the card I gave you

263
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
since you're so capable.

264
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,270
Nuo.

265
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,120
Are you satisfied?

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Uncle Xu, Nuo...

267
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,240
Enough.

268
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,390
Don't try to plead for her.

269
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,510
She just lacks experience.

270
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,510
She needs to suffer.

271
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,240
Go to work.

272
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,910
Hello, Aunt Rong.

273
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,670
Jiahe.

274
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,670
Nuo came to me last night.

275
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,480
Did she fight with Xu Mingli

276
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,360
again?

277
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,750
Talk to her if you're free.

278
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,270
I keep calling her,

279
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,120
but she doesn't answer.

280
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,910
I'm a bit worried.

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed

282
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,320
is currently unable to answer.

283
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,630
What do you wish for

284
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,000
on your birthday?

285
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,840
I wish my dad, mom, and I

286
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,320
would be together forever.

287
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
That's nice.

288
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,240
Happy birthday to you.

289
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,960
I wish to be with my mom

290
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,030
and dad forever.

291
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,270
Okay.

292
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,270
How dare you show up in front of me?

293
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,080
I happened to pass by.

294
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,240
You charmed Shen Jiahe

295
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,270
and seduced my dad.

296
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,550
You're so amazing.

297
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,550
Don't put it so harshly.

298
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,600
I can't stop those men

299
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,120
around you from loving me.

300
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
So you came here

301
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,440
to show off to me?

302
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,750
You're shameless.

303
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,720
It took me a lifetime

304
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,240
to get what you've

305
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,600
had since birth.

306
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
Now, I got them with my ability,

307
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,670
so why should I be ashamed?

308
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,510
With your ability?

309
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,320
My parents' divorce

310
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,150
was plotted by you

311
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,030
and Shen Jiahe, right?

312
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,390
Want to take over our property?

313
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,630
You won't make it

314
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,000
with me around.

315
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,120
Whatever you say.

316
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,480
All I know is

317
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,030
that you'll be calling me Mom

318
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
soon.

319
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,550
Shameless.

320
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,600
Xu Nuo.

321
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm not a pushover.

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,270
The best is yet to come.

323
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,360
Let's take our time.

324
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,790
Sorry.

325
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,790
The subscriber you dialed

326
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,440
is currently...

327
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,420
[Xu Nuo]

328
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,030
Sorry.

329
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,350
The subscriber you dialed...

330
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,590
By the way,

331
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,960
don't blame Jiahe.

332
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,830
I asked him not to tell you.

333
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,310
He's the one who wanted

334
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,200
to break up our family.

335
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,790
He's an ungrateful soul.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,160
Do you have some misunderstanding

337
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,270
about him?

338
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,590
When I divorced your father,

339
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,030
Jiahe hired a lawyer for me.

340
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,590
The house

341
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,550
and the plot of land in Huangshi Village

342
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,790
were also preserved thanks to him.

343
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,590
My father almost made you leave

344
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
with nothing,

345
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,510
so how did he give you this house

346
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,200
and the salt-lined lot

347
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,270
in Huangshi Village?

348
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,440
Who let you in?

349
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,270
Get out.

350
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,790
Get out.

351
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,720
Get out.

352
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,310
Get out.

353
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,160
Stop, Nuo.

354
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,000
Get lost.

355
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,030
Nuo.

♪I love you, love you, love you♪

357
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:28,740
