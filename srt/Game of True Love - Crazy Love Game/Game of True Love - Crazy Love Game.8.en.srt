What are you doing here

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,680

15

Why didn't you answer my calls?

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,230
I didn't want to.

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,400
What were you doing?

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,760
None of your business.

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,200
Last night you were in my bed,

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,430
and today you're dating someone else,

right?

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,120
I already told you.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,310

But my relationship with Chi Ye

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,280

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,080
