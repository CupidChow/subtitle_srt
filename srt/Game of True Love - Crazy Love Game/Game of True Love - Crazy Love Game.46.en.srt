00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,090
just because things got hard.

193
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,940
You're trying to protect Shen Jiahe, right?

194
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,140
No.

195
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,660
Gao Hao'en already told me

196
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,330
about the gas leak

197
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,660
at Shen Jiahe's place.

198
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,570
Wasn't it you who told me that day

199
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,260
to go find Gao Hao'en

200
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,450
and stay at his place?

201
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,970
And then,

202
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,570
you had me act to fool Chi Ye.

203
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,810
That's when I realized it.

204
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,610
Nuo,

205
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,780
I'm your bestie.

206
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,330
Why are you even hiding this from me?

207
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,690
Dandan...

208
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,730
I can't tell you right now.

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,090
I'm trying to keep you safe.

210
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,690
But if Chi Ye really is the one

211
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,690
who hurt Aunt Rong,

212
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,020
then what you're doing

213
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,450
is walking right into the lion's den!

214
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,140
Don't worry.

215
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,180
I've already gained

216
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,060
his trust.

217
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,540
Once I find some evidence,

218
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,020
I'll pull out right away.

219
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,970
Just make sure you stay safe.

220
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,610
I will.

221
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,940
Nuo.

222
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,210
These are the decoration boxes

223
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,970
for our engagement party.

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,330
Pick one you like.

225
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,660
Oh, and the cake.

226
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,260
I sent the styles to your phone.

227
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,730
Pick whichever bakery

228
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,660
you like best.

229
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,210
These are gifts for Gao Hao'en, Yuan Dandan,

230
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,540
Ao Zhe, Mei,

231
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,450
and your uncle...

232
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,380
Take a look.

233
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,450
Did I miss anyone?

234
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,260
You're so sharp. Who could you miss?

235
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,490
These are gifts

236
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,450
for Wang Cheng'en and Li Caizao.

237
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,140
I caught you sneaking snacks, huh?

238
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,540
I bought them.

239
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,090
How's that sneaking?

240
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,380
Here, one for you.

241
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,380
One for you, and you, and you!

242
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,300
Is this one okay?

243
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,570
Let me see if it's sweet.

244
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,810
Is it sweet?

245
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,380
Try again.

246
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,780
Nuo.

247
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,850
Nuo?

248
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,300
They all look good.

249
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,900
You decide.

250
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,540
Okay.

251
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,210
Then let's go eat first.

252
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,690
I already booked a restaurant.

253
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,380
Sounds good.

254
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,780
Nuo...

255
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,060
Looks like it's raining outside.

256
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,730
I got us couple's umbrellas.

257
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,730
Here you go.

258
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,850
Thanks.

259
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,300
I'll wait for you in the car.

260
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,660
Out of the car. Let's talk.

261
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,180
I don't think

262
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,180
we have anything to talk about.

263
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,260
This wedding isn't happening.

264
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,540
Just like Nuo said,

265
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,690
you're arrogant

266
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,540
and irrational.

267
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,660
I can give Nuo a stable life,

268
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,060
and support in her career.

269
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,900
What can you offer her?

270
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,810
I can give her the love she wants.

271
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,490
Nuo doesn't even love you.

272
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,540
She loves me.

273
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,450
Whether in the past or now,

274
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,380
you were nothing more

275
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,730
than her temporary refuge.

276
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,020
Go ahead!

277
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,490
Stop!

278
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,380
Nuo.

279
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,140
You can't marry him.

280
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,380
You can't do this to me!

281
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,420
Then how should I treat you?

282
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,940
You came to our place making a scene.

283
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,810
Want me to call the police?

284
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,810
Go ahead.

285
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,940
Have me arrested.

286
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,490
Then you two

287
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,380
can finally be happy together.

288
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,780
He's my fiancé.

289
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,260
If you've got a problem

290
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,780
with him,

291
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,610
take it up with me.

292
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,660
Oh, so touching, huh?

293
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,330
Nuo,

294
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,330
No matter what hurtful things you say to me,

295
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,900
I can take it.

296
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,140
Every time you break

297
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,970
this heart of mine,

298
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,300
it just comes back to life!

299
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,420
It's no use!

300
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,690
Shen Jiahe...

301
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,330
do you really love me that much?

302
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,380
I'm getting married.

303
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,140
Forget everything that happened before.

304
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,140
It's over between us.

305
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,860
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

306
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:31,840
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

307
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,570
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
