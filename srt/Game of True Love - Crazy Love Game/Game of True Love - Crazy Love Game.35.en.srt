How did you know I was here?

15
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,060
Because I remember you being like this

16
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,890
when you were little.

17
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,620
You'd laugh with everyone

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,090
I knew this hospital was not very big,

76
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,130
Right.

77
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,330
Is it also true that you teamed up with Bai Xia?

78
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,570
Did you introduce her

I riled you and forced you to go abroad

so that you could

But you came back.

89
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,740
So I had to turn you

90
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,940
into my tool

91
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,860
to make you go against Xu Mingli.

92
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,300
Now, I've achieved my goal,

93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,420
so I don't have to pretend anymore,

94
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,130
understand?

95
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,420
Sure enough,

96
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,500
this is the Shen Jiahe I know.

97
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,860
That's right. You know me too well.

98
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,010
You figured out my plan

as soon as you came back,

100
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,210

101
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,570
paralyze you with love.

102
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,740
And that game you proposed

103
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,130
gave me the opportunity

104
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,420
to use you.

105
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,420
In fact, I don't love you at all.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,660
How could I love

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,810

108
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,450
If it were you, would you?

109
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,300
I don't want you to be happy at all

110
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,620
but to suffer like me.

111
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,690
After doing this,

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,660

114
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,940

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,300

That's great.

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,780
In that case,

123
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,140
we don't owe each other anything.

124
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,850
That's the way it's always been.

125
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,810

129

00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,850
so now, you've gotten your revenge, right?
