[Episode 40]

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,170
Hello?

13
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,450
Nuo.

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,060
Do you ever think it's a coincidence

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,500
that the surveillance is broken?

16
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,620
Indeed.

17
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,530
I suspect this incident

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,250
has something to do with someone

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,060
close to me.

20
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,580
My assistant Dong.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,580
You've seen him before.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,620
The figure of the man in black

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,220
that day resembles Dong's.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,580
The strangest thing is

25
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,420
that after that day,

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,420
he took a vacation and never showed up again.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,170
Do you mean...

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,250
Dong is someone

29
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,340
Chi Hao sent to me.

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,140
I suspect Chi Hao has something

31
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,810
to do with this.

32
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,890
But we have no proof.

33
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,420
I have an idea.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,730
We can give it a try.

35
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,780
Where is Chi Ye?

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,220
He hasn't come back yet.

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,220
This kid

38
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,850
has no sense of time.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,650
Call him.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,370
Okay.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,530
He didn't answer the phone.

42
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,090
I asked you to keep an eye on him,

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,180
but what did you do?

44
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,300
I've been keeping an eye on him.

45
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,460
He was recently in the hospital

46
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,620
with the Yuanfei Group's...

47
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,850
What now?

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,740
Chi Ye, be careful.

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,460
Let go of me.

50
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,970
Let me out.

51
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,370
Let me out.

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,740
My brother seems to be quite smart.

53
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,020
What?

54
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,650
Aren't you happy with Dong?

55
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,410
I'm tired of you spying on me all the time.

56
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,850
So you're unhappy with me.

57
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,060
It's useless for you to be unhappy.

58
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,060
Dong has to follow you.

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,300
And from now on,

60
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,370
don't have any more dealings

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,500
with that woman.

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,660
Why?

63
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,540
Chi Ye.

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,770
Let me out.

65
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,810
I don't understand

66
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,500
why you're so infatuated.

67
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,250
Don't you know what SJ's relationship

68
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,180
with Yuanfei is?

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,810
My business

70
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,690
has nothing to do with you.

71
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,010
Did I tell you that you have to

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,690
be obedient?

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,060
If you're not, you have to pay the price.

74
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,300
Then kill me.

75
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,330
Do you think I don't want to?

76
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,330
Loser.

77
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,180
Chi Ye.

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,500
Are you OK?

79
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,500
Chi Ye.

80
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,250
Chi Hao has been like that

81
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,330
for years.

82
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,570
I'm used to it.

83
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,770
You should sue him.

84
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,370
Sorry, Nuo.

85
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,300
I didn't get substantial evidence.

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,180
You did.

87
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,860
At least, we now know

88
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,250
that Dong is Chi Hao's man

89
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,210
and that Chi Hao is probably

90
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,540
involved in the accident,

91
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,540
but

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,300
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,660
I caused you to take a beating because of me.

94
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,860
I'm fine.

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,570
I don't care if I can

96
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,330
do something for you.

97
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,740
Chi Ye.

98
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,660
Thank you.

99
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,130
A lot has happened

100
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,500
during this time.

101
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,690
I'm thankful

102
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,940
to have a friend like you

103
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,420
by my side

104
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,250
when I'm feeling

105
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,100
especially helpless,

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,060
but I don't want you to get hurt

107
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,980
in any way because of me,

108
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,130
you know?

109
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,450
What's so funny?

110
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,500
Nothing.

111
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,210
It's just...

112
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,810
It's nice to be worried about

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,060
by you.

114
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,690
Don't worry.

115
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,300
I'll take care of myself,

116
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,210
but you mustn't go into danger yourself.

117
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,060
Why are you here?

118
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,620
Xia.

119
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,090
I was at fault

120
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,380
during the last fight,

121
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,300
but no matter what,

122
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,730
we're mother and daughter.

123
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,570
It's all over when the fight is over.

124
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,570
Look.

125
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,730
I bought a cotton dress.

126
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,420
Yuan can wear it when she grows up.

127
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,020
What's this dress?

128
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,570
It doesn't even have a brand name.

129
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,540
You're not like before.

130
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,210
Don't care about the brand.

131
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,420
Kids this age

132
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,140
are growing up fast.

133
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,810
As long as it's comfortable

134
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,490
and warm.

135
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,260
I can buy clothes myself.

136
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,570
So why did you come?

137
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,490
I'm concerned about you.

138
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,330
Well.

139
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,330
I'm leaving.

140
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,020
Bai Lanhua.

141
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,300
Hello, Bai Xia.

142
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,940
Five dots.

143
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,850
Eight bamboos.

144
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,540
Ma.

145
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,420
Give me a few more days.

146
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,690
I'm sure I can win this time.

147
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,420
Please lend me some more money,

148
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,060
okay?

149
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,210
I'll pay you back double when I win.

150
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,690
Three times.

151
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,970
Bai Lanhua.

152
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,210
Give me back my money.

153
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,020
That's the money for my daughter's life.

154
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,780
Give it back.

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,730
I'll win

156
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,690
in a minute.

157
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,090
Your daughter?

158
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,260
You're just in time.

159
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,090
Give me back the money.

160
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,300
Let go.

161
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,020
Say it again.

162
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,490
What's going on?

163
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,490
What are you doing?

164
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,330
What am I doing?

165
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,450
What do you think I'm doing?

166
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,810
What do you think I'm doing?

167
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,490
Xia.

168
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,730
- Now go. - Boss.

169
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,570
Are you OK, boss?

170
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,780
-Boss. - Are you okay, boss?

171
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,690
Why looking at me? Go after them.

172
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,210
Come on out.

173
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,210
They're gone.

174
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,210
Get out.

175
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,540
- Get her. - Get her.

176
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,730
How dare you hit me?

177
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,260
Mom.

178
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,300
Beat her up.

179
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,900
Mom.

180
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,330
Stop it.

181
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,020
Don't move.

182
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,140
Do you want to die?

183
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,780
I called the police before I came.

184
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,020
Do you all want to go to jail?

185
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,300
Boss, what should we do?

186
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,380
Good.

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,020
Bai Lanhua.

188
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,420
Give me back

189
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,900
all the money in three days.

190
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,810
Otherwise,

191
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,850
this is not over.

192
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,570
Let's go.

193
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,730
Are you okay?

194
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,660
Let's go.

195
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,450
Xia.

196
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,420
I really didn't mean it.

197
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,570
I don't know the password

198
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,020
of this card.

199
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,140
I didn't spend any of the money

200
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,380
on this card.

201
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,610
Take it.

202
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,900
I can pay back for you,

203
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,810
but you can't go

204
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,060
to that place again.

205
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,210
Otherwise, if this happens again,

206
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,730
I won't care about you.

207
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,940
I won't.

208
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,380
I won't.

209
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,300
Jiahe.

210
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,020
Thank you very much.

211
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,570
You're welcome.

212
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,940
Mr. Shen.

213
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,660
Thank you for what you did today.

214
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,450
You've always

215
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,450
taken such good care of Xia.

216
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,210
Actually, Xia

217
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,180
is a very nice girl.

218
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,780
Mom.

219
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,020
Don't talk nonsense.

220
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,330
Ma'am.

221
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,450
I want to ask you a question.

222
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,940
Did you meet Xu Mingli

223
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,180
before he fell in love

224
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,420
with Bai Xia?

225
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,570
I do like to meet

226
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,780
those rich people.

227
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,540
It seems Bai Lanhua knows nothing

228
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,610
about what happened between Lin Chongshan

229
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,610
and Xu Mingli.

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,610
Do you know Lin Chongshan's son,

231
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,780
Lin Yi?

232
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,210
Why are you asking about him all of a sudden?

233
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,660
Do you remember

234
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,660
what he looked like?

235
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,210
Yes, of course,

236
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,940
but after

237
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,140
all these years,

238
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,660
he must have looked

239
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,810
very different.

240
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,810
Does he

241
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,090
have any features?

242
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,020
Features...

243
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,900
Yes.

244
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,490
Before,

245
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,260
Lin Chongshan told me

246
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,690
that this kid would be rich

247
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,850
because he had a birthmark on his waist.

248
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,730
He was so superstitious.

249
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,540
Chi Ye.

250
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,850
You look

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,330
a bit weak,

252
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,570
but you have a good figure.

253
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,940
As your friend,

254
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,020
I have to work out secretly.

255
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,850
Let me see.

256
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,660
Not bad.

257
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,140
Take a look.

258
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,380
Does he look like this?

259
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,940
I can't tell.

260
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,660
Not really.

261
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,980
[Basic information. Name: Lin Yi]

262
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,160
[Son of Lin Chongshan]

263
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,200
[A fire broke out in his childhood home]

264
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,420
[His father died when he was a child, and his mother is unknown]

265
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,500
[He attended Light Valley Kindergarten]

266
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,180
Find me someone

267
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,900
named Lin Yi.

268
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,140
Here's a photo of Chi Ye

269
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,180
and a profile of Lin Yi.

270
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,490
You'd better investigate

271
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,420
at local kindergartens

272
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,090
