12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,220
It's me.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,700
Open the door.

14
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,170
Mr. Chi.

15
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,650
Hello?

16
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,250
This isn't

17
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,500
a permanent solution.

18
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,620
The police will find me sooner or later.

19
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,020
How many times have I told you?

20
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,300
I'll take you abroad

21
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,340
after you've survived this.

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,650
Don't forget.

23
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,620
Three people died because of you,

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,500
and you're facing a lawsuit

25
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,620
about the compensation of hundreds of millions.

26
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,020
If I'd known,

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,970
I shouldn't have asked Xu Mingli

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,250
to contact the quality control department.

29
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,090
Whose car is this?

30
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,180
Whose blue car is it?

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,970
Move it.

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,250
Come on. It's in the way.

33
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,020
Isn't it your car?

34
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,650
Move it.

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,020
Whose blue car is that?

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,020
Can you move it?

37
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,780
Hurry up.

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,570
I'll move the car.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,460
Why are you parked here, man?

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,620
So fast?

Who are you?

43
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,970
Xu Mingli's daughter?

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,530
That's right.

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,020
I'll be brief now.

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,020
In this case,

47
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,090
you were set up by Chi Ye.

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,690
At first, he did give you

49
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,900
cost-effective lithium batteries

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,090
to make you money,

51
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,690
but then,

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,020
he replaced the original batteries

53
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,340
with inferior ones

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,060
in order to create a safety incident

55
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,810
for you to take the blame.

56
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,130
This...

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,690
Why can't I understand?

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,300
But

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,180
what's in it for him?

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,210
Because he didn't want

61
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,330
to make money at all.

62
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,250
He wants to take down Yuanfei

63
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,100
and Xu Mingli.

64
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,890
If Chi Ye knows we found out about this,

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,940
he won't let you go.

66
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,010
Don't hesitate.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,100
Come with me now.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,210
Wait a minute.

69
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,060
I haven't

70
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,890
finished packing yet.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,980
Give me a minute.

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,620
Nuo, how's it going?

73
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,130
Hurry up.

74
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,010
There's no time.

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,620
Let's go.

76
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,940
I'll take two more things.

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,660
Two more.

78
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,860
Come on.

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,660
A little further that way.

80
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,500
Can you drive?

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,940
Why so noisy?

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,450
I just told you to move your car.

83
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,450
Why full of nonsense?

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,330

85
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,770
Jiahe.

86
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,420
Mr. Chi.

87
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,570
Did Xu Mingli

88
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,500
send you?

89
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,770
Jiang Tian.

90
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,180
Help, Mr. Chi.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,250
Help me.

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,250
Chi Ye.

93
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,180
Jiahe.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,300
Jiahe.

95
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,330
Chi Ye.

96
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,250
What are you doing?

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,370
Shen Jiahe.

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,980
What are you doing here?

99
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,500
Mr. Chi.

100
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,890
He says

101
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,060
you planned all this,

102
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,060
but I don't believe him.

103
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,690
Did Xu Mingli send you

104
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,810
to convince me to turn myself in?

105
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,940
Today,

106
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,130
neither of you can leave.

107
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,130
I've already called the police.

108
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,420
What?

109
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,810
Mr. Chi.

Chi Ye.

115
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,330
I'll get the rope.

121

Chi Ye.

122
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,690
Let her go.

123
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,330
Chi Ye.

124
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,810
Don't move.

125
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,620
Nuo.

126
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,940
Nuo.

127
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,300
Nuo.

Nuo.

129
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,420
- Don't move. - Nuo.

130
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,740
Let go of me.

131
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,300
Chi Ye, get back here.

132
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,980
Nuo.

133
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,540
Chi Ye.

134
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,370
Let go of me.

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:38,810
Open the door.

Hello, Mr. Chi.

144
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,770
The police are at the office and want to arrest you.

145
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,740
Everyone is saying

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,740
that Chi Hao was killed by you,

147
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,940
and there are reports

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,890
that you are suspected of a hostile takeover.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,620
What should we do?

150
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,010
Mr. Chi.

151
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,100
What's the situation?

152
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,970
What's going on?

153
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,730
The police are looking for us.

154
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,570
So what now?

155
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,970
Let's go.

156
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,660
Yang, is the boat ready?

157
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,060
Okay.

158
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,300
The faster the better.

159
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,450
I got a boat.

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,060
Go to Duanshui Pier

161
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,260
and contact Yang.

162
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,690
Let me know when the boat arrives.

163
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:17,900
Okay.

164
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,210
Hide somewhere now.

165
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,420
Wait for my message.

166
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,260
Nuo.

167
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:41,970
Nuo.

168
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,330
Find Xu Nuo's location.

169
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,610
Do you want to find Xu Nuo

170
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,690
and share the location?

171
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,140
Confirm.

172
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,060
Where is this?

173
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,970
Jiahe.

174
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,810
Shen Jiahe.

175
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,300
Where's Shen Jiahe?

176
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,810
Where's Shen Jiahe?

177
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,380
Chi Ye.

178
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,380
I'm asking you where Shen Jiahe is.

179
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,210
He's fine.

180
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,660
Don't worry.

181
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,940
Stop struggling,

182
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,330
or you'll hurt yourself.

183
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,380
What do you want?

184
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,180
Nuo.

185
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,330
Do you remember

186
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,540
our school time?

187
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,610
I always

188
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,570
sat behind you

189
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,570
and could only see your back.

190
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,610
So?

191
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,660
So tonight,

192
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,450
we're leaving.

193
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,140
I've already booked the boat tickets.

194
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,060
We'll never come back,

195
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,850
okay?

196
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,090
Chi Ye.

197
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,300
You can't get away with it.

198
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,090
Why have you

199
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,380
gotten to this point?

200
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,940
Why?

201
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,810
What reason do you think?

202
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,180
Nuo.

203
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,300
Do you know how important you are

204
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,330
to me?

205
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,450
It was you

206
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,330
who brought a light

207
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,210
into my dark life.

208
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,540
I admit

209
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,570
that I want to take revenge,

210
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,810
but that's a debt that Shen Jiahe

211
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,180
and his son should pay,

212
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,140
but about you, Nuo,

213
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,810
I'm just

214
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,380
trying my best

215
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,570
to be there

216
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,210
for you all the time.

217
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,060
However, why do you

218
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,330
always show your fake feelings?

219
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,210
It was you

220
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,690
who extinguished

221
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,450
the only light in my heart.

222
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,420
Chi Ye.

223
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,260
Light can only penetrate

224
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,140
only if you are bright inside.

225
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,450
Right.

226
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,970
Right.

227
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,780
That's why

228
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,540
I am dark,

229
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,540
and I can only keep you with me

230
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,730
in a dark way.

231
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,690
My heart won't be loved

232
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,090
or understood,

233
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,540
but that's okay,

234
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,060
we'll love each other later.

235
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,020
Nuo.

236
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,690
Nuo.

237
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,970
Nuo.

238
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,420
Shen Jiahe.

239
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,970
You're really haunting.

240
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,050
Chi Ye.

241
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,860
Calm down.

242
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,250
If you want to do something, come at me.

243
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,050
Come at you?

244
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,100
Who do you think you are?

245
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,660
I advise you not to come over.

246
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,840
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

247
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:47,710
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

248
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,560
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
