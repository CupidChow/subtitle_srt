199

my mom raised you for over twenty years.

200
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,300
You used family as leverage,

201
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,690
treated marriage like a game...

202

207
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,380

208
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,660
I know you suspect me right now,

209

211
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,610

213

233

[Uncle]
That depends

234
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,490
on what you're willing to sacrifice.

235
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,060
If that price means

236
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,450
halting Yuanfei Group's growth,

237
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,810
would you still do it?

238
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,380
What's wrong?

239
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,970
The plan to remove him didn't go well?

240
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,690
I kind of expected it.

241
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,140
Shen Jiahe's been at Yuanfei Group for years.

242
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,260
His roots run deep.

243
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,450
It won't be easy to bring him down.

244
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,020
But just now, my uncle told me,

245
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,300
before my dad was taken away,

246
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,060
he talked to the shareholders

247
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,940
as a personal favor.

248
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,570
He asked them to support Shen Jiahe.

249
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,850
Shen Jiahe reported Uncle Xu,

250
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,610
yet Uncle Xu still helped him?

251
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,090
I never imagined

252
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,020
they were that close.

253
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,850
Maybe to my dad,

254
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,810
a son will always matter more

255
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,490

Yuanfei Group's stock

267
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,450

269

274
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,180

278
