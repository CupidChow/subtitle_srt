you?

192
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,720
It's none of my business,

193
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,000
but

194
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,200
I still want to say that the fetus is innocent.

195
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,600
Why can't

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
you?

197
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
Am I really going

198
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,120
to have this baby?

199
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,550
But I can't even take care

200
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,550
of myself right now.

201
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,080
Be careful.

202
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,030
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,360
Mom, are you okay?

204
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,390
I'm fine. Come on.

205
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,200
Go over there.

206
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Does it still hurt?

207
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,390
No.

208
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,270
You're my little angel.

209
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,720
Kiss me,

210
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,480
and then I won't feel any pain at all.

211
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,080
You're my good baby.

212
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,720
Will you be my little angel too?

213
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,480
The man has a nice figure,

214
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
but compared to me,

215
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,270
it's worse.

216
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Form is emptiness.

217
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,440
Form is emptiness.

218
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,390
Form is emptiness.

219
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,440
Form is emptiness.

220
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,440
Form is emptiness.

221
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,960
Form is emptiness.

222
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
What are you saying?

223
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,870
Watch the movie.

224
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,120
Who asked you to talk about this?

225
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,240
What else?

226
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,000
What am I supposed to talk about?

227
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,440
Concentrate.

228
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,630
Nuo.

229
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,000
He finally couldn't resist.

230
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,080
The day after tomorrow is Mother's Day,

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,840
so what are you going

232
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,750
to buy for Aunt Rong?

233
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,150
Shen Jiahe.

234
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm watching this kind of movie with you,

235
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,000
but you're talking to me about Mother's Day?

236
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,480
Are you serious?

237
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,240
What else can we talk about?

238
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,750
Guess I'll just have to use the killer move.

239
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,750
Use that on me?

240
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
Then don't blame me.

241
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,550
Why are you pouting?

242
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,720
Don't want to keep pretending?

243
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm going to stop

244
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,150
and go to bed.

245
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,390
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.

246
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,510
What are you going

247
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,320
to get my mom?

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
It's a secret.

249
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
I won't tell you until the last minute.

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,240
Anyway, whatever gift you buy,

251
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,270
mine will definitely be better than yours.

252
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,360
Really?

253
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:17,870
Hello?

254
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,480
Mr. Shen.

255
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,200
Madam has disappeared.

256
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,750
I checked all the surveillance videos near the hospital

257
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,480
but couldn't find her.

258
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,510
Got it. I'll be right there.

259
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,840
What happened?

260
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,790
Nothing.

261
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,390
Gao asked me to do something,

262
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,200
so I can't go

263
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,240
to the movies with you today.

264
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,870
Are you upset?

265
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,960
Dan said this morning

266
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,150
Gao Hao'en is traveling today.

267
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,910
Sir.

268
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,320
Follow the car in front.

269
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,030
Okay.

270
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,200
Why did Shen Jiahe come here?

271
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,380
[Binhai Zhihua Elementary School]

272
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,440
Sir, follow the car.

273
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,620
[Binhai Zhihua Elementary School]

274
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:01,510
Sway and sway.

275
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,270
'Til we reach Grandma Bridge.

276
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,360
Sway and sway.

277
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,600
Baby, go to sleep.

278
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,360
Sway and sway.

279
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,030
Go to sleep.

280
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,240
Go to sleep.

281
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,080
Go to sleep.

282
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,080
Sway and sway.

283
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,030
Are you pretending to be asleep again?

284
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,870
If I was asleep,

285
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,720
you could go to bed.

286
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
You're too tired.

287
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,750
Good boy.

288
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,150
Now go to sleep.

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,160
'Til we reach Grandma Bridge.

290
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,400
Go to sleep.

291
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,510
Baby, go to sleep.

292
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,400
Mom.

293
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,270
Go to sleep.

294
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,720
Mom.

295
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
Mom. Why are you here?

296
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,350
Jiahe, good boy.

297
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,070
Go to sleep.

298
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,070
I'll sing for you.

299
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,720
Jiahe.

300
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,160
Don't abandon me.

301
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,480
But I can't help it.

302
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,790
I'm sick

303
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,200
and can't take care of you.

304
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,110
No.

305
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,160
Jiahe.

306
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,960
I won't make trouble.

307
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,070
I can eat less.

308
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,720
Mom.

309
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,590
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,440
-I'm sorry. - Don't go.

311
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,240
Mom.

312
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Jiahe.

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,830
Go to sleep.

Let's go back to the sanatorium.

316
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,030
Baby, go to sleep.

317
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,830
Go to sleep.

318
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,000
Come on, Mom.

319
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,030
Be careful.
