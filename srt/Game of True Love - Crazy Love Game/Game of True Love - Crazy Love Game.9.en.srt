This is not merely

Where's your boss? Get out!

195
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,440
I am the boss.

196
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
How can I help you?

197
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
Here, take a look.

198
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,240
Miss Bai,

199
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,870
I think today may not be

200
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,600
the right time

201
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,960
to continue our due diligence.

202
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,910
Why don't we reschedule?

203
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,150
Sorry about this.

204
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,240
It's fine.

205
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,270
Hello, here is the case,

206
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,080
there is a recovery period

207
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,030
after this treatment…

208
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,390
Shut up.

209
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,480
What are you doing?

210
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,240
Why are you hitting her?

211
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,480
Shut up.

212
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Listen up!

213
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,150
You must compensate me ten times over today,

214
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,750
or I'll smash this place up.

215
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,030
Stop.

216
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,870
If you insist on driving forward,

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,440
all the side doors will break.

218
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,550
Fine, you do it then.

219
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,630
Hello, Bai Xia.

220
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,120
Okay, I got it.

221
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,910
I'll be there soon.

222
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,080
I have things to do.

223
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,510
Just handle it yourself.

224
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,030
What?

225
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
You are leaving for Bai Xia's call?

226
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,790
Didn't you say you couldn't live without Chi Ye?

227
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,150
Call him to help you then.

228
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,550
Mr. Shen is here.

229
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,000
What?

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
So you went to get reinforcements?

231
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,670
This is Mr. Shen,

232
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,630
the CEO of our group.

233
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,080
I don't care who he is.

234
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,270
Just tell me, are you compensating or not?

235
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,910
No.

236
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,670
Listen up, kid.

237
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,910
I wouldn't have come here today

238
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,080
if I didn't have backing.

239
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,240
I can tell that.

240
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,150
Or you wouldn't have come to cause trouble

241
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,200
right when Xiamei was undergoing due diligence.

242
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,320
I know

243
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,480
who your boss is.

244
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,480
Give them a message for me.

245
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,150
It's better to resolve grudges than to create new ones.

246
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,630
In business, harmony brings wealth.

247
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,030
Let's go.

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
Mr. Shen, you are impressive.

249
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
It seems

250
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,720
that someone deliberately hired people

251
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,750
to sabotage Yuanfei's investment

252
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,120
in Xiamei.

253
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,360
But how did you know

254
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,630
who was behind it?

255
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,360
I just asked your staff

256
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,630
for her client records.

257
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,670
There are only

258
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,750
two major beauty chain businesses

259
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,630
in Binhai.

260
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,000
And she happens

261
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,630
to be a shareholder in both.

262
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,720
If this happens again,

263
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,630
just call the police.

264
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,750
A damaged reputation can be rebuilt,

265
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,200
but what if something happens to you?

266
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,840
If you weren't here today,

267
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,790
who knows what would have happened?

268
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,510
As long as you're safe.

269
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,240
If there is nothing else, I'm leaving.

270
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,080
Can you stay a bit longer?

271
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,630
I'm afraid they might come back.

272
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,870
They probably won't.

273
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,840
But what if they do?

274
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,390
I have work to do. I have to go.

275
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,510
But I have something important to tell you.

276
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,000
What is it?

277
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,200
I need to drive later. I don't drink.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,670
Jiahe,

279
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,960
I love you.

281
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:06,930
