I've got some good news for you.

00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,010
Aunt Rong is awake!

I thought

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,410
you were never going to wake up again.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,170
I'm okay now.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,500
Well,

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,010
looks like

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,780
a lot happened

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,250
So, what about you and Jiahe?

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,420
You really plan to keep pretending

No, not too much.

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,370
I'm just checking...

127
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,180
Hands off!

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,210
What is it?

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,860
It's nothing.

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,890
I hurt my shoulder

131

when I saved you earlier.

132
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,450
Your knife wound is torn?

133
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,540

you weren't drunk at all.

140

And you didn't lose your memory at all!

141
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,570
That's not right.

142
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,010

Then let me help you

145

jog it a bit more.

146
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,690

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,260
you left me sleeping, huh?

168
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,330
Hey, kid,

169
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,690
what are you doing here?

170
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,180
Miss,

171
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,660
a guy named Jiahe

172
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,300
asked me to tell you to meet him at the piano hall.

173
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,260
Whether we've

174
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,540
sailed through storms together,

175
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,570
or we're starting all over again,

176
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,450
I will still propose to you.

177
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,060
I hope, while listening

178
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,690
to your favorite piano piece,

179
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,060
you'll walk toward me again.

180
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,380
Nuo,

181
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,360
I...

182
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,730
No matter what you say,

183
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,690
my answer is yes.

184
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,700
[LOVE]

185
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,780
Actually, I was just about to ask...

186
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,940
do you want

187
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,900
to play another game?

188
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,180
You still want to play games?

189
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,780
The price of this game

190
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,690
is a lifetime.

193
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,300
Then I surrender.
