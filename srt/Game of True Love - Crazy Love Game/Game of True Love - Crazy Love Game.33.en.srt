As long as we rehearse in advance,

everything will be fine.

You weren't drunk that night?

29

Of course not.

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,410

31
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,410
promise me...

You lied to me.

37
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,740
I've done it more than once.

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,570
In that truth-or-dare game,

Shen Jiahe,

42
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,020
we're the same kind of people,

We want the best for each other,

no matter what happens,

49
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,300
let's be honest with each other.

50
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,060
Can we do that?

51
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:47,850
Deal.

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,100
I'm heading out now.

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,570
Hurry!

to the ceremony myself.

96
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,370
Didn't you always object

97

to their marriage?

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,450
What good did objecting do?

99
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,570
They truly love each other.

100
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,940
What can I do about that?

101
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,010
I've come to terms with it now.

102
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,450
If they want to marry, let them.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,620
But still,

104
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,210
they really did

105
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,330
handle things poorly.

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,570
I am their father, aren't I?

107
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,060
And they didn't even send me the wedding invitation!

108
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,010
I've got my pride...

109
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,010
How can I crash the wedding?

110
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,770
Well, you brought that on yourself.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,500
I admit it.

112
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,060
It's all on me, okay?

113
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,660
Can you take me there?

114
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,370
Come on.

115
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,770
I'm begging you.

116
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,660
Please?

117
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,890
Nuo's car is already here.

118
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,810
How am I supposed to take you?

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,210
It's fine.

120
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,660
Just call Nuo

121
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,570
and have her send the driver back.

122
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,300
You have to ride with me.

123
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,210
If we don't arrive together,

124
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,810
how am I supposed

125
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,770
to get in later?

126
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,300
A father has to be present, right?

127
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,100
Don't you agree?

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,180
Fine.

129
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,300
Then hurry up.

130
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,940
We'll be late.

131
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,740
For you, only the best service.

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,060
Why are you here?

133
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,060
The wedding isn't happening here.

134
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm not here for the wedding.

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,060
Then what are you here for?

136
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,450
Ever since

137
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,660
you and Xu Nuo announced your engagement,

138
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,420
I haven't been able

139
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,610
to truly give you my blessing.

140
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,660
Keeping this to myself

141
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,810
would've been the ultimate revenge.

142
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,420
But...

143
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,420
I appreciate

144
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,450
everything you two did

145
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,690
for my daughter.

146
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,300
I want to do good for my daughter's sake.

147
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,260
What do you mean?

148
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,380
Yesterday, I went home

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,660
to deliver the divorce papers.

150
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,610
Xu Mingli was drunk

151
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,610
and said something

152
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,140
that's hard to believe.

153
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,940
Whether it's true or not,

154
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,660
you can decide for yourself.

155
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,900
What you just said was true?

156
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,140
Can you say it again

157
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,140
in front of Shen Jiahe?

158
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,330
Why wouldn't I?

159
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,690
I've got nothing to hide!

160
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,450
Let me tell you, Shen Jiahe...

161
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,210
You're actually

162
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,780
my biological son...

163
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,260
But didn't Shen Jiahe's dad

164
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,610
die in an accident?

165
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,330
Died in an accident?

166
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,330
Lin Chongshan was just a cover story

167
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,400
to keep the Su family

168
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,410
from finding out

169
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,080
that Shen Jiahe

170
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,300
is the child of me and Shen Fen.

171
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,660
So we made up the rest.

172
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,300
He should've known long ago.

173
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,210
That day, he even made me kneel...

174
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,900
Made your dad kneel?

175
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,420
Where's the justice in that?

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
Shen Jiahe...

177
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,020
you owe me a drink for that.

178
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,570
And you better drink it kneeling...

179
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,300
So...

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,810
Xu Mingli is my biological father?

181
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,690
Then Nuo and I...

182
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,540
Nuo and I...

183
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,730
That's impossible...

184
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,020
No way...

185
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,660
That means you and Xu Nuo

186
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,690
are half-siblings.

187
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,690
No way...

188
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,610
Go!

189
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,780
Go!

190
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,610
Get out!

191
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,140
Go!

192
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,490
Go!

193
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,260
Let me tell you, Shen Jiahe...

194
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,850
You're actually

195
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,300
my biological son...

196
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,020
Don't abandon me!

197
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,180
Mom...

198
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,060
Jiahe...

199
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,780
Jiahe...

200
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,850
Please don't leave me!

201
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,540
Jiahe,

202
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,140
- I'm sorry. - Mom...

203
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,180
I'm sorry, sweetheart!

204
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,900
Mom...

205
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,260
Jiahe...

206
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,690
You two

207
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,060
can't be too close.

208
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,610
If people see this,

209
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,660
they'll start talking.

210
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,610
You get it?

211
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,810
You're both my children.

212
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,940
To outsiders,

213
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,300
this would be a huge scandal!

214
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,300
Do you understand?

215
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,090
You two are siblings!

216
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,570
She's being reckless,

217
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,300
and you're following her lead?

218
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,140
I want you two to break off the engagement!

219
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,020
Call it off!

220
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,570
You grew up together.

221
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,380
I always saw you

222
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,660
as brother and sister!

223
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,330
Uncle Xu, calm down.

224
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,420
Break up or not?

225
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,180
If not, get out of here!

226
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,850
Jiahe,

227
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,020
don't be rash.

228
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,810
Listen to me.

229
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,900
There has to be some mistake.

230
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,900
What's written in that diary

231
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,380
is not what

232
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,850
really happened!

233
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:34,850
Back...

234
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,450
back then...

235
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,780
I...

236
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,180
You're actually my...

237
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,020
Xu Mingli, you bastard!

238
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,570
You bastard!

239
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,020
Mom!

240
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,900
Shut up, you bastard!

241
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,970
Mom!

242
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,180
Mom!

243
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,970
It's okay.

244
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,380
It's alright.

245
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,090
This is all my fault.

246
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,450
I brought all of this on myself.

247
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,730
Can you get through

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,610
to Shen Jiahe?

249
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,300
He's not here yet?

250
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,420
What's going on?

251
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,970
We can't reach him.

252
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,330
No way.

253
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,210
Call him again.

254
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,330
What are you two whispering about?

255
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,380
Nothing.

256
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,020
Shen Jiahe's probably on his way.

257
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,690
The traffic map's lit up red.

258
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,610
What a perfectly festive day!

259
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,020
I'll call him again.

260
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,730
Xu Mingli,

261
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,210
is this really the way to the wedding?

262
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,690
Of course.

263
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,180
Who are you trying to fool?

264
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,260
What are you up to?

265
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,690
Stop the car!

266
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,300
Why are you yelling?

267
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,810
I'm driving here.

268
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,180
Why are you taking off your seatbelt?

269
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,940
What if something happens,

270
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,180
like a crash?

271
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,330
You're a liar!

272
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,570
You just want to ruin

273
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,140
my daughter's wedding!

274
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,210
I'm calling Nuo right now

275
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,570
to tell them not to wait for me.

276
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,570
You're unbelievable!

277
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,060
Why bother calling her?

278
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,900
What are you doing, Xu Mingli?

279
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,330
Are you insane?

280
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,810
Stop the car!

281
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,090
Stop the car!

282
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,940
What are you doing...

283
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,300
Stop!

284
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,020
Stop the car!

285
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,780
Hey!

286
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,730
I'm driving!

287
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,020
Stop messing around!

288
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,300
You're the crazy one,

289
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,850
I'm telling you!

290
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,540
Those two can never

291
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,380
be together!

292
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,850
They absolutely can't get married!

293
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,730
If you care about them,

294
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,730
you'll do what I say.

295
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,140
Hello?

296
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,090
Hello, Xu Mingli.

297
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,780
Answer me...

298
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,450
Are Nuo and I...

299
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,140
really siblings?

300
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,570
Tell me!

301
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,850
Are Nuo and I related?

302
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,970
So, you found out.

303
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,850
Isn't that a good thing?

304
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,730
That's why

305
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,380
you two can't get married.

306
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,330
Get it?

307
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,690
Hello?

308
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,020
Did you hear me, Jiahe?

309
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,970
Jiahe.

310
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,970
Jiahe!

311
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,940
What are you doing?

312
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,810
Give me the phone!

313
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,850
Give it here!

314
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,420
Give it to me!

315
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,540
Give me the phone!

316
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,730
Jiahe!

317
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,730
What are you doing?

318
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,460
Are you okay, Su Rong?

319
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:29,640
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

320
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:38,580
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

321
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,320
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
