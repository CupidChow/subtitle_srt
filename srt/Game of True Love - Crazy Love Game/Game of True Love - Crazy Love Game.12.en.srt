65
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,370

Mr. Xu's ambition is not what it used to be.

You're not just buying shares.

It's also an opportunity.

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,690
within the contract period,

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,090
you'll become

85
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,340
a hidden shareholder of Yuanfei.

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,690
At that time,

87
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,570
wouldn't it be easy

88
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,060

90
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,460

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,970

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,370

93

But,

94
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,410
will Xu Mingli trust

95
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,780
the buyer you recommend?

96
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,740

105
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,450

but dragging my mom

194
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,540
into this illegal scheme?

195
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,140
I just came

196
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,020
to confirm it with you.

197
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,730
I have to go now.

198
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,300
Hello?

199
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,570
Let me ask you,

200
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,570
what exactly has my mom's overseas

201
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,570
fund company been up to?

202
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,180
Spare me the nonsense.

203
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,180
Just answer me this,

204
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,420
is your deal with Xu Mingli's share pledge

205
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,380
legal or not?

206
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,540
Hello?

207
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,570
It was kept a deep secret that we used

208
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,780
Zhang Lihui's name

209
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,140
to buy the shares,

210
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,020
even Xu Mingli didn't find it out,

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,060
yet Xu Nuo managed to uncover it.

212
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,570
This girl is really something.

213
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,900
Mr. Chi,

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,180
the man who's watching Chi Ye

215
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,380
said she just left his house.

216
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,450
She shouldn't have gone far.

217
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,850
Find a place and keep her there.

218
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,490
Don't let her ruin my plan.

219
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,900
Got it.

220
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,900
Hi,

221
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,730
Mr. Xu,

222
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,180
long time no see.

223
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:43,780
Please.

224
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,420
Thanks.

225
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,140
Hello? Nuo.

226
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,330
Hello? Jiahe.

227
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,210
Hurry and tell my dad not to sign the contact.

228
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,300
The real owner of KKR is SJ.

229
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,180
The fund company he pledges the shares to

230
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,450
is owned by Chi Ye's mother.

231
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,610
I just confirmed it with Chi Ye.

232
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,020
Chi Hao must be behind this.

233
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,900
I can't reach my dad.

234
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,490
Go stop him

235
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,060
before he falls into Chi Hao's trap.

236
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm on my way now.

237
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,850
Nuo?

238
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,780
Nuo?

239
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,300
Nuo?

240
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,900
Something's wrong. Nuo is in trouble.

241
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,450
She must have found out

242
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,940
that SJ is behind the share purchase,

243
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,260
so Chi Hao is going to get rid of her.

244
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,330
Call the police right now.

245
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,570
SJ probably just wants to keep her contained.

246
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,610
They won't do anything to her.

247
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,090
That depends on who we're dealing with.

248
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,730
Now,

249
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,940
give Zhou Cheng a call

250
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,940
and tell him to abort the plan.

251
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,140
We're going to use him

252
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,060
to set up Mr. Xu.

253
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,450
If you do this, you'll give yourself away.

254
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,610
As long as we get evidence

255
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,970
of him privately pledging shares,

256
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,610
we can weaken

257
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,900
his influence on the board.

258
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,780
Are you sure you want to throw it all away?

259
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,970
What if Chi Hao tips off him

260
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,180
and turns him against us?

261
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,810
Then we...

262
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,570
Just do as I say!

263
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,780
Call Zhou Cheng right now.

264
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,780
Alright.

265
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,540
Hello?

266
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,970
Chi Hao,

267
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,090
if you dare lay a finger on Xu Nuo,

268
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,330
I won't let you off.

269
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,090
You are Shen Jiahe?

270
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,540
Mr. Shen,

271
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,060
it must be a misunderstanding.

272
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,330
I don't even know

273
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,660
what you're talking about.

274
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,090
Don't play dumb with me.

275
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,780
You have one minute

276
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,380
to send me Nuo's location.

277
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,940
Or, I'll send you to jail.

278
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,570
Mr. Shen...

279
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,090
What should we do now, Mr. Chi?

280
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,900
Use a virtual number

281
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,450
and send him the location.

282
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,780
Okay.

283
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,020
Xu Mingli

284
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,140
raised a little traitor.

285
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,540
How interesting.

286
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,450
Should we tell Xu Mingli?

287
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,970
Not yet.

288
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,330
Let them fight among themselves.

289
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,940
The Sea God Temple.

290
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,900
Help!

291
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,300
The tide is rising!

292
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,300
Help!

293
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,090
Help!
