[Episode 27]

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Uncle Xu,

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,670
what exactly happened back then

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,070
that made my mom end up like this?

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,920
What happened back then?

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,070
Well...

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,280
How would I know?

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,600
Who could possibly know that,

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,230
kid?

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,870
So many years have passed

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,150
since then.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,510
Who still remembers what happened?

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,070
We're all getting on in years.

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,480
Don't you think?

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,950
But I do think

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,040
finding your mom

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,350
is a really good thing.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,840
All these years,

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,840
she's had such a hard time,

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,560
kid.

31
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,000
But now that you've told me,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,120
it's a good thing.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,760
Let's take care of her together,

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,870
okay?

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Don't worry.

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
I'll make sure

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,590
your mom gets the best doctor

38
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,000
to help her recover soon.

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,070
It's fine, really.

40
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,840
No need to trouble yourself

41
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,870
about her treatment.

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,710
I've already made arrangements.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,120
What arrangements?

44
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,790
You know what?

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,590
I've got something else in mind.

46
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,230
Jiahe,

47
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,870
you know Vincent,

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,950
the guy heading our Southeast Asia division?

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
He handed in his resignation.

50
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,870
He said he's moving to Australia

51
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,480
with his wife and kid.

52
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,510
So with that position open,

53
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,480
I need someone to fill it.

54
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,200
I looked through the whole company,

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,640
but couldn't find anyone

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,760
with his level of competence.

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,590
In my heart, there's only one person

58
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,150
who carries that kind of weight.

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Guess who?

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,430
Only you

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,750
are fit for the job.

62
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,520
You know,

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,630
the HQ is in Singapore.

64
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,030
You can even get an MBA while working

65
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,000
once you're there.

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,630
That'll be great

67
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,870
for your future career.

68
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,520
But Uncle Xu,

69
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,750
Southeast Asia sales

70
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,470
have been steadily growing

71
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,960
these past few years.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,870
If I'm transferred there,

73
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,910
won't that hurt morale?

74
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,400
No way!

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,750
Everyone in the company knows

76
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,360
you're the top performer.

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,750
Once you're there,

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
they'll be thrilled!

79
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,750
You're the one

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
I trust the most.

81
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,400
Alright then.

82
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,680
I'll go with your plan.

83
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,710
Great.

84
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,150
Please help make the arrangements.

85
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,560
You've always been such an obedient kid.

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,750
I figured he'd come after me,

87
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,120
but I didn't think

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,360
he'd ship me off to Southeast Asia.

89
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,190
Shen Jiahe,

90
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,240
let's see how long

91
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,590
you can keep pretending.

92
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
My dad

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,360
is just clearing the way for his happy life.

94
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,590
Kicking all three of us out

95
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,360
so he could live it up with Bai Xia.

96
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,360
Then why don't you just give him what he wants?

97
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,030
You're the CEO of Yuanfei Group,

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,630
and you're letting him

99
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,750
ship you off to Southeast Asia

100
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,360
without putting up a fight?

101
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,190
What's the point of fighting?

102
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,910
Your dad's the chairman, after all.

103
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,710
Go grab me some corn.

104
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,870
Help me peel it.

105
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,710
Or maybe I should talk to my uncle,

106
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,160
and have him rally the shareholders.

107
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,240
Such a major appointment,

108
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,870
he shouldn't get to decide that alone!

109
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,160
Forget it.

110
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,510
I actually think going to Singapore

111
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,270
might not be so bad.

112
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,270
And I even recommended you

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
as acting CEO.

114
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,720
It's a good opportunity

115
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,680
for you too,

116
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,360
right?

117
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,800
So you really just want to leave?

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,630
Why?

119
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,600
You can't bear to see me go?

120
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,310
Shen Jiahe,

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,950
why are you suddenly fishing

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,430
for sweet talks from me?

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,950
Well then, why not go with the flow

124
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
and say something romantic?

125
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,680
If you leave,

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
I'll go enjoy myself

127
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,870
wherever I want.

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,510
Aren't you afraid

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
I might start a foreign romance?

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,510
If you start one,

131
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,510
I'll start ten.

132
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,120
Alright.

133
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,560
I surrender, okay?

134
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm hopelessly devoted.

135
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,430
There's only room

136
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,430
for you in my heart and eyes.

137
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,310
What is it?

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,190
I was just thinking...

139
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
we just started

140
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,190
getting closer,

141
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,480
and now you're leaving.

142
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,160
Silly,

143
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,360
I'm just going on a business trip,

144
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,480
not vanishing forever.

145
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,800
If you miss me,

146
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,430
just say the word.

147
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,830
I'll fly right back to you.

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
Liar!

149
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,870
You promised you'd never leave me.

150
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,480
Now you're going back on your word!

151
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,560
When did I break my word?

152
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,390
Didn't I say

153
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,830
every time you hit me, I'd kiss you once?

154
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
You hit me three times just now.

155
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
That doesn't count!

156
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,510
How does it not count?

157
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,630
It just doesn't!

158
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,510
Let's put it this way:

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,630
there really are a lot of beautiful women

160
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,680
in Southeast Asia.

161
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,160
Binhai is full of young and talented guys,

162
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,070
not to mention your old rival, Chi Ye.

163
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,830
So many tempting choices.

164
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,120
The one closest gets the prize.

165
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,000
In this life, how many loyal guys

166
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,600
like Shen Jiahe can you really meet?

167
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,510
Nuo is such a fierce girl.

168
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
She finally agreed

169
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,630
to be with you...

170
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,070
One wrong step...

171
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,240
She might become someone else's wife.

172
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
He might show up with a kid years later...

173
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,920
Calling you Uncle,

174
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,750
asking for red envelopes!

175
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,040
In short...

176
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,510
In short...

177
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,600
- Strike while the iron's hot! - Strike while the iron's hot!

178
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,630
- I'm going to propose. - I'm going to propose.

179
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,750
Now that's more like it!

180
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,750
Better early than late!

181
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,120
- But the thing is... - But the thing is...

182
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,750
- how do I even propose? - how do I even propose?

183
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,360
I spent the whole day

184
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,680
racking my brain at work,

185
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,270
and still couldn't come up with anything.

186
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,510
The problem is,

187
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm proposing tomorrow.

188
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,040
But even now,

189
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
I've got nothing.

190
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,630
Classic.

191
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,630
That's so Xu Nuo.

192
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,190
What an early access!

193
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,360
Skipping straight to the finale!

194
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,720
Shen Jiahe

195
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,510
is heading to Singapore next week.

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,720
I really don't want to visit him

197
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,390
while we're still not engaged.

198
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,000
But what if...

199
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,870
what if Shen Jiahe turns you down?

200
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,190
That...

201
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,360
that wasn't part of the plan.

202
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,070
I'll talk to you later, bye!

203
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,750
Bye-bye.

204
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,720
Her phone's burning hot.

205
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,790
You're still pretending to sleep?

206
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,750
Still pretending?

207
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,390
Still faking it?

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,870
Stop that now.

209
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,150
Shen Jiahe,

210
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
tomorrow's the weekend.

211
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,030
Would you go on a date with me?

212
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,550
Sure.

213
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,630
Go to sleep now.

214
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,240
Goodnight.

215
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,750
Goodnight.

216
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,910
Hi there, here's your muffin.

217
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,720
Thanks.

218
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,200
Thank you.

219
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,200
I got this for you.

220
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,390
You've loved blueberry muffin cake

221
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,440
since you were a kid.

222
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
It still tastes the same

223
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
after all these years.

224
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,360
Come on, have a bite.

225
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,550
Thank you.

226
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,000
Jiahe,

227
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,240
happy birthday!

228
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,270
Here's your present.

229
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,000
A small toy car.

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,550
Thank you!

231
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,320
Try it.

232
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,550
Is it good?

233
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,240
It's delicious!

234
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,270
This is honestly

235
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,910
the best cake I've ever had.

236
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,670
Why are you crying?

237
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,630
I miss my mom.

238
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,270
Don't be sad.

239
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,360
From now on, I'm your family.

240
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,750
Is it good?

241
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,910
It tastes just the same.

242
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,630
If you like it, you better finish it all.

243
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,390
Alright.

244
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,600
What are you thinking about?

245
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,360
I was thinking

246
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,630
about the night I came back to the city.

247
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,510
That day might've

248
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,670
been the hardest,

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,150
longest day of my life.

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,240
Who do you think you are?

251
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,200
Who are you to care about me?

252
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,750
Who do you think I am?

253
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,480
A brother?

254
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,960
Or your first love?

255
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,030
Your exact words were

256
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
"You're just a foster child

257
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
who was abandoned and living

258
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,200
in someone else's house".

259
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,790
Dad?

260
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,910
Xu Nuo.

261
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,480
I have nothing to lose,

262
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,750
so I wanted you to experience

263
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,360
what it's like to have your family torn apart.

264
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,440
How's that?

265
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,960
Satisfied?

266
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,480
You must've really hated me back then.

267
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
Looking back now...

268
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,000
maybe hate was just another form of love.

269
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,390
Nuo,

270
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,240
don't worry.

271
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,960
I won't let you regret this.

272
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,150
You...

273
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,910
you finished it all?

274
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,200
Didn't you tell me to eat it all?

275
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,630
Then...

276
00:13:59,390 --> 00:13:59,840
then...

277
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,960
then do you feel

278
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,600
anything strange?

279
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,240
No.

280
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,000
Why?

281
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't tell me

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,240
he swallowed the ring!

283
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,320
What do we do now?

284
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,750
Thank you, my love!

285
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,750
You finally proposed to me!

286
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,630
- Marry him! - Marry him!

287
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,510
- Say yes! - Say yes!

288
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,270
Marry him!

289
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,150
Sweetheart.

290
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,790
- Congrats! - Congrats!

291
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,240
Jiahe,

292
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm heading to the restroom.

293
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,630
Alright, go ahead.

294
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,360
I'll wait right here.

295
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,840
Here's your ring.

296
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,600
Sorry, it was our mistake.

297
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,670
No worries.

298
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,440
As long as it's not lost.

299
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,080
Where is he?

300
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,080
How did he disappear so quickly?

301
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,440
I've been looking forever,

302
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,670
and still no sign of him...

303
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,760
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

304
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:10,680
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

305
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,660
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
