I solemnly apologize to you.

How about my father?

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,680
I want you to tell me

so can you

Bai Xia was living a very downtrodden life

98
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,270
before she met your father,

99
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,870

100
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,000

From Shen Jiahe.

103
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,360
You've always suspected

104
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,680
that Bai Xia

105
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,600
was an undercover agent

Shen Jiahe planted on Uncle Xu's side,

107
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,000

112

120

125

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,960
to a high-end private hospital.

196
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,840
He said we could do it there.

197
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,790
The staff there gives better services.

198
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,910
Let's go there together tomorrow.

199
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
You've always suspected

200
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,480
that Bai Xia was an undercover agent.

201
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,200
Shen Jiahe planted on Uncle Xu's side,

202
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,390
so now,

203
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
it seems possible.

204
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
If Shen Jiahe

205
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,390
really teamed up with Bai Xia to frame my dad,

206
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,790
then he did it this time too.

207
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,510
If it's true that he was trying

208
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,910
to fight for my mom like he said before,

209
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,510
then why did he lie?

210
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,550
Nuo, have some coffee.

211
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,030
What's wrong? What are you thinking?

212
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm wondering

213
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,790
if you'll lie to me.

214
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,670
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,790
Because we're getting married soon,

216
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,360
and I'm a little afraid of marriage.

217
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,000
Nuo.

218
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,270
Actually, a lot of people are afraid of marriage

219
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
because they're afraid that it'll change them

220
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,030
and that they won't fit in with their spouse,

221
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,870
but we've

222
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,840
always been together

223
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,960
and family,

224
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,790
so what are we afraid of?

225
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,960
I'm just afraid

226
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
that one day you'll get mad

227
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,150
and kick me out of the house.

228
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,790
That's up to your obedience.

229
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,750
Yes,

230
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,600
ma'am.

231
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,240
Are we going to the movies

232
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,790
or shopping later?

233
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm going to the factory later.

234
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,750
You're so busy

235
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,550
that you can only find time

236
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,840
to date your boyfriend.

237
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,320
You're too busy.

238
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Come with me.

239
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,440
Okay.

240
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,030
Then

241
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,790
I'll reluctantly

242
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,000
be your chauffeur today.

243
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,720
Let's go.

244
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
Safety norms should still be taken seriously.

245
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,510
Yes.

246
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,150
Otherwise, that could lead

247
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,270
to worse safety incidents.

248
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,840
We'll put together

249
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,750
a whole safety management program.

250
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,720
Later, I'll send it

251
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,240
to you by e-mail.

252
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:40,910
Okay.

253
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,750
Chairman Xu, Mr. Shen.

254
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Any other instructions?

255
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,750
Ask Chairman Xu.

256
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,480
No.

257
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,240
Let me take a stroll.

258
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,000
Okay, Chairman Xu.

259
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,870
You're becoming

260
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,720
more and more of a boss.

261
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,440
I spent a couple of nights

262
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,790
going through the company's

263
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,670
current projects.

264
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,750
It's still a mess.

265
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,150
I was not so convinced in you,

266
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,600
but now, I realize

267
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,440
how much pressure

268
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,360
you were carrying.

269
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,910
This kind of work is not

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,550
for ordinary people.

271
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,320
Don't worry.

272
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,240
I'm here. Don't worry.

273
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,910
Hello.

274
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,030
Is that your car

275
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,750
parked out front?

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,510
Yes.

277
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,240
Can you park it somewhere else?

278
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,510
Our van can't get in.

279
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,120
Okay.

280
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,510
Okay. Thank you.

281
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,960
I'll move my car.

282
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,790
Chairman Xu, be careful.

283
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,270
Nuo.

284
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,630
Nuo.

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,790
Nuo.

286
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,550
Nuo.

287
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,110
You scared me.

288
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,270
I'm fine.

289
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,640
I really can't leave you alone

290
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,030
even for a second.

291
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,210
Okay.

292
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,400
Then I'll hang myself on you later,

293
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,130
okay?

294
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,200
What a fuss.

295
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,370
How can anything happen

296
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,530
to the chairman of Yuanfei Group?

297
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,570
If something happens to you, what about Yuanfei Group?

298
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,920
There's still you, right?

299
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,510
Yuanfei Group needs you,

300
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,380
and so do I.

301
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,860
By the way,

302
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,380
I got Aunt Rong's share transfer

303
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,270
for you.

304
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,620
Really?

305
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,100
My dad's willing to transfer that?

306
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,060
I'll do what I

307
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,060
promised you.

308
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,300
Thank you.

309
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,580
Shen Jiahe.

310
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,820
You're welcome,

311
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,910
my

312
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
dear wife.

313
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,910
Let's go.

314
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,230
Maybe he did work

315
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,510
with Bai Xia,

316
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,140
but at least now,

317
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,710
he's all for me.

318
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,620
Shen Jiahe.

319
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,100
I choose to believe you this time.

320
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,130
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

321
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:43,040
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

322
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,010
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
