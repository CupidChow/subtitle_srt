00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,310
opened a casino for you,

186

Why don't you tell the truth?

Sit down.

194
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you.

195
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,520
I've known all about it.

196
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,760
Don't talk nonsense.

197
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,070
I didn't say anything.

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,000
I didn't say anything.

199
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,910
Yuanfei's market share

200
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,710
[Yuanfei Harbour City]
has dropped significantly

201
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,360
in the last six months.

202
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,900
[Yuanfei Group Board Meeting]

203
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,760
The market is constantly changing,

204
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,360
so we can all understand that,

205
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,640
but

206
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,480
at this critical time,

207
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,190
we must have someone

208
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,070
at the helm with both experience

209
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,830
and vigor.

210
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,360
Jia.

211
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,400
You're wrong.

212
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,550
I'm not saying

213
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,830
Miss Xu is doing a bad job.

214
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,430
I know we all want

215
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,240
what's best for the group.

216
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,160
Xu Nuo has just come on board,

217
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,590
and the projects she's taken on

218
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,160
haven't come to fruition yet.

219
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,880
What's in this report

220
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,640
you're looking at?

221
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,520
It's all old results

222
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,120
from Mr. Xu.

223
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,480
We can't put it all

224
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,590
on Xu Nuo.

225
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,040
I said

226
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,760
I didn't criticize Miss Xu.

227
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,160
I agree

228
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,040
with what Mr. Su said,

229
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,120
but

230
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,760
right now,

231
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,830
Miss Xu's mother is sick in bed,

232
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,280
so it's hard for her to balance

233
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,000
her career and her family.

234
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,310
I won't let my family

235
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,430
affect my work.

236
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,550
But after all, your influence in Yuanfei

237
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,430
is limited.

238
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,830
In these crucial times,

239
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,160
we still need

240
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,590
a leader who can

241
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,160
calm everyone down.

242
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,240
Her influence is limited?

243
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,430
What do you mean?

244
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,520
Are you looking down

245
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,430
on me?

246
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,670
Mr. Su.

247
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,550
This is not the time for you to defend her.

248
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,040
How about this?

249
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,240
Since this is a shareholders' meeting,

250
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,710
let's vote by a show of hands.

251
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,310
Raise your hand if you agree

252
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,000
to Mr. Shen as CEO.

253
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,190
I don't agree.

254
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,910
Even if the board replaces Miss Xu,

255
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,280
I won't be CEO.

256
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,000
Xu Mingli.

257
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,480
You were framed by Chi Hao,

258
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,040
and Nuo almost lost her life for you,

259
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,430
but now, you're twisting the knife.

260
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,520
Do you have a conscience?

261
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,550
Why do your words

262
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,590
sound so harsh?

263
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,160
Twisting the knife?

264
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,190
It was the board's opinion.

265
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,790
I was just going with the flow.

266
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,550
Stop pretending, okay?

267
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,190
Those directors

268
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,070
don't even read the financial reports,

269
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,520
so would they suddenly

270
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,760
propose the chairman's removal?

271
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,910
I raised Nuo

272
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,950
for so many years,

273
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,790
so can I have no love

274
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,640
for her?

275
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,670
But who are you?

276
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,310
You're my own son.

277
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,830
I was worried that Nuo

278
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,880
would turn against you if you fell out.

279
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,670
That's not necessary.

280
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,480
Mind your own business.

281
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,830
Mind your own business.

282
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,280
Don't get Yuanfei involved

283
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,360
in the Chi family's revenge.

284
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you understand?

285
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:23,880
Nuo.

286
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,880
Do you have time tonight?

287
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,550
Let's have dinner together.

288
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,000
I have something to tell you.

289
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,310
But I don't want to talk to you.

290
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,190
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,520
I didn't know Xu Mingli

292
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,240
would do this.

293
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,280
People in the workplace seek their own interests.

294
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,550
I'll take what you did today

295
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,880
as your reward for saving you

296
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,040
by mistake the other day.

297
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,590
It wasn't a coincidence that day.

298
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,000
You saved me on purpose,

299
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,640
didn't you?

300
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,830
What are you trying to say?

302
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:02,950
Nuo.

303
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,910
Do you know Chi Ye

304
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,070
