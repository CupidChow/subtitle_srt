Do you remember

39
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,890
when we were in high school?

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,020
My family was poor.

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,820
We were deep in debt.

43

there was a financial aid program at school.

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,610

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,140
and bullied me,

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,540
I really hated you.

52
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,890
You thought I spread the word?

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,330
I used to think so.

54

Now I know...

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,730
you wouldn't stoop

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,820
to something like that.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,700
Then why were you always against me?

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,580
Because of Shen Jiahe.

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,050
and folded it neatly.

65
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,580
Curious, I looked up

66
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,860
the price of that coat online.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,420

while I was born to serve?

75
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,770
Don't you think you hated the wrong person?

76
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,140
I knew you wouldn't understand.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,330

78
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,300

Because in my world,

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,700
there's no such thing as right or wrong.

82
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,500
You had the freedom

83
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,380
to follow your heart,

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,740
and no need to worry

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,820
about gains or losses.

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,060
But I had to numb myself

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,260
just to survive,

88
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,970
going against what I really wanted.

89
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,020
I kept telling myself,

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,140
all this ugliness,

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,090

92
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,290

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,970
It's all so that one day,

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,620
I can live with pride.

95
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,580
My kindness and dignity,

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,140
just like my whole life,

97
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,060
are worth nothing.

98
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,380

100
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,500
Yeah.

101
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,140
But when you realize

102
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,970
the person you envied

103
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,380
is even more pathetic than you,

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,700
all you have left is pity.

105
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,290
Right?

106
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,620
What do you mean?

107
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,530
The reason

108
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,740
Shen Jiahe can't marry you

109
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,180
is because he's actually

110
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,020
Xu Mingli's biological son.

111
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,450
What...

112
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,060
How is that even possible?

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,620
Xu Mingli said it himself

114
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,740
when he was drunk.

115
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,060
So that means

116
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,140
you and Shen Jiahe

117
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,290
are half-siblings.

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,330
Does he know about this?

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,290
I told him

120
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,210
on your wedding day.

121
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,330
He went and got a DNA test.

122
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,450
Xu Mingli admitted it himself.

123
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,090
But judging by how you two are now

124
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,890
completely at odds,

125
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,770
he's probably, like before,

126
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,820
trying to push you away

127
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,500
in such an extreme way,

128
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,410
so you wouldn't be hurt.

129
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,500
Bai Xia...

130
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,700
thank you.

131

132
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,210
Nuo.

133
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,330
What are you doing here?

134
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,290
I...

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,650
I just...

136

Don't act now, not at a time like this.

When my mom was awake,

139
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,740
you didn't seem sorry.

140
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,620
And now you're suddenly feeling guilty?

141
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,290

142
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,620

143
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,770

147
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,260
And don't come bothering

148
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,940

149
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,290
I said leave!

150
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,620
Didn't you hear me?

151
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,700
I... you...

152
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,500

153
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,530
Fine.

154
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,500

Of course your dad's protecting her.

157
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,330
After all, she's carrying

158
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,970
his own flesh and blood.

159
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,940
Don't I count

160
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,290
as his own blood?

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,260
No, you don't.

162
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,410
I...

163
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,930
I'm not my dad's biological child?

164
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,980
Back then,

165
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,890
I hadn't been with your birth father

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,140
for long

167
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,500
before he died in an accident.

168
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,620
I was still pregnant with you.

169
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,100
Your grandma refused

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,050
to accept a child born out of wedlock.

171
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,810
She thought it would disgrace the Su family.

172
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,930
So...

173
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,500
to keep you,

174
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,650
I had to find someone to marry right away.

175
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,220
Xu Mingli's family

176
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,020
wasn't well off back then,

177
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,650
but he

178
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,050
was quite ambitious

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,890
and treated me okay.

180
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,930
So we got married.

181
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,340
Later on,

182
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,530
because of my health condition,

183
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,810
I couldn't have any more children.

184
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,220
So he probably minded that.

185
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,220
Which means...

186
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,770
he married you

187
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,650
just to climb up the social ladder with the Su family?

188
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,860
No wonder once he was established,

189
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,500
he divorced you right away.

190
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,460
What's past

191
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,140
is in the past.

192
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,100
We all have to move forward.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,410
Originally, we agreed

194
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,500
to keep it from you forever.

195
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,890
I transferred the shares to him,

196
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,380
and he promised

197
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,170
he'd take responsibility for you like a father should.

198
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,930
But now look

199
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,340
how he's treating you.

200
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,930
Seeing you this heartbroken,

201
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,890
I felt...

202
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,460
there's no point in hiding it anymore.

203
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,930
Since he's so heartless...

204
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,340
we might as well...

205
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,570
stop calling him your father.

206
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,140
Mom...

207
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,460
I'm not Xu Mingli's real daughter,

208
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,980
but he is Xu Mingli's real son?

209
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,460
That's just insane.

210
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,570
All this time,

211
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,050
you thought he divorced you

212
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,340
because you couldn't have kids,

213
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,530
but the truth is, he already had one.

214
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,460
How else would Shen Jiahe exist?

215
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,170
Mom,

216
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,690
tell me...

217
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,140
how did it come to this between me and him?

218
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,290
Should I blame Xu Mingli,

219
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,860
or should I blame him?

220
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,650
I'm calling off our wedding.

221
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,810
Or should I blame Shen Jiahe?

222
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,620
If he didn't always

223
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,170
keep everything from me,

224
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,890
we wouldn't have had

225
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,860
so many misunderstandings.

226
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,980
I figured you'd be here.

227
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,290
Hungry?

228
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,890
Look what I got you,

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,570
something yummy.

230
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,530
Thanks.

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,740
Nuo,

232
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,980
are you okay?

233
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,290
Nuo,

234
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,930
Aunt Rong will definitely wake up.

235
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,100
But you, on the other hand,

236
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,650
have been running

237
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,220
between home and work these past few days.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,100
You're about to collapse.

239
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,050
I'm fine.

240
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,380
The weather forecast says

241
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,100
it'll rain tonight.

242
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,340
Usually,

243
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,770
sunrises after rain

244
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,620
are especially beautiful.

245
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,290
Want to go see it together?

246
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,100
Better not.

247
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,410
Sometimes you need

248
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,380
to give yourself a break.

249
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,740
Not only does it relieve stress,

250
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,100
it might even

251
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,690
help you find the answer in your heart.

252
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,930
Let's go tomorrow.

253
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,170
All right.

254
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,810
Have something sweet.

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,170
There's half a million here

256
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,570
for my granddaughter.

257
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,980
Where did you get all this money?

258
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,290
As long as you've got money to spend,

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,100
why do you care where I got it?

260
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,340
Xia,

261
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,690
I've paid off

262
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,740
everything I owed you.

263
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,460
You didn't gamble again, did you?

264
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,810
Relax.

265
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,100
From now on,

266
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,650
I won't gamble ever again.

267
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,380
If you don't tell me where the money came from,

268
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,100
I can't spend it in peace.

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,500
What's there to worry about?

270
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,650
I didn't steal, rob,

271
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,650
or lie.

272
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,410
This is heaven

273
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,770
paying me back.

274
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,380
All right.

275
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,650
For now,

276
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,930
I'll take the money.

277
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,620
But in the future,

278
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,020
keep your own money.

279
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,530
Don't worry

280
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,460
about Yuan's surgery fees.

281
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,020
Xu Nuo's foundation

282
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,810
helped me a lot.

283
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,890
You mean

284
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,100
Xu Mingli's daughter, Xu Nuo?

285
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,650
Right.

286
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,890
What's wrong?

287
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,220
No...

288
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,570
Nothing.

289
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,130
Why does he look so familiar?

290
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,660
Could that be Lin Yi?

291
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,420
It's been so many years.

292
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,530
He should be about that age now.

293
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,370
Xu Nuo?

294
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,770
So, he really managed

295
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,370
to latch onto the Yuanfei Group's heiress.

296
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,420
That guy's got luck on his side.

297
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,180
Lin Yi!

298
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:06,130
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

299
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:15,020
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

300
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,030
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
