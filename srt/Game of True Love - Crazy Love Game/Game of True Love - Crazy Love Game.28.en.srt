00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,960
Nuo,

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,280
do you remember

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,520
what you once said?

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,880
If the one you love

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,150
proposes to you in front of a church,

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,310
you'd definitely say yes.

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,950
Will you marry me?

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,870
So romantic

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,200
and so solemn!

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,430
If one day, the man I love

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,870
proposes to me at a church,

I'll definitely say yes.

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,760
Of course.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,310

we're both adults.

102

They may not be siblings by blood,

169
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,390
but they grew up like siblings!

170

from me?

179
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,510
Me?

180
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,750
What could I possibly be hiding?

181
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm just worried

182
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,030
people will talk about our family.

183
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Fine.

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,390
You can't let your grudge against me

193
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,670
cloud your judgment

194
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,360
and ruin the kids' future

195
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,390
and happiness!

196
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,150
Don't flatter yourself!

197
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,910
Who said I'm doing this to spite you?

198
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,840
Get out of the way!

199
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,720
Those two

200
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,480
really can't be together!

201
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,150
Step aside!

202
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,390
Mom,

203
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,750
Nuo and I

204
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,910
grew up together.

205
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,270
We know each other well and trust each other.

206
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,870
So we've decided

207
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,720
to get married soon.

208
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,630
Get married?

209
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,120
No!

210
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
No marriage!

211
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,480
Don't get married!

212
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,240
No way!

213
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,910
Mom.

214
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:23,960
It can't happen!

215
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,550
Mom...

216
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,670
Aunt Fen.

217
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,480
- What's wrong, Mom? - Aunt Fen.

218
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,320
No!

219
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,670
Aunt Fen.

220
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,550
- Okay. - No!

221
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,670
- It's alright. - No wedding!

222
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,240
It can't happen!

223
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,840
It's okay.

224
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,870
No wedding.

225
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,200
No marriage!

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,030
It's alright, Mom.

227
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,030
It's okay.

228
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,550
No wedding!

229
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,840
No wedding!

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,720
It's over now,

231
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,270
Mom.

232
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
That didn't scare you too much, right?

233
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,870
I'll head back by myself.

234
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,790
You can stay and take care of Aunt Fen.

235
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,480
Ao Zhe's car should be here soon.

236
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,600
Has she ever been like this before?

237
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,550
She's had emotional moments,

238
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,550
but never this bad.

239
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,200
Just now,

240
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,200
it really seemed

241
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,390
like she didn't want us to get married.

242
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,670
Don't overthink it.

243
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,080
With Aunt Fen like this,

244
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,510
can you really feel at ease going to Singapore?

245
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,960
I'll come back to visit you two often.

246
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,670
Besides,

247
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,120
you'll still be here, won't you?

248
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,840
Jiahe,

249
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,150
in the past,

250
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,840
I said a lot of things that hurt you

251
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,150
and did things

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,550
that upset you.

253
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,000
I was hoping

254
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,320
now that we're finally together,

255
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,240
I could make it up to you.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,480
But now, you're being transferred again.

257
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,910
Who knows how long till we meet again?

258
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,080
I'm a little worried...

259
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,630
Worried about what?

260
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,790
You were overseas for so many years,

261
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
but my feelings for you

262
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,600
never changed.

263
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,790
What are you worried about?

264
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,600
Don't worry.

265
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
I'll come back as soon as I can.

266
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,600
I believe you.

267
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,240
Then you have to promise me,

268
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,080
that no matter how many uncertainties

269
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,120
we face in the future,

270
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,910
we'll always be honest with each other.

271
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,360
Alright.

272
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,790
I promise.

273
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,480
No need to worry.

274
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,220
[Six months later]

275
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,860
[Xiamei Skincare Club]

276
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,320
Unbelievable!

277
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,320
Blank Capital is suing us?

278
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,440
Even if they're the investor,

279
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,550
they can't just go back on their word!

280
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,870
What's their excuse?

281
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,630
They're accusing us

282
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,670
of commercial fraud.

283
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,360
And they somehow knew

284
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,030
we pulled the funds

285
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,480
from somewhere else.

286
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,790
It must've been last month's

287
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,360
huge spending that made them suspicious.

288
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,790
It's all Xu Mingli's fault!

289
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,120
He rushed to pull the money out.

290
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,480
We already poured a ton

291
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,440
into those downtown storefronts

292
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,080
we rented.

293
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,510
And it's all prepaid annually.

294
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,390
Plus renovations, equipment,

295
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,720
and staff training expenses.

296
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
If Blank Capital really pulls out now,

297
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,550
then we're completely...

298
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,750
We're done for.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,120
Are you seriously trying

300
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,790
to burn through half my assets?

301
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,360
You're pregnant.

302
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,150
Just stay home and rest properly!

303
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
Why are you out there

304
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,910
raising funds

305
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,870
and opening shops?

306
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,150
Can't you wait

307
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,150
until after the baby's born?

308
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,840
Just six months ago, you were praising me

309
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,550
for securing Blank Capital's investment.

310
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,550
Now all of a sudden you're changing your tune?

311
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,440
Alright.

312
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't get upset.

313
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,000
You're already nine months along.

314
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,960
The baby's almost here.

315
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,480
You can't keep losing your temper like this.

316
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,360
It's bad for the baby.

317
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,750
If it weren't for you

318
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,840
pulling out the cash so recklessly,

319
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,120
we wouldn't be getting sued.

320
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
So now what?

321
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,150
You'd better return the money,

322
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,840
and come up with some excuse to smooth it over!

323
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
You want me to fix this?

324
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,750
What are you even doing?

325
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
Why every time something goes wrong,

326
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,510
I'm the one cleaning up the mess?

327
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,480
Why can't you

328
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,000
do a little self-reflection for once?

329
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,200
Self-reflection?

330
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,000
Haven't I done enough?

331
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
You were out having fun during my pregnancy,

332
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,790
and I didn't say a word.

333
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,840
Xu Mingli,

334
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
you said

335
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,640
you'd take care of everything.

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,480
That's why I agreed

337
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,720
- to have this child! - Enough!

338
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,750
Now you're trying to walk away from it all?

339
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,590
Hello?

340
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,160
Mr. Xu, I found something.

341
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,640
The capital behind Blank Capital

342
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,070
may be linked to SJ.

343
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,480
What?

344
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't tell me it's Chi Hao again!

345
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,640
Such a pain in the ass.

346
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,680
Alright.

347
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,790
Gather every pending payment project

348
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,680
from Yuanfei Group

349
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,830
and send them all to me.

350
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,680
ASAP.

351
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,640
Understood, Mr. Xu.

352
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
No matter what,

353
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,920
I have to fill in that investment from Blank Capital.

354
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,310
Otherwise, Chi Hao will definitely

355
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,590
use this to charge me with fraud.
