[Episode 50]

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,180
What happened?

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,220
What happened?

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,120
Why are you soaking wet?

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,710
Come inside.

16
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,270
Sorry.

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,880
I was at dinner with a client.

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,830
I had my phone on mute.

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,960
Then the battery died.

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,990
Dandan told me

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,320
you waited a long time.

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,600
It's fine.

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,960
What happened?

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,960
Why are you drenched like this?

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,630
Nuo,

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,270
are you free tomorrow

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,270
to go on a date with me?

28
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,160
Aren't you going to ask me why?

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,470
Why?

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,680
Because tomorrow,

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,520
I have a date with my fiancé.

32
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,080
Alright.

33
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,710
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

34
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,400
Now go home.

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,360
Don't catch a cold.

37
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:39,870
Okay.

38
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,800
I'll go now.

39
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,640
You should've given me a heads-up.

40
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,520
I had no idea

41
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,680
he was already at Yuanfei

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,080
when he called me.

43
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,430
Why is this umbrella here?

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,360
What's wrong?

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,080
He took it from Shen Jiahe's

46
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,520
place.

47
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,990
It's mine.

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,150
So?

49
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,680
Chi Ye knows

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,870
I was at Shen Jiahe's house.

51
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,920
What do we do?

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,240
Now that he knows you lied,

53
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,750
will he do anything to you?

54
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,120
I don't know.

55
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,590
You shouldn't go on that date tomorrow.

56
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,030
It's too risky.

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,080
Let me think.

58
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,680
Let me think.

59
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,480
When you see that umbrella,

60
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,280
when you learn

61
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,600
about all the terrible things I've done,

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,870
will you still stay with me?

63
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,240
Do you remember that time

64
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,550
we ran laps together in high school?

65
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,310
Yeah.

66
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,510
You got beaten up by Chi Hao

67
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,390
and were feeling down,

68
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,870
so I dragged you out for a run.

69
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,630
You even tripped and fell.

70
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,190
Thinking back,

71
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,390
I wasn't exactly kind.

72
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,360
When I showered later,

73
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,800
I looked at all the bruises on my body.

74
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,680
I couldn't even tell

75
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,550
which ones were from the fight

76
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,680
and which were from the fall.

77
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,240
But at least the pain

78
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,630
helped numb everything else.

79
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,550
Since then,

80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,750
whenever I feel down,

81
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,310
I come here to run.

82
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,870
Do you still run?

83
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,720
Sometimes.

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,920
Then will you

85
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,990
run with me one more time?

86
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,550
Sure.

87
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,800
Let's go.

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,990

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,720

Come on!

watching you run ahead of me,

00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,920

now it's your turn

113
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,280

Chi Ye,

122
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,750
I once had a friend

123
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,910
who was sincere

124
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,360
and kind.

125
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,870
I thought we'd be

126
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,080
friends for life.

127
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,670
But then

128
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,270
I realized everything about him

129
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,670
came with an agenda.

130
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,870
Worst of all,

131
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,750
he hurt my family.

132
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,120
He put my mother in this bed.

133
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,120
And yet, I still remember

134
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,630
how good he was to me.

135
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,270
All those memories from our youth

136
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,320
felt real too.

137
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,510
So,

138
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,270
I want to ask him,

139
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,870
which version of him is real?

140
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,440
So you know everything.

141
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,910
Stop,

It's already too late.

People who made mistakes

145
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,840

146
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,200
And what about the innocent people caught in the crossfire?

147
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,560
Why should they suffer?

148

Fine.

152
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,480
One last question.

153
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,320
Was there

154
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,870

157
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,510
Never.

158
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,120
I knew from the start

159
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,990
that Chi Ye wouldn't let go that easily.

160

Hatred is

like a fire.

163
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,790
Once it starts, it burns out of control

164
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,390
and drives you crazy.

165
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,560
By the time you realize it,

166
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,560
you're already lost in the abyss.

167
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,360
Is spending your whole life on revenge

168
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,390
really worth it?

169
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,200
It took me a long time to understand

170
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,440
that hatred can never

171
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,360
end hatred.

172
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,560
Only love and forgiveness can.

Why are you doing this to me?

Why?

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,240
If you never loved me,

196
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,150
why did you give me hope?

197
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,910
Was it just to mock me?

198
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,200
Fine.

199
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,790
If that's how it is,

200
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,430
then I'll take you all down with me.

201
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,710
Hello?

202
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,230
Pull the trigger

203
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,040
on the scooter factory deal.

204
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,720
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

205
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:07,530
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

206
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,330
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
