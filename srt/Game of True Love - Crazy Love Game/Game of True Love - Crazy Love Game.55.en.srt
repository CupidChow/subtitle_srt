197
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,730
I'm not going abroad.

198
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,450
I'll just study here

199
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,540
so I can be with you.

200
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,780
Really?

201
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,090
Nuo!

202
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,660
You're awake!

203
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,900
Where am I?

204
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,180
Nuo,

205
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,210
you're finally awake.

206
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,570
You were in a coma for so long.

207
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,780
Nuo,

208
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,940
do you know

209
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,540
how important you mean to me?

210
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,660
Chi Ye, watch out!

211
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,970
Grab my hand!

212
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,450
You were...

213
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,940
Chi Ye!

214
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,350
Chi Ye!

215
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,060
You were the light

216
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,940
- in my dark life. - Chi Ye...

217
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,610
Hold on to me!

218
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,930
Don't let go!

219
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,970
Chi Ye!

220
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,480
Chi Ye!

221
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,780
It's okay.

222
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,330
It's all over now.

223
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,420
Where's Shen Jiahe?

224
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,570
Shen Jiahe?

225
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,060
He just stepped out to grab something.

226
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,330
And you woke up the moment he left.

227
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,660
So what now?

228
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,380
Want me to pass out again?

229
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,780
Jiahe,

230
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,420
I want to go see her with you.

231
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,610
No need.

232
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,180
I'll take these flowers in for you.

233
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,610
She's still not awake?

234
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,970
This is...

235
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,850
This is for Nuo from the heiress

236
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,490
of Shenghong Technology.

237
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,380
Shenghong Technology?

238
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,690
Wasn't that the girl

239
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,940
you danced with last time?

240
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,140
She's just trying to get close to you.

241
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,610
Shen Jiahe,

242
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,730
it's been so long,

243
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,900
and you two are still keeping in touch?

244
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,810
She wanted to come see Nuo herself.

245
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,090
But I was afraid

246
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,260
that if Nuo woke up and saw her,

247
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,490
she'd get jealous again.

248
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,940
So I told her not to come.

249
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,260
Calling me jealous, huh?

250
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,660
Just you wait.

251
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,210
Nuo's hand moved!

252
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,810
Nuo?

253
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,690
Nuo, you're awake?

254
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,060
You are...?

255
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm...

256
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,260
Nuo, what's wrong?

257
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,570
It's me, Jiahe.

258
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,780
Jiahe?

259
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,380
Are you still faking...?

260
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,770
Oh no...

261
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,140
Maybe she lost her memory?

262
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,490
Lost...

263
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,260
Lost memory?

264
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,450
Lack of oxygen to the brain

265
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,180
can cause memory loss.

266
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,610
But Miss Xu's

267
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,970
test results

268
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,180
are all normal.

269
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,610
Then why would she lose her memory?

270
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,660
It could be extreme stress

271
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,730
leading to...

272
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,570
neurological issues.

273
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,450
But honestly,

274
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,540
it's quite rare.

275
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,900
Before she passed out,

276
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,180
she was really anxious and scared.

277
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,780
But...

278
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,540
that shouldn't have been enough

279
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,300
to cause neurological damage.

280
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,020
Maybe...

281
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,570
Are you still faking...?

282
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,090
Oh no...

283
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,570
Maybe...

284
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,060
she lost her memory?

285
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,810
This is our home.

286
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,690
Our home?

287
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,450
Yeah!

288
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,380
We're already married.

289
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,490
Making stuff up just because I "lost my memory"?

290
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,610
Nice one,

291
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,420
Shen Jiahe.

292
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,300
Married?

293
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,960
[Happiness]

294
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,540
Look,

295
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,300
this is our wedding room.

296
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,780
This is clearly

297
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,810
my own bedroom.

298
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,660
Wedding room, huh?

299
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,940
Is that our wedding photo?

300
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,140
What do you think?

301
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,860
Looks good?

302
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,970
Not bad, actually.

303
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,690
Hey, what are you doing?

304
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,180
Helping you take off your coat.

305
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,490
I lost my memory, not my mind.

306
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,970
I can handle simple things.

307
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,580
Isn't your arm

308
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,490
still injured?

309
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,140
The best way to treat memory loss

310
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,660
is to do more of the things

311
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,770
you used to do.

312
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,900
So later,

313
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,620
let's cook together?

314
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,450
I used to...

315
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,250
cook?

316
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,180
Well, not exactly.

317
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,250
You just...

318
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,180
helped out a bit.

319
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,730
And gave me encouragement

320
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,660
with your actions.

321
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,490
"Encouragement," huh?

322
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,970
Shen Jiahe,

323
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,420
you're really something.

324
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,010
Then tell me,

325
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,660
how exactly did I

326
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,580
give you encouragement

327
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,580
with my actions?

328
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,730
Like this.

329
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,180
Shen Jiahe,

330
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,210
I wanted you to chase me for real,

331
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,050
but somehow you're getting all the perks!

332
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,660
This won't do.

333
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,970
I need to take back the upper hand.

334
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,580
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

335
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:43,540
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

336
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,210
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
