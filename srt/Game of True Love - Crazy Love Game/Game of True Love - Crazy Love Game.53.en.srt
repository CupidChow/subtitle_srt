Dad.

13
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,530
I got a 95

14
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,220

He's the only one

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,980
who got a 100 in our whole school.

Okay.

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,090
Xu Mingli, you are selfish.

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,500
From the time I was a child until now,

39
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,530
all these years,

40
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,530
you've been afraid to recognize me.

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,570
You dare not take responsibility

42
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,090
for the mistakes you made

43
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,460
because you're afraid

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,020
of losing everything the Su family has given you.

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,650

No matter what,

I'm the father who raised you.

49
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,090
How dare you say that?

50
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,330
Hello?

51
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,370
Listen to me.

You promised me

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,300
that if I turned myself in,

56
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,420
you'd let Jiahe go,

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,740
right?

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,770

give you my shares,

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,660
okay?

Don't worry about it.

72

And as for your share,

73
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,660
you can keep it to buy yourself a coffin.

Even though I forced your father

76
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,300
to go down this path,

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,010
now my career is gone,

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,980
my family is ruined,

79
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,300
and I'm in jail,

80
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,890
so what more do you want from me now?

81
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,300
It's certainly not enough.

82
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,810
The price you have paid

83
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,940
is nothing compared

84
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,250
to what I've lost.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,370
Sometimes, I don't understand

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,540
why there are fathers

87
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,890
like you in the world.

88
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,980
I thought all the fathers in the world

89
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,250
were like my dad,

90
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,570
but he died

91
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,250
while you lived well,

92
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,130
so there is no such thing

93
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,860
as heavenly punishment in this world.

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,370
Evil people

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,770
still need to be punished by evil people.

96
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,100
There you are.

97
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,330
Mr. Chi started layoffs as soon as

98
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,250
he joined Yuenfei.

Mr. Shen and Mr. Xu's men

100
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,770
were all fired.

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,570
He laid off half the people in one setting,

102
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,620
so the severance package alone

103
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,660
would be a large sum of money.

104
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,940
What about you?

105
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,010
I came to get the separation certificate.

Mr. Chi, that's a good move.

112
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,740
From now on, I'll be the chairman,

113
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,570
and you'll be the CEO of Yuanfei.

114
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,210
Don't worry.

115
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,540

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,570

Those who hurt us

124
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,020
will pay.

125
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,300
I did it.

126
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,900
Jiahe.

127
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,260
Are you okay?

128
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,210
Yes.

129
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,540
By the way,

130
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,660
Zhang Lihui's health condition

131
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,540
couldn't make her capable of committing crimes,

132
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,020
so regarding Chi Hao's death,

133
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,330
the police started

134
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:02,970
to investigate Chi Ye.

135
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,450
I'm also hiring a lawyer to investigate

136
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,210
whether Chi Ye's acquisition of the stake was legal,

137
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,380
and Chi Hao's former assistant

138
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,780
has given me some clues.

139
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,330
We can join hands with other shareholders

140
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,420
and hold a board meeting

141
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,090
to fight against Chi Ye.

142
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,570
Chi Ye's goal

143
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,060
was never to get Yuanfei

144
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,090
but to get back at the Xu family.

145
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,300
He doesn't care what happens

146
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,570
to Yuanfei when he's mad,

147
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,450
so we can't do it the hard way.

148
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,730
And Jiang Tian.

149
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,970
What about him?

150
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,610
The police are still looking for him

151
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,090
but haven't found him yet.

152
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,300
He's probably being hidden

153
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,140
by Chi Ye.

154
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,210
After all, only he

155
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,540
knows the whole story.

156
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,690
Only if we find him

157
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,060
can we clear Yuanfei's name.

158
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,610
Now,

159
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,970
Yuanfei's reputation and stock price

160
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,210
have all hit rock bottom.

161
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,730
It's not far from bankruptcy and liquidation.

162
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,260
Hello?

163
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,610
Xu Nuo.

164
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,940
Let's meet.

165
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,940
Where?

166
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,020
Xu Mingli told me before he turned himself in

167
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,060
that it was you who gave Chi Ye

168
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,810
the shareholders' agreement for the scooter factory.

169
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,970
That's true,

170
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,970
but I didn't try

171
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,970
to hurt Shen Jiahe.

172
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,940
I worked with Chi Ye

173
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,570
to unite Chi Ye

174
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,660
against Xu Mingli.

175
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,660
Now, Xu Mingli has fallen,

176
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,610
so my next target

177
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,210
is Chi Ye.

178
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,300
Can I trust you?

179
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,490
Whether you believe me or not,

180
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,490
I will do it.

181
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,780
To deal with Xu Mingli,

182
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,330
Chi Ye fabricated a fake paternity test

183
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,300
so that Xu Mingli wouldn't recognize Xu Yuan,

184
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,450
which delayed her treatment.

185
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,450
He's a man

186
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,330
who can use his sister

187
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,810
without scruples for revenge,

188
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,300
so I have to

189
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,730
get back at him.

190
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,380
What are you going to do?

191
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,940
I can help you

192
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,020
find the owner of the scooter factory.

193
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,730
Do you know where he is?

194
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,260
After lurking around Chi Ye for so long,

195
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,810
I naturally have access

196
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,850
to some information.

197
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,540
In Fangzhou District, west of the city.

198
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,810
Get a car.

199
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,900
I'll take you there.

200
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,690
Bai Xia.

201
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,540
As expected, I was right to be on the lookout

202
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,380
for you.

203
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,940
My cell phone was implanted

204
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,060
with an eavesdropping virus by Chi Ye,

205
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,610
so I put it in the car.

206
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,970
You came to me because...

207
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,380
The owner of the scooter factory

208
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,730
may be hidden by Chi Ye,

209
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,020
but I don't know exactly where he is.

210
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,660
Can we trust you now?

211
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,090
Before,

212
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,140
it was indeed me

213
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,660
who handed over Xu Mingli's shareholding agreement

214
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,780
to Chi Ye.

215
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,690
I admit

216
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,970
that I took advantage

217
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,090
of your trust in me

218
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,300
and relayed part of the information

219
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,140
to Chi Ye,

220
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,330
but I had no intention of harming you and Xu Nuo.

221
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,450
And,

222
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,810
regarding the equity agreement,

223
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,730
I was also helping you.

224
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,090
A double agent?

225
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,090
Think what you will.

226
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,060
Anyway, Xu Mingli

227
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,330
has already paid the price,

228
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,810
so I think

229
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,060
we have the same goal next.

230
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,210
Taking on Chi Ye.

231
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,940
I have no objection.

232
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,420
But

233
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,540
since you're being bugged by Chi Ye,

234
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,420
we can use it as a ruse.

235
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,610
You read my mind.

236
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,660
I want to play along

237
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,780
with Xu Nuo

238
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,090
and pretend that I'm here to snitch.

239
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,060
So that Chi Ye would think

240
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,780
that Jiang Tian's location was compromised

241
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,570
and try to move him.

242
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,850
Right.

243
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,570
You guys have a good understanding.

244
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,810
What about Chi Ye?

245
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,970
Will he believe it?

246
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,140
Let's try our luck.

247
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,940
I overheard

248
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,420
that he was in Fangzhou District,

249
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,690
but I don't know exactly where he is.

250
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,330
Then I'll follow him.

251
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,730
Hey, Nuo.

252
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,380
I got Jiang Tian's location.

253
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,820
I'll call the police right away.

254
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,050
I'm right behind you.

255
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,340
Find a way to distract Chi Ye.

256
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,010
I'll convince Jiang Tian to turn himself in.

257
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,730
I'll convince Jiang Tian to turn himself in.

258
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,210
I'm afraid Chi Ye will hurt Jiang Tian.

259
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,420
OK. Be careful.
