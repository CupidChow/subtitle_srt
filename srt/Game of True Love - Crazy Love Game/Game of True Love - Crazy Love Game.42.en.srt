[Episode 42]

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,090
Lin Yi!

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,370
It really is you!

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,500
Do you remember me?

15
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,810
I'm your Aunt Bai!

16
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,500
Don't go!

17
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,370
I still wanted to ask...

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,530
after your dad passed away,

19
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,700
where did you and your mom go?

20
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,980
All these years,

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,250
there hasn't been a word from either of you.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,290
Ma'am,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,730
I think you've got the wrong person.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,250
Come on, who are you fooling?

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,340
That look on your face said it all.

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,780
You clearly recognized me!

27
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,340
And this scar...

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,150
Looks like you really

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,170
do want to catch up with me.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,060
Yi...

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,620
Yi...

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,850
What do you mean by this?

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,180
You're not still holding a grudge, are you?

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,020
Back then,

35
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,410
I picked up that red-hot wire

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,020
to scare your dad.

37
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,090
I didn't mean to burn you.

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,460
Let me...

39
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,530
Let me apologize to you.

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,650
Yi, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,250
You don't need to apologize to me.

42
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,620
The one who should apologize...

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,970
is me.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,690
No way.

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,690
What are you sorry for?

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,650
You and your mom didn't do anything wrong.

47
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,570
Not in the past, no.

48
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,090
But who knows about the future?

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,060
Maybe...

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,620
Bai Xia and her daughter

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,850
might soon

52
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,650
have a little "accident."

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,570
Wait...

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,970
Yi, what... what do you mean

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,460
by saying this?

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,690
I don't get it.

57
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,180
Then I'll make it clear.

58
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,620
If...

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,620
if anyone finds out

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,620
who I really am,

61
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,690
I swear,

62
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,780
in this lifetime, you'll experience

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,220
what it feels like

64
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,250
to bury

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,060
your own child!

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,500
Relax.

67
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,890
I'm tight-lipped.

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,250
I swear

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,890
I won't say a word.

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,860
You mean it?

71
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,100
Good.

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,330
This

73
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,060
is your reward once it's done.

74
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,890
If one day,

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,130
Shen Jiahe or Nuo asks you

76
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,810
if I'm Lin Yi,

77
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,450
what will you say?

78
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,300
Take a look.

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,660
Does he look like this?

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,500
It's hard to say.

81
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,210
Not quite.

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,450
Is there anything special about him?

83
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,300
Yeah.

84
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,810
Lin Chongshan once said

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,060
that kid would be filthy rich

86
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,250
because he had a birthmark on his lower back.

87
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,860
I tricked Shen Jiahe and Nuo

88
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,450
to get that money.

89
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,570
No matter what,

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,420
Xia can't know this.

91
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,210
You're here?

92
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,660
What do you want from me?

93
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,370
I need to talk to you.

94
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,100
I saw Nuo today.

95
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,690
What did you say to her?

96
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,690
Not a single word.

97
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,370
But I know she hates me.

98
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,330
She really hates me.

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,860
Xu Mingli, let me tell you...

100
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,690
you brought this on yourself.

101
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,250
She's never looked at me

102
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,250
with eyes like that before.

103
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,330
I'm sure

104
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,420
Su Rong told her everything

105
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,210
about her past.

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,740
What past?

107
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,060
What did she tell her?

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,250
I don't need to tell you.

109
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,660
You'll find out soon enough.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,300
Tell her what?

111
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,770
Nuo...

112
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,660
she's not my biological daughter.

113
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,940
What did you just say?

114
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,940
Nuo isn't your biological daughter?

115
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,620
That was a secret

116
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,690
between Su Rong and me.

117
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,370
No one was ever supposed to know.

118
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,180
Before I met Su Rong,

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,450
she had a boyfriend.

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,740
Nuo is the child

121
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,100
she had with him.

122
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,210
Later, her boyfriend

123
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,570
died in a car accident.

124
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,770
And I stepped in.

125
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,210
Why?

126
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,770
Why?

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,860
Why did you keep it from me

128
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,980
all these years?

129
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,740
There was never any blood relation

130
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,740
between me and Nuo.

131
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,690
Then why did you

132
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,250
keep blocking us

133
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,330
over and over again?

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,690
Because...

135
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,770
your existence.

136
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,740
Back then, Madam Su

137
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,060
warned me

138
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,660
never to acknowledge you

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,690
as my own son,

140
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,570
and never

141
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,380
to let you marry Nuo.

142
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,780
If I ever broke that promise,

143
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,490
then...

144
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,090
she'd take back

145
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,380
everything I got from the Su family.

146
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,690
I'd be left with nothing.

147
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,780
She was afraid I'd covet their fortune

148
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,940
and cut off all my options.

149
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,690
So...

150
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,260
even Aunt Rong doesn't know

151
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,940
that I'm your and Shen Fen's child?

152
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,420
No.

153
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,380
Only Lin Chongshan and Madam Su

154
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,420
know the truth.

155
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,900
Xu Mingli...

156
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,570
you're just selfish!

157
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,260
All these years, you never dared to claim me.

158
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,730
You never had the guts

159
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,140
to take responsibility for your mistakes.

160
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,380
You gave up my and Nuo's happiness

161
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,900
because you were afraid of losing

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,490
everything the Su family gave you!

163
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,690
All you ever thought about was yourself.

164
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,420
So what if I did?

165
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,660
If you don't look out for yourself, who will?

166
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,900
If you and Nuo weren't together,

167
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,690
everything would be fine, wouldn't it?

168
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,780
You'd stay CEO of Yuanfei Group,

169
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,450
and she'd still be my precious girl.

170
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,540
So now you're saying

171
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm the only one at fault?

172
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,330
Is this all on me?

173
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,380
Xu Mingli...

174
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,900
I...

175
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,300
Xu Mingli,

176
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,090
all these years,

177
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,690
you've been a coward.

178
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,810
You never once dared

179
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,020
to be honest with us.

180
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,140
All you ever saw was profit!

181
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,940
Yes, I didn't tell the truth. Yes, I'm weak!

182
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,300
I've spent my whole life paying for it!

183
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,090
But why is everything I do

184
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,610
still wrong in the end?

185
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,730
Who could ever understand me?

186
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,180
Xu Mingli...

187
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,380
Son...

188
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,090
No matter what, I'm still your father,

189
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,380
who gave you life and raised you.

190
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,300
Father?

191
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,570
You think you deserve that title?

192
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,810
Son...

193

I never even asked you

239
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,420
for anything in return.

Nuo,

258
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,010
where are you?

259
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,450
Yesterday, Shen Jiahe

260
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,770
was going crazy looking for you.

261
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,660
He told me

262
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,730
he used to think you were siblings.

263
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,940
That he was wrong

264
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,250
to say all those hurtful things.

265
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,420
I didn't understand

266
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,290
a single word of that.

267
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,490
He looked like he was falling apart.

268
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,860
You should really call him back.

269
00:17:59,550 --> 00:17:59,970
Here.

270
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,580
Give it a try.

271
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,820
Chi Ye,

272
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,290
I've got something to take care of.

273
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,140
I'll head back first.
