of "a cover-up only makes things worse"?

As long as I'm here,

you'll never marry into the Xu family.

Really?

146
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,600
Mingli already gave me

147
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,510
the family heirloom bracelet.

148
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,120
That's…

149

193
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,030
Stop Bai Xia from marrying my dad.

194
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,200
Forget it.

195
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,030
I know you won't

196
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,030
do something that will

197
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
offend both sides.

198
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,960
Forget it.

199
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,320
Nuo,

200
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,270
I can do

201
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,840
anything for you.

202
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,240
But I can't stop them

203
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,790
from getting married.

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,510
Who are you fooling?

205
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,910
With your relationship with Bai Xia,

206
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,080
you can't make it?

207
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,960
It's not what you think

208
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,360
between me and Bai Xia.

209
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,630
I don't care.

210
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,150
Just tell me, yes or no?

211
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
I can't.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Shen Jiahe,

213
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,120
do you love me?

214
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,150
Do something for me.

215
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,440
Stop Bai Xia from marrying my dad.

216
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,080
I went to Yuanfei to see Xu Mingli.

217
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,600
He avoided me again.

218
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,720
That bastard.

219
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,840
These debt collectors are driving me insane.

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,080
We did it together,

221
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,790
but when trouble came,

222
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,960
why should I have to

223
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,670
take the fall alone?

224
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,240
Xu Mingli used the Su family's power

225
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,670
to get away clean.

226
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,390
But I have nowhere to run.

227
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,320
My brakes failed on the highway today.

228
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,670
I wonder if it was done

229
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,510
by Xu Mingli's people.

230
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,480
I know too many of his secrets.

231
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,510
Is he trying to kill me?

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,870
If he dares harm my family,

233
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,720
I will take him down

234
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,360
with me.

235
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,910
What's Xu Mingli

236
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,270
hiding?

237
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I finally placed Bai Xia

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,480
and got a chance for further progress.

239
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,390
Should I really give up now?

240
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,670
Jiahe,

241
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,270
the finance department got some information.

242
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,910
Xu Nuo's uncle, Su Ting,

243
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,720
[Gao Hao'en]
is sending an audit team to check the accounts,

244
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,510
including upcoming investment projects.

245
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,870
I guess it's because

246
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,960
of Bai Xia's club.

247
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,790
It may be shut down.

248
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,630
Right, yes.

249
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,840
About the wedding setup,

250
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
you may just contact

251
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,480
Miss Bai's assistant.

252
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,030
Eavesdropping?

253
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,030
What?

254
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,440
Let's make a deal.

255
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What deal?

256
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,030
If I stop the wedding,

257
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,840
you will date me.

258
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,870
Didn't you say you couldn't make it?

259
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,200
How would I know if I don't try?

260
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,630
Deal.

261
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,870
Do something now.

262
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,150
Or they will even be

263
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,080
about to have babies.

264
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,270
What's your plan?

265
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,630
Don't worry about it.

266
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,390
Just prepare for our date.

267
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,270
