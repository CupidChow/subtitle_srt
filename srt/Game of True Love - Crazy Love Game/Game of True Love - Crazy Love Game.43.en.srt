I'll contact him right away.

194
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,160
Are you drinking so much

195
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,400
because you want to die?

196
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,710
Leave me alone.

197
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,520
Does it help if you drink so much?

198
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,480
Will she come back

199
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,550
when you drink yourself to death?

200
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,430
Didn't you guys used to

201
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,040
fall out all the time?

202
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,910
What's the big deal?

203
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,000
It's different.

204
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,950
It's different this time.

205
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,760
Let's go.

206
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,120
I'll help you to bed.

207
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,590
So hot.

208
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,520
Jiahe.

209
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,760
Where's your medicine chest?

210
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,160
Lie down.

211
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,950
Lie down.

212
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,830
I'm going out to buy medicine.

213
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,880
Wait for me.

214
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,900
[Xu Nuo]

215
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,670
Shen Jiahe.

216
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,400
Leave the house if you see the message.

217
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,830
Sir.

218
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,310
There's been no one going inside.

219
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,480
Should we keep watching?

220
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,240
Keep an eye on the door of Shen Jiahe's house.

221
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,640
I want to see who can get in.

222
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,190
Let's hurry.

223
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,310
Let's go now.

224
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,880
Shen Jiahe.

225
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,830
Shen Jiahe.

226
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,120
So hot.

227
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,740
[Shen Jiahe, leave the house if you see the message.]

228
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,900
[Delete]

229
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,780
[Are you sure you want to delete it?]

230
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,120
[Xu Nuo]

231
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,040
Nuo.

232
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,860
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

233
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:56,700
