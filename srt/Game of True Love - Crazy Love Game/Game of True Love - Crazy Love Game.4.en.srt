against him,

Look at this Xu family's princess...

206
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,790
Mr. Shen was innocent,

207
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,120
but Chairman Xu might not be.

In my opinion,

Miss Xu, you're truly talented and beautiful.

You must have grown up

Could you tell us

about your father?

246

My father is a man

with a great sense of responsibility.

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,870

Since our host

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,630
already called them rumors,

265
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,870

So, the trouble you caused at the ceremony

287
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,390
was a setup.

288
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,650
You first got Uncle Xu into a scandal.

289
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,480

385
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,720
Shen Jiahe and my dad

386
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,920
will stop at nothing

387
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,070
to eliminate anyone in their way.

388
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,750
Looks like the key to breaking this

389
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,830
is stirring trouble

390
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,200
between this stepfather and son.

391
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Nuo, you were right.

392
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,120
Shen Jiahe and Bai Xia's relationship

393
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,260
is way more complicated than it seems!

394
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,720
If I tell my dad,

395
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,000
he won't believe it.

396
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,270
Bestie,

397
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,550
ask a reporter

398
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,750
to anonymously send the photos

399
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,640
to my dad.

00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,460
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

401
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:06,780

402
