194
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,900
Looks like I'll have to change partners,

195
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,260
or I won't be able

196
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,850
to enjoy myself tonight.

197
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,140
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,090
Excuse me.

199
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,330
I'll fix my makeup.

200
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,780
OK.

201
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,810
I'll wait for you.

202
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,420
Give me one million.

203
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,180
You put my mom in jail

204
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,210
for half a million,

205
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,020
so it's not too much to ask for a million

206
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,300
for confidentiality, right?

207
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,020
Or should I ask Xu Nuo

208
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,970
for this money,

209
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,180
my dear brother,

210
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,020
Lin Yi?

211
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,140
What do you want?

212
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,510
[Jiang Tian Electric Scooter Co., LTD]

213
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,140
[Substitute shareholding agreement]

214
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,900
[Substitute shareholding agreement]

215
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,610
My purpose is simple.

216
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,540
It's to work with you

217
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,450
against Xu Mingli.

218
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,260
I even want to dismember him

219
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,730
as much as you do.

220
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,060
At my lowest point,

221
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,450
he abandoned me and my daughter

222
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,300
and ruined my career

223
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,450
and my life.

224
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,850
I have more than one

225
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,610
of these.

226
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,060
I'm sure you'll need it.

227
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,810
Don't you blame me for not stopping you

228
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,020
from marrying Xu Mingli?

229
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,660
If so, I'd have to blame too many people,

230
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,540
but

231
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,330
the cooperation isn't gratuitous.

232
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,610
Xiamei's debt...

233
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,260
That's easy.

234
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,610
Then I wish us good cooperation,

235
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,330
my brother.

236
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,690
I have something to do.

237
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,060
See you later.

238
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,570
You just had a nice chat

239
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,780
with that pretty girl.

240
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,330
Are you jealous?

241
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,580
Didn't you think I'd be jealous

242
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,420
when you flirted with Chi Ye?

243
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,210
Our plan has to be well thought out,

244
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,380
don't you understand?

245
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,580
But I still don't want to see Chi Ye

246
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,420
taking liberties with you.

247
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,340
Why don't you think I was taking liberties with him?

248
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,620
Then tell me

249
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,010
how you took liberties with him.

250
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,290
What?

251
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,450
Do you want to avenge him?
