00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,790
in store for Shen Jiahe?

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,960
For several years,

196
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,440
Shen Jiahe has been transferring money

197
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,000
to a company called Lion.

198
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,630
This company is ostensibly

199
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
an overseas consulting business,

200
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,630
but in fact, they'll do anything as long as people

201
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,550
give them money.

202
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,670
What I've got is evidence

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
of him transferring money

204
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
to this company behind Yuanfei's back.

205
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,550
Sure enough,

206
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,480
you came back this time

207
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
to fight him openly.

208
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,440
It is really like you.

209
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,120
Xu Nuo, Shen Jiahe.

210
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,390
You, a pair of siblings,

211
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
haven't seen each other for a long time,

212
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,630
but you beat each other up as soon as you meet.

213
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,840
Do you two

214
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,750
have a deep grudge?

215
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,600
No.

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
Who's his sister?

217
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,390
I don't know what's going on

218
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,360
with you guys

219
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,200
that you made such a mess right after coming back.

220
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,550
And you sent mass e-mails

221
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,390
to report Jiahe.

222
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,360
What do you want?

223
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,080
Uncle Xu.

224
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,120
Nuo does a lot of things wrong,

225
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,480
but she's still doing what's best for Yuanfei.

226
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,670
Don't play nice here.

227
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,600
Dad.

228
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,390
The president of a publicly traded company

229
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,080
is doing illegal things behind your back.

230
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,270
Even if he's your adopted son,

231
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,390
you can't harbor him.

232
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,600
What do you know?

233
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,200
Those accounts

234
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,030
were opened

235
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,360
for our future overseas project operations.

236
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,390
No way.

237
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,240
Yuanfei's annual report has always shown

238
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,440
a normal statement from overseas operations.

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,480
This money must have been misappropriated.

240
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,440
If you don't believe me,

241
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,270
you can ask a third-party review organization or a lawyer

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,030
to investigate.

243
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,320
Investigate what?

244
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,440
Don't mess around.

245
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,320
Why?

246
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,000
How can an overseas operation program

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,790
be as simple as you think?

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,750
Since you don't understand,

249
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,550
don't get involved.

250
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,840
Nuo.

251
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,200
I know you want to get back at me,

252
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,000
but you can't influence the company.

253
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,910
This is business, not a playing house.

254
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,030
Shut up.

255
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,630
Who are you to educate me?

256
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,390
Why do you talk to your brother like that?

257
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,030
What have you learned

258
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,960
abroad all these years?

259
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,600
Dad.

260
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,360
You sent me abroad to study

261
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,120
so that I could manage the company

262
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
in the future,

263
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,510
but now you've given the presidency

264
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,790
to Shen Jiahe without saying a word

265
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,910
and asked me to stay out of it.

266
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,630
Dad.

267
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,200
Whose father are you really?

268
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,790
Nuo.

269
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,150
Is it my decision

270
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,320
to make him president?

271
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,480
It was the board of directors' decision

272
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,320
through a collective discussion and a show of hands.

273
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,960
Do you know how much Jiahe

274
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,240
has done for the company?

275
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,630
After you do that,

276
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,790
we'll have to investigate

277
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,670
and make a public statement to the shareholders.

278
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,750
That's all.

279
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,870
I'm leaving.

280
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,480
I have something to take care of.

281
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,320
Dad.

282
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,080
Where's my mom?

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,600
Why isn't she home?

284
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,630
Your mom...

285
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,080
Your mom went to visit her family.

286
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,550
You're tired.

287
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,870
Let's talk tomorrow.

288
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,440
We haven't seen each other for years,

289
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
but you get so angry as soon as you come back.

290
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,200
Do you have to?

291
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,510
Shen Jiahe.

292
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,440
You won't be president

293
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,790
for long.

294
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,960
Miss Xu.

295
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,870
Mr. Shen.

296
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,510
I brought you the perfume

297
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,440
you bought earlier.

298
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,080
Thank you, Aunt Pei.

299
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,960
Uncle Xu asked me

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
to receive clients at the hotel.

301
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,510
Don't leave the door open for me tonight.

302
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,150
Okay.

303
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,200
Meeting clients at the hotel?

304
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,720
Using my dad as a front?

305
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,630
I'll see what he's up to.

306
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,020
[Sunac Wanda Vista Hotel]

307
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
If I remember correctly,

308
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,240
Shen Jiahe

309
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,360
and the heir to the Wansheng Group

310
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,390
are engaged.

311
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,510
Let's see how long

312
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,870
you can be president after I

313
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,910
get the proof of your cheating.

314
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,360
Why does this back

315
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,910
look so familiar?

316
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,550
Dad?

317
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,000
Xu Nuo?

318
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,840
Why are you here?

319
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,150
Bai Xia?

320
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:31,630
You guys...

321
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,000
Xu Nuo.

322
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,240
Xu Nuo, let me explain.

323
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,750
Xu Nuo.

324
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,720
Mingli.

325
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,720
Mingli, I...

326
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,630
I'll be right back.

327
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,360
Nuo.

328
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,630
Nuo.

329
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,480
Nuo.

330
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,550
I just saw Shen Jiahe

331
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
go in,

332
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,240
but why is that my father?

333
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,360
Calm down.

334
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,480
I need to get evidence for my mom.

335
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,160
Where's Xu Mingli?

336
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,830
What are you doing?

337
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,240
Let go.

338
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
You interfered with me and Shen Jiahe,

339
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
and now you're seducing my father.

340
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,350
Are you a repeat offender?

341
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,590
Do you know

342
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,720
I didn't cause this alone?

343
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,790
They courted me first.

344

[Do you want to delete this video? Yes.]

345
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,140
[Do you want to delete this video? Yes.]

346
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,480
Give it back.

347
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,030
Give it back.

348
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,350
How dare you hit me?

349
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,110
Hit me...
