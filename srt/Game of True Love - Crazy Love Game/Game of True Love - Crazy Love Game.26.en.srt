193
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:30,960
Hello?

194
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,320
What is it?

195
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,080
What?

196
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,440
I'm coming back

197
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,270
right now.

198
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,320
Xia, if you weren't

199
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,000
feeling well,

200
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,630
why didn't you call me?

201
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,080
You could've just picked up the phone.

202
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
You didn't come home last night.

203
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,320
How was I supposed to reach you?

204
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,000
I...

205
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,630
Well,

206
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
I had dinner with a client

207
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,840
last night.

208
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,320
But work

209
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
means nothing

210
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,000
compared to your well-being.

211
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,600
You...

212
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,320
I really feel sorry

213
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,840
for my poor Xia.

214
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,080
She works tirelessly day and night,

215
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,910
and even now that she's pregnant,

216
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,790
she still can't get proper rest.

217
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,270
I thought

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,150
marrying into the Xu family

219
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,270
would bring her a good life,

220
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,240
but who would've thought...

221
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,960
Mom,

222
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,750
enough.

223
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,030
Alright, I'll shut up.

224
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,750
I'll go make you something nutritious.

225
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,550
You're

226
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,200
carrying a child now.

227
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,630
Why push yourself so hard?

228
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,750
Listen to me.

229
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,750
From now on, whether I'm home or not,

230
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,630
whether I have work or not,

231
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,870
I'm staying

232
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,910
close

233
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,270
to keep an eye on you.

234
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,000
There's been no update from your side,

235
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,150
and I didn't want to pressure you,

236
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,080
so I tried to figure things out myself.

237
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,550
Stop worrying.

238
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,510
Just focus

239
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,910
on taking care of yourself, alright?

240
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,870
Actually...

241
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,320
What is it?

242
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,360
I've secured an investor.

243
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,120
Who?

244
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,270
Blank Capital.

245
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,480
Have you heard of them?

246
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,670
Yeah, I have.

247
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,030
They've been making big moves lately,

248
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,270
investing

249
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,390
in several major projects.

250
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,630
But they want us

251
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,030
to invest some of our own money

252
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,120
to reassure them.

253
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,240
Invest our own money?

254
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
But I...

255
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,790
Will ¥8 million be enough?

256
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,870
I'll talk to them.

257
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,960
But if it's not enough,

258
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,510
you'll cover the rest, right?

259
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,240
They're putting in ¥20 million.

260
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,120
Don't worry.

261
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,320
Once I have more funds,

262
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,840
I'll make sure you get what you need.

263
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,480
For now, go talk to them.

264
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,150
I'll have the legal and finance teams

265
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,080
back you up,

266
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,840
alright?

267
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,030
Alright.

268
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,750
How did I get so lucky?

269
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,240
What did I do to get

270
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,390
such a smart,

271
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,270
capable,

272
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,790
and gorgeous wife?

273
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
Then can you cut back on your socializing?

274
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,240
At least

275
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,320
until I've given birth.

276
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:25,910
Alright.

277
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
You have my word.

278
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,910
I'll do whatever you say.

279
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,200
You call the shots.

280
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,360
Okay?

281
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,910
Life is good.

282
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,240
Shen Jiahe!

283
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,270
Shen Jiahe!

284
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,600
Coming.

285
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,550
Have you seen my blow-dryer?

286
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,910
I need to go meet an investor soon.

287
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,150
I'll get it for you.

288
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:40,790
Nuo,

289
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,630
have you touched my files recently?

290
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,510
No.

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,120
Why would I?

292
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,440
Did someone else come in?

293
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,510
What's wrong?

294
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,240
Nothing.

295
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,960
Your phone's ringing.

296
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,870
It's nothing. You go ahead.

297
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,510
That's Xu Mingli's assistant, Sun.

298
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,670
Xu Mingli,

299
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,550
what exactly are you looking for?

300
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,520
[Xiamei Beauty Club]

301
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,600
Xia,

302
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
Mr. Xu has transferred

303
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,150
¥5 million,

304
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,030
and Blank's first-phase investment of ¥20 million

305
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,720
has been credited too.

306
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,910
We are flush

307
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,120
with funds now.

308
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,510
I've arranged

309
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,670
for the new branch's equipment.

310
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,750
With renovations,

311
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,600
we can open

312
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,670
the new branch by next month,

313
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,510
plus

314
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,960
two more the month after!

315
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,360
That's wonderful.

316
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,320
For the location of the new branch,

317
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,320
prioritize

318
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,000
high-traffic commercial areas.

319
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Do thorough research.

320
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,360
Got it, Xia. Don't worry.

321
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,510
When luck comes,

322
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,600
nothing can stop it.

323
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,840
You really are my little lucky star.

324
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,750
Jiahe,

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,240
you've been so busy with work lately.

326
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,750
We hardly ever

327
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,080
get a chance

328
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,510
to sit down and chat,

329
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,360
right?

330
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,550
So, how's

331
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,030
the company doing?

332
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
Not bad.

333
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,720
The groundwork we laid over the years

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
is finally paying off.

335
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,240
That's good to hear.

336
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,200
I know

337
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,510
that as long as you're at the company,

338
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,750
I can rest easy.

339
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,200
By the way,

340
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,750
last weekend,

341
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,440
I was on Yanhai West Road,

342
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,270
and I saw your car

343
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,150
turning into a sanatorium.

344
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,200
What were you doing there?

345
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,630
Visiting someone.

346
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,870
Who?

347
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,120
My mother.

348
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Who?

349
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,790
Your mother,

350
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,080
Shen Fen?

351
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,790
You found her?

352
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,840
That's huge!

353
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,550
Why didn't you tell me?

354
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,360
Is there

355
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,080
something you're worried about?

356
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,120
Is that why you kept quiet?

357
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,440
No, Uncle Xu.

358
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,630
Calm down.

359
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,120
My mother

360
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,200
has mental health issues now.

361
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,000
She's like a different person,

362
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,080
and she doesn't remember the past.

363
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,440
So I figured

364
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,910
there was no point in telling anyone.

365
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,240
She doesn't remember?

366
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,750
Jiahe,

367
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,480
this one's on you.

368
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,790
Aunt Rong and I

369
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,830
raised you.

370
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,590
You know how much

371
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,830
we care about you.

372
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,200
How could you keep this from us?

373
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,240
This is a big deal.

374
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,830
You should've told me.

375
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,680
I didn't

376
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,830
want to cause you trouble.

377
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,160
What trouble?

378
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,030
Don't be ridiculous.

379
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,880
When exactly

380
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,790
did you find her?

381
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,480
Last spring.

382
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,640
I saw her

383
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,590
digging through a trash can

384
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,070
for food in a park.

385
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,310
At first, I didn't even recognize her.

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,350
Uncle Xu,

387
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,830
what really happened back then?

388
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,200
How did my mom end up like this?

389
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,620
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

390
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:05,580
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

391
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:11,110
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
