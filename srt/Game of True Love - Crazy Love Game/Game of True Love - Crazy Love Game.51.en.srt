Or,

194
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,670
just like you did back then

195
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,640
with my dad,

196
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,830
you can throw your son under the bus again

197
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,120
and make him take the blame.

198
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,160
But...

199
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,910
everyone else involved

200
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,910
seems to have skipped town.

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,280
The only thing that can prove he's innocent...

202
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,020
[Inspection Report]

203
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,000
is this.

204
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,520
Give me that report!

205
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,640
Being cornered with nowhere to run?

206
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,670
Feels awful, doesn't it?

207
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,240
When my dad

208
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,550
was trapped in that fire,

209
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,160
that's exactly how he felt!

210
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,070
Kid...

211
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Listen to me...

212
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,400
Let me explain.

213
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,550
I swear to God.

214
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,670
I've never killed anyone

215
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,070
or set a fire in my life.

216
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,430
Really. You have to believe me.

217
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,480
I didn't start that fire.

218
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,190
You've got it all wrong.

219
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,360
I...

220
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,520
I never did anything

221
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,910
to betray your father.

222
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,190
Please, I'm begging you.

223
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,760
Spare my family. Just this once.

224
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,950
Spare you?

225
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,280
Why didn't you think of sparing us?

226
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,880
You've got one day to decide.

227
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,710
If you don't turn yourself in,

228
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,160
your son's the one going to jail.

229
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,240
Son.

230
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,590
Mom!

231
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,240
How did you get out?

232
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,790
Didn't I tell you?

233
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,760
It's not that easy

234
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,190
to take me down.

235
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,710
Come at me if you've got a problem.

236
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,520
Leave my mom out of this.

237
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,550
Oh, you?

238
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,240
So it turns out

239
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,880
you and your mother

240
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,550
clung to the Chi family all these years

241
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,480
just to get revenge

242
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,310
for your dead father?

243
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,280
What are you doing?

244
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,910
Mom!

245
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,710
Don't touch him!

246
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,880
Mom.

247
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,120
Are you okay?

248
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,950
Back off!

249
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,790
I really underestimated you.

250
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,240
You actually dare to play dirty behind my back.

251
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,190
You deserve everything coming to you.

252
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,590
Still remember that beating here on you

253
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,070
a few days ago?

254
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,070
So it was you.

255
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,790
You're the lowest

256
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,000
of the low!

257
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:05,910
I...

258
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,590
Son!

259
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,880
Son!

260
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll hit you whenever I feel like it!

261
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,790
Don't hit...

262
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,480
Don't hit my son!

263
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,430
Get out of the way!

264
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,400
Don't hit my son!

265
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,760
Mom!

266
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,400
Move!

267
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,120
Mom!

268
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:24,790
Mom!

269
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,880
Are you okay?

270
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,120
No...

271
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,240
Got anything else to say?

272
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,280
You and your father are nothing but cowards!

273
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,040
You're crushed by Xu Mingli at work,

274
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,160
and all you know is hitting women and kids.

275
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,790
Don't touch my son!

276
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,710
Son!

277
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,590
Who gave you

278
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,590
all those good years?

279
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,280
And you dare talk to me like that?

280
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,670
You little bastard!

281
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,400
Shut up!

282
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,760
Screw you!

283
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,950
Stop it!

284
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,520
Son!

285
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,550
Son!

286
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,240
Chi Ye!

287
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,910
Son!

288
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,280
Son!

289
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,760
Son!

290
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,960
♪I love you, love you, love you♪

291
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:20,000
♪So deep that I forget who I am♪

292
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:25,690
♪I miss you, miss you, miss you♪
