You are safe. You are safe now.

You are safe now.

It's alright.

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,300
Easy.

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,300
You are still burning up.

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,340
Take the medicine first.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,300
The police have caught the person who kidnapped you.

43
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,180
They're interrogating him now.

44
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,900
How are you feeling?

45
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,940
What about the shares?

46
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,850
Don't worry, the contract wasn't signed.

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,900
That's good.

48
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,530
By the way, Nuo,

49
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,570
if Chi Hao

50
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,940
was behind your kidnapping,

51
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,300
Chi Ye might also be involved.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,740
I think you should

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,410
stay away from Chi Ye.

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,970
Chi Ye is different from Chi Hao.

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,940
We grew up

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,020

57
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,500
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,060
Fine.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,060
I don't have evidence.

60

if something like this happens,

63
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,770
you must tell me right away.

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,130
You can't handle it alone.

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,620

when you had a nightmare,

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,180
you said you were afraid of dying.

74
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,770
When

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,370
will you stop

76
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,740
being so stubborn?

77
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,100

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,570
you can tell whether a person is sincere or not

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,620
Just by looking into his eyes.

88
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,540
But why

89
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,500
do your eyes lie?

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,180
Maybe

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,010
what you see is real

92
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,660
and what you assume is wrong.

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,130
Shen Jiahe,

94
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,010
I swear I'll never talk to you again.

you never let me

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,940
What happened

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,130
when you were 18?

123
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,740
Just one night, and you were like

124
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,620
a completely different person.

125
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,010
Was it because of what I said

126
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,620
in the auditorium that hurt you?

127
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,100
But

128
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,690
I apologized to you afterward.

129
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,860
And I've said worse things

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,570
before,

131
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,180
and you never held it against me.

132
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,060
I remember you said

133
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,980
it was the last straw

134
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,210
that broke you.

135
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,770
No, it wasn't.

136
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,860

think carefully.

Or, compared to the secret

144
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,770
you refuse to tell,

145
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,810
winning the game isn't as important?

146
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,210
You think too much.

147
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,620

to plant Mr. Zhou

151

157
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,090
Dear Mr. Shen,

158
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,490
regarding your request

159
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,090
to locate your relative, Mr. Lin Yi,

160
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,060
he has been missing since he went abroad

161
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,970
20 years ago.

162
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,020
We are sorry to inform you

163
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,940
that we were unable to find him.

164
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,660
Fortunately, Nuo called

165
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,730
just in time.

166
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,090
Otherwise, we wouldn't

167
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,140
have known she was kidnapped.

168
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,490
That jerk Chi Hao.

169
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,450
Call the police

170
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,180
and have him arrested.

171
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,330
We've called the police,

172
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,940
but all we have

173
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,180
is a virtual phone number

174
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,940
and a rented car.

175
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,260
Tracking him down directly

176
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,490
won't be easy.

177
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,970
What about Zhou Cheng?

178
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,810
Zhou Cheng

179
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,490
has already fled.

180
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,540
That traitor.

181
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,940
Freeze his shares

182
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,210
and expel him from the board.

183
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,090
I'll hunt him down

184
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,180
no matter what it takes.

185
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,810
Got it, Mr. Xu.

186
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,850
I'll take care of it.

187
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,060
Jiahe,

188
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,730
luckily, you and Nuo

189
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,380
found out about it in time.

190
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,260
if Chi Hao had gotten

191
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,540
any leverage, he could've

192
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,060
used it against me,

193
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,020
and I'd be in trouble.

194
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,810
It's all thanks to Nuo this time.

195
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,570
She almost lost her life.

196
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,850
Mr. Xu,

197
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,060
although Nuo can be a bit

198
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,780
domineering at times,

199
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,210
but she's always been

200
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,690
looking out for your best interests.

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,180
I was too harsh

202
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,090
on her before.

203
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,730
Jiahe,

204
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,450
from now on, help Nuo

205
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,540
with her work,

206
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,380
alright?

207
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,540
Compared to the evasive

208
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,420
Shen Jiahe,

209
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,570
I think you're more terrifying.

210
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,260
Me?

211
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,300
You've fallen for him, girl.

212
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,810
Before, all you cared about was

213
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,850
kicking Shen Jiahe out of Yuanfei.

214
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,570
But now, all you care about is

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,140
whether he truly has feelings for you.

216
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,060
You don’t understand.

217
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,810
A true hunter

218
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,300
often appears as the prey.

219
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,610
If I don't play along,

220
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,330
how am I supposed

221
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,300
to outmaneuver him?

222
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,090
Fine, you are right.

223
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,300
So what's next?

224
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,090
You can't keep asking him

225
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,660
like a broken record,

226
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,690
"Jiahe,

227
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,810
do you have feelings

228
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,300
for me or not?

229
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,140
Do you love Bai Xia or me?"

230
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,970
Cut it out.

231
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,570
Playing games is all about

232
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,330
who can act better.

233
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,970
This time, I'll make him taste what it's like

234
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,850
to be played.

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,970
My dad's on a business trip.

236
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,540
Tonight, it's just the two of us at home.

237
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,210
What do you mean?

238
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,610
I'm a grateful person.

239
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,140
Let me treat you to dinner

240
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,260
to thank you for saving me.

241
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,610
Really?

242
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,970
See?

243
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,660
You've done so many bad things that you're always

244
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,540
afraid someone will retaliate.

245
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,420
Come on.

246
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,900
Relax.

247
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,450
There's no poison in the food.

248
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,570
Tell me,

249
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,300
you went through all this trouble,

250
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,540
what is it that you really want?

251
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,900
Since you asked...

252
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,210
Shen Jiahe,

253
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,940
who do you really love?

254
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,090
Who do you think?

255
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,450
Miss Xu,

256
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,970
your bathwater is ready.

257
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,140
Alright.

258
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,970
I'll go take a bath first.

259
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,140
Mr. Shen,

260
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,300
enjoy your dinner.

261
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,940
