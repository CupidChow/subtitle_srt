00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,940
Doctor,

228
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,210
how is...?

229
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,780
After examination,

230
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,730
we've confirmed that the baby

231
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,090
has the congenital heart disease.

232
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,300
The condition is unstable,

233
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,330
so the baby will need to stay

234
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,660
in the incubator for close monitoring.

235
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,490
A heart disease?

236
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,850
But we don't have

237
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,690
any family history of that.

238
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,490
It's not necessarily hereditary.

239
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,300
During fetal development,

240
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,140
certain factors,

241
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,380
such as a mother's medication use

242
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,810
or underlying conditions

243
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,420
like diabetes

244
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,300
or hypercalcemia,

245
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,850
can contribute

246
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,210
to congenital heart disease in an infant.

247
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,660
So, what next?

248
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,570
Will surgery be needed?

249
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,130
For now, we'll monitor the baby closely.

250
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,890
Once we have a full consultation,

251
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,820
