194
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
it would have been a relief for me

195
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,960
when she'd abandoned me,

196
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,600
but until I was five,

197
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
she was the best mom in the world.

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,790
Even when she was raising me on her own,

199
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,000
she gave me

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,870
all her love,

201
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:56,910
so

202
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,240
I hate her.

203
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,440
I hated her

204
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
for being so good to me.

205
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,120
She gave me a home

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
but then made me lose it.

207
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,440
Aunt Fen must have had her reasons.

208
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,720
No mother wants

209
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,150
to abandon her child.

210
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,790
Hello?

211
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,000
Mr. Shen, we found Ms. Shen.

212
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:45,790
OK.

213
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,870
I'll be right back.

214
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,320
Jiahe, eat the candy.

215
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,480
Eat the candy.

216
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,840
This candy was from Ms. Lan

217
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,030
in the next ward when she

218
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
was discharged last month.

219
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,390
After all this time,

220
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,440
she always wanted to leave the candy to her son.

221
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,030
To Aunt Fen,

222
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,320
you're still the same five-year-old boy.

223
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,600
Eat it.

224
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,390
Mom.

225
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,840
Jiahe.

226
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,150
Jiahe.

227
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,150
Eat it.

228
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,960
Eat it.

229
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,270
I'm really sorry, Mr. Shen.

230
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,000
We'll definitely send more people to take care of her.

231
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,000
It will never

232
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,910
happen again.

233
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,320
It's okay. Thank you.

234
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,200
By the way,

235
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,240
did you see

236
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,030
who brought her back?

237
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,720
A middle-aged man.

238
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,150
That man asked us

239
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,480
when Ms. Shen came here,

240
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,750
but we kept client information

241
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,600
confidential.

242
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,870
Then did you notice

243
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,790
what he looked like

244
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,270
or

245
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,870
what kind of car he drove?

246
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,120
That man

247
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,320
was about 50 years old.

248
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,790
He drove an MPV,

249
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,390
and I remember his license plate had several eights in it.

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,960
Shen Jiahe found Shen Fen

252
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,360
but didn't tell me.

253
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,360
How much does he know

254
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,150
about what happened back then?

256
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,270
Here.

257
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,600
I told to you clearly

258
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,080
that you couldn't come to see Jiahe.

259
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,750
What are you doing now?

260
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,360
I was sick

261
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,390
and thought I was going to die.

262
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,510
Since you abandoned

263
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,150
this child back then,

264
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,790
you should now pretend that you don't have this child.

265
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,270
But I carried him for ten months

266
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,630
and raised him for five years,

267
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,670
so how can I pretend that I don't have him?

268
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,720
Please.

269
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,550

enough for?

Can you afford to raise him?

You, as a mom, can't be too selfish.

279

You have to think more about Jiahe.

Please.

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,510
Let me see him.
