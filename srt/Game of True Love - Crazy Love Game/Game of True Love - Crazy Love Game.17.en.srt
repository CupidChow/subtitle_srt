00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,330
What matters is

196
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,210
that he's willing to take all the blame.

197
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,570
Think about it.

198
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,380
After this mess,

199
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,140
who in Binhai's upper class

200
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,380
would still want to marry Nuo?

201
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,900
Anyone can marry Nuo,

202
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,660
except someone from the Chi family.

203
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,020
Everyone in Binhai knows

204
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,540
my feud with them.

205
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,380
Mingli,

206
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,330
you're only seeing part

207
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,730
of the picture.

208
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,140
What do you mean?

209
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,210
Chi Ye and Chi Hao

210
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,450
are half-brothers,

211
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,850
and they've never gotten along.

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,180
Think about it.

213
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,180
If he

214
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,450
becomes your son-in-law,

215
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,330
Nuo has a shot at inheriting

216
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,810
Chi's family assets

217
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,450
in the future.

218
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,610
Then,

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,850
will Chi Hao be furious?

220
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,260
If I support Chi Ye

221
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,210
in the SJ Group power struggle,

222
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,140
Chi Hao will be...

223
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,210
Chi Hao will be

224
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,210
furious!

225
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,810
Exactly.

226
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,900
Babe,

227
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,210
you are so smart!

228
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,210
You are beautiful and intelligent.

229
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,810
Who else but you should be the future boss lady

230
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,020
of Yuanfei Group?

231
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,420
This position has to belong to you!

232
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,090
Xu Nuo,

233
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,900
since I can't have Shen Jiahe,

234
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,780
you won't get him as well.

235
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,800
[Senwei Capital]

236
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,210
Mr. Shen,

237
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,020
I found out.

238
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,570
It was Zhang Shuyu.

239
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,090
He's at his office now.

240
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,690
Zhang Shuyu!

241
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,490
Bro...

242
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,450
Don't hit me!

243
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,090
How dare you harm Nuo? Tired of living?

244
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,020
I didn't.

245
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,810
Aunt Pei?

246
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,780
Mr. Shen,

247
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,330
Miss Xu and Mr. Xu

248
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,210
are quarreling.

249
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,210
Please come back.

250
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,850
Got it.

251
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,330
Come here.

252
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,730
Enjoy your life now.

253
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,570
Because you will be imprisoned soon.

254
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,610
No!

255
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,660
I won't get married!

256
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,610
If you don't get married now,

257
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,380
who will marry you afterwards?

258
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,660
Who will marry me?

259
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,780
Is my only worth

260
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,610
in getting married?

261
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,090
Then do you have a better plan?

262
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,850
You say the man in the video

263
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,490
isn't Chi Ye but Zhang Shuyu.

264
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,730
Do you have proof?

265
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,810
Who can back you up?

266
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,610
Also,

267
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,900
Which story sounds better?

268
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,690
You were assaulted

269
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,730
or it was just a date

270
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,570
between a couple?

271
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,570
The internet

272
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,260
is ruthless to women.

273
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,060
I'm thinking about your future.

274
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,570
Nuo.

275
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,730
I am the victim here!

276
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,420
Why should I have to compromise?

277
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,690
How is this compromise?

278
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,090
I heard Chi Ye already confessed

279
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,450
his feelings to you before.

280
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,690
And you agreed,

281
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,180
right?

282
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,660
Under these circumstances,

283
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,090
he still wants to marry you.

284
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,970
If this isn't a good thing, then what is?

285
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:32,970
I...

286
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,810
I won't agree to it.

287
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,210
Jiahe.

288
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,210
Don't

289
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,610
encourage Nuo.

290
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,060
Nuo should choose

291
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,570
who she wants to marry.

292
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,540
If you agree to this marriage,

293
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,380
your grandmother's shares

294
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,690
will be yours.

295
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,060
I'll even

296
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,850
give you extra stock

297
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,970
as your dowry.

298
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,970
If you don't,

299
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,490
then pack up

300
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,180
and find another job elsewhere.

301
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,300
Dad.

302
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,850
Why do you always use this

303
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,660
to threaten me?

304
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,490
Think it over.

305
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,810
This afternoon,

306
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,420
the PR team will officially

307
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,540
announce

308
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,450
your engagement with Chi Ye.

309
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,970
Miss Xu, do you have

310
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,850
anything to say?

311
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,490
Miss Xu,

312
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,210
is Mr. Chi

313
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,090
the man in the video?

314
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,810
Miss Xu,

315
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,780
why did you

316
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,690
suddenly announce your engagement?

317
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,380
Is this

318
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,330
your response to the scandal?

319
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,500
Miss Xu.

320
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,180
Is Mr. Chi

321
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,090
the man in the video?

322
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,060
Yes, it was me.

323
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,300
We're planning to get engaged soon.

324
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,900
We hope...

325
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,660
The man in the video

326
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,780
was me.

327
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,530
Miss Xu, please tell us

328
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,860
who the man in the video is.

329
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,860
- It's me. - It's me.

330
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,380
There's only one man in the video.

331
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,340
Who is lying?

332
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,450
- Him. - It's him.

333
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,940
So, who is he?

334
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,520
Miss Xu, please tell us the truth.
