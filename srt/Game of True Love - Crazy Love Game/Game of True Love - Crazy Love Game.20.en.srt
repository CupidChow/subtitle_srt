The phone you are calling...

194
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,040
[Xia]

195
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,780
Xia,

196
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,450
don't be angry.

197
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,180
All right?

198
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,700
[Message Sent, Rejected]

199
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,330
Wake up. We are here.

200
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,450
Jiahe.

201
00:11:59,510 --> 00:11:59,970
Nuo.

202
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,380
Nuo.

203
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,210
Nuo.

204
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,940
Did you have a nightmare?

205
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,900
Why don't you go home with my car?

206
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,490
I can see that you're exhausted

207
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,330
from work previously.

208
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,300
I can go on my own.

209
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm fine.

210
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,240
Chi Ye insisted on donating to the school

211
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,220
with your name.

212
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,520
I want to see

213
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,900
what he is scheming.

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,080
I find it weird.

215
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,410
We've made our relationship public

216
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,140
but he is still clinging to you.

217
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,420
Don't speak nonsense.

218
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,720
Chi Ye

219
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,100
has always been doing charity.

220
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,250
He saw me being misunderstood by the public

221
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
and used my name

222
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,520
for his donation

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,890
to help me regain my reputation.

224
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,610
Come on.

225
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,820
Nuo!

226
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,330
Chi Ye.

227
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,330
Chi Ye.

228
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,780
Why won't you give up?

229
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,850
You're paying money to make someone else's wife happy.

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,730
She's only your fiancee and not your wife.

231
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,730
There's no legal effect without a certificate.

232
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,900
Be careful of your words.

233
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,090
It'll happen sooner or later.

234
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,140
What are you talking about?

235
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,300
It's nothing.

236
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,300
Did you argue?

237
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,020
No.

238
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,740
No.

239
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,420
Let's go inside.

240
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:42,900
Sure.

241
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,800
Thank you

242
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,330
for still remembering Binhai High School

243
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,140
and donating scholarships for us.

244
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm very touched

245
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
as a former teacher of yours.

246
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,890
Don't be so polite, Mr. Yan.

247
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,820
This is Chi Ye's suggestion.

248
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,730
It's all thanks to him.

249
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,040
It's my honor

250
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,970
to contribute to my alma mater.

251
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,700
I would not have meet Nuo

252
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,900
if I hadn't transferred here.

253
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,990
Are you saying

254
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,490
that both of you are married?

255
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,060
Headmaster,

256
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,510
you've misunderstood.

257
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,560
She is my wife.

258
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,120
Sorry.

259
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,040
I just matched the wrong couple.

260
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,370
Not really.

261
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,260
They are only engaged.

262
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,040
The ceremony in the afternoon

263
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,210
will begin approximately at two.

264
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,920
You may walk around the school for now.

265
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,460
Headmaster, you may leave us

266
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,020
and get back to work.

267
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,830
See you later.

268
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,690
See you later.

269
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,060
Let's go and take a stroll.

270
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,200
Sure. Let's go.

271
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,330
Many years have passed

272
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,420
but our school

273
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,790
doesn't change a lot.

274
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,110
You don't change a lot too.

275
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,610
Can you play a song?

276
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,570
I forgot how to play it.

277
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,080
Play a song.

278
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,180
As expected, you've become worse.

279
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,650
You too.

280
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,050
The fourth note

281
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,940
of the third bar

282
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,230
was wrong.

283
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,850
Twice.

284
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,610
Do you think only your ears are good?

285
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,620

286
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:12,720
