[Episode 52]

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,370
I did all of this.

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,580
You need to go.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,220
Go, now!

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Why are you

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,940
only helping me now?

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,010
When Chi Cheng called me a bastard,

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,090
where were you?

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,010
When Chi Hao held me under

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,250
and nearly drowned me in the pool,

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,500
where were you then?

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,890
Chi Cheng may not

23
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,220
have been a good man,

24
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,700
but he gave you

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,890
a life of comfort,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,530
a chance to make something of yourself.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,010
You just cared about money and status!

28
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,060
How do you think we ended up like this?

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,650
You really don't know

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,890
what people have been saying?

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,450
Fine.

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,780
Fine.

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,940
Then all of this is my fault.

Dad wouldn't have died, right?

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,250
So the one who should've died wasn't him.

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,570
It should've been me!

It's not your fault.

47

It's not your fault.

48
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,900
It was Xu Mingli.

He ruined your dad.

I saw Chi Hao push you...

and I couldn't do anything.

I'll tell them

I pushed him off.

Stop calling me Chi Ye, okay?

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,410
Do you know why Chi Cheng

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,650
gave me that name?

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,940
Do you?

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,090
He said...

86
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,500
he said it meant "wild and free."

87
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,780
But that's not

88
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,900
what he told me.

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,460
He told me...

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,450
it meant I was a bastard.

91
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,620
But I still had to go by it...

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,620
because I needed that identity.

93
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,420
And I had to act

94
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,180
like I was grateful for it!

95
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,010
So yeah, my whole life

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,300
is just one big joke.

A major criminal case

103

fell from the group's headquarters.

106
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,420
According to suspect Ms. Zhang,

107
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,810
[Binhai TV]
the two got into a heated argument

108
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,690
over personal matters.

109
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,370
Taking advantage of a moment,

110
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,740
Zhang pushed Chi off the building.

111
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,570

How could this happen?

114
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,980
Do you really think

115
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,810
Zhang Lihui did it?

116
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,080
No way.

117
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,690
She's been in a wheelchair.

118
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,200
Exactly.

119
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,170
And Chi Hao was heavy.

120
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,320
With his temper,

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,620
if Chi Ye tricked him,

122
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,950
he would've definitely

123
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,850
gone after him for revenge.

124
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,160
Maybe, Chi Ye

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,250
got into a fight with him,

126
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,060
and pushed him off the building?

127
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,910
And his mom is just taking the fall?

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,100
If that's true,

129
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,330
then Chi Ye's completely lost it.

130
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,250
The police reviewed surveillance footage.

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,450
There was a man

132
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,370
who witnessed the moment

133
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,370
Chi Hao fell.

134
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,500
Xu Mingli?

135
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,370
Why was he there?

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,420
He told me earlier

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,570
he went to see Jiang Tian.

138
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,500
Turns out he went to SJ instead.

139
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,980
So could Xu Mingli

140
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,500
also be involved in the scooter scandal?

141
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,860
Maybe Chi Ye set him up too.

142
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,180
That makes sense...

143
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,300
Your injury,

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,660
the scooter incident,

145
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,210
and Xu Mingli...

146
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,300
This whole thing's not over yet.

147
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,980
Alright.

148
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,010
Stop overthinking.

149
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,010
Don't worry. I'm here.

150
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,500
We'll get through this.

151
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,100
Lin Yi is really brutal.

152
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,660
He's not letting me off the hook.

153
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,100
What should I do?

154
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,300
No...

155
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,620
I need to leave!

156
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,660
Wait.

157
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,300
I had Jiang Tian take one agreement

158
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,100
to get stamped.

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,860
But I never gave him his copy.

160
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,420
I had two copies.

161
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,130
So who gave one

162
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,570
to Chi Ye?

163
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,690
Are you looking for the agreement?

164
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,360
Why are you here?

165
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,880
Who let you in?

166
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,090
Get out!

167
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,570
The police have already started

168
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,300
investigating the scooter case.

169
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,020
So you're rushing to destroy

170
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,690
your agreement with Jiang Tian?

171
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,900
That way, the only one left to blame

172
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,450
is Shen Jiahe?

173
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,310
Xu Mingli,

174
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,060
classic you.

175
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,220
To save yourself,

176
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,380
you'd even throw your own son

177
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,600
under the bus.

178
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,260
So that's it.

179
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,180
I remember I had two copies

180
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,260
of Chi Ye's

181
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,020
shareholding agreement.

182
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,780
Why is there

183
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,730
only one left now?

184
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,020
Where's the other one?

185
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,210
Did you give it to him?

186
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,970
Yeah.

187
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,610
That's right.

188
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,540
The one even that idiot Jiang Tian

189
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,690
never got his hands on,

190
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,810
the one that could bring you,

191
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,490
Xu Mingli, down for good,

192
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,540
I gave it to him.

193
