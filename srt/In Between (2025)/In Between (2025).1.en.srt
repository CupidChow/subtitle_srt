1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,072
Everyone is a type of alcohol.

2
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,366
Some are smooth like a fine wine,

3
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,745
leaving you intoxicated
with their elegance and grace.

4
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,998
Others are bold and fiery
like a shot of tequila

5
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,876
making your heart race
with their wild spirit.

6
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,588
And there are those
who are sweet and bubbly like a cocktail,

7
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,048
tempting you with their playful charm.

8
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:53,219
But no matter the flavor,
each one leaves a lasting impression,

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,473
a lingering taste
that keeps you coming back for more.

10
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,518
And then,

11
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,104
there's Alexia.

12
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:09,069
She's like a glass of champagne,
classy, elegant,

13
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,738
with a sparkle that lights up the room.

14
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,741
Her refinement is unmatched,

15
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,368
leaving you breathless with every sip.

16
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,624
Thanks! Yeah, totally unexpected.

17
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,168
Can you believe it's been 12 years?

18
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,587
- We don't have any plans.
- Gaila. Hey.

19
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,756
- Join us.
- Sure. Talk to you later.

20
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,841
We're just drinking at home.

21
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,052
Just having a beer's enough for us.

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,766
Lex, we've known each other for ten years.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,519
From the moment I met you,

24
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,022
I knew you were different.

25
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,608
I knew you were special.

26
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,654
Lex, you're perfect.

27
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,784
And I've wanted to say this
for the longest time. I just…

28
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,079
I've never had the guts.

29
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,373
Until now.

30
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,877
Lex, I love you.

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,883
Will you be my girlfriend?

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,095
- I am here.
- Excited much?

33
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,556
Shut up. Time to go surprise him.

34
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,598
Good luck.

35
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,856
I don't think it's gonna work out.

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,451
Gaila?

37
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,763
Creating the perfect drink is an art.

38
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,975
It's more than just mixing ingredients.

39
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,812
It's about understanding
the balance, flavors, textures.

40
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,231
You have to choose the right glass,

41
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,941
the right ice, right pour.

42
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,738
It's about using the finest ingredients
and paying attention to every detail.

43
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,116
Because the difference between
a good drink and great one

44
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,534
is in the details.

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,411
Everything must work in harmony.

46
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,080
And that's how you make a perfect drink.

47
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,917
It's like searching for the perfect love.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,421
You need the right mix, and settling
for anything less just won't do.

49
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,715
This tastes off.

50
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,050
It's that bad?

51
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,843
This place isn't my vibe.

52
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,262
But you know what?

53
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,099
I know a spot that's way better.

54
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:53,191
She's like a classic gimlet,
sharp, with a wit that keeps you on edge.

55
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,278
And her smile?
Tart, but somehow irresistible,

56
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,948
like the perfect balance of lime and gin.

57
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:05,370
But once the sweetness wears off,
the sharp bitterness stays behind.

58
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:12,752
Now her, she's like a tequila sunrise,
bold and confident.

59
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,130
Her presence,
it hits you with a sharp kick,

60
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,716
leaving a trail of warmth that lingers on.

61
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,845
Her energy sparks something in the air
and makes you want to lean in.

62
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:28,685
But just like tequila,
there's a burn that follows.

63
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,396
She's bold, spontaneous,

64
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,482
but not always easy to keep up with.

65
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,610
And her…

66
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,946
She's like a vodka spritz.

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,492
Refreshing with a bright burst
that makes everything feel lighter.

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,913
The sparkle in her eyes are like
bubbles rising to the surface,

69
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,082
drawing you in without even trying.

70
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,292
Yeah. Yes, please.

71
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,169
But then there's actually
more fizz than flavor.

72
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,589
After a while, the sparkle fizzles out

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,468
and everything about her
just feels watered down.

74
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,265
It's not working out.

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,685
I'll just go to the toilet
and I'm not coming back.

76
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,065
- As for me…
- Thanks.

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,818
…I guess you could say
I'm like this dirty martini,

78
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:23,614
sharp, polished, refined,
but clearly not for everyone.

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,034
An acquired taste.

80
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,370
Guarded, like this olive
at the bottom of the glass.

81
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:34,208
To really understand me,
you have to be willing to take your time.

82
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,961
All right, thank you, everyone!

83
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,838
Can I get some applause?

84
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,840
I hope you enjoyed our set.

85
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,634
Again, this has been Gaila.

86
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,803
I hope you had fun as much as I did.

87
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,264
Please, do order drinks from the bar,

88
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,600
especially if you're single.

89
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,561
The best for heartbreaks, a strong drink.

90
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,481
Let's have a round of applause
for my band.

91
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,900
I hope you guys enjoy
the rest of the night.

92
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,901
Thanks.

93
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,326
Voilà!

94
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,952
My latest concoction.

95
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,707
Shane's ultimate post-party drink
with extra moringa.

96
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,334
- Moringa?
- Yeah.

97
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,795
What happened to regular smoothies?

98
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,089
They're boring, bro.

99
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,882
The kids love the healthy stuff.

100
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,468
So?

101
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,346
It tastes like shit.

102
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,389
Why'd you go out drinking again?

103
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,685
Let me guess.

104
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,023
You had too much fun with those
adventure dates these past couple of days?

105
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,276
Dude, if you were on those dates,
you would need a drink yourself.

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,278
Okay, let me give you a rundown.

107
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,239
Three girls, bro.

108
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,406
Number one,

109
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,325
she was fine. Pretty.

110
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,868
Everything was going well.

111
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,287
Then, all of a sudden,
she started complaining

112
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,331
about everything!

113
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,084
Tastes bad and expensive.
Smells awful too!

114
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,252
Who thought of this?

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,505
The second girl…

116
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,925
I don't even think I got a chance
to say a single word, bro.

117
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,343
It's so hard being a girl.

118
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,637
- It's so hard to wear heels.
- No--

119
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,014
And you know my one main reason right now?

120
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,183
- How do I keep my nails so glossy?
- Nothing--

121
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,644
And you have bags collected… It's like…

122
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,147
Then the third one…

123
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,648
Hi, guys!

124
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,693
I'm here at the bar right now
with my date.

125
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,239
I don't wanna talk about the third one.

126
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,366
- Go, go, go.
- No, nope.

127
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,076
Is this what dating is nowadays?

128
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,871
It's just swipe, swipe, attraction?

129
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,290
And then small talk? And then…

130
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,541
That's it?

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,418
I… I just want--

132
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,586
Alexia.

133
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,130
Alexia.

134
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,214
Alexia, Alexia, Alexia.

135
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,552
Bro, every girl is a Alexia checklist.

136
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,220
Hear me out.

137
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,307
- We listen, we don't judge, okay?
- Yeah.

138
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,644
Her scholarship in France is almost over.

139
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,688
Wait, dude, listen.

140
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,649
She said she doesn't want distractions.

141
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,567
She said…

142
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,738
But even if I'll be away,
I hope we can still be friends.

143
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,450
Maybe when she comes back,
we can give it another chance.

144
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,576
I don't know.

145
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,495
Bro, it's been an effing year.

146
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,290
Move on, bro. Move on.

147
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,630
All right! Thank you so much everyone,

148
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,840
and happy, happy Valentine's Day.

149
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,134
All you singles out there, don't worry.

150
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,594
We're here together!

151
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,638
Enjoy the rest of your night.

152
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,890
- Thank you.
- Here's your martini.

153
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,350
Stirred just right.

154
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,310
- Perfect. Thanks.
- Frosted glass, three olives.

155
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,269
- Jimmy.
- Yes?

156
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,397
Where's my phone? And one beer, please.

157
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,566
Tabs are for paying customers.

158
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,485
Come on! Please?

159
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,321
It's Valentine's Day. Please? Please?

160
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,490
- I knew it.
- This is the last.

161
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,367
- Don't forget your phone.
- Thank you.

162
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,161
Miss, sorry, it's taken.

163
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,333
- I'm sorry. The seat is taken. Okay.
- The seat is taken, yeah.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,710
Wait, you're taken?

165
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,796
I thought you were single.

166
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,882
I should have asked your girlfriend first.

167
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,177
No, miss, I mean the seat is for my date.

168
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,720
She's on the way I think.

169
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,306
Well, in between waiting for your date,

170
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,018
I'll hang here.
I'm just waiting for my ride.

171
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,531
Can I ask you something?

172
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,868
If you don't mind, I'm just curious.

173
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,124
You're with someone new every night.

174
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,334
Just between us…

175
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,669
Are you a gigolo?

176
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,130
What?

177
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,548
I'm not judgmental.

178
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,884
I'm not one to judge.

179
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,303
I'm just curious.

180
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,554
Is the money good?

181
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,640
Maybe I can give it a shot.
I might make it.

182
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,394
No, I'm not a gigolo.

183
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,564
Really? Then what's your deal?

184
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,567
How about this…

185
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,571
If I can figure out why you're dating
someone new every night,

186
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,283
you'll buy me this bottle.

187
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,243
- That one beer?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,287
How about it?

189
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,788
Sure, why not?

190
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,582
Okay. Game.

191
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,175
You're too prim and proper
to be a fuckboy.

192
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,262
And you're not flirty enough
to be a playboy.

193
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,224
And I'm not a stalker, okay.
I'm just observant.

194
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,603
But your go-to drink is a martini.

195
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:50,274
Stirred, not shaken.
Frosted glass with exactly three olives.

196
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,027
You hate it if it's even a little off.

197
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,155
I know your type.

198
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,867
Men that are hard to please.

199
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,579
Interesting. Okay,
you've got my attention.

200
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,623
- I wanna hear the rest. Continue.
- Okay.

201
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,001
So, you're jumping
from one date to the next

202
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,547
'cause you want to fill that space
that's been left by someone.

203
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,302
Your heart got wrecked.

204
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,807
And you're hoping that the next girl
would make your heart whole again.

205
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,268
But then again, you're hard to please.

206
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,271
It's not love you're scared of.

207
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,816
It's making the wrong choice.

208
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,444
How about that?

209
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,947
I've got you down to a tee.

210
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,617
- Tab's on him, Jimmy.
- Wait, wait, wait.

211
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,744
Okay, let's say…

212
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,621
Let's say you're onto something.

213
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:50,543
But isn't that the whole point of dating?
Is to meet somebody you connect with?

214
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,921
Not just these meaningless
hookups, meetups? It's…

215
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,757
I mean, eventually,
you want to marry the person,

216
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,845
have kids, start a family, right?

217
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,765
I mean, yes, okay, it's hard.
Especially on a day like Valentine's.

218
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,435
- What a sad excuse for a holiday.
- Right?

219
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,437
It's just commercial bullshit.

220
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,523
So they can sell greeting cards, flowers…

221
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,233
- Chocolates.
- Chocolates.

222
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,277
True.

223
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,240
Okay. My turn.

224
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,199
Your turn?

225
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,534
My turn to guess.

226
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,743
Fine.

227
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,998
- This is easy.
- Easy? Okay.

228
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,416
A beer drinker.

229
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,336
The exterior is very tough.

230
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,296
Rugged.

231
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,630
Cool.

232
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,593
But deep down, you got hurt, too.

233
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,013
You've been shattered.

234
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,516
And deep, deep, deep down,

235
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,519
you just wanna be loved and to love.

236
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,063
Just like everybody else.
It's all the same.

237
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,775
- Wrong!
- No way! You're lying!

238
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,235
True love? Please.

239
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,321
Do you think this is a fairy tale?

240
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,157
Do I seem like
the fairy-tale princess to you?

241
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,410
True love my foot!
I'm done with true love, come on.

242
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,622
I swear it's best
to keep things light and casual.

243
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,668
Especially if you're scared of getting
hurt. If you're searching for "the one,"

244
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,295
good luck.

245
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,505
You won't find it.

246
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,758
Especially someone as hard
to please as you. Good luck.

247
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,847
Excuse me.

248
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,308
Hello, you're here?

249
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,351
I'm leaving.

250
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,144
I won't take long.

251
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,729
Thanks for the beer.

252
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,814
Good luck on finding true love.

253
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,566
Hey, Jimmy!

254
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,496
Every sip I've had recently
doesn't quite hit the spot,

255
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,498
but this girl…

256
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,834
I've always wanted to…

257
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,380
She's like a glass of rosé,
light and refreshing,

258
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,091
with just the right amount of sweetness.

259
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,178
Each word she says is like another sip,
leaving me wanting more.

260
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:13,018
For the first time in a long time,
I'm actually enjoying the conversation.

261
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,651
Maybe that random girl was wrong about me.

262
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,195
I'm not hard to please.

263
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,038
Can you believe this?

264
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,000
Six thousand? Are they serious?

265
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,253
I made more off
a drunk foreigner's tip last night!

266
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,254
Unbelievable!

267
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:45,134
They're not going to cover me
if I blow out a vocal cord.

268
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,554
We agreed on 15,000, not 6,000!

269
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,807
Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck you all!

270
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,478
Let's forget about everything.

271
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,565
Can we just… just have some fun tonight?

272
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,150
Right?

273
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,944
Kiss me.

274
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,281
Wait, wait, wait.

275
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,742
Son of a bitch!

276
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,244
Sorry, excuse me.

277
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,332
Gaila, I've been calling the whole day.

278
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,668
Just because your rent's due,
you won't answer my calls?

279
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,797
Hey, Miss Jane. I'm really sorry,

280
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:28,177
I just got busy at work.
But I'm not avoiding you.

281
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,471
Stop with the excuses.

282
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,307
You better pay me
or else I'll throw you out.

283
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,894
No, please, ma'am!

284
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,315
Promise, I'll make sure it's paid
by the end of the week.

285
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,192
I should get a discount.

286
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,486
I'm hardly ever home.

287
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,404
Damn.

288
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,283
Bullshit!

289
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,244
Fuck this!
My problems just keep piling up!

290
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,960
- Sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

291
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,130
I know we're keeping things casual.

292
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,799
But…

293
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,054
can I possibly
crash at your place tonight?

294
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,306
Just for tonight.

295
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,352
Yeah, about that…

296
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,482
Bubbles!

297
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,159
Girl,

298
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,661
what happened this time?

299
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,913
Can we stay here for a while?

300
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,085
Sorry about this.
I had no one else to call.

301
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,129
To quote Mandy Moore…

302
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,007
You're my only hope

303
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,886
I'd be more offended
if you hadn't called me first.

304
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:59,101
So, welcome to Chateau Heaven,
open for Gaila 24/7.

305
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,520
Are you sure? Won't Jay get mad?

306
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,689
Don't worry about him.

307
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,025
He's not even here, he's busy working.

308
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,193
It's lonely being here by myself.

309
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,948
Thank you, thank you!
You're the absolute best.

310
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,199
Of course.

311
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,118
But…

312
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,538
I know it's sensitive.

313
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,459
But why not just take
your apartment back from Tristan?

314
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,170
Aren't you almost done paying for it?

315
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:31,425
And I don't understand
why you had to be the one to leave.

316
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,385
Didn't he cheat on you?

317
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,431
He's not just a cheater, he's ugly too.
Cheaters never win, right?

318
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:42,352
- I want to strangle him.
- Let's just calm down.

319
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,188
I'm never going back there.

320
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,190
It will just dampen my mood.

321
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,068
Imagine all the memories? No.

322
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,029
He and his ugly instructor
deserve each other.

323
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,823
Besides, I've moved on.

324
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,246
You don't believe me?
I swear I've moved on.

325
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,832
And I promise I won't annoy you.

326
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,251
I'll only be here for a couple of days.

327
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,087
- All right. Game.
- Game?

328
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,422
- No problem. Cheers!
- Cheers!

329
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,436
So, I saw your profile.

330
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,189
And I saw that you love to travel?

331
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,858
In your last post, you were in Milan?

332
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,820
- I've spent six years in Milan.
- Cool!

333
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,407
I spent such a long time.
My career has taken me all across Europe.

334
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:38,992
That's cool.

335
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,496
Paris, Fashion Week, London.

336
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,541
But you know, I'm in my forties.

337
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,418
I want to settle down a bit.

338
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,838
So I'm doing more local AVPs,

339
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,799
some high-profile shoots.

340
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,259
And you?

341
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,802
Let me guess.

342
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,304
Model?

343
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,556
- Really?
- Yeah.

344
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,225
- Come on.
- I mean, look at you.

345
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,352
Your flawless skin,

346
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,479
big beautiful eyes…

347
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,231
You think?

348
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,941
…kissable lips.

349
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,778
If you want me to be a model,

350
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,946
I can be.

351
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,408
But, no. I'm a freelance makeup artist.

352
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,826
Just three months in.

353
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,037
It's fun, but the work's inconsistent.

354
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,456
Some days, I'm fully booked,

355
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,376
and other days, it's crickets.

356
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,211
But I keep busy.

357
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,380
I do graphic design on the side.

358
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,965
How about this?

359
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,884
If you want,

360
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,969
why don't you join me for my shoots?

361
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,599
It's time for me to give back
to young talent like yourself.

362
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,895
- Strictly professional, of course.
- Of course.

363
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,980
Strictly.

364
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,318
Oh, shit!

365
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,282
Hello? Dad?

366
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,078
Mr. Corpuz called me last night. Twice.

367
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,206
They fixed the property for today's shoot.

368
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,377
I heard your host backed out last minute.

369
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,878
Are you on top of this?

370
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,756
Yes, Dad, I'm on top of this.

371
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,217
Shane, let me remind you,

372
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,886
this is a multi-million peso listing.

373
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,516
So don't botch this, okay? Got it?

374
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,684
Or we lose them.

375
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,935
We won't lose them, Dad.

376
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,272
I got this. I'm gonna find
a replacement host right now.

377
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,649
- Okay.
- Good.

378
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,568
Remember, this is your project.

379
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,987
Okay. Bye.

380
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,573
Babe, what's wrong?

381
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,703
The host backed out last minute.

382
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,497
Now, I have to find
a replacement. Right now.

383
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,959
Babe, hello, I can be the host.

384
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,336
I can totally do that for you.

385
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,423
It's gonna be so much fun!

386
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,760
We're just going for a fresh look today.

387
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,845
Do you like it?

388
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,223
Can we go lighter on the concealer?

389
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,766
It's too much.

390
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,730
Okay. No problem. Look up.

391
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,234
I'll just smudge it out. Okay, check.

392
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,777
Hey. Just checking in.

393
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,950
- Hi!
- Hi.

394
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,203
Hi, sir. I'm Gaila, makeup artist.

395
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,332
Hi. Shane from Jade Properties.

396
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,376
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

397
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,715
This is Sammie.
Sammie is our model for today.

398
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,091
- We've met.
- Yeah.

399
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,968
Yeah. And she's my girlfriend.

400
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,387
Wow, girlfriend.

401
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,473
You look good together.

402
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,725
Good luck. Excuse me.

403
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,937
- How are you? You good?
- Good. Do I look good?

404
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,900
Daddy, I made this project for art class.
The teacher gave me an A-plus.

405
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,318
That's my kid.

406
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,195
I'm so proud of you, baby.

407
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,781
But I'll see it later.
Let me talk to Mommy.

408
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,824
- Okay.
- Mommy?

409
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,535
Hello. She keeps asking for you.

410
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,996
What time will you be home? We miss you!

411
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,748
Maybe tomorrow, baby.

412
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah. Looks like
the shoot's going to run late.

413
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,001
I see.

414
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,172
So, don't wait for me.
But I'll see you guys soon, okay?

415
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,507
Okay, hon.

416
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,718
All right, ten minutes, we'll start.

417
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,303
- Ten? We're ready now.
- Yeah.

418
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,429
- Now?
- Yeah.

419
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,347
- Ready?
- Yeah.

420
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,599
- It's upstairs.
- See you. All right.

421
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,267
Do you want to try this?

422
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,938
It complements your eyeshadow.

423
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,275
Okay, this is your time to shine.
You're the expert here,

424
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,571
you have to know all the details
of this house, where it's from, et cetera.

425
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,657
Call the cameras! Let's go for a take.

426
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,574
Camera.
Rolling!

427
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,409
Action.

428
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,705
So this house was rebuilt
and redesigned to look modern…

429
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,166
contemporary…

430
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,127
house.

431
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,378
To look modern…

432
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,255
To be a contemporary house.

433
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,173
Contemporary house.

434
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,926
So the lot area for this house is around…

435
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,847
- Can we… Can we take this again?
- Nine… inch?

436
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,306
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

437
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,227
It's "modern contemporary"
and "900 square meters".

438
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,271
And it was built in the 19…

439
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,731
- 1970s!
- '70s, that's it. Okay.

440
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,817
Sorry. Let's do another one.

441
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,530
So, a brief history about this house.
This house was built in 1970s.

442
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:14,619
So this house was rebuilt and remodeled
to be a modern contemporary house.

443
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,539
So the lot area of this house is around

444
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,791
eight hundred…

445
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,751
- Sorry.
- Go ahead.

446
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,378
Nine. Nine hundred.

447
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,838
Nine hundred, and then…

448
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,091
Your face is just a bit too serious.

449
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,719
Smile. So the viewers…

450
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,931
You want them to think this will be
the best decision of their life, okay?

451
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,558
Babe?

452
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,809
- Okay.
- Okay.

453
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,228
- One more!
- One more, please.

454
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,771
- Everybody, one more.
- Okay.

455
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,981
From the top.

456
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,400
So, a brief history about this house.

457
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,652
This house was built in the 1970s…

458
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,863
Cut. Sorry, cut.

459
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,406
Makeup!

460
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,490
Makeup.

461
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,452
Yes, sir?

462
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,121
Can you do something about the eyes?

463
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,498
- They don't look good.
- Okay.

464
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,542
- I got it.
- Thank you. I'm sorry again.

465
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,793
- That will be…
- I'm…

466
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,170
Yeah, okay.

467
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,630
Can you make it two?

468
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,131
Yep. Look up.

469
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,509
Why is it green?

470
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,844
For color correction.

471
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,804
I stand corrected.

472
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,059
Can you also smile a little, babe?

473
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,187
"This house was built…" Do it like that.

474
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,439
I have an idea for this shoot.

475
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,441
Yeah, babe, go ahead. What is it?

476
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,151
It's called walking the hell out!

477
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,404
What's this?

478
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,574
I just saw the video shoot rushes.

479
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,328
Your host lacks energy and presence.

480
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,746
Come on, Shane.

481
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,124
How can you expect to take over a firm

482
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,502
if you can't handle a simple shoot?

483
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,545
Yes, Dad. I know.

484
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,131
I promise I'll take care of this.

485
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,135
Babe?

486
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,347
Babe, are you okay?

487
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,392
I'm breaking up with you.

488
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,726
What?

489
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,021
Shane, I'm so tired of you.

490
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,316
This has been the most
exhausting relationship.

491
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,902
We've been only together for what?
Three months?

492
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,114
Wait. Is this about the shoot, babe?

493
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,617
Babe, I was doing that for you.
I wanted you to look good!

494
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,411
You're always trying to fix me!

495
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,206
From my makeup to my clothes,
and even my grammar!

496
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,250
Can I just live my life?

497
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,674
Worst shoot ever. The stress! God.

498
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,969
You want to destress?

499
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,098
It's over! I'm so tired!
I'm so done with you!

500
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,182
Get out!

501
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,559
Get out!

502
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,770
- And you're not even good in bed!
- What the fuck?

503
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,188
I've been faking it!

504
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,816
It was improv and I fucking nailed it!

505
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,237
Mr. Albert, can you give me a ride?
I want to leave this shitshow behind.

506
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,908
I'm not good in bed?

507
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,043
I don't know where to start.

508
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,003
Let's just grab a drink.

509
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,299
I mean, really, dude?

510
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:19,012
Telling everyone she was faking it?

511
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,474
Fuck, that's so embarrassing.

512
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,893
You know what?
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

513
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,562
She was nothing like Alexia anyway.

514
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:31,566
Will you stop stressing over
your love life?

515
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,527
Welcome back to the single club.

516
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,946
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

517
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,200
Yuck!
You okay?

518
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,411
I have a question.

519
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,457
What was going on
with you and the photographer?

520
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,958
That was a bit scandalous.

521
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,923
That's nothing.
Just a no-strings fling with that DILF.

522
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,801
Until I found out he's got a whole family.

523
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,096
Casual hookups are fine, no problem.

524
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,433
But getting involved with a family man?

525
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,394
That's where I draw the line.

526
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,855
Love always ends one way.

527
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,857
It's either…

528
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,569
you stick with it
even when you're unhappy,

529
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,948
or… you love fully

530
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,659
just to get cheated on.

531
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,619
That's deep.

532
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,124
Is that your ex?

533
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,126
Maybe you'll get back together.

534
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,962
"Baby, I love you… I love you, babe!"

535
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,005
Stop it.

536
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,549
Pick it up!

537
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,844
It's my dad.

538
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,889
You know, real estate
is practically in my blood.

539
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,144
Before I even had the choice
to decide what I wanna do,

540
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,188
I already had the office, the job…

541
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,023
You're still not happy?

542
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,443
- Yeah, no.
- Unbelievable.

543
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,987
What do you really want?

544
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,615
I wanna open a speakeasy.

545
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,703
I want a place that's laid-back,
I can be myself…

546
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,996
People can come in

547
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,167
and I can make their lives
a little bit lighter because of my drinks.

548
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,209
You know?

549
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:18,131
But Dad says no,
because real estate is more practical.

550
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,800
You know, it's more realistic.

551
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,427
But fuck that shit, right?

552
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,431
You're not gonna do it
because someone told you?

553
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,640
Pretty much.

554
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,059
Fuck that shit, for real!

555
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,441
I just don't want to fail.

556
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,568
What do you mean?

557
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,278
It's normal to fail.

558
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:45,158
You think you can just open a bar
and expect magic to happen?

559
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:49,037
That's not how it works, man.
You have to claim it! Work for it.

560
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,497
Gain experience.

561
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,415
Just keep going!

562
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,501
Right?

563
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,504
You just don't want to do it.

564
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,005
No, enough about me.

565
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,174
You… I mean, I've seen you sing.

566
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,052
- I've seen you do makeup.
- Yes.

567
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,304
What's your deal? What and who are you?

568
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:11,017
Why put myself in a box?

569
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,313
As long as it's
something creative, I'm in.

570
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,774
Being a makeup artist is fun.

571
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,319
The work's great,
but gigs can be hard to find.

572
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,280
That's why I started graphic design.

573
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,657
I'm Jill-of-all-trades.

574
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,325
Graphic artist?

575
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,577
You're really talented.

576
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,121
- No, seriously. I mean, your parents--
- Thank you.

577
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,458
No, I'm serious.
Your parents must be proud.

578
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,170
Proud? They all packed up and left.

579
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,216
My father left us when I was three.

580
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,345
Mom married a foreigner

581
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,681
and moved to Canada.

582
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,808
Eventually, all my siblings followed.

583
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,644
They want me to go too.

584
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,396
I was like, "No!"

585
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,897
What will I do there?

586
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,649
Mom told me,

587
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,986
"Marry a rich man
so your future's all set."

588
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,989
No way! I can take care of myself!

589
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,824
I can survive on my own.

590
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,909
I can manage myself.

591
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,787
But I don't know.

592
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,124
It feels like
I'm not getting anywhere here either.

593
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,792
You know what?

594
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,129
Maybe, just maybe, hear me out.

595
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,924
If you put all your efforts
and focus it on one thing,

596
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:29,220
maybe become successful.
I mean, there's a bigger chance, right?

597
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,306
It goes the same way with dating.

598
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,852
If you just focus on dating
or finding that one person,

599
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:41,357
you'll save all this time you're spending
with the wrong people.

600
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,193
Right?

601
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,615
Is that so? Fine.

602
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,450
I'll take your advice,

603
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,244
if you follow mine.

604
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,997
Okay.

605
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,083
You know what, you should enjoy life more.

606
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:04,631
Do you get me,
Mr. Serious Relationships Only?

607
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,091
You should start dating around.

608
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,927
No strings, no pressure…

609
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,929
Stop looking for love.

610
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,391
Fine, okay.

611
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:21,689
Then let tonight be the beginning
of my casual dating era.

612
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,775
- No more looking for love.
- Yes!

613
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,943
Just fun?

614
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,070
Yeah?

615
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,739
I'm not even sure. You have to teach me.

616
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,075
What do I have to do? What do I do?

617
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,869
Do you know what else sucks
about breakups?

618
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,787
What?

619
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,081
You're not only breaking up
with the person,

620
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,584
you're breaking up with his whole family

621
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,919
- and friends.
- And friends.

622
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,963
And you love them too.

623
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,840
And when they send messages
asking how you're doing,

624
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,677
even though they didn't do anything wrong,
you just want to say, "Screw you!"

625
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,262
You changed your whole life for them…

626
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,932
Even your friend groups.

627
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,934
It's so hard.

628
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,019
- You're used to going out together.
- Right?

629
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,606
But now it's too awkward to hang out.

630
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,191
Everyone has to adjust.

631
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,276
Even worse when they all hang out together

632
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,153
- and leave you out.
- And leave you out!

633
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,656
Shit, that hurts.

634
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,701
I'm drunk. Let's go home.

635
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,869
You wanna dance?

636
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,163
Dance?

637
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,544
- Watch out!
- Ouch!

638
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,676
- You know what's funny?
- What?

639
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,679
- Why does alcohol--
- I better find this funny.

640
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,015
I guess it's not that fun. Shut up.

641
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,476
We drink alcohol even if it's bad for us.

642
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,020
- Why do you drink?
- I don't know.

643
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,063
- Why do I drink?
- No idea.

644
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,148
You're bad for me.

645
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,026
We even celebrate it.

646
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,403
- When we're sad, we drink.
- We still drink.

647
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,488
- When we're happy, we drink.
- We celebrate.

648
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,407
- When I'm mad, I buy--
- Alcohol.

649
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,324
Actually--

650
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,993
What am I doing with my life?

651
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,287
Even if there's no reason to,
we still drink.

652
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,497
- Do you know why?
- Why?

653
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,624
It's delicious.

654
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,460
That's true.

655
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,254
- Here's the thing--
- No. I can walk.

656
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,506
Sure… Hey! Sorry.

657
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,008
I'm fine.

658
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,135
Who do you want to fight tonight?

659
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,888
No one, you warfreak.

660
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,182
Sometimes we want what we can't have.

661
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,017
- Things that are bad for us.
- Yeah.

662
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,602
Like… love.

663
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,855
- Wow, deep!
- That's deep!

664
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,440
That's deep!

665
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,568
- That wasn't bad for a one-night stand.
- Well?

666
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,320
It was okay.

667
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,281
Different.

668
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,575
So, you faked it?

669
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,453
I'll head out now.
Got a workshop to catch.

670
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,415
Fuck. Back to reality.

671
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,544
Well, at least we had a break in between.

672
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,673
I wish the break in between
lasted forever.

673
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,301
Come on.

674
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,386
I'll go ahead.

675
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,221
Bye.

676
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,312
Wait.

677
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,897
What if…

678
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,152
What if we become each other's
in betweens?

679
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,865
What does that mean? We can

680
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,325
link up,

681
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,827
have sex,

682
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,079
drink,

683
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,081
talk about our feelings?

684
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,209
Yeah.

685
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,668
All of the above.

686
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,961
But…

687
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,174
What if we end up in relationships?

688
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,135
Okay.

689
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,515
If we fall in love
with other people, we'll end this.

690
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,312
Sure. But there better be no gross drama
if one of us gets taken.

691
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,563
Yes, agree.

692
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,482
No asking, "Where are you?"

693
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,985
"Why aren't you answering my texts?"

694
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,155
Because we're not
each other's priority, right?

695
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,156
Right.

696
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,826
Because our priority
is to fix our lives and figure shit out.

697
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,746
Okay, agree.

698
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,248
- Okay?
- Agree.

699
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,669
What now?

700
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,296
What if you fall in love with me?

701
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,301
Or what if one day, all of a sudden,
you decide you want to start a family?

702
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,762
Wow! Me, really?

703
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,223
Aren't you the soft one between us?

704
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,684
As if! Keep dreaming.

705
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,311
I don't want to be your wife.
I'll never marry you.

706
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,231
Okay, same here.
I don't wanna marry you either.

707
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,066
- Good. Perfect.
- Great.

708
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,567
- Okay.
- Deal.

709
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,862
All right. Bye.

710
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,578
This part's interesting.

711
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,373
- You've watched this before?
- No. Just a feeling.

712
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,126
All horror movies are the same.

713
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,629
I told you!

714
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,756
Okay, Mr. I Have A Dream Bar

715
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,050
and I'm An Alcohol Expert.

716
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,927
- Alcoholic. Yeah?
- Enlighten me.

717
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,430
What's the difference
between draft and craft beer?

718
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,597
Check this out.

719
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,557
- Oh, sure.
- Okay.

720
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,183
Leave this to me.

721
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,476
Go to the next one.

722
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,020
How about Angelica?

723
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,813
- Bad news?
- Yeah.

724
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,107
So nice to meet you, Doc.

725
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,817
Philip.

726
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,820
"Doc" gives off hospital vibes.

727
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,489
Okay, I'm sorry, Philip.

728
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,325
How are you?

729
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:51,037
So draft beer, it's just
when you put it inside the keg,

730
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,789
- and it looks nice because of the tap.
- Okay, got it.

731
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,960
Craft beer is made by small businesses
and has a unique taste.

732
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,087
I'm looking for something serious.

733
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,130
Me too.

734
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,300
Playing games gets old, doesn't it?

735
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,267
What else do you do? Hobbies and such.

736
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,896
Well, more creative. I'm a makeup artist.

737
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,899
I take on all kinds of gigs.

738
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,901
Personally, I want a family.

739
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,111
I'm ready to settle down.

740
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,906
- That's good to hear.
- I'm finally serious about life.

741
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,949
How will I find "the one" that way?

742
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,409
- You're right.
- Please.

743
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,452
Friendzoned him.

744
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,579
She even said to me,

745
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,332
I'm a golden retriever type or something?

746
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,793
I can see it.

747
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,544
Wow.

748
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,671
What does that even mean?
Who made that up?

749
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,598
Aren't muscular men just

750
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,560
overcompensating for having
small dick energy?

751
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,021
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure he takes whey protein.

752
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,580
Big dick? Doesn't matter.
It's all about the motion of the ocean.

753
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,041
So it's like people, huh?

754
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,210
- I guess?
- Some are boring

755
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,629
and some are more exciting?

756
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,797
Kind of.

757
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,090
- Yeah.
- Complicated?

758
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,341
Yeah.

759
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,342
Which one am I?

760
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,429
You're the drink I never knew I needed.

761
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,348
But since I got a taste…

762
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,564
Is it even true when people say,

763
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,399
they'd rather choose

764
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,901
a career over a relationship?

765
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,278
Can't they have both?

766
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,738
No, there's no way
it works out perfectly like that.

767
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,909
If perfection existed, you'd miss
the little good things in life.

768
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,829
- Like?
- Little good things like this.

769
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,627
Good company, good vibes,
good music, good drink.

770
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,795
Me?

771
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,547
Me?

772
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,218
- A threesome could work.
- Sure, yeah.

773
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,678
Two guys? I mean…

774
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,221
Sorry.

775
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,182
- Three people?
- Have you experienced it?

776
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,142
- Who knows.
- Wow!

777
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,107
- Feels good, right?
- Don't you dare--

778
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,989
It's wet? Why is it wet?

779
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,258
- Fuck! I have to go.
- Shit! I have to go.

780
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,387
I cracked it, bro. I cracked it.

781
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,973
Cracked what? Cracked… life?

782
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,435
Brother, love? Lust? Two different things.

783
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,354
Yes!

784
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,189
So, lust, you can just have fun.

785
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,566
No strings attached,
no emotions, no anything.

786
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,319
You can just have fun,
and do all those things,

787
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,404
and that's the code. I cracked it.

788
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,950
So you're simply saying you're joining
the no-strings-attached club.

789
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,992
Exactly.

790
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,619
You got it.

791
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,662
Good for you.

792
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,871
- I mean--
- Great for me.

793
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,541
- Good for you. Look at you!
- Wonderful for me.

794
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,625
You look good!

795
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,418
- Right?
- Is this a rebrand?

796
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,797
I mean, I love it.

797
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,967
I like this you better
than the one who cries all the time.

798
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,009
Over Alexia.

799
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,680
Let's not say her name.

800
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,306
- Yeah.
- Her?

801
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,975
- Her.
- Her.

802
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,852
But I am… I am. I'm over her.

803
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,604
I don't even think about her,

804
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,523
I don't daydream about her,

805
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:51,527
I don't get crazy nightmares about her.
I'm… It's over.

806
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,112
It's over. Completely over.

807
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,782
That's good. I mean,
when did you learn how to sleep around?

808
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,870
Let's just say somebody taught me
that you can have fun in life

809
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,373
without making things too complicated.

810
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,875
This collateral is fine.

811
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,919
But I still have some tweaks.

812
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,424
The company's branding
has to be warm and artisanal,

813
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,466
but also sleek.

814
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,802
Nothing too rustic.

815
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,887
But also not too modern.

816
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,723
The colors should be warm,

817
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,058
but also cool.

818
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:30,649
Okay, sir. So, warm colors,
but also cool. Yes.

819
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,945
Oh, we don't have additional budget
to buy a specific font.

820
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,616
We want it a bit handwritten and raw.

821
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,868
Could you paint it yourself?

822
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
Myself?

823
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,874
Sorry, hold on, sir.

824
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:51,879
These are pretty major revisions,
but the deadline's immediate?

825
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:52,880
Correct.

826
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:57,009
Also, the café's opening
got moved up to next month.

827
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,219
I need the signage in three days.

828
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,227
Okay, sir. I'll figure something out.

829
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,813
Okay, thanks. Bye.

830
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,692
Warm but cool? What the hell?

831
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,030
Las Islas Filipinas
is so rich with history.

832
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:21,617
And did you know that it was named
after King Philip II of Spain?

833
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:26,789
And during that time, the archipelago
was considered a key factor

834
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,499
in the Spanish expansion.

835
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,710
That's so interesting, Prof.

836
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,878
It's like--

837
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,298
But it's not just about
the geographical label.

838
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,301
Las Islas Filipinas is… has a deep…

839
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,512
Here you go.

840
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,641
So, Sarah… Sarah, right?

841
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,642
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

842
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,644
I didn't get to ask you earlier,

843
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,939
what's your idea of, like, a good time?

844
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,734
Travel? Shopping? Food?

845
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,777
A foodie?

846
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,658
I just want some peace and quiet.

847
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,953
You know, just watching the world go by.

848
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:06,995
A homebody.

849
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:11,250
What's the difference
between draft and craft beer?

850
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,672
Why would I want to know that?

851
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,632
Anyway, going back…

852
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:24,138
Every island of Las Islas Filipinas
is a piece of a larger puzzle.

853
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,891
They all contribute to the cultural…

854
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,477
It just feels nice to zone out for a bit.

855
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,147
Excuse me.

856
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,569
@GAILA: Where are you?

857
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:42,322
@SHANE: On a date. It's the worst.

858
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,034
…geographical historical landscape

859
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,078
called the Philippines.

860
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:52,249
And I'm just so proud to know
this thing about Las Islas Filipinas.

861
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,462
Sorry, hold on.

862
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,005
Hello?

863
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,007
Hello?

864
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,676
Where are you?
You lost Grandma in the mall?

865
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,719
What?

866
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,345
Grandma's missing?

867
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,514
She's 80 years old.

868
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,225
I told you to watch her.

869
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,562
Papa will get mad when he finds out.

870
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,731
Fine, I'm heading there.

871
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,901
I'm on my way. Yes, okay. Bye.

872
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,904
I'm so sorry.

873
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,655
- Family emergency.
- It's fine.

874
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,781
I have to go.

875
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,782
Are you okay?

876
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,867
I'm so sorry.

877
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,204
I think I have to go.
I have a family emergency.

878
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,163
I'm really sorry.

879
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,456
It's okay.

880
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,500
Excuse me.

881
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,804
- Looks good, I think.
- Here.

882
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,639
- Wow, thanks.
- Sure.

883
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,559
This client is driving me crazy.

884
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:37,604
They think revising a logo is so easy.

885
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,981
What am I, a magician?

886
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,275
That's how it is at first.

887
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,359
But knowing you…

888
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,237
I'm sure you love the challenge.

889
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,781
You know, it's all
gonna be worth it in the end.

890
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,157
And if you need help,

891
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,827
I'm right here, aren't I?

892
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,537
Okay.

893
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,623
You said you lived here
with your best friend?

894
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,084
Yeah, but she's not here now.

895
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,838
She's in Palawan,
on vacation with her boyfriend,

896
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,674
while I'm slaving away for money.

897
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,176
You need a break.

898
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,678
Destress.

899
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,054
You said it.

900
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,765
Let's hit up Long Bar later.

901
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,976
They have a new menu I want you to try.

902
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,561
I'm down.

903
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,438
You seem inspired today.

904
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,984
What can I say? I guess…

905
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,570
Mixing drinks is my way of

906
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,948
making something good
out of something that once hurt.

907
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,826
That's deep.

908
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,996
By the way, what did your dad say
about your bar plan?

909
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,129
Actually, I haven't told him yet.

910
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,050
What? You haven't told him, why not?

911
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,972
Look, he wants me to do
a new project this month.

912
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,891
Imagine if I just left the group.

913
00:48:56,475 --> 00:49:00,896
Can't I just open the bar
without him finding out?

914
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,482
What if I hit you on the head?

915
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,608
Tell him.

916
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,986
No matter how he reacts,

917
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,946
whether he's supportive or not,

918
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,449
you'll still be moving forward
with your dream.

919
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,660
And that in itself is a win.

920
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,844
That must be your dad.

921
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,846
You're in trouble.

922
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,606
I have a date.

923
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,651
Right now. She's there right now.

924
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,568
Now?

925
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,987
Yeah.

926
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,491
Well, the fuckboy's got himself a date.

927
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,161
Hurry up. Don't be late.

928
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,083
So…

929
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,128
no Long Bar tonight.

930
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,255
Yeah, obviously.

931
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,297
Okay.

932
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,591
- You can make it up to me.
- I'll make it up to you.

933
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,009
- You owe me.
- Yes.

934
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,761
- Go on.
- Bye.

935
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,846
Enjoy.

936
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,140
"Enjoy"?

937
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,312
- Bye.
- Bye.

938
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:36,366
@MOM: Hi, Gaila, how are you?

939
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,828
Which movie did you like more, Philip?

940
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,038
The horror or the comedy?

941
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,206
The comedy.

942
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,751
The kid was super cute.

943
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,463
Reminded me of my patient last week.

944
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,840
He wouldn't take his meds.

945
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,760
I had to sing by his bed

946
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,219
so he'd take them.

947
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:57,929
So I did.

948
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,055
You sang to him?

949
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,057
Complete with hand gestures.

950
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,726
Take your medicine

951
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,187
Get well soon

952
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,730
- You're good!
- Then he took his meds.

953
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,107
- A doctor and a singer.
- Super good.

954
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,985
Are you sure you're not AI-generated?

955
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,822
You know, I haven't seen
any red flags from you yet.

956
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,366
But I'm sure you have one.

957
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,995
I bet you're a secret heartbreaker.

958
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,455
Gosh.

959
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,916
No secret heartbreak, promise.

960
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,960
I think my red flag

961
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,130
is having a low tolerance for alcohol.

962
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,133
- Really? How low?
- I try to avoid drinking.

963
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,426
Two drinks.

964
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,346
And I start making

965
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,264
questionable life choices.

966
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,682
- Two drinks?
- Two.

967
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,728
Really? Wow, Doc, do I need to
carry you down these steps?

968
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,313
It's nothing like that.

969
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,440
You know what, you're funny.

970
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,859
Can I be honest with you?

971
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:53,777
Sure.

972
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:58,573
I've enjoyed our dates
these last few months.

973
00:51:58,657 --> 00:51:59,658
Me too.

974
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:04,329
I'm having a party at my place.

975
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,164
Weekend gathering with the family.

976
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,918
You can join us if you're free.
You're very welcome.

977
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,795
And… No pressure.

978
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,755
Only if you feel like it.

979
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,841
- This… this weekend?
- Yeah.

980
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,802
I have some errands.

981
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:23,139
But aren't you seeing other girls?
Maybe they'd want to come.

982
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,810
Hey, you're the only one
I want to be with.

983
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,230
Well…

984
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,695
I'm just not ready for that yet, Philip.

985
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,822
I think we're going too fast.

986
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,200
I can wait.

987
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,415
Jade Property's expansion in Makati
is already locked in.

988
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,375
It's a 20-hectare development.

989
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,377
Son,

990
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,629
this is the kind of project

991
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,840
that cements a legacy.

992
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,760
You are the next Santillanes
that will lead this firm.

993
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,096
It's always been you.

994
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,183
No.

995
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,270
No?

996
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,566
Dad, I spent my whole life
doing what you wanted.

997
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,195
Because that's what I thought
I needed to do to be the perfect son.

998
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,948
To make you proud.

999
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,827
But you never once asked me
what did I want to do.

1000
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,122
And what I want to do is make cocktails.

1001
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,500
I want to open a speakeasy.

1002
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,962
I want to create
a new experience for people.

1003
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,007
That's what makes me feel alive.

1004
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,551
Go ahead.

1005
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,886
It's a hobby, right?

1006
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,055
But that's it.

1007
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,641
It's only a hobby.

1008
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,393
It's a distraction.

1009
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,229
This cocktail phase of yours?

1010
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,649
It's meant to kill time.

1011
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,945
It's not just a hobby.

1012
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,239
This is what I want to do, Dad.

1013
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,700
This is what I'm choosing.

1014
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,413
Enjoy your drinks.
If you need anything, I'll be in the bar.

1015
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,498
- Thanks!
- Thank you.

1016
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,583
I did it.

1017
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,418
I stood my ground and I told him.

1018
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,755
- It felt so good.
- Right?

1019
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,091
I felt free. I mean,
I feel like right now,

1020
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,926
I could take on the world.

1021
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,552
You're so extra.

1022
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,847
No, finally, I did something for myself.
I mean…

1023
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:32,394
By the way,
I had another date with the doctor.

1024
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,396
Okay.

1025
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,939
What happened?

1026
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,857
Nothing. He was just perfect.

1027
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,484
He got his life together.

1028
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,404
And then he invited me
to his family gathering.

1029
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,489
Wait, this is good news, right?

1030
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,032
Of course it's good news, but…

1031
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,368
You know what I said?

1032
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,869
I told him

1033
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,956
to ask someone else.

1034
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,375
Gaila, why?

1035
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,962
Come on, Shane. My life is a mess.

1036
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,714
I just do what I want to do.

1037
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,591
You know… For how long, I don't know.

1038
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,970
He should thank me. I did him a favor.

1039
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,075
What's wrong?

1040
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,205
Is that him?

1041
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,583
Shane.

1042
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,294
Shane, I have to go.

1043
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,420
No.

1044
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,714
No.

1045
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,467
They should be the ones to leave.

1046
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,524
What's wrong with you?

1047
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,943
We're having a fun time, right?

1048
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,820
Laugh.

1049
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,339
- Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

1050
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,799
He said that?

1051
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,883
He did!

1052
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,430
- No way!
- I know, right?

1053
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,517
He thought he could get away with it.
He didn't!

1054
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,185
No! He even said it twice!

1055
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,979
- He said it twice!
- No way!

1056
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,108
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

1057
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,526
Oh, my God!

1058
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,705
Hey.

1059
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,374
I'm here.

1060
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,091
Thank you.

1061
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,717
Of course. Always.

1062
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,053
Always.

1063
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,976
Shane.

1064
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,978
I'm here.

1065
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,996
Come in.

1066
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,040
Have a seat.

1067
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,250
I'm fine.

1068
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,335
You want something to drink?

1069
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,588
Beer.

1070
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:49,549
Wow, Mr. Martini now wants beer.

1071
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,426
- Let me help.
- I'm fine.

1072
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,262
Gaila, sorry, I think I broke this.

1073
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,890
What's this anyway?

1074
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,600
It's Tristan's.

1075
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,936
Some of his work. He's into pottery.

1076
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,899
That's his "art." Since he's an "artist."

1077
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,817
I don't know.

1078
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,194
Why do you still have it?

1079
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,364
Twelve years of that love bullshit,

1080
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,241
and that?

1081
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,536
That's my consolation prize.

1082
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,916
Meanwhile, I gave everything
to that fucker. Everything!

1083
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:27,295
I even stayed here instead of
moving to Canada with my family.

1084
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,131
For him. Because we were
supposed to get married.

1085
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,591
And what did he tell me?

1086
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,592
I'm sorry.

1087
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,719
You're not wife material.

1088
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,429
You're not a serious person.

1089
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,431
You're too carefree.

1090
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,767
And you know what hurts the most?

1091
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,354
Seeing them happy, building a family,

1092
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:48,066
as if nothing happened,
as if they never hurt anybody.

1093
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,985
And what do I get? What the fuck, right?

1094
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,576
So you've been keeping this.

1095
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,415
Secretly.

1096
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,547
Gaila.

1097
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,632
Gaila.

1098
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,927
Why won't you let yourself be happy?

1099
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,270
- Oops.
- Shane!

1100
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,271
What the hell?

1101
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,397
Wait.

1102
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,403
Give me your hands.

1103
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,322
Look at me.

1104
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,658
Let yourself be happy.

1105
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,336
Yeah?

1106
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,586
You think I should
head over there, Bubbles?

1107
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,219
Like the first swig of beer
after a long day,

1108
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,222
slowly settling warm in your gut,

1109
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,809
Gaila isn't just a drink.

1110
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,687
She's the warmth that lingers,

1111
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,149
the rush that stays long
after the glass is empty.

1112
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,282
Fuck, shut up, Shane.

1113
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,458
Wow! So you were just here.

1114
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,711
You haven't been responding.
You left your shirt.

1115
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,799
What can I say? I had a good teacher.

1116
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,802
You left without a shirt on?

1117
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,554
Unbelievable.

1118
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,851
Chill here for a bit. I'll get dressed.

1119
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,269
You should.

1120
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,687
Make yourself at home.

1121
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,064
What's this?

1122
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,610
Does this have alcohol?

1123
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,694
No!

1124
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:15,833
Wow.

1125
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:43,236
I imagine less seats,
but it's like, it's more…

1126
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,781
- It's private?
- I was just thinking the same thing.

1127
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,699
You want it to feel exclusive…

1128
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:52,620
Exclusive, and give a… I guess
you can hear the person you're talking to.

1129
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:56,082
- Experience, like, dim lights.
- Dim lights.

1130
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,376
I want to keep a lot of natural choices.

1131
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,523
What's this?

1132
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,525
A gift from the one that got away?

1133
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,402
Should I rip it?

1134
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,778
- Let's do it!
- Don't.

1135
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:26,821
I will!

1136
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:27,822
- Come on!
- Don't!

1137
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,448
- Let's rip--
- Gaila, don't.

1138
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,369
Okay.

1139
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:36,330
Okay. Sorry.

1140
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,168
I'll head out.
I just brought your shirt over.

1141
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,304
There's this girl.

1142
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,139
She's tough.

1143
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,474
A little wild, actually.

1144
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,227
Gaila.

1145
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,521
But she's not my type.

1146
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,939
I mean, she's…

1147
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:06,819
she's not what I'm looking for,
not what I'm used to.

1148
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,991
Bro, she has a name. Gaila.

1149
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,784
I mean…

1150
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:18,456
Anyone who replaced her out of your mind,
I mean, deserves an award.

1151
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:19,624
But I feel bad.

1152
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,376
I feel guilty.

1153
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,008
- She found the napkin.
- The napkin?

1154
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,134
The napkin.

1155
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,013
She was joking about ripping it in half.

1156
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,724
I stopped her.

1157
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,851
I was wrong, wasn't I?

1158
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,186
Be honest, was I?

1159
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,104
I was wrong, wasn't I?

1160
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,357
Bro, that's your problem.

1161
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:49,320
I mean, nothing's ever that deep for you,
and you make sure it isn't.

1162
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,448
If this

1163
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,910
Gaila makes you feel good,

1164
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:00,539
don't wait for her to make the first move.

1165
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,499
Do it.

1166
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:02,875
Text her.

1167
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,585
- Now? Text her?
- Now.

1168
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,879
- Go. Go.
- Okay, I'm texting!

1169
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,090
Wait.

1170
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,342
Boss Jim?

1171
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,677
Sir, are you free tonight?

1172
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,555
I need backup at the rooftop bar.
I have an emergency.

1173
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,474
- Backup?
- Can you cover for me?

1174
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,393
Yes, boss, why not? Yeah.

1175
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,979
Actually, that will be
a good experience for me.

1176
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,855
I'll be there, boss. See you.

1177
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,525
See you, boss. Okay. Bye.

1178
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,446
- Text her.
- I will.

1179
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,531
Hey.

1180
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:35,533
I'm sorry about last time.

1181
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:38,577
I must have been in a mood.
I didn't mean to offend you.

1182
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,746
No, don't worry. It's fine.

1183
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,332
How was your family gathering?

1184
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,250
It was fun.

1185
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,835
Did you end up taking someone?

1186
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:46,752
No.

1187
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,006
Just spent time with my family.

1188
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,507
You would have loved it there.

1189
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:55,011
We went to this
restaurant with a waterfall,

1190
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,638
the view was amazing,

1191
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,099
and you could hear the water flowing.

1192
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,517
It was so beautiful.

1193
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,523
I don't mean to cut you or anything,

1194
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,276
but do you want to move over there?

1195
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,819
Let's drink.

1196
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,696
Sure, whatever you want.

1197
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:15,906
- Yeah?
- Let's just finish our meal.

1198
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,200
Yeah, okay. Let's eat.

1199
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:22,705
Hey, Philip.

1200
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:23,622
Thank you.

1201
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,667
Even if you're not much of a drinker,
you still kept me company.

1202
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,752
Of course.

1203
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,296
- The drinks here are delicious, promise.
- Really?

1204
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,213
Server.

1205
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,965
- Grab some dinner.
- All right, okay.

1206
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,258
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1207
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,266
Can we order a--

1208
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:45,561
Yeah, sorry, guys…
Do you know what you want?

1209
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,104
One mule.

1210
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:48,898
Moscow mule?

1211
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:52,318
- Moscow mule, yeah.
- Moscow mule for me. And for the lady?

1212
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,445
One beer.

1213
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:55,613
One beer.

1214
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:56,739
Figures.

1215
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,824
I'll be right back with your drinks.

1216
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,289
Have I told you
how beautiful you look tonight?

1217
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,083
Doc! Thank you.

1218
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,125
You too.

1219
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,920
- And you smell really good, like a baby.
- Wow.

1220
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,089
Like a baby.

1221
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,716
- Order something. Food here is good.
- Food?

1222
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,594
- How do you wanna order?
- Okay, guys, here are your drinks.

1223
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:19,512
Thank you.

1224
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,722
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1225
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:28,729
You know what? Sorry, I just… if I may,

1226
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,981
you two make such a cute couple.

1227
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:31,899
Adorable.

1228
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,528
No. We're not a couple yet.

1229
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,570
Oh, really?

1230
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,323
But it's getting quite serious.

1231
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,409
This guy is such a gentleman.

1232
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,329
Not like… those messy,

1233
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,832
- overcomplicated guys.
- Okay.

1234
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,959
Wow. This drink is smooth.

1235
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,461
- Thank you.
- I can barely taste the alcohol.

1236
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,879
Is that so, sir?

1237
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,090
Quick fix solution coming up!

1238
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,843
Let's pour in some more vodka,

1239
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,554
to get that kick right away. Right?

1240
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,888
There you go.

1241
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,473
- To the brim.
- That's too much.

1242
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,432
That's a lot.

1243
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:06,851
He can handle it.

1244
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,894
Or…

1245
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,272
you can just get drunk off me tonight.

1246
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,400
I have to ask.

1247
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,820
I got a sense that you

1248
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:21,115
just wanted something
casual from last time.

1249
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,200
What changed?

1250
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:27,955
Actually, when I met you, I really
wasn't looking for anything serious.

1251
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,876
But I have this fuck buddy
who told me that

1252
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,421
I should look for something
more long-term.

1253
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,715
So, yeah.

1254
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,219
Sorry, guys, not that
I'm eavesdropping or anything,

1255
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,888
but I can hear you from across the bar

1256
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,473
and I just want to
congratulate you both because

1257
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,518
your relationship seems to
be getting serious, yeah?

1258
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:52,354
Sir, if I'm not mistaken,
it's your first time here at the bar?

1259
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,355
Yeah, first time.

1260
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,442
So you get
a free complimentary welcome shot

1261
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,985
and another one on the house.

1262
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,111
And for you, ma'am?

1263
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,697
Can you handle it?

1264
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,493
Some people think
they can handle something, but they can't.

1265
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,205
- Can you?
- I can handle it.

1266
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,040
And I don't back down.

1267
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:11,957
Okay.

1268
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,585
I'm just saying,
people think they can handle it,

1269
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:16,337
then end up getting sick at the end.

1270
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,379
Shit.

1271
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,714
Exhibit A.

1272
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:19,757
Are you okay?

1273
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,799
I'm wasted.

1274
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,801
That's strong.

1275
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,428
Wasted?

1276
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,597
I have to go.

1277
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,891
I need to be at the hospital
early tomorrow…

1278
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,101
- Water, water!
- So…

1279
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,604
- Water, boys!
- Let me know how much I owe you.

1280
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:34,939
On the house.

1281
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:38,025
- We're out of water?
- I'll take a cab and get my car tomorrow.

1282
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,860
- Sorry, excuse me.
- Are you good?

1283
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:40,945
- Can you walk?
- Yeah?

1284
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,780
- He's fine. Bye.
- Excuse me, guys.

1285
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,073
The bill isn't fine.

1286
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,075
What's wrong with you?

1287
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,202
What? It was on the house.
It's free alcohol.

1288
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:49,912
You're out of water? Really?

1289
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:50,913
Gaila!

1290
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,331
Don't… Gaila!

1291
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:53,916
Gaila, wait!

1292
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,376
Wait.

1293
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:56,877
I just want to talk.

1294
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,128
I just want to talk.

1295
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,965
What the hell, Shane?
For fuck's sake! What's your problem?

1296
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:04,176
You think I couldn't tell
you were trying to get my date drunk?

1297
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,929
Relax, that wasn't my intention.
I really wanted to talk to you

1298
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,807
because you haven't been answering
my texts, my messages.

1299
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,726
What? Why are you even
expecting a reply from me?

1300
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,646
We're not each other's
priorities, remember?

1301
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,564
What are we even doing?

1302
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,651
Well, is it wrong
for me to care all of a sudden?

1303
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,194
You just left the other night.

1304
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,071
I just want to know if you're safe

1305
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,531
- or alive…
- I'm here!

1306
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,032
- …if you've eaten?
- I'm fine!

1307
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,617
- Okay! Okay.
- I'm good!

1308
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,661
I was trying to avoid this kind of drama.

1309
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:33,205
Have you forgotten our deal?

1310
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,249
We're just each other's in betweens.

1311
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:36,250
No attachment,

1312
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,501
no feelings,

1313
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,003
no anything.

1314
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,004
Okay?

1315
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:41,714
Okay.

1316
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,757
- Okay. Move.
- But, really, that guy?

1317
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:44,758
That guy?

1318
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,303
- Are you serious about him?
- None of your business.

1319
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,097
Come on, Gaila.

1320
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,515
Last week,

1321
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:53,183
that meant nothing to you?

1322
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,020
Can you tell me why you're so mad at me?

1323
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,522
It can't be just about that doctor.

1324
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:01,025
- Why are you so mad at me?
- I'm not mad at you, okay?

1325
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,901
I'm angry at myself.

1326
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,446
This wasn't supposed to be
anything serious, right?

1327
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:08,741
But I guess I'm so stupid
that I fell in love with you!

1328
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,081
What was that?

1329
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,918
What was that?

1330
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:21,754
Nothing!

1331
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,922
You're in love with me?

1332
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,094
You won't admit it, okay,

1333
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,179
fine.

1334
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:31,805
Then I'll go first.

1335
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,476
Sure,

1336
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,479
we had a deal at first.

1337
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,856
We're just in betweens.

1338
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,191
And I told myself

1339
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,818
I wouldn't fall for somebody like you.

1340
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,030
Something changed.

1341
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,366
Gaila,

1342
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,701
nobody makes me feel this way.

1343
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,579
You're like my best friend.

1344
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,206
But then we have sex.

1345
01:12:57,289 --> 01:13:00,793
We can talk about the weirdest,
you know, most random thing,

1346
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,712
but then we can also switch
to something so deep and meaningful.

1347
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,464
That never happens.

1348
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,925
I don't get like this with anybody else.

1349
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,010
Only you.

1350
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:14,098
I think about you all the time.

1351
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:19,603
I'm so done with this casual shit.

1352
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:25,025
I'm so over this in between… nonsense.

1353
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,238
I love you.

1354
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,076
I love you.

1355
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,538
I love you too.

1356
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,623
I love you more.

1357
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:40,666
I love you most.

1358
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,876
I love you mostest.

1359
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:44,670
Fine!

1360
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,046
You win.

1361
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:47,631
You win.

1362
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,508
Now, kiss me.

1363
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,446
So, sir, it's called The Hidden.

1364
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:14,116
Nowadays, people, they don't
really like noisy places anymore.

1365
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,409
Noisy bars…

1366
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:16,952
They want intimacy.

1367
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:21,248
And it's not always about the drinks,
it's more about the experience, sir.

1368
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,585
You've got vision, Mr. Santillanes,
I'll give you that.

1369
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,629
But bars aren't built on ideas.

1370
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,089
They're built on numbers.

1371
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,216
And without a proven track record,

1372
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,469
an investor like me sees risk,

1373
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,804
not opportunity.

1374
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,347
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1375
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:38,307
Yes, sir.

1376
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,477
Thank you for your time.

1377
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,899
Experience.

1378
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:48,984
Everybody wants experience.

1379
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,028
How the hell
am I supposed to get experience

1380
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,030
if nobody gives me a chance?

1381
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:58,660
I'm so close to giving up.
I swear, babe, I'm tired.

1382
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,620
Hey!

1383
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,164
You're such a drama queen.

1384
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,207
What the hell!

1385
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,833
That's normal, you know.

1386
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,627
You can't give up.

1387
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:09,129
We'll figure something out.

1388
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:13,217
What if you do a bar takeover?

1389
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,552
You'll be the guest bartender,

1390
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:19,556
and you can feature
all your signature cocktails?

1391
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:23,977
Like, we can post your drinks
to build engagement,

1392
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:26,146
build your media presence.

1393
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,524
- Yeah.
- That's actually a good id…

1394
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,069
What if nobody goes?

1395
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:35,155
Okay. No, what if they go
and give a bad review?

1396
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,908
Well, at least you tried.

1397
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,493
At least you did it.

1398
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:40,452
Right?

1399
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,745
Besides, hello?

1400
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:42,829
I'm here.

1401
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,581
I'll help you.

1402
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,710
Let's custom design your menu,

1403
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,754
let's make you a playlist.

1404
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,589
Let's make it exciting.

1405
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,175
You're the best, babe.

1406
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,178
I know I'm the best.

1407
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,429
You know, even if

1408
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,807
you're busy with work,

1409
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:03,809
you still help me out.

1410
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:05,894
I appreciate you.

1411
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,646
Of course.

1412
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:11,358
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends and my dad,

1413
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:13,110
so they see how amazing you are.

1414
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,862
I appreciate you.

1415
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,370
I've only been gone for a month,

1416
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:25,163
and now you have a boyfriend?

1417
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,207
In fairness.

1418
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,625
But I'm so happy for you.

1419
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,586
My gosh. Girl, long story.

1420
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,171
I was surprised myself.

1421
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:35,591
This girl just fell in love.

1422
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:38,969
So, do I look good now?

1423
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:41,471
Am I girlfriend material enough?

1424
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,516
- Let me see.
- How is it?

1425
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,518
Let me see your back.
What bra are you wearing?

1426
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,936
I'm not wearing one.

1427
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,272
- Approved!
- Okay?

1428
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,190
You look like a female lead.

1429
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,734
Oh, look at you.

1430
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:54,860
A goddess.

1431
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:56,653
Hold on,

1432
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,655
I'm getting nervous.

1433
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,242
What if his friends
and family don't like me?

1434
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,454
They're rich people. They might judge me.

1435
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:07,998
First of all,

1436
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,333
you'd pass as a rich woman.

1437
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:10,542
- Really?
- Yes.

1438
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,587
You just happen to prefer
flip-flops over heels.

1439
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:16,214
And second, if they judge you,

1440
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,258
tell me and I'll have them disbarred.

1441
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,010
You're really something.

1442
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,805
I never used to mind events like this.

1443
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,641
But now, I don't know.

1444
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,688
Girl, Shane chose you.

1445
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,523
You don't need to prove anything.

1446
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:38,070
I don't have a fabulous
career or reputation.

1447
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,572
I don't have a title or anything.

1448
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:43,950
It sucks being a Jill-of-all-trades.

1449
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,870
Come here.

1450
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,457
There's nothing wrong with that, okay?

1451
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,667
That's your edge.

1452
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,585
And it's what makes you unique.

1453
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:57,422
Come on, let's put on some more lipstick.

1454
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,424
Fine, I believe you.

1455
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,550
Shane,

1456
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,554
I don't want us
to avoid this conversation.

1457
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,141
I've been thinking about
what you said to me.

1458
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:09,643
And…

1459
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,188
I think we both should compromise.

1460
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:14,690
Let's meet halfway.

1461
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,150
- Really, Dad?
- Yeah.

1462
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,902
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

1463
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:22,197
I'll be supporting your cocktail business.

1464
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,492
But… you have to build it

1465
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:28,120
in one of Jade Property's developments.

1466
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:29,663
Okay?

1467
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:31,748
We will integrate your bar

1468
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,250
into the hotel.

1469
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,835
You can do what you love

1470
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:37,921
and within a solid business structure.

1471
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:43,468
- Yeah, but, Dad--
- Shane. Come on.

1472
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,637
Be smart about this, okay?

1473
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,639
I'm giving this to you

1474
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,517
so you can do it without struggling, okay?

1475
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,602
Of course, there are conditions.

1476
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:56,398
Your bar will be under
corporate management.

1477
01:18:56,481 --> 01:19:01,319
You'll have partners that will have a say
on how things are run.

1478
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,156
If that's the case, Dad, then--

1479
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,782
Sir, wait.

1480
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,910
Excuse me. If I may speak.

1481
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:13,081
Shane strongly believes in his dream bar.

1482
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:14,833
Actually,

1483
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,044
he makes drinks every day to practice.

1484
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,296
He studies,

1485
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,423
talks to investors.

1486
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:25,802
He even has a secret notebook
of all his cocktail recipes.

1487
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:29,347
And he's got his whole business plan
ready to pitch.

1488
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,267
Thank you.

1489
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,395
I wanna open a speakeasy, Dad.

1490
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:38,523
Even if it's small.
I want it intimate and personal.

1491
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:42,736
I want it to be a place where anybody
can walk in and feel right at home.

1492
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:44,571
And I've been practicing.

1493
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:45,989
I've been studying

1494
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,491
and I've been saving up.

1495
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,951
So, I will open one

1496
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,369
on my own terms.

1497
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:54,498
Whether I have your support or not.

1498
01:19:56,333 --> 01:20:00,045
Sir, I'm sure you started the same way.

1499
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,171
From scratch.

1500
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:02,798
Just like Shane.

1501
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,342
And it's not just land
that holds market value.

1502
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:07,803
Alcohol brings in a fast ROI.

1503
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:13,642
You know,

1504
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,936
this is my favorite drink.

1505
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,562
Yeah. I told you.

1506
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,898
Cheers.

1507
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,191
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1508
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:22,776
Cheers.

1509
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,488
Thank you.

1510
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,450
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

1511
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,452
Cheers, everybody, nice to meet you.

1512
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:36,373
So, you must be quite the catch.

1513
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,583
We know how much of
a perfectionist Shane is.

1514
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,794
He wouldn't just settle for anyone.

1515
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:43,672
He's definitely had his fair share
of impressive women,

1516
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:46,007
and didn't even give them a look back.

1517
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,218
That's too much, bro. That's not true.

1518
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:49,761
That's too much.

1519
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,847
So, how did you win this guy over?

1520
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:54,683
No, wait.
I think maybe I should tell them.

1521
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,768
- Bruh?
- She didn't win me over.

1522
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,728
I fell head over heels in love for her.

1523
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,939
- Really?
- Wow!

1524
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,401
- Who said "I love you" first?
- Not me.

1525
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:05,485
"I love you"?

1526
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:08,613
- "I love you" already?
- "Why do I feel like I love you already?"

1527
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,698
Do you agree?

1528
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,366
Stop it!

1529
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,535
You're embarrassing me!

1530
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:14,953
So, Gaila, what do you do?

1531
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,038
Shane says you're so busy these days.

1532
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:20,542
Well, for now, I'm a graphic artist.

1533
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,336
- But I'm still trying to figure it out.
- That's nice.

1534
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,672
- Sometimes--
- No, she's being humble.

1535
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:27,299
Okay.

1536
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,009
Gaila is a superstar.

1537
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:32,387
She's a graphic designer,
a musician, and a makeup artist.

1538
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:36,391
She juggles all three at the same time.
I've never met anyone as talented

1539
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:39,561
and as artistic as her. Seriously.

1540
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:41,104
But, yeah, I was saying--

1541
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:42,939
It's true, you don't understand.

1542
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,400
She can make a graphic design
out of thin air.

1543
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:50,405
And then still have time to write music,
and still have time to be a makeup artist.

1544
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,532
- Three jobs.
- Yeah. Who has time to do that?

1545
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:55,285
I won't survive it.
I don't know how you do it, babe.

1546
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:57,329
- I don't know how you do it.
- Wow.

1547
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,790
So that's the reason why this guy
can't stop talking about you.

1548
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,001
Have you guys heard the news?

1549
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:06,254
Did you guys know that Alexia
is actually back from France?

1550
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:08,089
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1551
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,426
Like, she got back,
I think, like, last week.

1552
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:12,969
I saw her Stories.

1553
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,055
Good for her.

1554
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,975
- Cheers? Cheers!
- Cheers!

1555
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,143
Cheers it up.

1556
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,775
Do you pay your taxes?

1557
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:29,611
Of course.

1558
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:30,737
Yeah.

1559
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,614
Actually, it's frustrating

1560
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:37,661
- how those taxes eat into my paycheck.
- Fact, no?

1561
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,871
Where does it even go? I don't see it.

1562
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,373
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1563
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,249
How's the business going, bro?

1564
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,984
How was it, babe? Did you have fun?

1565
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,236
Just tired.

1566
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,158
Babe, if it's something I said or did,

1567
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:20,620
you should just tell me.

1568
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,711
Total superstar.

1569
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:30,672
Really?

1570
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,843
You didn't have to hype me up
like that to your friends.

1571
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,553
Hype?

1572
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:39,014
I wasn't hyping you.
I was just telling my friends.

1573
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,558
I was talking about
my super-talented girlfriend.

1574
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:42,809
Wow, super?

1575
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:46,312
Super, really?
Is that why you kept talking over me?

1576
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:49,190
I was still talking and then you
cut me off with that bullshit!

1577
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,526
Do you not want them to know the real me?

1578
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,279
Come on, babe. You are super talented.

1579
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,947
And that's what I love about you.

1580
01:23:56,906 --> 01:24:00,243
For fuck's sake, what the hell?
Are you messing with me?

1581
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:03,747
Me? Talented? I don't even know
what I want to do with my life.

1582
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,373
Talented my ass.

1583
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,834
I'm sorry, okay?
I wasn't trying to be rude.

1584
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,795
I was trying to be nice.
I didn't want you to feel out of place.

1585
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,131
I didn't feel out of place!

1586
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:15,925
Not until you made me feel
that I needed to be perfect

1587
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,803
to fit in with your perfect
English-speaking friends!

1588
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,139
- There you go.
- Sure, I don't speak well!

1589
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:23,391
I'm not refined! What else?

1590
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,977
At least you're owning up
to your feelings.

1591
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,022
You know what,
maybe if you stuck to something,

1592
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,523
something you were good at,

1593
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:34,069
then you wouldn't feel like shit
and we wouldn't be having this argument.

1594
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:35,779
Sorry then!

1595
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:38,031
And you wouldn't be projecting
your feelings onto me!

1596
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,909
I said I was sorry! Sorry I'm not perfect!

1597
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:42,786
Unlike your one that got away!

1598
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:12,398
Shane.

1599
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:17,070
- Hi!
- Hi.

1600
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:18,363
Hi.

1601
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:19,447
Hi.

1602
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,200
What brings you here?

1603
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,036
Well, I just had a meeting downstairs

1604
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,581
and they told me you were here
and I had to come and make sure it's true.

1605
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,958
I was…

1606
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,418
I figured we were bound to see each other.

1607
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,129
- It's a small world.
- It is.

1608
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,631
The world of F&B is really so small.

1609
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:39,425
So,

1610
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:42,470
- Master Sommelier, how does it feel?
- Gosh.

1611
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:45,765
I didn't spend a year drowning
in Bordeaux for nothing, right?

1612
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,308
- Right.
- Yeah.

1613
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,394
And I'm so back

1614
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,896
and I'm finally staying for good.

1615
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:53,731
For good?

1616
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,068
- That's great.
- What about you? Look at you! I mean…

1617
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,654
You're finally doing what you love, I see?

1618
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,865
Finally, yes I am.

1619
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,159
Cheers to the both of us.

1620
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,870
- Can I grab this? Amazing.
- You can. I just made this.

1621
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,913
I actually want you to try that one.

1622
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,498
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1623
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,043
You've done good work.

1624
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,545
You're a real artist.

1625
01:26:15,628 --> 01:26:18,339
That's why I feel so bad about this.

1626
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,884
I met with the other partners today.

1627
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:23,178
And while we love your art,

1628
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:26,264
the team feels
we need to take the café's branding

1629
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:27,849
in a different direction.

1630
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:31,853
Excuse me?

1631
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,063
They want a different art style.

1632
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:37,483
So, we went with another designer.

1633
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,068
Sorry about this.

1634
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:40,904
Wait, what?

1635
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:44,616
I spent weeks working on this.

1636
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,868
I'm even drawing in my dreams.

1637
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:50,997
How could this happen
when all the deliverables were in place?

1638
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,957
We really appreciate your effort.

1639
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,084
But this is our partners' decision.

1640
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:57,795
What about the work I did?

1641
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,590
Sir, you have to pay me in full.

1642
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:02,467
Since we didn't sign a contract,

1643
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,886
we'll give you 20% of your rate.

1644
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:06,679
We really apologize.

1645
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:10,475
Promise, you'll be top of mind
for our next project.

1646
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,902
Are you okay, girl?

1647
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:23,404
I'm tired.

1648
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,325
I can't catch a break with this life.

1649
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,248
Girl, I hate to add to everything,

1650
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:34,832
but Jay…

1651
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,044
is asking when you're moving out.

1652
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:40,213
I told him,

1653
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:46,010
be patient,
since finding a new place isn't easy.

1654
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:49,264
But we've been arguing about it a lot.

1655
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:51,641
And he's not budging.

1656
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:54,310
Gaila, I'm sorry-

1657
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,770
Stop it.

1658
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:58,273
Don't apologize.

1659
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:01,067
You and Jay have been so generous to me.

1660
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,194
I should have moved out long ago.

1661
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,530
I should be the one saying sorry.

1662
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,700
I never meant to cause tension
between you and Jay.

1663
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:12,412
Hey, you didn't do anything wrong, okay?

1664
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,790
You know, I love having you here.

1665
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,669
I just have to choose my battles.

1666
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:23,006
Of course. I understand.

1667
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:25,717
You should prioritize your relationship.

1668
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,386
Not everyone gets to have
a good thing like that.

1669
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:31,097
To know one's place in life,

1670
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:34,225
in the world, in love,

1671
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,852
and even at work.

1672
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:37,770
You're so lucky.

1673
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:39,522
You've got it all.

1674
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:41,232
I hope it happens for me too.

1675
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,942
You're so dramatic.

1676
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,570
I'm not perfect.

1677
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:49,741
Whether it's work or a relationship,

1678
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,076
I'm just happy to be there.

1679
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,080
That's why I fight for it and stand by it.

1680
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,290
Simple as that.

1681
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,133
Babe?

1682
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:12,263
I have nowhere else to go.

1683
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,808
I'm a mess. I'm always bothering people.

1684
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,143
Hey.

1685
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:18,811
Don't say sorry.

1686
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,355
You're my girlfriend.

1687
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:21,856
I'm happy you're here.

1688
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:23,483
You're not bothering me.

1689
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:25,276
Okay?

1690
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,570
I'm sorry too,

1691
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,573
for what happened the other night.

1692
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,285
I don't know what got into me.

1693
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,913
But don't worry. My mind's all cleared up.

1694
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:41,459
I can help you with the bar takeover.
It will be awesome.

1695
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,253
Stop saying sorry. It's fine.

1696
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,090
I wasn't in the best mood
that night either. Okay?

1697
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:49,300
Okay?

1698
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,140
- And you brought Bubbles!
- I did!

1699
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,060
- She's getting cold out here.
- I'm sorry.

1700
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,561
Hey, little guy.

1701
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:02,814
Let's go inside.

1702
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,110
Thank you, babe.

1703
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:12,031
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

1704
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,452
I saw Lex today.

1705
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:19,664
It was completely coincidental.

1706
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:24,502
We just talked about business.

1707
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:28,089
She said that she could help
with the menu and future competitions.

1708
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:31,259
She could also help out
through her connections.

1709
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:32,802
But I promise that's it.

1710
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,348
Well… that's great.

1711
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:41,978
If she can help you, that's great.

1712
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:44,856
And if she's got great ideas,
then why not?

1713
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:51,404
And if you want her to help out
with planning the bar takeover,

1714
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:52,655
it's fine.

1715
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:57,160
She's in the past, right?

1716
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,247
Really, babe? It's okay with you?

1717
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,417
If it'll help you,

1718
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:06,252
I'm down.

1719
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:10,047
You're the best.

1720
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,132
I know.

1721
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,509
Thank you too.

1722
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:17,388
Come inside? Okay?

1723
01:31:18,389 --> 01:31:20,016
Here's the idea.

1724
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,644
Since this is a bar takeover,
we really have to make use of the space.

1725
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:29,483
Thinking of keeping the lighting subtle
to maintain the ambiance

1726
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:32,111
and still highlight your signature drinks.

1727
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:35,615
We can also design the napkins, coasters.

1728
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,867
- Is that okay?
- Coasters, yeah.

1729
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,785
I think this could really work.

1730
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,495
- Yeah! Yeah.
- It's awesome, huh?

1731
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:44,415
Okay. You might have other ideas.

1732
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:46,209
Shane, hi!

1733
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:47,835
- Hey.
- Hi!

1734
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:50,046
You look great! Hi.

1735
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:52,715
- Hi! Gaila.
- Gail? Right?

1736
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:55,176
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1737
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,136
Alexia, you're so pretty.

1738
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,471
- Thank you.
- Please.

1739
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:00,389
Thanks. You're the sweetest.

1740
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:01,515
I got you.

1741
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:07,939
The idea is to play around
with this color palette for a hip vibe.

1742
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:11,984
And then we'll just mix in
some old-school jazz and indie music

1743
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:16,322
- to cater to Gen Zs.
- Yeah. That's super trendy.

1744
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:19,867
You wanna add something?

1745
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:23,371
Yeah. I mean, the concept is really good.

1746
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:24,747
It's very trendy.

1747
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:27,917
I was just thinking.

1748
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,627
I mean, Shane, knowing you,

1749
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:33,798
isn't it a little tacky for your taste?

1750
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:38,427
I'm sorry, I don't mean it like that.
I super love it, Gaila.

1751
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:39,679
- It's just--
- It's fine.

1752
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:41,430
Trends die fast.

1753
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:44,684
And if there's one thing
that I learned in Paris,

1754
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:46,519
timeless always wins.

1755
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:50,022
And elegance never goes out of style.

1756
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:55,444
I don't know, but I think
it needs to feel more exclusive.

1757
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:58,906
You know?
Not just another stop along the block.

1758
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:02,785
If we all collab, it'll all work out.

1759
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:06,539
Yeah, I'm not here to, like,
cut down everything that you said.

1760
01:33:06,622 --> 01:33:10,668
It's just that I really want it to work,
and I know your vision because I know you.

1761
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,921
I understand. Not at all. I don't
feel that way. I'm sure, same with Gaila.

1762
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:14,839
Yeah.

1763
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:16,465
- We all want it to work.
- Sure.

1764
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:17,717
It will turn out good.

1765
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,803
It's gonna be amazing
once we put this all together.

1766
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:23,097
I hope so. I'm nervous but excited.

1767
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:25,599
Yes, me too.
Oh, my God, it's really happening.

1768
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:26,559
I know.

1769
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:50,541
Should I rip it?

1770
01:33:50,624 --> 01:33:52,209
- Let's do it!
- Don't.

1771
01:33:53,502 --> 01:33:56,213
I don't see myself marrying you.

1772
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:01,052
I don't wanna marry you either.

1773
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,143
Mom?

1774
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:14,899
Gaila, I'm glad you called.
I've been worried about you.

1775
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:18,277
We haven't heard from you in ages.
What's going on with you?

1776
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:19,695
Are you okay?

1777
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,368
Sorry I haven't called, Mom.

1778
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:29,163
So much has been happening,

1779
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:31,165
but it feels like I'm running in circles.

1780
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,627
I don't know. I'm just tired.

1781
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:41,509
I told you, if you're tired,
you don't have to bear it alone.

1782
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:43,427
You're welcome here in Canada.

1783
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,054
We miss you, Gaila.

1784
01:34:57,608 --> 01:35:00,111
You're on storage room duty, man.

1785
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:01,779
Time to bring out the alcohol.

1786
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:03,697
Time check?

1787
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,449
Okay.

1788
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,785
- Hey.
- Lex.

1789
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:10,955
It's way too early. We're not even
finished preparing yet.

1790
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:12,540
Yeah, I…

1791
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:17,253
I just wanted to chat with you
before things get busy later?

1792
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,964
Yeah, sure. Is everything okay?

1793
01:35:20,714 --> 01:35:21,757
Yeah…

1794
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:30,433
Shane.

1795
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:32,893
You know, I was thinking, like,

1796
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,312
it's just crazy because…

1797
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:41,068
back in college,
we were just kids with big dreams.

1798
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:45,656
All we ever wanted to do
was make people happy with our…

1799
01:35:45,739 --> 01:35:47,700
our creations, our drinks.

1800
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:48,826
Yeah.

1801
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,786
And look at us now.

1802
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:53,956
I mean, look at you now.

1803
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,418
I'm just so proud of you, Shane.

1804
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:11,223
Look, I know you're with Gaila now and

1805
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:14,810
she seems like a wonderful girl, but

1806
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,189
if there's still a chance that

1807
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:21,275
maybe you feel the same way?

1808
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,738
I'd like to give us a try.

1809
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:29,742
Lex.

1810
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:35,372
- Don't.
- Shane.

1811
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:38,834
My parents can fund us.
You won't have to struggle anymore, Shane.

1812
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:42,004
We can finally make this dream happen.

1813
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:50,513
I used to think

1814
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:52,765
you loved me too.

1815
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,851
You don't know how many times
I asked myself,

1816
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,145
"Was I not enough?"

1817
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:00,940
"Was what I did not enough?"

1818
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,610
And how that broke me every single day.

1819
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:08,572
And now you just walk back into my life

1820
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:09,990
like nothing happened.

1821
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,410
How the fuck is that fair, Lex?

1822
01:37:16,038 --> 01:37:17,164
I missed you.

1823
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:21,168
Every single day, I missed you so much.

1824
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,297
I've been waiting so long

1825
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,466
for this conversation.

1826
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,344
I've been waiting such a long time
for it to happen.

1827
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:34,723
If you give me another chance,

1828
01:37:36,475 --> 01:37:37,518
I swear…

1829
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:42,147
I'll never hurt you again.

1830
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:47,987
I love you, Lex.

1831
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,575
I will always love you, Lex.

1832
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:17,474
You'll like this. It's strong.

1833
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:19,310
You know what I mean?

1834
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:20,894
Enjoy your time. Okay, thanks.

1835
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,108
How are things? All good?

1836
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:27,276
- All good.
- Okay.

1837
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:15,658
I've taken any regular cocktail
you see on any menu

1838
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:17,117
and added my own twist to it.

1839
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:20,079
Like Sampaguita Sour,
Calamansi Old-Fashioned.

1840
01:39:20,162 --> 01:39:22,373
These are just to name a few,
and we have many more.

1841
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:23,957
So, I do appreciate your interest.

1842
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,376
Sure, here.

1843
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:27,670
- Thank you! Much appreciated.
- No problem.

1844
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:29,421
- I'll contact you. Thank you.
- Okay.

1845
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,674
Ma'am, thank you.
Enjoy your evening. Enjoy.

1846
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,179
Gaila.

1847
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:38,764
Gaila.

1848
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:40,349
Where were you?

1849
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:42,351
- Where the fuck have you been?
- What?

1850
01:39:42,434 --> 01:39:45,688
I've been calling you all night.
I've been worried about you.

1851
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:47,106
Why don't you answer?

1852
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:49,525
I went drinking!

1853
01:39:49,608 --> 01:39:50,693
Drinking?

1854
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:53,362
Of all nights, tonight?

1855
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:56,115
With who?

1856
01:39:57,282 --> 01:39:58,409
Your friends?

1857
01:39:58,492 --> 01:39:59,618
Or a guy?

1858
01:40:02,037 --> 01:40:03,997
Son of a fucking bitch.

1859
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:05,791
You're so fucking messed up.

1860
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:07,334
- I swear--
- I know, okay?

1861
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:11,630
I'm a mess. Didn't you know
what you got yourself into?

1862
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:13,507
I knew what I was getting into!

1863
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,717
I know!

1864
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,093
But not tonight.

1865
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:18,887
This night is fucking important.

1866
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:21,473
I needed you. You weren't there!

1867
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,600
You're such a hassle.

1868
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:26,645
Then I guess it's fine.

1869
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:30,774
To just pack up and head to Canada.

1870
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,610
- Canada?
- Exactly. So I won't be a hassle to you!

1871
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:35,696
You don't need me, Shane.

1872
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:37,865
What the fuck are you talking about?

1873
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:40,033
You don't need me, Shane!

1874
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:44,705
You don't need me
because Alexia's here, right?

1875
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,624
And she's perfect!

1876
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,961
Perfect night, perfect event,

1877
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:53,547
perfect girl, perfect couple.

1878
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:55,466
Just fucking perfect!

1879
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,093
You know me and her are just friends.

1880
01:40:58,177 --> 01:40:59,803
I heard everything!

1881
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:01,889
Shane!

1882
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:06,143
I heard how you told her
she's always on your mind.

1883
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:11,190
And how you've been waiting
for her to come home.

1884
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:15,611
Isn't that funny?

1885
01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:21,450
Maybe I really am
just an in between to you.

1886
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:27,956
The girl that you date while
you wait for "the one" to come along.

1887
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:31,126
That's not true.

1888
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:32,878
That's not true!

1889
01:41:32,961 --> 01:41:35,631
Shane, I'm so tired of feeling useless!

1890
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:38,717
It's like…

1891
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,261
It's like nobody sees me.

1892
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,305
I feel so small!

1893
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:45,724
Like I never do anything right!

1894
01:41:46,558 --> 01:41:48,101
And I fucking…

1895
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,271
fucking hate myself for it.

1896
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:55,818
I'm done.

1897
01:41:59,404 --> 01:42:02,282
I told myself I need to change.

1898
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:08,622
I need to turn my life around and focus.

1899
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:11,792
I need to detox my life.

1900
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:12,960
Detox?

1901
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:16,296
So what are you cutting out? Me?

1902
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,506
Really?

1903
01:42:17,589 --> 01:42:18,966
Me, of all people?

1904
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:20,384
After everything?

1905
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:24,972
I introduced you to my friends,
my family, my dad.

1906
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:27,724
We planned everything.
Tonight was supposed to be ours.

1907
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:29,810
Our night! Not mine, ours!

1908
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:34,648
You made me believe in us.

1909
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:37,818
You made me fucking believe.

1910
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:42,114
This was important to me, Gaila.

1911
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:46,159
This was the one fucking thing
I wish we didn't fuck up.

1912
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,162
But we fucked it up.

1913
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:53,208
Is it that easy for you?

1914
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:56,128
I know we're fucked up, you're fucked up.

1915
01:42:56,211 --> 01:42:57,921
But is it that easy for you?

1916
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:00,966
Did I mean anything to you?

1917
01:43:02,676 --> 01:43:03,969
I love you.

1918
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:09,266
Tonight is our night.

1919
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,811
I've been calling you.

1920
01:43:15,814 --> 01:43:17,065
Did you fuck him?

1921
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,453
Yes.

1922
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:31,705
Yes, I did.

1923
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:18,627
It's okay, bro.

1924
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:59,311
My life has always been
striving for perfection,

1925
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:01,938
chasing the perfect plan,

1926
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,815
the perfect girl,

1927
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:05,150
the perfect life.

1928
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:11,740
But perfection doesn't exist.

1929
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:16,286
And the journey isn't about
achieving some flawless ideal.

1930
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:21,416
It's like the search
for the ultimate cocktail.

1931
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,544
It's not about creating the perfect drink,

1932
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:28,131
but finding the one that truly satisfies.

1933
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,509
All the way to the top.

1934
01:46:31,593 --> 01:46:33,303
Go ahead. Don't be shy.

1935
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:39,601
And when life becomes too much,

1936
01:46:40,519 --> 01:46:42,979
what you need isn't another drink.

1937
01:46:43,647 --> 01:46:47,150
Sometimes, you just need a detox.

1938
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:02,249
Alcohol.

1939
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:06,336
The first sip, hitting you just right.

1940
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:11,091
As if forgetting all your problems
while you're having the time of your life.

1941
01:47:12,425 --> 01:47:14,094
But when you drink too much?

1942
01:47:14,594 --> 01:47:16,847
Headache. Hangover.

1943
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:19,432
But why do you still drink so much?

1944
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,269
Because you're used to it.

1945
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:26,314
Used to the cycle of getting drunk.

1946
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:28,483
The cycle of being lost.

1947
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:30,360
The cycle of blaming yourself.

1948
01:47:31,903 --> 01:47:34,698
Until when will you continue
to wake up with a hangover?

1949
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,828
You need a detox.

1950
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:42,289
And not just the temporary hangover cure.

1951
01:47:42,372 --> 01:47:45,834
A true detox that'll give you
true freedom and happiness.

1952
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:48,628
One that won't require a chaser.

1953
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:55,427
Sometimes, you'll get a glass of cold
water in the middle of a wild party.

1954
01:47:55,510 --> 01:48:00,015
To quench your thirst and wake you up.

1955
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:04,269
Like Shane.

1956
01:48:04,936 --> 01:48:07,397
He woke me up into fixing my life.

1957
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:10,108
He made me feel
like I had something in me,

1958
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:11,651
that I had worth.

1959
01:48:12,402 --> 01:48:14,821
He was the glass of water
that woke me up again.

1960
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:18,909
But no matter how many
glasses of water you drink…

1961
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:23,413
…if you're set on getting drunk,
you'll still end up wasted in the end.

1962
01:48:25,874 --> 01:48:29,169
It's not in the glass of water.
It's up to you.

1963
01:48:29,252 --> 01:48:33,215
At the end of the day,
the only thing that can really detox you

1964
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:34,633
is yourself.

1965
01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:37,010
We're good. We miss you.

1966
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:42,974
- Charles!
- Gaila, what's up?

1967
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:46,811
How have you been? I'm okay. You?

1968
01:48:46,895 --> 01:48:49,522
Good. Still wearing this scarf.
You look good.

1969
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:52,359
Hey, thanks. Just had some things done.

1970
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:55,320
- Shane?
- How is he?

1971
01:48:55,403 --> 01:48:57,864
He's okay. Busy with his career.

1972
01:48:57,948 --> 01:48:59,449
That's good to hear.

1973
01:48:59,532 --> 01:49:02,744
Well, I'm happy for him… and Alexia.

1974
01:49:03,745 --> 01:49:04,788
Alexia?

1975
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:09,167
They never got together.

1976
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:13,255
I mean, after the bar takeover?
Alexia went back to France.

1977
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,383
It's always been you.

1978
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,596
You know what?

1979
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:24,849
He just opened his bar last week.

1980
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:26,476
Maybe you want to drop by.

1981
01:49:55,338 --> 01:49:57,549
My name is Shane
and I'll be your server tonight.

1982
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:00,510
If you need anything, look for us
or any of the boys here.

1983
01:50:00,593 --> 01:50:03,722
I'll be going around,
so just raise your hand or whatever, okay?

1984
01:50:03,805 --> 01:50:05,682
Have fun. Thank you.

1985
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:09,561
What do you really want?

1986
01:50:09,644 --> 01:50:11,146
I wanna open a speakeasy.

1987
01:50:11,229 --> 01:50:13,565
Whether he's supportive or not,

1988
01:50:13,648 --> 01:50:15,817
you'll still be moving forward
with your dream.

1989
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:18,695
You can't give up.
We'll figure something out.

1990
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:19,946
I appreciate you.

1991
01:50:20,655 --> 01:50:21,656
Of course.

1992
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:26,202
Did you fuck him?

1993
01:50:57,317 --> 01:50:59,819
I will always love you, Lex.

1994
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:11,831
But my heart belongs to somebody else now.

1995
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:13,500
Okay?

1996
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:18,755
I'm gonna propose.

1997
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:22,258
I wanna marry her.

1998
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:25,512
I'm happy for you.

1999
01:51:26,262 --> 01:51:27,472
I will be.

2000
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:29,599
Thank you.

2001
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:48,952
And what can I get for you, ma'am?

2002
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,206
Surprise me.

2003
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:55,041
Surprise you?

2004
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:56,751
Okay.

2005
01:51:58,336 --> 01:52:01,798
Actually, tonight, we have
a special drink on the menu.

2006
01:52:01,881 --> 01:52:05,051
It's bold, unpredictable.

2007
01:52:05,135 --> 01:52:08,346
It has regrets, bitterness from the past,

2008
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:11,391
but a hint of sweetness.

2009
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:13,810
To remind us that not all hope is lost.

2010
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:17,230
Each drop carries the weight
of all memories shared.

2011
01:52:18,022 --> 01:52:19,524
And I call this drink…

2012
01:52:19,607 --> 01:52:20,775
The Revival.

2013
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:30,535
It's strong from the first sip.

2014
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:34,122
Meaning, you were deeply hurt.

2015
01:52:35,915 --> 01:52:39,127
The girl must have been an asshole
for this drink to be this strong.

2016
01:52:40,962 --> 01:52:45,133
She probably didn't know any better,
but… it's no excuse.

2017
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:48,303
She hurt you. On purpose.

2018
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:50,763
She should be sorry.

2019
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:56,603
She is.

2020
01:52:58,271 --> 01:52:59,314
But grateful.

2021
01:53:01,065 --> 01:53:02,150
Like this.

2022
01:53:04,527 --> 01:53:05,945
After a while,

2023
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,364
it tastes richer.

2024
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:12,160
Sweeter.

2025
01:53:14,829 --> 01:53:16,456
Tastes better.

2026
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,418
You've already moved on.

2027
01:53:21,836 --> 01:53:23,588
You've reached your dreams.

2028
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:26,674
You're happy.

2029
01:53:28,927 --> 01:53:29,928
Am I correct?

2030
01:53:33,181 --> 01:53:35,767
Wow, I didn't know
this was a palm reading.

2031
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:38,061
Okay, my turn.

2032
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:41,564
People like you,
who want to get surprised.

2033
01:53:42,857 --> 01:53:44,275
Confident.

2034
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:46,027
Very sure of themselves.

2035
01:53:47,445 --> 01:53:48,655
Not afraid of anything.

2036
01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:53,326
Whatever challenges you face,
whatever life throws at you,

2037
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:56,371
you're never scared.

2038
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:00,708
It looks like someone
is in a better place now.

2039
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:03,962
Correct?

2040
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:06,631
Maybe.

2041
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:11,177
Because you helped her find her path.

2042
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:13,763
Same.

2043
01:54:18,851 --> 01:54:19,936
Cheers?

2044
01:54:21,646 --> 01:54:22,855
Cheers.

2045
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:36,452
How's Bubbles?

2046
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:38,246
Bubbles is dead.

2047
01:54:38,329 --> 01:54:40,915
- No way! What happened?
- Yeah, I felt about bad it.

2048
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:42,250
What happened to her?

2049
01:54:42,333 --> 01:54:44,002
I think she drowned.

2050
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,255
She's a fish, dude!

2051
01:54:47,839 --> 01:54:49,215
How could Bubbles drown?

2052
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:51,551
She forgot she was a fish
and went looking for air!

2053
01:54:51,634 --> 01:54:53,177
- What the--
- Unbelievable.

2054
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:57,932
Hey, man!
