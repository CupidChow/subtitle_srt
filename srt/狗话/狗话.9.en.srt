1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,007
Here, boy!

2
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,675
Alex, that's it, this way.

3
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,712
Mmm...

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,844
Okay, try this new batch, Bella.

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,349
Smell good, Bella?

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,602
And you know what's even better?

7
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,270
It's really good for you.

8
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,738
Hey, Dad.

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,157
Oh, hey, sweetheart.

10
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,201
Hey, Maggie.

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,286
How are you doing,
my sweet preggy girl?

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,081
Yeah, only a couple
more weeks to go.

13
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,707
Honey?

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,167
- Yeah?
- Come here.

15
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,048
The puppies seem to like
that twinkle ball of yours.

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,383
Ehh, forget that.

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,843
What I have here
is true alchemy.

18
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,680
Pure puppy gold.

19
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,515
Check this out.

20
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,772
Hi!

21
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,243
Oh, my gosh.
Come here, you, come here.

22
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,870
Mwah! What'd you put in 'em?

23
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,580
Oh...

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,959
I think...
I finally got the recipe right.

25
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,419
Hi!

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,628
Hi! Hi!

27
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,632
Oh, you really ought to try
and get these into stores.

28
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,967
That's the plan.

29
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,181
Look, they love them.

30
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,525
I've cracked the code.

31
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,486
What's this?

32
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,155
A recipe for the healthiest,

33
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,407
most delicious
dog treats on the market.

34
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,908
Well, they're not
on the market yet,

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,785
but that's where you come in.

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,912
Oh, Scarlet...

37
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,539
You remember
our last pitch, right?

38
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,042
I remember, yeah.
It didn't go super well.

39
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,752
Yeah, and the pitch before that?

40
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,172
You know what they say, geniuses
are often misunderstood.

41
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,841
But you gotta
trust me on this one.

42
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,885
And all those products
that we couldn't sell

43
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,803
to the other stores, I mean,

44
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,597
who carries them now?

45
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,682
Okay, fair.

46
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,517
Look, I do trust you,

47
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,729
but your last venture into pet
cuisine was a bit of a disaster.

48
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,439
Yeah, I'll admit,

49
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,083
vegetable-infused ice cream
wasn't the best choice,

50
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,485
but this is the real deal.

51
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:18,114
Bella loves them, the new litter
at my dad's went wild over them.

52
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,785
I even brought
some for Baxter and Tilly.

53
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,582
If they love them, will you
partner with me on this?

54
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,796
Come on!

55
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,381
You're so good at branding,

56
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,966
and I need a
catchy name and a logo. Please?

57
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,638
Fine.

58
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,517
Fine. Fine.

59
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,145
Okay, let's see
what we've got here.

60
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,314
Oh, they smell good.

61
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,071
Do you want to try one?
Do you want to try one?

62
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,198
Yes, baby.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,661
I've got one for you. Yes, baby.

64
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,330
Yeah! Oh, I haven't
forgotten you.

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,418
I guess you
really like those, huh?

66
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,880
Are you smiling right now
because you love them?

67
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,674
Oh, I don't think you do.

68
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,384
Oh...

69
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,640
How do you convey...

70
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:30,520
nutritious
and delicious in a name?

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,107
Hmm.

72
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,946
I think you're gonna love this.

73
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,489
It looks great, doesn't it?

74
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,866
Pup's Palate? It's perfect.

75
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,117
I think this is gonna work.

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,829
Right? All right. Let's go.

77
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,417
I'm sorry, the figures
just don't work for me.

78
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,211
Best of luck.

79
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,921
The name and the
packaging are appealing,

80
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,301
and the ingredients
are top-shelf, but...

81
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,969
Pup Chuck is the leading brand.

82
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,637
Truth is, we don't have room

83
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,058
in our stores for
an untested product

84
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,517
with no sales history.

85
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm sorry. Good luck.

86
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,107
- No.
- Not gonna happen.

87
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,486
Thanks for coming all this way,
but it's gonna be a no.

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,744
Ugh, what a day.

89
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,995
Tell me about it.

90
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,830
That's nice.

91
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,248
I just don't understand

92
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,833
why Pup Chuck has
so much shelf space.

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,919
I mean, our puppies
don't even like it.

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,381
Yeah, Tilly and Baxter
don't like it either.

95
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,466
Pup Chuck?
It's more like upchuck.

96
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,344
Okay, well,
it hasn't been a total loss.

97
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,055
You did manage to
convince one buyer.

98
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,015
You carry
my product out of pity.

99
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,600
That is not true.

100
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,519
You just need to keep at it

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,604
until something hits.

102
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,024
I mean you know that
Thomas Edison quote

103
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,359
about light bulbs and failure.

104
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,361
Yep. I haven't failed.

105
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,780
I just found 10,000 ways
that didn't work.

106
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,366
I should frame that
and hang it on my wall.

107
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,828
Okay, well,
things may not be working out

108
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
the way we want
them to right now,

109
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,667
but Matt still sent me over with
this delicious bottle of Pinot,

110
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,004
and said that we should toast
to our efforts so far. Hmm?

111
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,423
You have a great husband.

112
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,092
Hm. I do, don't I?

113
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,390
A toast to Edison
and his 10,000 failures.

114
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,058
And the light bulb.

115
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,563
And to you and your...
indomitable creative spirit.

116
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,525
Okay, okay, what I'm
thinking is that we just...

117
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,068
we need to cast a wider net.

118
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,904
We've pitched it just about
every store I know of.

119
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,824
Actually, there is one that I
thought of on the way over here

120
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,951
that we didn't get to.
It opened last year.

121
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:54,581
It's called the, um...
Paws and Wellness Emporium.

122
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,583
Hmm, interesting name.

123
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,253
It's a new chain, but they're
expanding nationwide.

124
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,713
I mean, their shelf space

125
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,382
is probably already
filled with Pup Chuck.

126
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,134
Well, I don't know.

127
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,803
But it's still worth a try.

128
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,015
Look, it just takes one "yes",

129
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,017
and then, we're in business.

130
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,935
That's true.

131
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,481
I'm up for
one more pitch, if you are.

132
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,941
- Okay.
- Hmm?

133
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,072
Cheers.

134
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:37,290
What you accomplish in life
comes down to a few key moments,

135
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,209
and I think this is one of them.

136
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,131
Let's do this.

137
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,638
They have a
dog mascot named Duke!

138
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,848
Aww, that is so cute.

139
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,642
Oh, here.

140
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,269
Excuse me.

141
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,271
- Can I help you ladies?
- Hi.

142
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,108
We have a meeting with the
general manager, Alex Paulson.

143
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,317
Umm...

144
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,194
Right over there.

145
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,113
That's him right over there?

146
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,031
Yeah.

147
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,162
Thank you.

148
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,831
You okay?

149
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,958
You're looking kind of nervous.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,002
Oh, please.

151
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,146
You'll see. By the end of this
meeting, I'll have him eating

152
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,256
puppy treats
out of the palm of my hand.

153
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,051
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

154
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,596
Uh...

155
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,516
That did not just happen.

156
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,184
Clean up on isle three?

157
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,853
I... I'll go get the broom.

158
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,105
- Thanks, Benny.
- I am so sorry.

159
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,523
It's okay. Accidents happen.

160
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,233
I'll pay for all of it.

161
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,610
That's kind of you.

162
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,531
But that's not our policy.
Believe me,

163
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,241
I've seen a lot worse.

164
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,076
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,955
Yeah, I'm sure.
Like I said, accidents happen.

166
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,210
Mr. Paulson.

167
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,712
Oh. Call me Alex.

168
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,047
- I'm Gina.
- Gina.

169
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,566
This is Scarlett,
my business partner.

170
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,216
- Scarlett.
- Hi.

171
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,426
And, uh...

172
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,844
we're with Pup's Palate.

173
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,721
Oh.

174
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,598
Wow.

175
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,434
Well, mess aside, it's
nice to meet you both.

176
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,561
Oh, you've got, uh, birdseed.

177
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,563
There you go.

178
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,939
- All good.
- Thanks.

179
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,276
How about you both
come to the office

180
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,987
and tell me a little more
about your product?

181
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,448
Great. Great.

182
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,158
Oh. Oh.

183
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,827
- Sure.
- Great.

184
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,205
Watch your step.

185
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,956
Off to a great start, huh?

186
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,917
I'm so sorry.
I'll pull it together.

187
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,752
You know,
just try to keep your hands

188
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,545
out of his hair
during the pitch.

189
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,464
Unlike the leading brand

190
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,186
that currently
overclutters the shelf space

191
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,468
at grocery stores
and pet supply retailers,

192
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,471
there is nothing
artificial in Pup's Palate.

193
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,264
Every ingredient

194
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,600
is the highest quality and
engineered to promote

195
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,227
strong bone and muscle growth,

196
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,646
strengthen eyesight,
and aid in brain development.

197
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,440
Hmm. Wow.

198
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,234
These have been test-marketed?

199
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,319
Absolutely. Extensively.

200
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,029
And dogs seem to like it?

201
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,490
Oh, they love it.

202
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,367
Hmm. And where's it
currently being carried?

203
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,952
Chew That.

204
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,805
Not familiar with that.
Is that... is that a chain?

205
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,623
No, it's a single store.
It's great, though.

206
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,500
It's the best. Gina owns it.

207
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,794
Oh, makes sense.

208
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,089
Listen, I think this
is an excellent product.

209
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,675
I really do. But...

210
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,218
But you don't
have room in your store

211
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,971
for an untested product
with no sales history.

212
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,766
That's not what
I was gonna say. It's just...

213
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,269
before I make a decision,
I thought maybe

214
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,230
I'd try it out on my own puppy,
see if he likes it.

215
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,442
You... do you have a dog?

216
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,776
- I do.
- Ah.

217
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,029
A young Golden named Mosey.

218
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,284
So, if you... Pup's Palate is
actually what you say it is,

219
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,119
I'll consider placing an order.

220
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,912
That's amazing.

221
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,223
Don't you think,
Gina, that's amazing?

222
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,958
Oh, I do, I do.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,936
But I think we
should be going before we say

224
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,962
or do anything that might
make him change his mind.

225
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,383
Um, thank you so much
for your time, Alex.

226
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,844
Pleasure. Scarlett.

227
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,263
We'll leave you the box.

228
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,432
I hope Mosey enjoys it.

229
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,226
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

230
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,770
See ya.

231
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,068
Mosey...

232
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,363
Like, "Mosey along?"

233
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,199
That's exactly it.

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,701
I love it.

235
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,495
Bye.

236
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,211
Pup Chuck quarterly report,

237
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,879
Mr. Prescott.

238
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,884
We need to do something to
boost this profit margin.

239
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,719
Mm.
I was thinking the same thing.

240
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,304
- Were you?
- No.

241
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,598
It's too thin.
Board's gonna jump all over it.

242
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,558
We need to fatten it up.

243
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,269
What's glucosamine, anyway?

244
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,896
Well, look it up.

245
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,731
- Oh. Right.
- Jeez.

246
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,818
They teach you anything at
Harvard Business School?

247
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,363
Glucosamine is a nutrient
that supports joint health.

248
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,781
Does it affect taste?

249
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,658
Uh...
Says here it's tasteless.

250
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,159
Then get rid of it.

251
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,553
Cost of that stuff's
gone through the roof.

252
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,578
But, sir...

253
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,830
Not up for discussion.

254
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,581
Our priority here is what?

255
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,768
- Fattening the profit margin.
- Now, you are getting it.

256
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,961
Uh-uh-uh. I need you to run
another report for me.

257
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,213
Come here. Write it down.

258
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,590
If we were to reduce the
amount of food in our bags by,

259
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,676
let's say, two or three percent,

260
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,179
but we continue to increase
pricing at CPI plus one percent,

261
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,098
how would that
impact profit margin?

262
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,308
My guess is
it'd make it even fatter.

263
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,310
Good because
I want it as fat as that bear

264
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,938
that won Fat Bear Week.
You see that thing?

265
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,648
- No.
- Well, it was... it was fat.

266
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,067
Now, go.

267
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,821
Go faster.

268
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,823
Mosey, want to try a new treat?

269
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,993
Mosey, come on.

270
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,663
Try this out, buddy?
What do you think?

271
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,458
Whoa.

272
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,211
Someone is hungry.

273
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,564
That's a lot of Pup Chuck.

274
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,244
You wait right here. I'm not
done with your spa treatment.

275
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,582
- Hello?
- Scarlett.

276
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,125
Hi, it's Alex Paulson,

277
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,811
general manager of
Paulson Wellness Emporium.

278
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,504
Oh, hi.

279
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,424
Hi. Listen. Um...
I just wanted to tell you

280
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,010
that... Mosey...

281
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,346
absolutely loved Pup's Palate,

282
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,891
and, um...
we'd like to place an order.

283
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,687
Scarlett, you there?

284
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,522
Oh. Yeah, hi.

285
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,192
Sure, an order, we can do that.
Uh, how much were you thinking?

286
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,277
Well, how soon can
you deliver 100 boxes?

287
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:28,535
Oh, Scarlett, why did you
have to tell him tomorrow?

288
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,203
You know a few extra days

289
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,931
would have made this
a little more manageable.

290
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:36,209
I just wanted to
seem official, you know?

291
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,795
Like, "100 boxes.
Yeah, no problem.

292
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,881
"We'll get that to you."
You know?

293
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,717
"We're a real company."

294
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,885
Hey, we are a real company now.

295
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,389
Yeah, we are.

296
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,767
You know, if this works out,
we're gonna need to staff up,

297
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,894
you know, get
some more equipment.

298
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,480
This is so exciting.

299
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,441
Yes, it is!

300
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,447
You know what else was exciting?

301
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,324
That thing I noticed
between you and Alex.

302
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,659
What thing?

303
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,494
Oh, don't even.

304
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,414
Sparks that flew when you two
locked eyes were like...

305
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,000
4th of July fireworks.

306
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:21,046
Please. He likes you. Trust me.

307
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,440
You know,
it didn't even seem to matter

308
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,883
that you destroyed
his display of birdseed.

309
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,219
Oh, my gosh,
that was so embarrassing.

310
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:34,267
Okay, fine. I'll admit,
he's sort of good-looking.

311
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,687
Sort of? Okay,
no disrespect to my husband...

312
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,397
you know I love Matt to pieces...

313
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,691
but Alex is just...

314
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,362
He's just...
different level attractive.

315
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,113
Mm-hmm.

316
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,157
Yeah, well, he's probably
got loads of girlfriends,

317
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
so he's not the kind of
type I would date, anyway.

318
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,579
We did just meet the guy.

319
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,956
But beyond his looks,

320
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,502
I mean, he's...
polite and friendly.

321
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,422
And unlike your ex,
actually employed?

322
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,050
Okay, just because
Jeremy didn't have a job

323
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,135
didn't make him a bad guy.

324
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:13,431
Look, Scarlett, let's face it,

325
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,310
you don't exactly make the best
choices when it comes to men.

326
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,145
I mean, time and
again you've dismissed

327
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,665
what may have been
the right one and...

328
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,067
and gone with the wrong one.

329
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,152
Am I right or wrong?

330
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,572
Yeah, you're right.

331
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,366
I thought I could trust him.

332
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,411
I thought a lot of things
about Jeremy that were wrong.

333
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,288
So, don't be afraid
to take a chance. Hmm?

334
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,420
It's often
where you find true love.

335
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,761
Check it out, Boss.

336
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,014
It's flying off the shelf.

337
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,891
- High paw.
- High paw.

338
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,061
Thanks.

339
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,873
Just right inside
the door would be perfect.

340
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,485
He wants to meet for coffee?

341
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,612
Why do I feel like
I'm getting nervous?

342
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,072
Hmm.

343
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,575
"How about
Little Victories 8 a.m."?

344
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,747
A date?

345
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,915
It's not a date.

346
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,876
Is it?

347
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,044
It's totally a date.

348
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,879
It's a business meeting.

349
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,633
Okay, fine. Then, it's a date
disguised as business meeting.

350
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,469
Do you really think so?

351
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,512
I mean,
we're just going for coffee.

352
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,723
Well, my first date with
Matt was at a coffee shop.

353
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,893
Oh. How romantic.

354
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,020
It was, actually.

355
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:46,983
Yeah, but what was romantic had
nothing to do with the coffee.

356
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:51,363
No, it's when I realized...
how genuinely interested he was

357
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,490
to know every
little thing about me.

358
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,036
And the way that he...

359
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,413
he looked at me...

360
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,249
it was like no one else existed.

361
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,628
I... I'd never been on a date

362
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,216
with someone that was
just so focused on me.

363
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,260
It's like he was
savoring every minute.

364
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:18,098
He never even
checked his phone once.

365
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,016
You know what he told me after?

366
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,227
That he knew right
from the beginning

367
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,853
that I was
the girl of his dreams.

368
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,439
Aww...

369
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,570
You know, really,
that sounds special.

370
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:37,367
So, remember, Scarlett,
when it comes to relationships,

371
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,162
never settle for anything
but the absolute best.

372
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,832
Yeah.

373
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,341
No, it's true.

374
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,427
You're looking at
the Illinois state record holder

375
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,803
for the longest ride ever.

376
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,221
You're serious?

377
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,890
Peoria to Chicago, 173 miles.

378
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,225
No way.

379
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,768
You can look it up.

380
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,604
I mean, how'd you do that?

381
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,983
I don't know.
Youthful determination?

382
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,318
I was 16.

383
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,448
My friends thought I was crazy.
Maybe I was crazy, but...

384
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,576
I raised $17,000
for the animal shelter.

385
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,387
I was more proud of
that than the ride itself.

386
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,331
Amazing.

387
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,684
You know, I wouldn't have pegged
you for a unicycler, though.

388
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,836
Oh, then,
you do not know me at all.

389
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,713
If it is unusual, unique,

390
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:36,051
something most people
can't do, I am all over it.

391
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,345
Yeah, I guess we could see that.

392
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,723
How'd we get
on the subject, anyway?

393
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,059
Hmm. My fault.

394
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,453
I'm just asking
way too many questions.

395
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,103
Yeah, would you cut that out?

396
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,689
Sorry, I'm just
genuinely interested.

397
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,691
In what exactly?

398
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,278
In you.

399
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,365
Do you need to get that?

400
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,284
Um...

401
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,954
I can wait.

402
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,665
Um...

403
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,336
So, we should probably
talk business, right?

404
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,922
I mean, that's why
we're here, isn't it?

405
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,216
Yeah, let's get into it.

406
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,760
I'd like to double
what I ordered last time.

407
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,096
Double? You're kidding.

408
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,806
No, I'm the GM.

409
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,266
It's my job to supply
what the customers want.

410
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,771
I'd like to speak
with our regional manager

411
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,856
and ask her if
she'll hear your pitch.

412
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,317
Yeah, I would really
appreciate that, Alex.

413
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,777
Don't mention it.

414
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,990
Cheers.

415
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,123
Thanks again for everything.

416
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,334
Of course. It was a lot of fun.

417
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,919
Yeah, it was.

418
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,587
So, where are you off to?

419
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,507
Oh, I go to this rock climbing
gym on the weekends.

420
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,384
I'm just gonna
head over there right now.

421
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,802
Wow, rock climbing.

422
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,596
So, I'm not the only one
into unique hobbies.

423
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,433
Yeah, yeah.
It's really therapeutic,

424
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,685
keeps my mind off everything,

425
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,563
gets me really present,
you know, in the moment.

426
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,107
It's also a really good workout.

427
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,400
Hmm. I worked out earlier.

428
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,444
I like to get
my exercise in early,

429
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,404
so the rest of the day
is dedicated to work.

430
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,448
- Even on a Saturday?
- Even on Sunday.

431
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,491
It's just us
running the business.

432
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,368
It's the only way to get ahead.

433
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,913
Well, I hope
I'm not being too forward,

434
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,458
but do you want to come with?

435
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,418
I mean,
you're totally dressed for it.

436
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,879
Take time to
celebrate your wins?

437
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,213
You know what?

438
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,632
Maybe work can
wait a couple of hours.

439
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,259
Yeah?

440
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,719
Yeah!

441
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,138
I think I want to give
rock climbing a try.

442
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,473
I think we should do it, then.

443
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,558
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

444
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:01,237
Okay, this is my happy place.

445
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,923
You don't do this
on real mountains, do you?

446
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,325
Sure, yeah.

447
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,243
I go camping as often as I can,

448
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:11,247
just to kind
of restart, you know?

449
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,584
Can I grab this from here?
Thank you so much.

450
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,628
You know, I go climbing,

451
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,421
hiking, fishing.

452
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,274
You know, it's just really
nice to detach for a while,

453
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,509
just completely
immerse yourself in nature.

454
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,094
It's good for
the soul, you know?

455
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,637
I think I would
have a panic attack

456
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,681
if I was away
from work for too long.

457
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,767
Well, I believe in
a work-life balance.

458
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,103
Who knows?

459
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,813
You might even
find being in nature,

460
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,232
well, you know,
it might actually

461
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,067
feed your creativity.

462
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,236
You want a demonstration?

463
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,570
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

464
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,656
All right, chalk
your hands up like this.

465
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,203
And get a good hold, like so.

466
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,664
And then, away we go.

467
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,419
Remember to use your legs.

468
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,839
Wow, you're really good.

469
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,430
And one last move.

470
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,560
All right, that's it.

471
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,853
Way to go, Alex.

472
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,655
That was impressive!

473
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,574
Sorry.

474
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,702
No worries.
But now it's your turn.

475
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,203
Okay!

476
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,664
Okay. Okay, first,
I'd like you to loop this,

477
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,082
and you're gonna feed it

478
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,476
right through the
red loop, both red loops,

479
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,127
- Like this?
- Yeah, just like that.

480
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,004
Okay. I'm gonna belay you.

481
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,006
What's that mean?

482
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,716
Well, if you fall, I got you.

483
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:48,303
Oh. So, I'm putting
my life in your hands.

484
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,156
Well, a rock climb
requires you trust your partner.

485
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,890
That sure is asking a lot.

486
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,826
I mean, we're just starting
to get to know each other.

487
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,729
Trust me, Scarlett. I got you.

488
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,732
Okay.

489
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,861
You got me?

490
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:08,198
I got you.

491
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,450
All right, Scarlett,
away you go.

492
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,997
Foothold.

493
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,003
I think I like this.

494
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,922
You're doing great.

495
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,590
Keep going.

496
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,388
Okay!

497
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,306
- I did it!
- You did!

498
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,767
Congratulations! That's great!

499
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,489
All right, now,
I want you to hold the rope

500
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,871
and push off the wall
with your feet.

501
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,106
Uh...

502
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,900
You want me to
let go of the wall?

503
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:46,861
Don't worry, Scarlett.
I gotcha. You can trust me.

504
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,406
He's got me. I can trust him.

505
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,119
Whoo!

506
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,287
There you go.

507
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,628
Oh, my gosh, that was amazing.

508
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,756
That was incredible.
You did great.

509
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,009
So, do you want to
try a different route

510
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,319
or do you have
to get back to work?

511
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,512
I think
I have time for one more.

512
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,389
Well, that's what
I like to hear.

513
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,683
All right, let's go.

514
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,982
Yes?

515
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,710
Secretary
Alex Paulson is here to see you.

516
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,694
Oh, great.

517
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,571
Just give me a minute
and then send him in.

518
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,749
Come on in.

519
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,916
Please, have a seat.

520
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,669
Oh, okay.

521
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,421
So, what brings
you up to corporate?

522
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,465
Aside from wanting to see me.

523
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,887
Well, I just want to bring
a new product to your attention.

524
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,305
What is it?

525
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,058
It's a dog treat
called Pup's Palate.

526
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,601
A new dog treat.

527
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,895
- Mm-hmm.
- Not very exciting.

528
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:04,356
Well, to dog owners, it is.

529
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,733
I just put a little shelf space
aside in my store

530
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:10,153
and it's doing really,
really well.

531
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,613
My own pup loves it,

532
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,656
and the women behind
the business started it

533
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,176
because they actually
care about the health

534
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,493
and wellbeing of puppies.

535
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,662
Puppies don't spend money, Alex.

536
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, in my store, the owners
are spending it on Pup's Palate.

537
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:27,462
Look, I just ask you to hear
their pitch, that's all.

538
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,174
Sure. Why not?

539
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,842
Great.

540
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,762
Look, I'm not one to mix
business with personal matters,

541
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,639
so let's just
shelve the business for now.

542
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,974
You've been very distant lately.

543
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,227
Um...

544
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,188
Sorry, I thought we...

545
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,399
agreed that, um,

546
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,318
we're gonna step back
from this relationship.

547
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,529
For the sake of our friendship

548
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,115
and-and, you know,
working together.

549
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:58,952
That was not my takeaway
from our last conversation.

550
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:02,038
I thought we had a good thing
going and I agreed we should,

551
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,542
you know, slow things down, but
I don't think either one of us,

552
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,420
like, was definitive
about ending things.

553
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,381
Well, I...

554
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,049
Sorry, I...

555
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,759
Oh, sorry. Yes?

556
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,511
Your 10 o'clock
conference call

557
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,846
is ready when you are.

558
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,973
All right,
I'll be right with them.

559
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,993
Listen, I have to jump
on this call, but I would love

560
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,435
to get together to talk.

561
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,270
You know,
I think it's pretty clear

562
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,022
that I'm not ready to move on.

563
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,898
And if you are, that's... fine,

564
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,736
um, but I would love
to talk it through.

565
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,279
Yeah.

566
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,907
- Sure.
- Great. Okay.

567
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:41,119
I already made us a reservation,
anyway, so that's perfect.

568
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,580
- Thank you, Alex.
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,264
Hey, Dad.

570
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,016
Oh, hi, honey.

571
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,477
Hi.

572
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,562
- Hello.
- Hello.

573
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,106
I thought I'd stock you up.

574
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,901
Oh.

575
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,569
Hi.

576
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,490
Paws doubled their order,

577
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,533
so we've cranked
production into high gear.

578
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,345
And we're looking to
lease some new equipment.

579
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,121
Oh, honey, that is great news.

580
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,791
I think that this is
going to really take off.

581
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

582
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,752
But the...

583
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,021
the Pawggles
might need a little work.

584
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,880
Hmm. Yeah.

585
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,108
Looks like I need to go back to
the drawing board on that one.

586
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:39,010
Because dogs need
UV protection, too, you know.

587
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,596
How's Maggie doing?

588
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,974
Well, you know, she's been
a bit more lethargic than usual,

589
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,644
but I think she's okay.

590
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,104
I'm keeping a close eye on her.

591
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,814
Okay.

592
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:54,067
I think I'll go sit
with her for a bit later.

593
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,736
Hi.

594
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,363
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

595
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,864
Hi.

596
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,668
How you doing, sweet girl?

597
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,130
Yeah, creating new life
must really tucker you out.

598
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,634
But the joy you'll
bring into this world...

599
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,054
Oh...

600
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,479
Hey, Mose.
Wanna go for a run, boy?

601
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,606
Yeah? You ready for a run?

602
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,191
Oh, so am I.

603
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,777
Okay. Here we go.

604
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,863
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

605
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,365
Come on.
We can go by the dog park, too.

606
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:44,701
Come on. Good boy.

607
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,931
Okay, I know you love the park.
We're almost there.

608
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,253
gonna be there all day.

609
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:58,882
Good boy.

610
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,304
Come here often?

611
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,599
- Alex, hi.
- Hey, Scarlett.

612
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,352
- Oh, mind if I sit?
- Of course.

613
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,728
All right. Thanks.

614
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,648
Did you bring Mosey?

615
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,400
- I did.
- Which one is he?

616
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,235
He's right over there.

617
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,238
You got him from Picket Fence
Puppies, didn't you?

618
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,866
I did. How'd you know?

619
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,786
I never forget one of our pups.
As a matter of fact,

620
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,871
I think I was there
when he was born.

621
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,248
- Jack Townsend is my dad.
- You're kidding me.

622
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,376
- Nope.
- He's great.

623
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,711
So, puppies is
a family business?

624
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,505
Yeah,
I guess you could say that.

625
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,882
I actually
designed this dog park.

626
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,927
Planning to
expand it in the spring,

627
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,304
so I'm just
brainstorming a few ideas.

628
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,598
Wow. You got a lot going on.

629
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,518
I also invented 27
new dog toys and accessories.

630
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,396
I have patents on six,
the rest patent pending.

631
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,980
What are you? Like,

632
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,625
the Leonardo da Vinci
of the pet world or what?

633
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:58,918
I think that's
a bit of a stretch,

634
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:00,276
but I appreciate the compliment.

635
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,696
You're certainly prolific.

636
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,907
Oh, looks like Bella met Mosey.

637
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,701
Hmm. Bella's your pup?

638
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,744
Mm-hmm.

639
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,788
So, are they
from the same litter?

640
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,874
Different parents,
a couple of weeks apart.

641
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,644
Hmm. Looks like they're
already fond of each other.

642
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,045
Yeah, I think they are.

643
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,299
You know,
it's sort of serendipitous

644
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,634
I ran into you here.

645
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,386
- It is?
- Yeah.

646
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,930
I, uh... I got some good news.

647
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:32,225
I was gonna see if you
wanted to meet up tomorrow,

648
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,645
so I could tell you in person,
but might as well tell you now.

649
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,148
I managed to get you
a pitch meeting

650
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:40,025
with our regional manager
Michelle.

651
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:43,653
Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Alex.
Thank you! Thank you!

652
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,155
You're welcome.

653
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,325
Um...

654
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:53,538
even though I don't have
an excuse to ask you out,

655
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,001
um... do you think you still
might want to do something?

656
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:01,963
Depends.
What'd you have in mind?

657
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,680
This is pretty cool.

658
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,182
Feels like we went back in time.

659
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,976
Yeah.

660
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,704
You know, they've been
holding screenings here

661
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:17,937
in the springtime every year,

662
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,314
since our parents were kids.

663
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:21,024
Did you come here growing up?

664
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,026
Oh, yeah.
My parents were movie buffs.

665
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,278
So, whenever they
showed a classic screening

666
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,530
here in the park,
that was our Friday night.

667
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,741
I love that.

668
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,458
Mmm...

669
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,835
What are you doing?

670
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,587
You're gonna miss the movie.

671
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,632
Got to reply
to one of my suppliers.

672
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,258
Right this second?

673
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,428
"Nothing works unless you do."
That's Maya Angelou.

674
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,765
Um, yeah, she was a genius,

675
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,393
but I don't think
she meant that exactly.

676
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:01,439
Work-life balance,
just give it a try.

677
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,692
- Okay.
- Yeah.

678
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:26,172
Hey, Dad, what's up?

679
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,049
Okay, slow down.

680
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,968
What's wrong with Maggie?

681
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,888
Okay, I'll be right there.

682
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:40,186
This pregnancy has
been harder on Maggie this time.

683
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:43,690
Her energy, she's been
really tuckered out lately.

684
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:45,316
Hmm...

685
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,944
I'm gonna do a sonogram,
so we can get a closer look.

686
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,992
I think I figured out

687
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,618
why she's so fatigued.

688
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,328
Why?

689
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,331
One, two, three, four,

690
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:04,210
five, six, seven,

691
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,129
eight, nine, ten.

692
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,300
That'll tucker anyone out.

693
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,302
I'll run her blood work
back to the lab,

694
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:16,306
just to get everything checked
out, but I think she'll be fine.

695
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:19,851
Thank you for coming
so quickly, Dr. Mitchell.

696
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:23,146
Whenever you have
any concerns, call me, okay?

697
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,440
You had us worried, sweet girl.

698
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,233
You're gonna be just fine.

699
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:35,909
I like it.

700
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,828
- You do?
- I do.

701
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,097
It's about time
we inject some new life

702
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,498
into the pet treat section.

703
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,333
So, I'll tell you what,

704
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,794
I will start it out at one-third
of our 72 stores,

705
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,879
and if it moves,

706
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,590
we will distribute
Pup's Palate regionally.

707
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:53,426
Yeah, yeah. I...
we would love that.

708
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,137
And I don't want to
get ahead of myself, but...

709
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,016
if it does well, we could be
looking at a nationwide rollout.

710
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,728
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

711
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,980
I'm glad Alex brought it to me.

712
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,857
He was a real
advocate for you two.

713
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,651
- We love Alex.
- Yeah, I do.

714
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:14,864
I mean, we do.

715
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:16,449
I don't actually mean love-love,

716
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:19,160
like in a romantic way.
What I meant to say is

717
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,955
we love his
enthusiasm and just...

718
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,873
general personality and...

719
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,834
And we should go. You know?

720
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,377
Because I'm sure Michelle

721
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,421
has a very busy afternoon
ahead of her.

722
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,340
So...

723
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:35,635
Thank you again so much.
You're not gonna regret this.

724
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:37,053
Come on.

725
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,389
- Bye.
- Bye.

726
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,652
Alex, yeah, I just saw the pitch

727
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,655
and I placed
an order for 24 stores.

728
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,116
Oh, they were excited all right.

729
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:01,953
Listen, for dinner,
what do you think about Maddie?

730
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,544
Really appreciate you
guys getting here so fast.

731
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:12,339
Thank you.

732
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,507
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey.

733
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:15,884
Oh, big day, huh?

734
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,344
Just getting
all the new equipment.

735
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,887
Can't tell you how excited I am.

736
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,597
Well, I got you something.

737
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,766
- Oh, what is that?
- Take a look.

738
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:29,314
Just like the chef
at Cordon Bleu wear.

739
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,109
- How do I look?
- You look great.

740
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,278
I mean official.

741
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,155
Thank you.

742
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,592
Do you want to come inside and
see how I set up the operation?

743
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:43,828
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, let's check it out.

744
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,663
Welcome.

745
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,916
This has always
been my design studio,

746
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,627
but it's also perfect
for this operation.

747
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,379
I like it.

748
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,130
I'm adding fans for ventilation,

749
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,132
an industrial-scale
kitchen over here,

750
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,468
and a packaging
assembly line over there.

751
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,053
Great space.

752
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,222
And all of our
ingredients for the next month

753
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,057
are express-shipped.

754
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,767
And, with the
equipment I've leased,

755
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,560
we'll definitely
have the capacity

756
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:09,372
to handle our current orders
and a good amount of growth.

757
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,814
Well, that's important

758
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,400
because I think you're
going to keep growing,

759
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,318
and I'll be
right there beside you.

760
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:24,744
Right against the back wall
would be great. Thanks.

761
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:27,080
Amazing how this has taken off.

762
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,581
I'm really,
really happy for you.

763
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,500
I think this calls
for celebration.

764
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,128
Besides,
I owe you for all your help.

765
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,672
Work-life balance, right?
Celebrate our wins?

766
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,924
I'd love to take you
for dinner tonight.

767
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:41,553
Oh, I'd love to, Scarlett,
but I have a prior obligation,

768
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:42,846
with Michelle.

769
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,305
Michelle the regional manager?

770
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:45,849
Yeah.

771
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,393
Oh. I didn't realize
you two had a thing.

772
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,621
We're just getting together
to just talk things through.

773
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,731
- That's all.
- Oh.

774
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,693
But maybe we can
get together tomorrow night.

775
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,695
I think I'll be pretty busy

776
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,905
getting this place
all sorted out.

777
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,533
But maybe I can help?

778
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,369
No, you've done enough already.

779
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:07,996
Tina and I have it covered.

780
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,247
You sure?

781
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,791
Yeah. Um...

782
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:15,003
I appreciate all your help,
Alex, I really do.

783
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,685
It's not as good
as the 2018, but it's not bad.

784
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,020
What do you think?

785
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,731
It's pretty good.

786
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,524
Not too oaky?

787
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:39,235
Um...
No, I don't think so.

788
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,154
I'm no wine connoisseur,
though, so.

789
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,616
I recently did
a vineyard tour in Napa.

790
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,993
It was fabulous.

791
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:50,330
Maybe we could
do that together sometime.

792
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:51,998
Oh, you know me,

793
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,459
when it comes to the outdoors,
I prefer to rough it.

794
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:58,171
I guess I haven't matured
to wine tasting quite yet.

795
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,215
You'll get there.

796
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,841
Yeah, we'll see.

797
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:07,430
This is really nice, Alex.

798
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,767
Yeah, it is really nice.

799
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,228
No, I mean this, us.

800
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,272
Oh.

801
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:17,941
Michelle,

802
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:22,612
listen, this is
really nice, but...

803
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,280
I need to be honest with you.

804
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,450
Let me guess. You don't want
to be tied down right now.

805
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:28,868
Why would you think that?

806
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,371
You know this not me at all.

807
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,958
You don't think that I see
the way women look at you?

808
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,421
Most of them would do
anything to date a guy like you,

809
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,131
and yet, you're still single.

810
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,550
Uh...

811
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:49,764
Michelle, what...

812
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,224
I think it's best I leave.

813
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,560
I thought there might be
something between us

814
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,103
worth pursuing.

815
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,440
I'm sorry I put you
in this position, Alex.

816
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,109
Uh, Michelle...

817
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:16,291
- Hello, Michelle.
- Paul!

818
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:19,377
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure of this surprise visit?

819
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:22,213
Well, I caught wind
that a certain competitor

820
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:25,091
is trying to
move in on our turf.

821
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:28,303
If you're referring to the
new brand of dog treats, yes.

822
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,239
We're going to make a
little bit of room on the shelf

823
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,474
in a third of our stores
and just see how it goes.

824
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,642
I'll tell you how it's gonna go.

825
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:38,104
It's not gonna go at all
because that's our shelf space.

826
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:40,023
You'll still have
the vast majority.

827
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:44,235
But I want what we have now,
every square inch.

828
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,197
Paul, be reasonable.

829
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:50,325
Michelle,
this impacts me personally.

830
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,660
I mean,
this hits my bottom line.

831
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:55,413
Pup Chuck
is my bread and butter.

832
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,584
Do you even know what's in it?

833
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:04,089
Well, I know
what's not in it - glucosamine.

834
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,715
What?

835
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:07,717
Listen, I'm a numbers guy.

836
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:10,595
It's a food for dogs,
it sells well;

837
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,847
I really
don't care what's in it.

838
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:15,225
You know this business, Paul,

839
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,686
there are new products being
introduced all the time.

840
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,772
You've got to figure out a way
to keep your customers happy

841
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,774
or they're gonna
take their money elsewhere.

842
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,485
Do I need to remind
you who owns Pup Chuck?

843
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,904
National Provisions.

844
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:29,572
Yes, one of your
largest suppliers.

845
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:31,741
I'm sure you're aware.

846
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:34,744
What are you saying, Paul?

847
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:38,456
Look, Michelle...

848
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,958
between you and me,

849
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,002
I've seen how the execs
at National Provisions

850
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:43,753
react to threats.

851
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:47,590
They're not afraid to sic their
attorneys on the little guy.

852
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:50,468
And then, next thing you know,

853
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,346
maybe there's something
in those dog treats

854
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,557
that the FDA wants
to take a closer look at.

855
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:58,518
So, they pull all
the products off the shelf,

856
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,396
until an exhaustive
investigation is concluded,

857
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:06,109
and well,
that could take weeks, months,

858
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:08,319
maybe even years.

859
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:11,990
Sounds like you're making
a threat yourself, Paul.

860
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:16,494
No, I'm just passing along
information to a friend.

861
00:42:16,536 --> 00:42:19,581
Well, it's, uh...

862
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,791
It's good to see you,

863
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,294
as always.

864
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,004
Yeah.

865
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,981
- Hey!
- Hi! Okay.

866
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,441
You sure you have time for this?

867
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,169
Oh, yeah. At this point,
it's all hands on deck.

868
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:49,903
We have orders to fill

869
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:51,488
and Matt's got
the store covered, so...

870
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,324
Great. The team is on their way.
Let's get started.

871
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,910
So, we're going to shred the
apples, shred the carrots,

872
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,870
make the dough.
Oven is all ready to go.

873
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,472
- Perfect. Let's do it.
- Perfect? Okay.

874
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,002
Michelle. Hi.

875
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,088
Alex, we need to talk.

876
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:10,340
Um, look,
if this is about last night,

877
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,842
there's more to it
that I wanted to explain.

878
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:14,969
What I wanted to say was...

879
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,597
I actually have
feelings for someone else.

880
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,140
Oh.

881
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:21,017
And I'm not totally sure

882
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,811
about how she feels about me,

883
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:26,981
but I just want to see how it
goes, so that's why I...

884
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:28,858
It's Scarlett, isn't it?

885
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,318
Yes.

886
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:34,614
Alex, this isn't about us.

887
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,033
- It isn't?
- No.

888
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:39,494
I'm here to discuss business.

889
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:43,248
I need you to remove
Pup's Palate from the shelf.

890
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:46,751
Why? I mean,
it's flying off the shelves.

891
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:50,797
Pup Chuck is the best-selling
pet food that we carry.

892
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,551
Um,
it's the only pet food we carry.

893
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:56,386
We have a relationship
between Pup Chuck

894
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,406
and National Provisions
that I can't afford to upset,

895
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,099
so I'm canceling the order.

896
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:04,602
No, you can't do that. No.

897
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:07,022
Scarlett and Gina just
leased a bunch of equipment,

898
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:08,898
and they're actually fulfilling

899
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,734
one of our orders
right now, as we speak.

900
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:15,238
You know there is a clause
that stipulates the agreement

901
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,033
can be voided within 72 hours.

902
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:20,368
Michelle, that's not fair.

903
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,789
I'm sorry, Alex, but I need you
to remove Pup's Palate today.

904
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:28,877
I'll call Scarlett and Gina
myself and let them know.

905
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:42,599
I actually asked him
to dinner to celebrate,

906
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,184
which is so unlike me.

907
00:44:44,225 --> 00:44:46,811
I'm proud of you.

908
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:49,939
Yeah, but he turned me down.

909
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,233
What?

910
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:55,236
Well, I thought things were
heating up between you two.

911
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:57,280
Yeah, so did I.

912
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:58,990
Well, then,
why did he turn you down?

913
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:02,118
He had another date...

914
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,621
with Michelle.

915
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:07,123
The regional manager
that we pitched to?

916
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:09,668
Uh-huh. Turns out they dated.

917
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:11,419
He downplayed it,

918
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:12,962
said they just had a
couple of things

919
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:16,132
to talk through, but...

920
00:45:16,174 --> 00:45:18,426
Am I naive for believing him?

921
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,679
Well, why would he tell you
that if it wasn't true?

922
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,847
Maybe he's more like
Jeremy than I thought.

923
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,642
No, I don't think so.

924
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:28,186
He's being transparent, and
that's a good thing.

925
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:30,855
Most guys would just tell
you that they're busy.

926
00:45:30,897 --> 00:45:33,608
What if he's the type of guy
that likes to date around?

927
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,860
I mean, you've seen
the way women look at him.

928
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:40,323
He just doesn't strike me
as that kind of guy.

929
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:43,993
I'm not saying let
your guard down.

930
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,995
I mean, you've been hurt before.

931
00:45:46,037 --> 00:45:47,664
Yeah. I'm gullible.

932
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:48,873
It's a fault.

933
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:51,001
No. You're trusting.

934
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:54,379
You take people at their word
until they prove otherwise,

935
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,941
and that's the way
that you want to be.

936
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:02,178
Now, I think that
Alex is an honest guy.

937
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,181
Yeah. I think so, too.

938
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:07,517
Thanks for the advice, Gina.

939
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,687
Well, what are friends for?

940
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:13,982
If I'm being honest, I think
I'm starting to really like him.

941
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:16,192
Mm. Well, there's
a lot to like.

942
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:18,153
There really is.

943
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:25,118
- It's Michelle.
- Uh, you know what?

944
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,679
She's probably calling
about the order.

945
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,748
Um, just, uh, tell her
we're ahead of schedule.

946
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,334
Hi, Michelle.

947
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,752
Good
morning, Scarlett.

948
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:35,754
We are on track to fill
the order by Friday,

949
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:37,714
maybe even a day early.

950
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:39,382
That's what
I'm calling about.

951
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,468
I have some unfortunate news.

952
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,347
Not right now, Duke.

953
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,767
We need to talk.

954
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:50,727
- Um...
- Let me look into this, boss.

955
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,246
Thanks. I'll just
talk to you in a bit.

956
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,605
Okay.

957
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:56,584
I take it you spoke to Michelle.

958
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:58,526
Yeah, I spoke with Michelle.

959
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:00,612
Yeah. She wanted
to tell you personally.

960
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:02,655
I was going to come by
right after work

961
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:03,948
and... and see you.

962
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,492
I can't believe this, Alex.

963
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:09,079
I trusted you. You
said you had my back.

964
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,539
I do have your back.
Look. I am sorry.

965
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:14,292
I tried to stop it, but it's...

966
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:15,710
it's out of my hands, Scarlett.

967
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,379
I'm on the hook for
the new equipment

968
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,756
and all the ingredients.

969
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:22,384
- I know.
- I hired three people, Alex.

970
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:24,427
I gave them my word.

971
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,447
Even if I go broke doing it,
I'm paying them for the month,

972
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,182
work or no work,
because I keep my word,

973
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,351
unlike Paws and
Wellness Emporium.

974
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:34,938
Sorry.

975
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:39,442
I have a shipment
emergency I have to deal with.

976
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:44,155
I really want to sit down with
you and talk this through.

977
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:46,157
Can... can we
speak tomorrow?

978
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,617
Sure.

979
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,452
Okay. Listen.

980
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:51,579
We're going to figure
something out, alright?

981
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:52,789
I promise.

982
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:06,302
Oh, hi, Gina.

983
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:08,680
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

984
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:11,599
She's been laying out
there a while now.

985
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:13,518
It's not at all like her.

986
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:18,481
I know what will
snap her out of it.

987
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:21,484
Puppies! Puppies!

988
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:23,278
Come here!

989
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,447
Come here, puppies!

990
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:33,997
Ah!

991
00:48:38,543 --> 00:48:41,671
- Hello.
- There's that smile.

992
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:42,964
Hi, Gina.

993
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:46,426
How are you feeling?

994
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:47,844
I've been better.

995
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,095
Mm-hmm.

996
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:54,017
Okay. It's time
to get up.

997
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:55,810
You're coming with me.

998
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:57,479
Where are we going?

999
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,230
- On a jog.
- A jog?

1000
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:01,649
Yes.

1001
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:03,693
We just need a creative spark.

1002
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:05,987
I get all of my best ideas
when I'm out running,

1003
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:09,199
and you desperately need to
get those endorphins pumping,

1004
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,950
so come on. Let's go.

1005
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,827
- Okay.
- Let's go. Yeah.

1006
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,308
Scarlett! Scarlett,
Scarlett,

1007
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,268
wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1008
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,979
Okay. I think... I
think I have an idea.

1009
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:42,190
- Okay. Let's hear it.
- Okay.

1010
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:43,608
We need to pivot.

1011
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,943
Pivot?

1012
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:46,486
Yeah. It's a
basketball term.

1013
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,613
Uh, now, it's a very
overused business buzzword,

1014
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,323
but in this case,
it might actually work.

1015
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,574
Explain.

1016
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:54,494
Okay. So, Paws
and Wellness Emporium,

1017
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:56,663
they won't put Pups Palate
in the stores, right?

1018
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,623
Yeah. That's the problem.

1019
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,000
Yeah, but they
never said anything

1020
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,460
about outside of the stores.

1021
00:50:02,502 --> 00:50:04,421
I don't follow.

1022
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:08,466
Okay. Um, what if we set up a
booth in front of the store

1023
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:10,802
and we bring in some of
your dad's puppies

1024
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:12,637
and we conduct a taste test

1025
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,724
so customers can see firsthand
what an amazing product we have?

1026
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:19,269
You know, they say the customer
is always right, right?

1027
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,871
So, think about it. If they
see a bunch of customers

1028
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:23,481
interested in our product,
they're going to feel pressured

1029
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:25,358
to put Pups Palate back
on the shelf!

1030
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,985
This is a great idea.

1031
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:29,029
- You think?
- I do.

1032
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,990
You see? I need an idea,
and I go for a run.

1033
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:33,950
Works every time.

1034
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,119
I already have a
vision for the booth.

1035
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:39,289
And I can take care of
the signage, so...

1036
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,599
- Ah! Let's do it!
- Let's do it.

1037
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,336
Hi! How's it going?
We are Pups Palate.

1038
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:45,563
Hi! Do you
have a second?

1039
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:47,589
Premium puppy
nutrition.

1040
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,175
We are really focused
on puppy nutrition.

1041
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:52,344
I am the founder of Pups
Palate. Free sample?

1042
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:54,387
online, and you
can order from us...

1043
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,764
Here's two for you.

1044
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:57,223
information.

1045
00:50:57,265 --> 00:50:59,642
One for you.
We are a local business.

1046
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,811
I don't know. Like,
I haven't tried it yet.

1047
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:04,022
- Morning, Scarlett.
- Thank you.

1048
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,774
Morning, Gina.

1049
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:07,275
Oh. Hi, Alex.

1050
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,196
So, what's this?

1051
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:13,365
Well, we're showing Paws
and Wellness Emporium

1052
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:16,034
why their decision to pull us
from the shelves was ridiculous.

1053
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:17,744
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah, I see.

1054
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,206
Um, I'm not really sure

1055
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:23,792
if this sort of thing is
allowed out here.

1056
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:27,045
Oh, really? Well,
who's going to stop us?

1057
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,548
Well, not me, um,

1058
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,342
but I was hoping

1059
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,403
maybe we can go about this in
a more conventional way.

1060
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:36,513
Oh, so you have
a conventional idea

1061
00:51:36,554 --> 00:51:38,223
that'll get us back
our shelf space?

1062
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:41,101
Um, not yet, no,

1063
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:42,769
but I am working on it.

1064
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,437
Well, we can't sit around

1065
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,523
and wait for conventional
inspiration to hit us.

1066
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:49,234
We have bills to pay
and a business to save.

1067
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,695
Fair enough.

1068
00:51:51,736 --> 00:51:55,824
Wow. I really like
what you've done here.

1069
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,534
Oh. You do?

1070
00:51:57,575 --> 00:51:59,786
Marketing and promotion
guru right here.

1071
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,247
Oh. Very clever.

1072
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:04,124
Thank you.

1073
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:06,418
Alright. Well, um, I'll
get out of your way.

1074
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:07,919
Yeah. You do that.

1075
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,797
Right.

1076
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:13,258
Oh, we're not stocking it on
the shelves right now.

1077
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:15,260
Do you guys have
this inside?

1078
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:18,263
Gather round, everyone.

1079
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:20,557
What we're going to do now
is conduct a taste test

1080
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:24,019
between Pups Palate
and the leading brand.

1081
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,395
Alright.

1082
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:27,897
Okay.

1083
00:52:27,939 --> 00:52:30,275
Remember, the
blue bowl is our competitor

1084
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:32,402
and red bowl is Pups
Palate's healthy treats.

1085
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:36,322
What was it, the
store brand again?

1086
00:52:39,534 --> 00:52:41,453
- Hi!
- Come on! Hi, guys.

1087
00:52:41,494 --> 00:52:42,930
- Here, puppies!
- Yeah. There you are.

1088
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:44,289
Hi!

1089
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,832
Come on, puppies!
Come on!

1090
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:49,002
Oh!

1091
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:50,211
Oh, we have
to get some.

1092
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:52,297
Well, there you have it.

1093
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,590
Pretty unanimous, I think.

1094
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,092
Puppies prefer Pups Palate.

1095
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:57,320
So, we have some more brochures

1096
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,096
on how to order
from our website.

1097
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:02,140
Yeah! Is it good?

1098
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,352
It's so good!

1099
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,872
Alright. Fine.

1100
00:53:26,998 --> 00:53:29,084
I'll show it to them.

1101
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,269
I asked you

1102
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:31,586
to hold my calls.

1103
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,588
I've tried, but
Paul Frasca from Pup Chuck

1104
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,007
insists he speak with you.

1105
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,592
I bet I know why.

1106
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,053
A rep of his said there is
an incident unfolding

1107
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:41,304
at the Paws on Tenth Avenue.

1108
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:42,847
You should get down there.

1109
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:45,684
Okay. Um, tell Mr. Frasca
that I am on my way

1110
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:48,311
and I will call him once I
assess the situation.

1111
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:49,993
He's on his
way there now, too.

1112
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:52,899
Wonderful. Then
I'll see him there.

1113
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,011
- And you can find...
- There they are.

1114
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:05,915
all the nutritional
information through this.

1115
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:08,373
They should, uh...
We should try this.

1116
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:09,934
I am sorry,
Scarlett and Gina,

1117
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,560
but you're not permitted
to sell your product

1118
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:13,086
outside our store.

1119
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,130
Oh, we're not selling anything.

1120
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:16,440
We're just promoting
our business.

1121
00:54:16,464 --> 00:54:17,733
- Yeah.
- Well, you're not allowed

1122
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:19,801
to promote your
business here, either.

1123
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,928
Not without a Single
Event license.

1124
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,264
And I'm assuming you
don't have one of those.

1125
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:26,891
Actually, we do.

1126
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:29,561
Even with the license,
this is private property,

1127
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:31,396
and you need permission
from corporate.

1128
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,939
And that I know you
don't have, so...

1129
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:39,446
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1130
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:42,073
- How may I help you?
- I'm here to see Mr. Dunbar.

1131
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:43,241
Do you have an appointment?

1132
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,410
I, uh... No,

1133
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:48,288
but this is very important.

1134
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:50,123
I'm the manager of his
Tenth Avenue store.

1135
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,000
Mm.

1136
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:56,129
Oh. He has a 30-minute slot
available June 7.

1137
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:59,424
That's over
three months from now.

1138
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:02,844
He's usually booked
six months out.

1139
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:06,639
Okay. Uh, could I
just please get his email?

1140
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:09,059
Here's his executive
assistant's email.

1141
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,146
Email him, and he'll forward
it along to Mr. Dunbar.

1142
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:14,731
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1143
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:26,451
Ordinance DR 27 of the Swanson
County business district

1144
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:29,287
prohibits the sales and/or
promotion of products

1145
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:30,955
on private property
without a license

1146
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:34,209
and express written consent
from the property owner.

1147
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,585
Do you guys have
this inside?

1148
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:37,295
Please, Officer.
We're just a startup,

1149
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,522
and we're running low on funds.

1150
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:40,757
- Very low.
- Any extra expense

1151
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,425
could shut us down for good.

1152
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:44,594
I'm sorry, ma'am.
The law is the law.

1153
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:46,096
Amen, Officer.

1154
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:48,473
Can't just let people do
whatever they want.

1155
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,016
Otherwise, we'd have anarchy.

1156
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:52,644
And who are you?

1157
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:56,064
Paul Frasca, director of
sales at Pup Chuck.

1158
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,899
Oh.

1159
00:55:57,941 --> 00:55:59,484
Oh...

1160
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,736
I'm sorry, Scarlett. I
admire the effort,

1161
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,988
and the taste test
was a nice touch, too.

1162
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,367
Wait. You weren't
here for that.

1163
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:10,412
Oh. Alex sent me a video.

1164
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,621
It's a good thing he did, too,

1165
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:13,123
or he'd be taking some heat

1166
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:15,166
for allowing you to
pull this little stunt.

1167
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:22,298
Alright. Shall we?

1168
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:30,015
I don't know
what to say.

1169
00:56:30,056 --> 00:56:31,182
I'm sorry.

1170
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,232
My cards are
maxed, and my bank accounts

1171
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,900
are in the red.

1172
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:44,779
Yeah. We definitely spent more
than we anticipated,

1173
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:47,073
but we did get
some online orders today.

1174
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,408
How many?

1175
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,744
Oh. Let
me see. Um...

1176
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:55,707
Um... seven boxes.

1177
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:57,917
That
won't pay the fine.

1178
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:00,545
I can't believe
Alex reported us.

1179
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:01,963
I thought I could trust him.

1180
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:06,634
Well, I'm sure we'll
get some more orders through.

1181
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:08,321
I mean, we talked to
a lot of people today,

1182
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:11,056
and maybe you could
talk to Alex.

1183
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:15,560
It's him right now.

1184
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,772
Why don't you answer it?

1185
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:19,981
Him and I are finished,

1186
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,566
and I'm not ready to
have that talk.

1187
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,152
Let's face it, Gina.

1188
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:25,695
Pups Palate's finished, too.

1189
00:57:50,553 --> 00:57:52,389
What are you doing here?

1190
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,767
Uh, well, I came to talk to you.

1191
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,061
I wish you had let me
know you were coming by.

1192
00:57:58,103 --> 00:57:59,854
Well, I tried,

1193
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:02,524
but you won't answer your
calls or respond to my texts,

1194
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:05,235
so I figured I'd
come here to talk to you.

1195
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:09,239
There is not much
left to talk about.

1196
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:13,034
Scarlett, I want to help.

1197
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,869
You don't.

1198
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,622
I knew better than to trust you
instead of relying on myself.

1199
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:18,873
- What?
- I know you're the one

1200
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:20,792
who got our booth shut down.

1201
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,169
You told Michelle.

1202
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:27,382
Uh, yeah. I sent
her the videos

1203
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:30,051
and asked her to... to send
them to the executives.

1204
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:31,761
So you could
wipe your hands clean

1205
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,322
of any involvement and keep
yourself out of trouble.

1206
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:36,057
No, no, no. That is not
what I meant to do at all.

1207
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:39,144
And when they showed up,
you were nowhere to be seen.

1208
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,479
Scarlett, look. I drove
to corporate and...

1209
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:43,106
No. I get it.

1210
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:46,693
You don't want your
work-life balanced lifestyle

1211
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:50,196
disrupted by anyone or
anything unconventional.

1212
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:53,658
What does that mean?

1213
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,493
You got your rock climbing,

1214
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:57,162
your camping, your nature time,

1215
00:58:57,203 --> 00:58:59,372
your movies, but when
it comes to work,

1216
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:02,042
you're not someone
that's reliable.

1217
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:04,044
Not someone that's
reliable?

1218
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:06,546
No, you're not,
and you have to be

1219
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:09,341
if you want to achieve
any kind of success.

1220
00:59:09,382 --> 00:59:11,885
Success by whose measure?

1221
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:14,304
You know what?

1222
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,765
Forget it. I'll
let that go.

1223
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:18,266
You're upset, and I think

1224
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:21,227
you're just trying to
start an argument here.

1225
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:23,104
Maybe I am.

1226
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:26,191
Oh. Alright, then.

1227
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:31,112
Well, maybe if you didn't
always focus on work so much

1228
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:34,407
and weren't so intense and
obsessive about it,

1229
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:35,825
you'd get better results.

1230
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:41,748
Obsessive? That's
what you think of me?

1231
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,002
No.

1232
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:49,089
Look. I'm sorry.

1233
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,300
That's not what I think
of you, obviously.

1234
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:54,594
Yeah. Obviously.

1235
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:01,434
Listen, Scarlett.

1236
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:07,732
All I'm saying is, if you
want to get some things done,

1237
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:10,860
there's just different
ways to go about it.

1238
01:00:10,902 --> 01:00:14,072
Alex, my whole life
is collapsing.

1239
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,116
If I don't come up with
a lot of money soon,

1240
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:19,494
I'm at risk of losing
everything I've worked for.

1241
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:20,829
Do you know
what that feels like?

1242
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,250
Alright, Scarlett. Just
hear me out, okay?

1243
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,085
No, I can't.

1244
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,838
I just need some space to
figure things out on my own.

1245
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,883
And one more thing.

1246
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:35,969
I don't want to speculate

1247
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:38,930
on what may have influenced
Michelle's decision,

1248
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:41,683
but if she thinks there's
anything between us,

1249
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,435
I want her to know
she's mistaken.

1250
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:50,275
I think you should go.

1251
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,183
Mm-hmm.

1252
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,145
That's a good boy.

1253
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,356
You're going to be
so clean after this.

1254
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:30,815
Oh-ho-ho.

1255
01:01:30,857 --> 01:01:32,275
You know you can trust me,

1256
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:33,443
right, Mosey?

1257
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:40,658
Dry those ears off.

1258
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,619
There we go. Mm-hmm.

1259
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:46,373
Mm. Whoa.

1260
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,252
Looking pretty
clean there, buddy.

1261
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:52,587
Drying off nicely.

1262
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:04,349
Bella, I'm not ready
to get up yet.

1263
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:09,396
In fact, I don't think I'm
getting out of bed at all today.

1264
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,363
Okay. Fine.

1265
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,574
Come on!

1266
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,297
Oh.

1267
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:49,310
Ugh. All I've got is this
old bag of Pup Chuck.

1268
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:52,897
Can you believe,
before Pups Palate,

1269
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:55,233
they used to only stock
Pup Chuck?

1270
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:05,326
And they still do.

1271
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:11,332
Go on.

1272
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,421
Go on. One
bowl won't hurt you.

1273
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:19,758
You'd rather not, huh?

1274
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:21,051
I don't blame you.

1275
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:22,552
Let's go get you some real food.

1276
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:27,724
Hey. You get that
from the recycle bin?

1277
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:34,147
Wow. You really like
those, don't you?

1278
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,694
Hmm. You want some
more, don't you?

1279
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:43,073
Well, then, where are they?

1280
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,913
Been a tough stretch, huh?

1281
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:51,581
More than you know.

1282
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:54,959
Well, maybe I could
put together a small loan.

1283
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:58,213
That's sweet, Dad, but no.

1284
01:03:58,254 --> 01:04:00,965
It's my responsibility.

1285
01:04:01,007 --> 01:04:03,385
I should have chosen a
safer career path.

1286
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:04,987
I could have been an
animal rights attorney

1287
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:07,472
or taken any job

1288
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:09,974
that was more
financially stable.

1289
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:11,643
An attorney?

1290
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:13,603
Working for someone else?

1291
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:15,563
That's not you.

1292
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:19,317
You're a free spirit,
just like your mom was,

1293
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,361
the type of person
who sees things and says,

1294
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:24,656
"There has to be
a better way."

1295
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:29,077
Trust me. You're doing exactly
what you should be doing.

1296
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,871
Your passions align
perfectly with your talents,

1297
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:34,165
and sweetheart, that's rare.

1298
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:38,420
I only have one suggestion.

1299
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:39,838
What's that?

1300
01:04:39,879 --> 01:04:41,673
Go a little easier on yourself.

1301
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:46,219
You've been pushing it
for a while now,

1302
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,556
and just remember, there's
a lot more to life than work.

1303
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:54,644
I am really proud
of all you've done,

1304
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:57,647
and your mom would be, too,

1305
01:04:57,689 --> 01:05:00,358
but at the end of the day,

1306
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,694
we just wanted you to be happy.

1307
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:04,112
I know.

1308
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,448
I love you, Dad.

1309
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:09,701
I love you, too, sweetheart.

1310
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,835
Maggie.

1311
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:22,672
Ah, they're here.

1312
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,469
It's a miracle.

1313
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:31,848
It makes me so happy.

1314
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:35,894
Oh.

1315
01:05:35,935 --> 01:05:37,228
Oh, Maggie.

1316
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,105
I'm so
proud of you, Maggie.

1317
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:41,733
Oh, good girl.

1318
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:44,903
Oh.

1319
01:05:57,332 --> 01:06:00,377
Heard through the rumor mill

1320
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:02,712
Pup Chuck is looking
to sign long-term exclusive

1321
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:04,506
with Paws and Wellness Emporium.

1322
01:06:04,547 --> 01:06:07,884
- Where'd you hear that?
- Ah, I have my sources, boss.

1323
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,762
- Okay. Duke told me.
- Duke?

1324
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:13,723
Yeah. Okay. He, was, uh,
he was up at corporate.

1325
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:16,309
Overheard Michelle talking
to the Pup Chuck guy.

1326
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:18,079
He's going to present
a contract to Lee Dunbar

1327
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:19,521
at the executive
meeting this week.

1328
01:06:20,897 --> 01:06:22,190
Okay. I can't
let that happen.

1329
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:23,358
Mm-mm.

1330
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,336
Hello.

1331
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:45,005
Good evening, Mr. Townsend.

1332
01:06:45,046 --> 01:06:47,966
My name is Alex.
I got Mosey from you.

1333
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:49,926
Oh, yeah.
You sent me

1334
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:51,803
some photos of Mosey
a few months back.

1335
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,263
Yeah, I did.

1336
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:54,848
That was kind of you.

1337
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:56,433
How's Mosey doing?

1338
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:57,600
Is everything okay?

1339
01:06:57,642 --> 01:06:59,853
Oh, yeah. He's doing great.

1340
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:01,563
Uh, but this isn't about Mosey.

1341
01:07:02,897 --> 01:07:04,149
It's about your daughter.

1342
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:06,526
Did you want to come in?

1343
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:07,944
Yeah. Thank you.

1344
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,037
Well, Scarlett told me
she'd met a real nice fella

1345
01:07:17,078 --> 01:07:18,997
who had bought one
of our puppies.

1346
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,416
- She did?
- Oh, sure.

1347
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:23,960
In fact, she's talked about
you quite a lot lately.

1348
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:25,337
She seemed to really like you.

1349
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,341
But that sure
changed in a hurry.

1350
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:33,636
Yeah.

1351
01:07:54,866 --> 01:07:57,410
Well, with her business
going so well one minute,

1352
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:59,037
then crashing the next,

1353
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:02,082
you know, poor Scarlett's
been through a lot.

1354
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:05,043
And that fine for
the booth was excessive.

1355
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:07,212
I know. I know, and
I've already submitted

1356
01:08:07,253 --> 01:08:09,923
an appeal to the county
to get it waived.

1357
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:16,096
Listen, Mr. Townsend.

1358
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:18,014
Look. I
just want you to know

1359
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:20,433
I'm here for two reasons.

1360
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:24,187
First, I think your daughter's
product is incredible.

1361
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,856
I believe in it so much,
I'm willing to go around my boss

1362
01:08:26,898 --> 01:08:29,234
and take it directly to the CEO.

1363
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:30,860
I already tried to talk with him

1364
01:08:30,902 --> 01:08:33,071
the day that Scarlett's
booth was shut down,

1365
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:36,157
but he is a hard man
to get a hold of.

1366
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,660
Well, it... it sounds
like National Provisions

1367
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:41,121
has a monopoly on shelf space

1368
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:43,373
and your bosses
protect that for them.

1369
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:44,725
- Mm-hmm.
- How are you going to change

1370
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:46,376
anyone's mind?

1371
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:47,585
I have an idea.

1372
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,715
But Scarlett won't talk to me.

1373
01:08:51,756 --> 01:08:54,509
So I'm asking you
to talk to her for me.

1374
01:08:58,346 --> 01:09:00,598
It's a possibility, I suppose.

1375
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:06,062
So... what's the
other reason you stopped by?

1376
01:09:07,772 --> 01:09:11,443
Uh... well, that's
a little more personal.

1377
01:09:13,653 --> 01:09:17,032
And... I
just want to say,

1378
01:09:17,073 --> 01:09:19,367
since you're helping me out, uh,

1379
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:21,578
my intentions are
completely sincere.

1380
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:26,499
The truth is,

1381
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:30,128
I've never met anyone
like your daughter, sir.

1382
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:34,758
She just has this...
beautiful glow to her.

1383
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,259
Her energy is infectious,

1384
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,928
and whenever I'm not with her,

1385
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,139
I just... I can't stop
thinking about her.

1386
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:44,642
I know she's not happy
with me right now.

1387
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:48,271
But I'm just hoping

1388
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:50,231
she just gives me a
chance to make it right.

1389
01:09:58,823 --> 01:10:00,116
I'm thinking about it.

1390
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:05,747
Well...

1391
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,959
I'll give you two some privacy.

1392
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:14,339
Uh...

1393
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:20,136
Scarlett, you put
a lot of faith in me,

1394
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:21,656
and I should have been
a better partner.

1395
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:29,479
No. You were right.

1396
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:33,149
I shouldn't have gotten on
you about work-life balance.

1397
01:10:33,191 --> 01:10:35,235
I could use a little
balance in my own life.

1398
01:10:36,736 --> 01:10:39,239
I'm sorry I got on you about it.

1399
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:43,118
I was really emotional and
jumping to conclusions.

1400
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:44,411
I was totally out of line.

1401
01:10:46,913 --> 01:10:50,667
Do you think, um, we could maybe
take another shot at this?

1402
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:54,379
Another shot at what?

1403
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:57,132
Scarlett, you got me.

1404
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:00,552
I'm all in on this.

1405
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:04,889
I'm all in on us.

1406
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:07,767
I'm all in on us, too.

1407
01:11:14,774 --> 01:11:17,193
What was your idea exactly?

1408
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:19,195
We're going to go crash the
executive meeting.

1409
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:24,284
- Yeah.
- No problem.

1410
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:25,928
So, come over this
way, and I'll tell you

1411
01:11:25,952 --> 01:11:27,712
about the problem.

1412
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:34,461
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1413
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:36,296
Hi, Duke.

1414
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,548
Uh, we're here to see Lee
Dunbar and the executive team.

1415
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,175
They're in a meeting.

1416
01:11:40,216 --> 01:11:42,093
Yes. That's why we're here.

1417
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,930
I don't have a message
from Mr. Dunbar

1418
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:48,141
about any additional
participants.

1419
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:50,435
Well, that's because
it's confidential.

1420
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:53,813
You see, they're thinking

1421
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,900
about replacing Duke here
as the company mascot.

1422
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:58,193
Oh.

1423
01:11:58,234 --> 01:11:59,944
Yeah. You know,

1424
01:11:59,986 --> 01:12:02,739
they're considering
a ferret named Ralph.

1425
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:04,407
A ferret?

1426
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:06,409
I know, right?

1427
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:08,471
Some of the executives aren't
keen on the idea, either.

1428
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,080
That's why they called us in,

1429
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:12,248
so if you could please
just keep it quiet.

1430
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:14,334
The press has been,
you know, sniffing around.

1431
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:16,378
We don't want this to leak out.

1432
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:17,962
As you know...

1433
01:12:18,004 --> 01:12:20,715
Duke's a really big
hit with the kids.

1434
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:22,050
Of course.

1435
01:12:22,092 --> 01:12:23,259
Secret's safe with me.

1436
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:24,761
- Oh, thank you.
- Go on in.

1437
01:12:37,148 --> 01:12:39,067
- Alex?
- Keep going.

1438
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:41,361
Alex, what are you doing?

1439
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:43,488
I need to speak
with the executive team.

1440
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:46,199
- They're in a meeting.
- In the conference room, right?

1441
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:48,243
- Yes, but...
- Perfect.

1442
01:12:48,284 --> 01:12:49,744
Alex, you can't go in there!

1443
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:52,580
Good morning.

1444
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:56,251
We're here to review the latest
proposal from Pup Chuck.

1445
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:57,711
Paul, the room's yours.

1446
01:12:57,752 --> 01:13:01,047
Well, uh, I think
everything in the proposal

1447
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:03,133
is kind of self-explanatory,

1448
01:13:03,174 --> 01:13:06,177
so if you just turn
to page three...

1449
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:08,013
- What's going on?
- Ah. Let's do this.

1450
01:13:08,054 --> 01:13:09,347
Oh, yeah.

1451
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:14,060
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

1452
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:15,729
We're in the middle of
a meeting here.

1453
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,188
How can we help you?

1454
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,607
Uh, actually,
Mr. Dunbar, sir,

1455
01:13:19,649 --> 01:13:21,443
I think we can
actually help you.

1456
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,904
Now, if I could just get
your signature...

1457
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:26,281
I'm listening.

1458
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,411
Mr. Dunbar, sir, my
name is Alex Paulsen,

1459
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,872
and I'm the general manager of
your Tenth Avenue store.

1460
01:13:33,913 --> 01:13:35,498
And I'm Scarlett Townsend,

1461
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,293
the founder of Pups
Palate Healthy Treats.

1462
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:40,086
Seriously, if we
could just put an end

1463
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:41,439
to this clown show and
get back to...

1464
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:43,882
I'd like to hear what
they have to say.

1465
01:13:43,923 --> 01:13:45,467
Thank you,
Mr. Dunbar.

1466
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:48,053
This is the nutritional
information,

1467
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:51,556
which is miles ahead of
any other brand.

1468
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:54,768
One serving promotes 100 percent

1469
01:13:54,809 --> 01:13:57,604
of the 22 most essential
vitamins and minerals

1470
01:13:57,645 --> 01:13:59,356
- a puppy needs.
- And when our store

1471
01:13:59,397 --> 01:14:01,608
sold Pups Palate,

1472
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:05,570
it outsold Pup
Chuck three to one.

1473
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,947
Well, I'd
like to see the numbers

1474
01:14:07,989 --> 01:14:09,449
to verify that.

1475
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:12,410
Then why was it pulled
from the shelves?

1476
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:13,870
Well, sir, I
think that's a question

1477
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:15,014
for someone else in this room.

1478
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:31,554
Oh, my goodness! Oh!

1479
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:37,686
Are you seeing this?

1480
01:14:37,727 --> 01:14:39,729
Oh!
Oh, they all love it!

1481
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:42,399
- They really do.
- Oh, we have to get some.

1482
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,627
- Do you believe in this?
- Is this your video?

1483
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:46,277
No. No.

1484
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:49,656
I think it was posted by
someone who was at your booth.

1485
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:53,326
They hashtag Pups Palate
and Paws and Wellness.

1486
01:14:54,327 --> 01:14:57,122
And best dog treats ever.

1487
01:14:57,163 --> 01:14:59,958
Oh, my goodness! Oh!

1488
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:04,254
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1489
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:07,841
There you are! There you are.

1490
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:09,426
Paul, have you seen this?

1491
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,930
Well, I don't trust
social media.

1492
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:15,807
And look.

1493
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:19,811
Our relationship with Paws and
Wellness Emporium is strong,

1494
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:21,604
and to re-up our
wonderful partnership,

1495
01:15:21,646 --> 01:15:23,565
I just need you
to sign this contract

1496
01:15:23,606 --> 01:15:26,276
making Pup Chuck your
exclusive provider.

1497
01:15:26,317 --> 01:15:28,695
I mean, the numbers work, Lee.

1498
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:30,739
You're not going to find
a retail profit margin

1499
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,534
as healthy as ours with
any other product, guaranteed.

1500
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:35,994
Well, you make
a good point, Paul.

1501
01:15:37,495 --> 01:15:39,122
But we got to ask ourselves,

1502
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:40,915
"What's more important,

1503
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:44,294
a healthy profit line...

1504
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:45,712
or a healthy puppy?"

1505
01:15:47,505 --> 01:15:50,842
These... they
even smell good.

1506
01:15:58,933 --> 01:15:59,851
Oh!

1507
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,025
Oh!

1508
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:09,361
Dippy, what are you doing here?

1509
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:11,154
- Oh!
- Aw!

1510
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:13,948
Did he smell these
from all the way down the hall?

1511
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:19,537
- Oh.
- The seal of approval.

1512
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:22,374
I think the customer's
clearly spoken.

1513
01:16:24,334 --> 01:16:25,627
High paw.

1514
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,176
You two think you're
pretty clever,

1515
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:34,886
barging in like that,

1516
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:36,179
but this isn't over,

1517
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:37,681
not by a long shot.

1518
01:16:37,722 --> 01:16:41,184
Nobody muscles Pup
Chuck off the shelf.

1519
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:42,394
You'll be hearing from me.

1520
01:16:42,435 --> 01:16:43,895
Here's where you can reach me.

1521
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,524
Well, we have to get
you back to work.

1522
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:49,043
You have a lot of
shelf space to fill.

1523
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:01,180
I've been working
since I was a teenager

1524
01:17:01,204 --> 01:17:02,997
to create something like this.

1525
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:04,457
It's literally
a dream come true.

1526
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:06,584
Well, you certainly deserve it.

1527
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:10,463
Best part? Dogs across the
country are healthier than ever.

1528
01:17:10,505 --> 01:17:13,008
You know what I love most
about you?

1529
01:17:13,049 --> 01:17:14,759
You're the rare businessperson

1530
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:17,929
who genuinely cares about doing
what's right above all else.

1531
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,472
Maybe it'll catch on.

1532
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:21,099
I hope so.

1533
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,563
I'm delivering.

1534
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:27,814
I got to go.

1535
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:29,691
- Alright. See you.
- Bye.

1536
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:30,900
See you, Gina.

1537
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:32,277
- Bye.
- Bye.

1538
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,175
Wow.

1539
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,554
Well, well, well.

1540
01:17:59,596 --> 01:18:02,140
Paul Frasca, director of
sales at Pup Chuck.

1541
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:03,808
Nice to see you both again.

1542
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:07,479
You might remember him as
the guy who shut our booth down.

1543
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,646
Of course.

1544
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:12,317
Days gone
by, as they say.

1545
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:15,028
Anyway, I wanted to
congratulate you both

1546
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:17,280
on your tremendous
success.

1547
01:18:17,322 --> 01:18:19,741
This is, uh... this is quite an
operation you have going.

1548
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:21,302
I'm sorry. We have a big
shipment to send out.

1549
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:22,911
May I ask why you're here?

1550
01:18:22,952 --> 01:18:24,996
Oh. I... I suppose I should
get right to the point.

1551
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:27,582
Uh...

1552
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:35,674
This is a
business purchase agreement.

1553
01:18:35,715 --> 01:18:37,175
Excuse me?

1554
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:39,844
We'd like to
acquire Pups Palate.

1555
01:18:39,886 --> 01:18:41,680
Uh, before you say anything,

1556
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:43,848
why don't you have
a look at page seven?

1557
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:46,726
You'll see at the top the amount
that we're willing to pay

1558
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:50,021
to purchase your business.

1559
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:53,149
Uh, well, that's...
that's a big number.

1560
01:18:53,191 --> 01:18:55,652
Indeed it is,
but we also think fair,

1561
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:58,571
based on the quality and
the popularity of your product.

1562
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:01,866
What's the rest of this say?

1563
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:05,370
Oh, the rest of it just consists
of, uh, legal machinations,

1564
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:08,164
uh, effectively create an
iron-clad agreement for a buyer,

1565
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:11,251
us, to acquire the
ownership from the seller...

1566
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:15,171
in this case, you... at
the agreed-upon purchase price,

1567
01:19:15,213 --> 01:19:16,506
thereby upon signatures

1568
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:18,216
and transfers of
funds to the seller,

1569
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:21,011
the buyer takes full and
complete control

1570
01:19:21,052 --> 01:19:22,679
of your business,

1571
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:24,556
including all
intellectual property,

1572
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:26,683
in perpetuity.

1573
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:28,101
I'm no legal expert,

1574
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:29,894
but does that means you
can change the name,

1575
01:19:29,936 --> 01:19:31,604
the recipe, even?

1576
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:33,541
Well, I mean, it does mean
that Pups Palate is ours

1577
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:35,483
to do with whatever we wish,

1578
01:19:35,525 --> 01:19:37,610
and if we find
ways to cut costs,

1579
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:40,321
sell more product,
boost our profit margin,

1580
01:19:40,363 --> 01:19:41,990
well, we will.

1581
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:44,951
After all, we are in
the business of making money.

1582
01:19:46,661 --> 01:19:49,956
Thank you, Mr.
Profit-Obsessed Executive.

1583
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,169
You
can just call me Paul.

1584
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,896
But I think we'll keep
our product in the hands

1585
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,631
of people who prioritize
puppies over profit.

1586
01:20:01,634 --> 01:20:04,012
But you see what we're
offering, right?

1587
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,347
You heard her.

1588
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:07,682
We're not selling.

1589
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:25,617
Oh! Oh, no.

1590
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:27,577
Bella, that was
not supposed to happen.

1591
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:38,630
Uh, what in the world is
my beautiful fiancee up to?

1592
01:20:38,672 --> 01:20:40,799
I'm working on a
temporary, all-natural,

1593
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,176
biodegradable and washable
colored dye for pet fur.

1594
01:20:43,218 --> 01:20:45,512
Ah. Why?

1595
01:20:45,553 --> 01:20:47,305
Why not?

1596
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:49,516
You know
what? You do you.

1597
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:51,810
Thank you.

1598
01:20:51,851 --> 01:20:53,687
Are you, uh, ready to go?

1599
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:56,314
It looks like you could use
some time in nature.

1600
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:58,400
I think I'm going to need
a couple of minutes.

1601
01:20:58,441 --> 01:20:59,818
What do you think, Bella?

1602
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:02,278
She agrees.

1603
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,383
Come on, Bella.

1604
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,325
- Here.
- There you go.

1605
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:08,618
Let's go.

1606
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,412
- There you go.
- Up, up, up!

1607
01:21:10,453 --> 01:21:12,831
Good job,
guys. Okay.

1608
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:23,466
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1609
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:25,969
I know. We still have
to carry it, so...

1610
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:28,805
But look at this and this.

1611
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:30,181
We're going to be
back on Monday.

1612
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:31,558
If you need to reach me, just...

1613
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:34,102
Don't worry.
We got it covered.

1614
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:35,603
You two enjoy yourselves.

1615
01:21:35,645 --> 01:21:37,313
Have a good weekend. Thanks.

1616
01:21:37,355 --> 01:21:38,857
See you on Monday, Duke.

1617
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,318
High paw. Oh, yeah.

1618
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,205
Hello, guys.

1619
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:56,249
Hey.

1620
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:57,584
- Darling.
- Thank you.

1621
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:01,588
Oh.

1622
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:03,923
Ah, nice.

1623
01:22:05,342 --> 01:22:06,301
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
