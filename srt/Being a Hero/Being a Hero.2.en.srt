[Episode 2]

2
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,300
You've got nothing else to do, have you?

3
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,300
Chief Lin,

4
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,140
there's another thing that I didn't report to you.

5
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,460
Go on.

6
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,100
At the crime scene of Hu Qingshan's homicide,

7
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,500
some jade debris was found.

8
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,580
Wu Gang was in the jade business.

9
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,260
He once purchased a pair of

10
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,700
jade pendants with a pretty long history.

11
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,700
When I was young,

12
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,820
he gave one to Wu Zhenfeng

13
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,180
and the other, to me.

14
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,620
The two pieces put together

15
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,620
make a whole one.

16
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,420
But they can also be worn separately.

17
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,540
The debris here,

18
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,980
I have had it authenticated.

19
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,620
The material of it

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,940
is the same as which of mine.

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,580
Therefore, I believe

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,180
this is left in the scene

23
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,140
from Wu Zhenfeng.

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,060
I think he's back.

25
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,020
So in tomorrow morning's meeting,

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,620
I will suggest that we

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,020
combine this case

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,060
with the Wu Gang case
that happened three years ago.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,140
Classify and file the evidence later.

30
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,700
Chief Lin.

31
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,860
I've got the result of the comparative test.

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,740
Inside the capsule is mainly flour

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,900
mixed with some glucose.

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,500
The urine test comes out negative.

35
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,300
No signs of drugs.

36
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,100
Okay.

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,500
Give it to Captain Liu.

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,060
Alright.

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,260
Release him if nothing suspicious is found.

40
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,900
[Pharmacy]

41
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,140
(What would you like to have?)

42
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,180
(Xian, the police closed my shop.)

43
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,980
The police arrived

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,940
soon after Feng robbed me.

45
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,100
I suspect that he reported me.

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,300
My place is not safe anymore.

47
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,820
Listen,

48
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,860
go to the old storehouse tonight

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,620
and silence that man

50
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,980
named Feng.

51
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,340
Xian.

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,300
I don't kill.

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,020
I didn't ask you to do that.

54
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,140
He killed Hu Qingshan.

55
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,860
Plant something there

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,620
and report him to the police.

57
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,740
He killed Hu?

58
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,020
Bring out all the stuff

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,620
that you have.

60
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,820
Keep none.

61
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,900
Remember, keep none.

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,860
Xian.

63
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,860
Hello.

64
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,540
It's me.

65
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,340
Please hold.

66
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,300
Go on.

67
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,500
I found the person

68
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,380
who killed Hu Qingshan.

69
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,020
His nickname is Feng.

70
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,540
I don't know his real name.

71
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,100
How did you find out about it?

72
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,620
I asked around.

73
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,100
And the authenticity?

74
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,380
I can't say for sure.

75
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,540
He contacted me.

76
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,540
I'm meeting him tonight.

77
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,100
OK.

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,500
Take a good look at his face when you meet.

79
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,820
Remember.

80
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,940
And

81
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
who made the rhubarb capsules?

82
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,260
Have you got anything?

83
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,500
Still working on it.

84
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,460
Make it quick

85
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,420
Have you brought the stuff with you?

86
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,980
Yes.

87
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,060
Do it fast later.

88
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,780
Knock him out as soon as he arrives.

89
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,060
Spread the drugs around him
and report it to the police.

90
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,740
Boss.

91
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,580
Why do we need so much stuff
if we're just making a report?

92
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,380
Cut the crap.

93
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,140
Bring the stuff to Xian

94
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,340
after you finish the job here.

95
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,380
The police have had their eyes on me.

96
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,060
You guys stay a low profile in the coming few days.

97
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,300
[Chen Yu]

98
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,220
Chen Yu.

99
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,380
Where are you?

100
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,660
Where are you now?

101
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,820
I'm in a deserted chemical factory

102
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,780
in the suburb.

103
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,820
Now Ba

104
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,700
has met with the people inside.

105
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,940
I'm not sure if they're armed.

106
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,220
They're probably going to

107
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,660
have a drug deal soon.

108
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,420
Ask for backup now.

109
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,180
Do you hear me?

110
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,900
OK.

111
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Send your location

112
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,780
to my phone.

113
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:20,780
I'll call for backup now.

114
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,500
Only report this

115
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,980
to Captain Liu

116
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,740
and no one else.

117
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,660
Someone must have leaked

118
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,340
the operation of Ba Peng.

119
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,020
OK. Got it.

120
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,660
Chop-chop.

121
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,900
Bro,

122
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,180
you slimy fox.

123
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,740
You reported me.

124
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,860
That's too bad.

125
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,100
I didn't expect you to be so well connected

126
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,780
and can get out this soon.

127
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,260
Why did you do that?

128
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,220
If I didn't, you'd only see me
as a petty peddler

129
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,340
who could only sell

130
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,180
some drugs from time to time.

131
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,620
Captain Liu, it's Chen Yu.

132
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,420
Chen Yu, it's me.

133
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,740
Captain Liu.

134
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,020
They're having the deal already.

135
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,180
But it's too dark in there

136
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,060
and I can't see their faces.

137
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,580
Don't act alone.

138
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,380
Wait for the backup.

139
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,420
We'll be there in no time.

140
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,140
Got it.

141
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,140
Let's talk about the case.

142
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,820
Do you think the case of new-type drugs

143
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,020
has something to do with K?

144
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,740
What do you mean?

145
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,540
Well, I reckon

146
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,260
they are somehow connected.

147
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,900
I'd like to know about your insights.

148
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,340
I'll report to you as much as we know then.

149
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,780
This case of new-type drugs

150
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,500
is just a start.

151
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,860
All these years, I have my deployment

152
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,900
in Yunhe.

153
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,700
I've been working on it.

154
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,500
I want to eradicate

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,540
all the drug cartels

156
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,980
here in Yunhe

157
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,380
by investigating

158
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,620
the new-type-drug case,

159
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,180
including K.

160
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,940
Can you walk me through

161
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,140
your deployment?

162
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,540
I can't.

163
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,700
Vice Captain Chen,

164
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,740
sorry.

165
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,100
According to the principle of confidentiality,

166
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,380
that's all I can tell you.

167
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,180
Can you tell me

168
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,740
when will your deployment come to the last step?

169
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,140
I hope to close

170
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,260
the new-type-drug case

171
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
and the K Group case

172
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
at the same time.

173
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,340
One month.

174
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,060
Can you do that?

175
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,460
Vice Captain Chen,

176
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,380
to be honest with you,

177
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,740
I'll be retiring

178
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
in a few months.

179
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,100
When I retire from my position,

180
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,180
I hope Yunhe County

181
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,100
can get rid of drugs.

182
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,100
But you know as clearly,

183
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,780
Yunhe's location is special geographically.

184
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,300
Its demographic structure is complicated.

185
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,820
That's why

186
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,620
I can't rush it

187
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,180
but to do it step by step.

188
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,900
I can only eliminate

189
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,220
all the drug cartels in Yunhe

190
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,580
in one go

191
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,820
when I manage to find out

192
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,780
about the whole structure of them.

193
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,780
I have no idea

194
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,300
if this is just your excuse

195
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,140
or your true plan.

196
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,020
All I see is

197
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,900
that Yunhe is deeply infiltrated by drugs

198
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,740
with you being the chief for three years.

199
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,380
I understand

200
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,100
there are restrictions
and difficulties of all sorts

201
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
but none of them

202
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,180
should become the excuse for being incapable.

203
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,220
What do you say?

204
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,660
I agree.

205
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,420
Oh, right.

206
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Just now, you said

207
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,540
you're retiring in a few months.

208
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,780
What do you want?

209
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,700
I want drugs.

210
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,340
Many drugs.

211
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,100
Did you have to kill Hu Qingshan

212
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,940
and reported my shop to the cops

213
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,060
to get that?

214
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,980
I didn't kill him.

215
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,380
Drop your act.

216
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,860
Huang Daxian told me everything.

217
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,820
You killed Hu Qingshan.

218
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,620
Huang Daxian is the one who did that.

219
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,820
You're setting me up.

220
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,460
I'll just tell you.

221
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,940
This is a trap made for you.

222
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,860
Go.

223
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,260
Go.

224
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,300
Police.

225
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,460
Freeze!

226
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,180
Stop right there!

227
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,300
Police.

228
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,460
Police.

229
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,220
Freeze!

230
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,580
Police!

231
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,340
Stop!

232
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,380
Come on, it's the police.

233
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,140
Burn the drugs. Burn them all.

234
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,860
Hurry.

235
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,900
Get in the car.

236
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,460
Stop!

237
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,100
Freeze!

238
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,740
Police.

239
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,460
Freeze!

240
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
Stop right there!

241
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,340
Freeze!

242
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,140
Stop!

243
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,460
Put out the fire!

244
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,300
Captain Liu.

245
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,340
A mobile phone was found in the car.

246
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,500
It's heavily damaged on the outside.

247
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,660
I don't know

248
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,540
if the data can be resumed.

249
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,860
Give it to Bowen when we get back.

250
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,540
Let him try.

251
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,860
Chief Lin.

252
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,100
Chief Lin.

253
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,980
Such a big operation.

254
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,900
Why didn't you report it?

255
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,180
Why?

256
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,500
It happened too fast.

257
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,300
When we arrived,

258
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,260
the deal had begun.

259
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,180
There was no time for detailed planning.

260
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,620
It was my mistake.
I'll write a self-reflection report.

261
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
Self-reflection report?

262
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,260
What's the use of writing it?

263
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,460
Man died. Clues gone!

264
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,380
One month.

265
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,020
You all know that!

266
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,740
One month!

267
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Sorry, Chief Lin.

268
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,420
We sent someone to your office

269
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,940
but you weren't there.

270
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,980
We called you but no one answered.

271
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,740
Write me a report.

272
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
In detail!

273
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,380
Report.

274
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,100
Who is that?

275
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,580
Come in.

276
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,660
Chief Lin.

277
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,460
Anything?

278
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,740
Report.

279
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,860
I apply again

280
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,060
to combine the Hu Qingshan case,

281
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,500
the drug dealing case in the chemical factory,

282
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,540
and the Wu Gang case that happened

283
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,380
three years ago.

284
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,220
Chief Lin.

285
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,700
I just went to the Department
of Forensic Service.

286
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,580
Look.

287
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,300
This is the jade debris found

288
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,260
at the crime scene

289
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,380
of Hu Qingshan's homicide.

290
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:10,860
And this

291
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,380
is the jade pendant found
in the drug dealing case

292
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,100
in the chemical factory.

293
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,620
This proves

294
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,020
they belong to the same person.

295
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,500
This one is mine.

296
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,860
And this is Wu Zhenfeng's.

297
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,820
So I conclude

298
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,140
that he's back.

299
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,460
For this reason, I apply

300
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,180
to combine these cases

301
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,740
and put out an APB of him in the county.

302
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,340
I believe

303
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,340
this is where we can make a breakthrough.

304
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,300
Have you reported to Captain Liu?

305
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,180
The case is too big.

306
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,700
I want to directly report to you.

307
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,940
Archive the evidence

308
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,900
and get out.

309
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,460
What do you mean?

310
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,180
Do you accept my suggestion?

311
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,900
No.

312
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,100
Can you differentiate evidence

313
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
from a hypothesis?

314
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Order an arrest?

315
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,660
What a fuss will it be?

316
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
How many cops does it take?

317
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,220
Have you thought about that?

318
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,260
Can you afford it?

319
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,300
I have them authenticated.

320
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,540
They're of the same material.

321
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,340
It belongs to Wu Zhenfeng.

322
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,940
Who did the authentication?

323
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,460
Are they qualified to do
forensic authentication?

324
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,460
Does it conform to
the forensic authentication standards?

325
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,380
But we can't just

326
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,100
ignore the clue, can we?

327
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,460
We found Wu Zhenfeng's jade pendent

328
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,660
and its pieces on both scenes.

329
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,700
Those are the evidence.

330
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,940
Listen, young man.

331
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,900
It's been three years,

332
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,700
over 1000 days.

333
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Does Wu Zhenfeng

334
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,660
still have it?

335
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,780
Could he have lost it?

336
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,260
Could it have been robbed, stolen

337
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,420
or pawned by its owner?

338
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
How many people once had it?

339
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,380
Have you thought about it?

340
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,580
How could you prove that

341
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,100
Wu Zhenfeng was there

342
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,620
by a mere object on the scenes?

343
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,180
Chief Lin,

344
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,620
I believe it was Wu Zhenfeng!

345
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,460
It must have been him

346
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,300
who ran away from the scene.

347
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,980
We need solid proof.

348
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,220
What you see is not necessarily the truth.

349
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,620
You have the ability

350

is not about a single piece of physical evidence

not tell you that in college?

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,580
for a small dealer

525
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,820
to get hold of so many drugs?

526
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,700
Impossible.

527
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,340
There must be something

528
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,660
he held back

529
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,820
from me.

530
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,420
That is to say,

531
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,500
we failed to find the drugs

532
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,380
in the pharmacy this afternoon

533
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,380
because you informed him.

534
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,980
I told you

535
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,900
just now.

536
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,260
I meant to ask him to find

537
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,140
the source of the rhubarb capsules.

538
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,580
Who else can testify for you?

539
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,220
You're suspecting me?

540
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,780
He...

541
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,860
Kaihua.

542
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,940
You've been in the profession for many years.

543
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,180
You should know all about
the confidentiality provision.

544
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,140
Chief Lin,

545
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,900
the guy is dead

546
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,620
and loads of drugs were found on the scene.

547
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,620
How do you explain?

548
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,500
Vice Captain Chen is still in Yunhe.

549
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,580
How would you explain to him?

550
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,900
Will he believe you?

551
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,900
Will you?

552
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,380
What's wrong with you?

553
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,740
Those are shrimp dumplings.

554
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,100
Your favorite.

555
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,780
What's with that long face?

556
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,860
Haven't you always wanted

557
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,820
to return to the Counter Narcotics Unit?

558
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,780
It is transfer, to be precise.

559
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,620
I tell you,

560
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,460
The Counter Narcotics Unit

561
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,740
is not like a police station.

562
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,020
Quite dangerous.

563
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,980
You are not like my brother.

564
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,260
My major is drug prohibition.

565
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,340
Then what are you

566
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,300
unhappy about?

567
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,620
I was criticized once by Chief Lin today.

568
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,620
No.

569
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,180
Twice.

570
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,180
Uncle Lin?

571
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,500
Do you know why he threw me

572
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,620
to the police station back then?

573
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,660
And I worked as a regional policeman for 3 years.

574
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,540
I don't know.

575
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,180
All I know is that three years ago

576
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,580
when I was going to rent out the room upstairs,

577
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,420
my brother introduced you to me

578
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,660
as his colleague.

579
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
Then I rented the room to you.

580
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,740
That's when I just reported to Yunhe,

581
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,260
because of a firefight

582
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,180
by overseas drug dealers.

583
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,860
Someone was killed.

584
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,460
The drug dealer who died

585
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,740
just happened to be my childhood neighbor.

586
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,740
His son came to the funeral.

587
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,380
Because we knew each other

588
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
when we were kids,

589
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,620
I was asked to accompany him

590
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,340
while

591
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,700
trying to find some clues.

592

(My dad can't be a drug dealer!)

593
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,140
(He can't do drug business!)

594
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,260

597
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,700
remain suspicious of him.

598
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,180

Do you?

606
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,500
Is your piece still there?

Look at it!

609

Your family has been separated from him

for fifteen years.

616
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,820
Fifteen years is long enough.

617
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,620
Fifteen years is also long enough

618
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,220
to change a person totally.

619
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,460
No one can guarantee this.

Yes.

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,900

632
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,500

is his father-killer.

648
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,700
He disrupted our deployment,

649

so we failed the capture.
