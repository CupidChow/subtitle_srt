Follow me.

Our boss wants to see you.

6
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,540
Stop, what are you doing here?

7
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,990
Isn't this place for betting?

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,740
No, please leave now.

9
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,500
Where do I place my bet then?

10
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,740
This is my girlfriend.

11
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,540
We're going in together.

12
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
Shu wants to talk to him.

13

Let them in.

I've been looking for you.

Now you're here yourself.

18

It's been three years.

You still remember my name.

20

You're from K Group, right?

21
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,460
Don't you know who I am?

22
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,180
I came here today

23

to wreck this place

24

I know this guy.

Three years ago,

28
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,870
he was the one who hunted me and Wu Zhenfeng

overseas.

30
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,230
What did you say?

31
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,430
Shu, right?

32
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,710
Your name

really fits your appearance.

Do you all see it?

47
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,740
Wu Zhenfeng isn't there for boxing

48
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,540
or trading.

49

I'm fine.

72

So this is what you meant by walking around.

73

I helped you get what you want.

74

Wu Zhenfeng, I'm telling you.

75

We had the situation under control.

76

Without you,

77
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,260
we will still take the place down.

78
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,830
I'm willing to cooperate
with your investigation.

79
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,070
Take him.

80
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,350
Come on.

81
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,390
He's arrested now.

82

You tell me.

If something got slipped out,

84
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,020
what to do?

85
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,070
Have I taught you

86

how to lead your people?

87
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,110
Have I?

please calm down, all right?

Shu has never met you.

91
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,630
He won't tell a thing.

92
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,110
Does he know about the incident three years ago?

93
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,830
If the police ever find out

94

how Wu Gang died,

95
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,830
who can escape?

96
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,260
Tell me. Who can escape?

He won't betray me.

100
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,180
Three years ago, he betrayed Wu Gang.

101
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,830
This time, he can betray you too.

102
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,140
This is one million.

103
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,260
Hurry up, take your mom

104
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,110
to replace her kidney.

105
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,110
I can't take

106
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,110
the money.

107
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,740
You are not getting this for free.

108
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,460
Wu Gang is your boss, right?

109
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,510
Help me finish a job.

110
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,670
He is dutiful.

111
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,790
Dong,

112
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,910
he cares about his mom.

113
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,180
I'll take his mom here.

114
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,230
Okay?

115
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,230
Dong, you can trust me.

116

He has followed me for many years.

117

Three years ago, we went back to Yunhe

and founded this factory.

121
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,460
You gave me this knife.

122
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,910
I have always kept it by my side.

123

I treat you like a real brother.

Do you remember that guy?

139

That guy with a scar on his face.

140

You knew we have our eyes on you.

141

You did it intentionally,

Please interrogate him properly.

Investigate him.

151
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,950
There must be something wrong with him.

Don't worry.

You said that the guy

who hunted you and Wu Zhenfeng three years ago

161
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,300
is the one

162
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,270
with a scar on his face?

163
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,860
Yes.

164
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,150
The scar on his face

165
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,100
was left by Wu Zhenfeng.

166

You are saying

that Wu Zhenfeng is here for revenge?

168

I don't think so.

when he saw this guy,

171

174
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,910
[Wan Heda, the boss of Wanlutong Logistics]

175
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,710
What brings you here?

176
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,790
Something's up.

177
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,030
Something's up.

178
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,060
Mr. Wan.

179
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,060
Come in, please.

180
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,390
Director Lin.

181
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,150
Did you guys just take down

182
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,420
an underground boxing ring tonight?

183
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,910
My daughter, Wan Mengmeng,

184
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,150
has been arrested

185
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,980
by the Counter Narcotics Detachment.

186
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,150
Why would your daughter

187
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,590
be at such a place?

188
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,470
Director Lin,

189
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,620
this daughter of mine is quite pampered

190
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,420
and capricious.

191
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,860
But I dare to guarantee

192
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,060
with my net worth and life

193
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,590
that she would never

194
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,180
do anything illegal.

195
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,950
She went there out of curiosity.

196
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Since she didn't violate any rules,

197
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,300
she would only be asked some questions

198
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,180
for documentation purposes.

199
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,390
Don't worry.

200
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,860
She will be released very soon.

201
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,790
Let me show you something.

202
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,300
Since Mengmeng was a kid,

203
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,100
she's got intermittent epilepsy.

204
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,790
It's extremely easy for her to get a seizure.

205
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,390
And she can't take irritation.

206
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,230
If anything ever happens

207
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,540
to her well-being,

208
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,230
publicly and privately,

209
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,950
it won't be good for both of us.

210
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,860
Director Lin.

211
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,030
If it's really difficult for you,

212
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:21,910
it's fine.

213
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,180
How about this,

214
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,390
Deputy County Mayor Zhang

215
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,030
has been watching my daughter grow up.

216
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,350
He could prove this.

217
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,270
If you don't believe me,

218
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,350
I'll give him a call now.

219
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,300
He could help me prove this.

220
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,790
Hold on.

221
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,590
Mr. Wan,

222
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,980
allow me to make a call first.

223
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,950
Thank you.

224
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,740
Is Liu Kaihua around?

225
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:50,830
Director Lin,

226
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,230
Chief Liu is in the interrogation room now.

227
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,910
During the mission tonight,

228
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,860
is there a person arrested

229
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,950
named Wan Mengmeng?

230
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,150
Yes.

231
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,350
We finished her interrogation.

232
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,420
She denied being related to drugs and gambling,

233
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,910
claiming that she has nothing to do

234
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,910
with the boxing ring.

235
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,470
Since nothing was found,

236
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,910
follow the procedure and release her.

237
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,390
You can proceed with the release now.

238
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,710
I'm coming over.

239
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,390
Yes, sir.

240
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,300
Director Lin.

241
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:22,740
Please.

242
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,060
Thank you so much.

243
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,420
Madam.

244
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,100
Who are you looking for?

245
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,660
Jiang.

246
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,060
Jiashu is in trouble.

247
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,420
He ordered us to pick you up.

248
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,030
He's in trouble?

249
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,230
Jiang,

250
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,830
tell me the truth.

251
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,470
What had actually happened?

252
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,910
We weren't there.

253
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,710
We'll head over first.

254
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,390
I'm so worried.

255
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:42,860
Let's get in the car.

256
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,470
Let's get in the car.

257
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,660
Madam, let's get in the car.

258
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,060
You...

259
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:54,980
Firstly,

260
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,270
he wasn't planning to trade with them.

261
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,270
And prior to that, he didn't know

262
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,390
the guy who hunted him was in there.

263
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,420
Hence, he wasn't there for revenge.

264
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,150
So why on earth did he

265
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,390
do all these?

266
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,790
Do you know why he grabbed my bag

267
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,100
after we went inside?

268
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,150
Why?

269
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,470
It's for obtaining evidence.

270
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,420
So I think

271
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,590
no matter what the purpose

272
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,660
of Wu Zhenfeng is,

273
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,620
he can be a valuable asset.

274
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,500
Name?

275
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,300
He Jiashu.

276
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,350
Tell us then.

277
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,060
Tell you what, officer?

278
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,950
Telling us voluntarily
and being forced to answer us

279
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,860
would be treated differently.

280
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,660
The place is owned by Du Hai.

281
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm irrelevant.

282
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,620
I'm only a groundskeeper.

283
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,620
I have no idea about anything else.

284
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,710
Stop fooling around.

285
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,350
Du Hai has confessed

286
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,860
that the place is yours.

287
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,540
He is your puppet

288
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,270
who works for you.

289
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,790
Officer,

290
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,790
you guys must investigate properly.

291
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,350
It can't be just words

292
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,790
from someone's mouth.

293
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,230
If his words alone aren't sufficient,

294
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,790
those people who got in here tonight

295
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,910
already confessed

296
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,180
that you're Du Hai's boss.

297
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,150
They are all Du Hai's lackeys.

298
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,420
Of course, they would say so.

299
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,230
I am the puppet

300
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,790
who's pushed to the front.

301
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,230
All right.

302
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,620
Let's not talk about who owns the place.

303
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,710
Let's talk about Wu Zhenfeng.

304
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,030
Do you know him?

305
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,350
No.

306
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,910
He's the one who put a scar on your face.

307
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,230
And you don't know him?

308
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,300
Tonight, he was there for you.

309
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,270
Don't you have anything

310
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,270
to tell us?

311
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,300
You won't tell, right?

312
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,660
Think about it.

313
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,470
The evidence that we obtained

314
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,300
is enough to detain you for quite a while.

315
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,030
We have time.

316
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
(You went to the rehab center)

317
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,500
(just to get in touch with Li Shougui.)

318
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,620
Through Li Shougui,

319
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,860
you found the boxing ring.

320
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,060
Then you led us there.

321
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,500
Tell us.

322
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,060
What's your intention?

323
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,390
That scar-faced guy

324
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,390
just now.

325
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,950
Do you remember?

326
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,390
He's called Shu.

327
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,030
Shu.

328
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,740
Three years ago, he almost killed us.

329
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,390
He must be related to my dad's death.

330
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,270
He must be.

331
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,350
Investigate him.

332
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,590
Accordingly to the clues provided from the site,

333
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,420
you simply didn't know He Jiashu.

334
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,710
You didn't know that he owns

335
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,350
the boxing ring either.

336
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,910
Tell me your intention.

337
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
You came from Mengka.

338
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,790
To connect with K

339
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,180
is your intention,

340
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,420
right?

341
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,470
To connect with K?

342
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,980
If I wanted to connect with him,

343
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,790

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,910
Give me back my phone!

516
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,630
Are you insane?

517
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,510
Give me back my phone!

518
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,990
Do you want the whole world

519
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,340
to know that you do drugs?

520
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,550
What about it?

521
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,820
Wan Heda, aren't you also...

522
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,700
Kaihua,

523
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,150
when you were arresting people,

524
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,870
Wan Heda

525
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,550
entered my office.

526
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,060
Who could deliver such news so quickly?

527
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,270
Who have we actually offended?

528
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,870
You've said it just now.

529
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,340
That place

530
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,510
is K's trading spot in Yunhe.

531
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,510
Think about it.

532
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,700
You think

533
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,030
that Wan Heda is related to K?

534
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,180
Right now,

535
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,630
I dare not say.

536
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,460
But when dealing with someone like Wan Heda

537
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,670
who has powerful connections,

538
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,790
we must be cautious,

539
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,940
and evidence is a must.

540
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,700
If we were to take action,

541
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,700
we must own evidence

542
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,510
that he could never deny.

543
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,060
Sir.

544
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,060
Come in.

545
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,270
Director Lin.

546
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,340
Chief Liu,

547
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,940
I didn't get to ask.

548
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,460
How was it with He Jiashu?

549
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,550
Did he confess?

550
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,420
We won't get much info on the first night.

551
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,340
It will take some time.

552
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,340
How's the situation with Wu Zhenfeng?

553
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,550
What did he confess?

554
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,420
Nothing.

555
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,100
Chief Liu,

556
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,910
could you assign me

557
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,700
to interrogate He Jiashu?

558
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,990
I know what you're thinking.

559
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,550
Although He Jiashu

560
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,990
did try to hunt you and Wu Zhenfeng,

561
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,420
our priority now

562
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,180
is to capture K through the boxing ring.

563
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,460
Rather than seeking

564
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,750
the reasons he tried to hunt you.

565
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,870
Everyone has worked hard today.

566
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,750
Rest earlier.

567
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,060
We'll continue tomorrow.

568
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,510
Yes, sir.

569
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,510
During the mission last night

570
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,300
with the security brigade,

571
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,220
we captured

572
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,870
96 gamblers

573
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,300
and 14 drug addicts.

574
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,420
We seized 200 plus pieces of Yaba

575
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,150
and a small number of Yellow Capsules on site.

576
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,030
The underground boxing ring
not only involved gambling

577
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,870
but also drugs.

578
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,750
It should be K's distribution spot as well.

579
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,420
Also, according to confessions made

580
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,700
by the accomplices that we captured last night,

581
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,750
the true owner of the place

582
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,420
is this guy named He Jiashu.

583
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,030
Any breakthrough?

584
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,580
Report, Chief Liu.

585
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,060
Wan Mengmeng, who was released yesterday,

586
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,030
was caught gambling many times.

587
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,670
And she could get in
and out of the boxing ring at her will.

588
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,870
She's definitely a regular

589
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,790
who's close with the place owner.

590
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,550
I apply to investigate Wan Mengmeng.

591
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,580
I've said this before.

592
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,270
When it comes to people
with powerful connections,

593
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,460
we must not accuse them

594
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,670
without solid evidence.

595
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,510
It will alert them.

596
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,300
If we have to,

597
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,340
we must investigate them quietly.

598
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,390
Yes, sir.

599
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,580
The key would still be He Jiashu.

600
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,580
Think about

601
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,550
how to get him to talk.

602
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,550
Yesterday, I contacted a friend

603
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,460
from Economic Crime Investigation Bureau

604
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,180
to retrieve all accounting information

605
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,390
of He Jiashu.

606
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,100
We discovered that most of his expenses

607
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,100
were payments made to Yunhe Nursing Home.

608
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,790
Moreover, he paid for

609
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,460
his mom's kidney transplant

610
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,580
three years ago.

611
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,220
Judging by his account,

612
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,100
he doesn't have

613
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,910
any bad habits.

614
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,390
He keeps it low-key.

615
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,340
All the money was spent

616
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,300
on his mom alone.

617
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,820
I think this is a breakthrough.

618
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,030
Meanwhile,

619
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,220
I retrieved his resume

620
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,060
and checked his social background.

621
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,260
[Father: He Chengpeng; Mother: Sun Hairong]

622
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,270
[Work experience: Wu's Jade Shop,
Period of employment: 2014 - 2016]

623
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,750
Wu's Jade Shop?

624
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,990
This is the jade shop owned

625
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,700
by Wu Zhenfeng's dad.

626
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,270
He worked there

627
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,150
throughout the period

628
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,940
between 2014

629
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,750
and 2016.

630
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,870
This proves that my speculation

631
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,550
was right.

632
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,630
What did Wu Zhenfeng say

633
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,550
during the interrogation last night?

634
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,270
He only mentioned

635
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,220
that he found out K is related

636
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,060
to his dad's death.

637
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,510
He's back to take revenge on K.

638
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,630
So this

639
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,750
is the reason he was there.

640
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,180
According to the evidence,

641
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,390
Wu Zhenfeng didn't know

642
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,550
that He Jiashu owns the place.

643
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,820
Have you thought

644
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,630
that he might have other intentions?

645
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,870
Yes, I have.

646
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,750
So, I apply for an investigation.

647
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,580
Wu's Jade Shop was out of business.

648
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,300
The shop operator, Liu Jun,

649
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,940
already settled back in Yunhe.

650
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,030
I think we can find the truth

651
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,700
from here.

652
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,180
And find out Wu Zhenfeng's intention.

653
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,700
Chen Yu.

654
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,910
We are short of hands at the moment.

655
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,940
After taking down such a big business from K,

656
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,460
the workload of the investigations

657
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,700
for this case is already hefty enough.

658
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,150
Now you're telling me

659
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,820
to investigate the Wu Gang Case
from three years ago?

660
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,060
Do you think I would agree?

661
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:58,990
Chief Liu,

662
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,750
I only need half a day, all right?

663
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,180
The breakthrough point mentioned

664
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
by Bowen is crystal clear.

665
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,180
You can investigate

666
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,340
He Jiashu's social background first.

667
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,340
As detailed as possible.

668
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,550
Report.

669
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,060
Chief Liu.

670
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,580
I could lend Chen Yu

671
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,510
some help

672
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,790
in checking He Jiashu's

673
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,460
social background.

674
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,030
Report, Chief Liu.

675
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,550
Me too.

676
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,750
Only half a day.

677
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,390
Doesn't matter if you find

678
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,180
any useful information.

679
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,700
Only half a day.

680
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,030
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

681
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,100
Mr. Liu.

682
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,820
Hello.

683
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,030
I am Chen Yu,

684
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,180

what you have found.

I'll remind you now.

694
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
This is overseas.

695
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,940
You don't have the right to arrest me.

696
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,670
Don't you feel guilty at all?

don't you feel guilty then?

700
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,670
Wu Zhenfeng

00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,580
I can't help you.

703
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,300
I'm not here to ask

704

about Wu Zhenfeng.

705
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,580
I'm here to learn about He Jiashu.

706
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:00,990
He was working

707
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,990
for Wu's Jade Shop.

708
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,270
Do you remember?

709
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,750
Three years ago,

710
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,460
he was hunting Wu Zhenfeng.

711
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,700
Right after I went after Wu Zhenfeng

712

from the jade shop.

713
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,030
We all call him Shu.

714
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,180
He's not a good guy.

715
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,870
He's a gambling addict

716
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,030
who's debt-strapped.

717

Go on, get back to work.

Go on.

How much do we have in the account?

756

Stop right there.

757
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,100
Go to the casino

758
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,820
and ask how much he owes.

759
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,790
Settle it.

760
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,630
The usury loan will compound.

Go check how much we have in the account.

Getting his mom treated is the priority.

765

We have to help him with the urgent problem.

that day was too strange.

773
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,340
So,

774
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,550
I kept the shipment list all along.

His mom was sick and urgently needed money.

779

After Wu Gang's accident,

780
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,750
He Jiashu immediately received

781
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,220
a huge fund from an unknown source.

782

Meanwhile,

783

Wu Gang's car

784

was assembled by him.

785

Right after the convoy departed,

786
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,030
he immediately resigned.

all these can't be a coincidence.

793
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,940
The key is

794
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,790
that the drugs left

795
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,630
at Wu Gang's death scene

796
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,990
weren't taken away.

797
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,390
So the way I see it,

798
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,270
this is obviously not a dog-eat-dog case.

799
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,750
Shu was bribed.

800
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,990
He's closely related

to Wu Gang's death.

that Wu Gang's murderer

I reckon K Group

815
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,910
is the remnant

816
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,140
of Li Linfan's drug trafficking organization.

817
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,310
We only need to investigate properly

the relation
between Li Linfan and Wu Gang's cases.

Then the truth will surface.

I'll summarize for you.

821
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,460
What you meant was,

822
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,460
Wu Gang was framed and blamed.

823
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,590
Am I right?

824
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,460
You're not solely

825
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,740
investigating Wu Gang Case, right?

826
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,620
Sir.

827
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,460
I'd to take charge of Wu Zhenfeng's case

828
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,550
and make him cooperate with us.

829
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,710
All right.

830
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,460
However, making a drug addict

831
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,430
to work with us

832
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,140
isn't that simple.

833
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Your analysis

834
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
was too rash.

835
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,070
Even if

836
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,980
Wu Zhenfeng's motive was validated,

837
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,910
you still missed out on one point,

838
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,860
that is what Wu Zhenfeng had done

839
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,790
over the past three years overseas.

840
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,590
The fact that he's a drug addict

841
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,220
can't be excused by vengeance,

842
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,140
right?

843
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,550
Director Lin.

844
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,100
Even if he does drugs,

845
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,310
he's surely doing it

846
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,550
for the sake of finding clues for his revenge.

847
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,460
We can actually

848
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,310
take advantage of this

849
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,830
to obtain information
from the drug trafficking group.

850
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,190
Getting an informant

851
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,190
should be done with the utmost caution.

852
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,740
Let me remind you.

853
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,740
Wu Zhenfeng is staying with you,

854
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,260
isn't he?

855
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,380
About the boxing ring,

856
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,100
did he ever mention

857
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,860
it to you?

858
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:56,980
No, right?

859
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,190
He doesn't trust us.

860
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,430
So,

861
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,830
he's a double-edged sword.

862
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,420
Sometimes, he's probably

863
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,460
using you because of your identity.

864
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,150
I still think that he was using you

865
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,030
to take down the boxing ring

866
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,260
this time.

867
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,980
Go back and think about it.

868
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,460
Report your investigation

869
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,030
to Kaihua.

870
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,630
Kun.

871
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,550
Your dad has never welcomed me

872
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,350
here, hasn't he?

873
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,630
Come in.

874
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,260
Dad.

875
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,220
Mr. Wan.

876
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,940
About the boxing ring,

877
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,180
what did

878
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,660
Hao Dong know of?

879
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,310
I've picked up

880
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,830
Shu's mom.

881
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,590
He won't tell a thing.

882
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,260
I was asking you

883
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,740
what did Hao Dong know

884
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,630
about the incident at the boxing ring?

885
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,740
Last night, the boxing ring was taken down.

886
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,550
The police obviously planned for it.

887
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,900
Dong is checking on it.

888
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,420
Before the incident yesterday,

889
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,150
Hai

890
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,350
gave me a call,

891
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,030
saying that Mengmeng

892
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,590
brought in a stranger.

893
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,550
She's a cop.

894
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,390
All the people there

895
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,220
witnessed it.

896
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,550
Even if I wanted,

897
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,630
I couldn't hide it.

898
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,150
Kun.

899
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,830
Listen to me, I can explain.

900
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,830
I really didn't know.

901
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,390
She lied to me.

902
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,590
I didn't know she was a cop.

903
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,500
You need to trust me.

904
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,180
I really didn't know.

905
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,220
Shut up!

906
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,500
Kun.

907
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,220
If Hao Dong knew about this,

908
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,500
he would kill Mengmeng.

909
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,260
Kun.

910
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,070
You and Mengmeng

911
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,830
have been together for more than two years, right?

912
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,180
To be honest,

913
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,390
I disapprove of your relationship

914
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,830
and I don't like it.

915
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,150
Today, I let you in here.

916
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,630
I have only one question for you.

917
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,310
Is Mengmeng

918
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,660
your girlfriend?

919
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,150
You recognize it now.

920
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,420
There's another person on site,

921
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,870
Wu Zhenfeng.

922
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,390
We both will tell them the same story.

923
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,980
It's Wu Zhenfeng who brought the cop

924
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,110
into the boxing ring.

925
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,700
Put the blame on him.

926
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,790
Then Mengmeng

927
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,790
might be able to get away from it.

928
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,790
Someone picked her up?

929
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:33,940
Chief Liu,

930
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,260
it should be someone close to her.

931
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,630
We checked the CCTV.

932
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,740
The people

933
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,630
who picked up He Jiashu's mom

934
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,260
were all wearing a cap,

935
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,870
so we couldn't identify them.

936
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,660
However, we questioned the care worker

937
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,350
on duty that night.

938
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,700
She described the suspects' appearances.

939
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,070
We've submitted it to the technical department

940
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,790
for the portrait.

941
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,900
How was she picked up?

942
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,500
By car?

943
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,660
Any information about the car?

944
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,630
It was a cloned car.

945
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,310
The car was last seen

946
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,350
near the border.

947
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,150
It disappeared from the CCTV.

948
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,740
So, He Jiashu

949
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,740
simply won't talk.

950
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,420
He must have expected her mom

951
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,460
to be taken away.

952
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:08,630
Yes.

953
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,390
This has proven that He Jiashu

954
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,550
is really important to them.

955
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,700
They're afraid that He Jiashu

956
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,900
might give us some clues.

957
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,390
Now it seems like we found

958
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,070
the right direction.

959
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,310
As long as we get to find

960
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,220
He Jiashu's mom,

961
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,590
we'll be able to make him confess.

962
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,590
By the way, Chief Liu.

963
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,630
There is another important matter.

964
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,940
He Jiashu's mom

965
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,110
had undergone a kidney transplant.

966
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,350
She has been taking

967
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,260
anti-rejection medication.

968
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
But it was so rushy

969
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,790
that they left the medication behind.

970
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,900
If this drags on,

971
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,460
it might be life-threatening to her.

972
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,030
Yang Yi,

973
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,590
both you and Qiang,

974
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,260
be sure to find He Jiashu's mom

975
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,220
as soon as possible.

976
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,350
Check the immigration record first.

977
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,870
Confirm if she's still within the border.

978
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,310
Then check the location

979
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,740
where the car was last seen.

980
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,310
It is of utmost urgency.

981
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,790
Ensure the safety of the elder.

982
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,790
Yes, sir.

983
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,940
Why are you guys keeping me up

984
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,460
the whole night?

985
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,500
I've confessed everything I could.

986
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,260
Du Hai is my boss.

987
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,830
You guys should ask him.

988
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:18,980
He Jiashu,

989
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,390
you are very filial.

990
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,070
Officer.

991
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,790
In the middle of the night,

992
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,630
you're going to talk about my mom?

993
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,180
What have you done to my mom?

994
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,030
What can we possibly do to your mom?

995
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,310
You're quite loyal.

996
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,150
You refused to spill anything.

997
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,220
However, your brothers out there

998
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,420
aren't so kind.

999
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,420
They kidnapped your mom.

1000
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,030
Right now, Dong must be thinking about

1001
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,150
how he could kill us all.

1002
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,310
Dong is ruthless in Yunhe.

1003
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,460
