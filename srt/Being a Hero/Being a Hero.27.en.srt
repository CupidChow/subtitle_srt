of whether we should capture them now or not.

If there's anything,

00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,290
I should protect you.

I'm a police officer.

598

Don't forget

599
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,140
that they see me as a drug dealer.

600
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,900
I can gain access easier.

601

the drugs.

607
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,260
I'll be fine.

608
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,010

609
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,570
that if you

run into any unexpected situation,

611
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,050
you'll need a helper.

We didn't return together three years ago.

613

00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,220
I'll return after doing one round.

617
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,220
This is Offloading Area 5A.

618
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,090
I'll go to Area 6.

619
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,140
It'll be close to you.

620
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,460
Wait for me.

621
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,180
Don't go anywhere.

622
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,220
Don't finish them all.

623
