00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,740
[Episode 1]

2
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,740
Stop.

3
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,980
Stop right now.

4
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,980
Stop running.

5
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,260
Hello.

6
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,340
What's your name?

7
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,980
Yang Shengguang.

8
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,500
Is this your restaurant?

9
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,940
When was the last time

10
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,860
you saw Hu Qingshan?

11
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,820
La... Last night,

12
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,300
around nine thirty.

13
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,060
I... From my restaurant...

14
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,100
I... I was going to a party.

15
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,060
I... I saw him

16
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,940
holding a half-full

17
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,540
alcohol bottle in his hand.

18
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,420
There were wounds on his face.

19
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,380
He... He must've been involved in a fight.

20
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,220
I really didn't know.

21
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,860
I only come here

22
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,660
to check the accounts regularly.

23
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,860
But he... I don't...

24
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,580
Yang Shengguang.

25
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,980
Come here.

26
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,780
Lift your feet.

27
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,580
Let me check your soles.

28
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,220
The left one.

29
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,620
Cut a potato for me.

30
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,660
Do it.

31
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,300
Use your left hand.

32
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,340
I am not a left-handed person.

33
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Were you a cook before?

34
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,420
This restaurant is mine.

35
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,260
I used to be the cook here.

36
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,620
And my wife was the waitress.

37
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,260
To make some more money,

38
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,860
I opened several branches.

39
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,980
Otherwise, I wouldn't have rented this to him.

40
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,820
Look at him now.

41
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,140
He is dead.

42
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,860
And he was doing drugs.

43
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,220
Chief Wang.

44
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
What are you doing here?

45
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,340
Did you ask about the case?

46
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,780
We're in the middle of it.

47
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,500
About the case?

48
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,740
Is this related to the case?

49
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,060
Do more business.

50
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,700
Captain Liu.

51
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,660
Captain Liu.

52
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,420
Chief Wang.

53
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,220
-You're here already.
-Chief Wang.

54
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,700
Captain Liu.

55
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,380
Where are the drugs?

56
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,180
Here.

57
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,860
Captain Liu.

58
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,260
Methamphetamine.

59
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,180
I don't know about the yellow ones.

60
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,180
It needs to be tested.

61
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,940
Where did you find them?

62
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,140
In there.

63
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,180
In a jar of starch.

64
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,140
Yang Yi. Take them.

65
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,060
Yes, sir.

66
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,740
Leng Feng.

67
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,540
Captain Liu.

68
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,860
For now, we know

69
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,500
the murder weapon should be

70
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,540
something sharp like a knife.

71
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,700
Judging from the defensive wounds

72
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,820
on his upper limbs,

73
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,300
he was in a violent struggle.

74
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,700
Besides, I've also found out,

75
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,020
post the death of the victim,

76
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,260
the killer stabbed him a few more times.

77
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,060
The body has no signs of injections.

78
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,140
Thus, whether or not

79
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,420
he used drugs remains unclear

80
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,340
till further examinations.

81
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,820
Captain Liu,

82
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,900
I believe,

83
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,740
the exact place where the victim was

84
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,340
stabbed for the first time

85
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,260
should be here.

86
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,580
Judging by the bloodstains on the ground,

87
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,220
he should be stabbed from the front.

88
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,940
(After he was injured,)

89
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,660
(he climbed over this table,)

90
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,540
(and planed to run towards the door.)

91
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,260
(But the killer pulled him back.)

92
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,860
(Right by the door,)

93
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,860
(the killer stabbed him a few more times.)

94
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,300
After he died,

95
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,780
the killer stabbed him from his back

96
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,940
several times more.

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,940
There are no other possible

98
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,860
murder weapons at the scene,

99
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,740
except the boning knife

100
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,900
of that set of knives.

101
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,340
That one.

102
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,380
I think most likely, the killer

103
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,700
committed this crime in the heat of passion.

104
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,580
He had a conflict

105
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,460
with the victim,

106
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,380
and then killed him.

107
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,860
Is there any other evidence?

108
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,060
I picked up

109
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
some hair at the scene.

110
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,740
Go get it tested.

111
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,500
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,060
Have you got any fingerprints at the scene?

113
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,180
I did.

114
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,020
On the knife handle.

115
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,780
It's rather clear.

116
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Did you talk to the shop owner?

117
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,340
I did.

118
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,940
He can be ruled out as a suspect.

119
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,780
Why?

120
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,860
Captain Liu, look.

121
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,020
In these footprints,

122
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,100
the right one is clearer and more intact,

123
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,100
which proves that his left foot is stronger.

124
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,420
The killer is very likely

125
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,500
a left-handed person.

126
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,100
Besides, I also

127
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,100
checked his soles.

128
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,620
They don't match with the shoe prints

129
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,300
at the scene.

130
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,220
Also, he is not

131
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,340
a left-handed person.

132
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,140
On his body,

133
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,500
there're no signs of fights either.

134
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,420
Why are you so talkative?

135
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,900
Can he be ruled out as a suspect?

136
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,700
We can do some more digging.

137
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,060
We can start

138
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,100
by checking if he really went to that party.

139
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,180
If he really was at the party,

140
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,420
then he had no time to commit the crime.

141
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,500
Thus, he can be ruled out.

142
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,060
Captain Liu, sir,

143
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,780
we found something.

144
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,660
Modafinil.

145
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,820
Ampakines and methylphenidate.

146
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,140
These are all addictive drugs.

147
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,100
They are all new

148
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,060
synthetic drugs.

149
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,340
Yang Yi.

150
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,380
Find out where they come from.

151
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,140
Yes, sir.

152
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,660
Look at this vent.

153
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,100
The storage room is right next to the kitchen.

154
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,700
The kitchen vent

155
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,700
and the storage vent

156
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,500
were connected by him,

157
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,020
The smell of oil and smoke thus

158
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,820
covered the smell of

159
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,540
him making the drugs.

160
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,060
This guy was clever.

161
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,380
Are you done with being smart?

162
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,100
Go to the door

163
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,700
and check the Driving Recorders.

164
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,540
Yes, sir.

165
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,420
Captain Liu,

166
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,700
I'll get going then.

167
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,900
Chen Yu,

168
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,500
do you want to come back to
the Counter Narcotics Unit?

169
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,300
I...

170
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,180
Captain Liu...

171
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,260
What are you waiting for?

172
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,260
Get going.

173
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,300
Yes.

174
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,300
Captain Liu.

175
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,260
Yang Yi,

176
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,580
who is he?

177
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,540
My senior in

178
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,260
Police College.

179
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,740
He was always the best of his department.

180
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,820
He keeps the record till this day.

181
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,900
So impressive.

182
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,180
Why did he leave the Counter Narcotics Unit then?

183
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,540
You need to ask Chief Lin about it.

184
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,900
He majored in drug control.

185
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,780
You can't waste a talent

186
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,100
like that for three years,

187
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,460
can you?

188
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,260
If you want him,

189
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,980
you can hand in a report to Chief Lin.

190
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,660
I'm in no hurry anyway.

191
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,580
It never hurts to have a talent

192
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
like that by my side.

193
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,580
I'm certain

194
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,620
these are from the same jade.

195
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,660
They have completely the same texture.

196
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,700
(Stop.)

197
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,260
(Stop right now.)

198
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,980
(Your jade pendant has)

199
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,700
(another half, right?)

200
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,140
Sir?

201
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,140
Sir?

202
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,420
Are you sure?

203
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,260
I've been looking at jades

204
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
my whole life.

205
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,220
Thank you.

206
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,420
Sir.

207
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,180
Come in.

208
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,780
Sir.

209
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,180
Deshan West District Police Station,

210
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,780
Policeman Chen Yu reports for duty.

211
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,500
How long have you been working?

212
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,100
Sir. Three years.

213
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Police experience.

214
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
I was, in year 17 and 18,

215
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,580
given the title, Advanced Individual.

216
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,660
Last year, I got a Merit Citation Class III.

217
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,500
Have you only worked in

218
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,300
Deshan West District Police Station?

219
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,340
There were no other

220
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,420
departments?

221
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,340
Sir.

222
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,300
I once worked in Yunhe Public Security Bureau,
Counter Narcotics Unit

223
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,340
for twenty-seven days.

224
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,340
After that, I was transferred

225
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,620
to Deshan West District Police Station.

226
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,940
Then tell me,

227
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,140
how does it feel to come back to
Counter Narcotics Unit?

228
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,820
As the People's Police,

229
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,540
I serve the people wherever I am.

230
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,580
I resolutely obey

231
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,900
the organization's work arrangements.

232
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,180
You are an elite of Kundu Police College

233
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,260
who majored in drug control.

234
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,260
Why were you kicked out of

235
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,460
the Counter Narcotics Unit three years ago?

236
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,420
Sir.

237
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,620
In my first mission upon joining

238
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,700
the Counter Narcotics Unit,

239
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,380
because of my carelessness,

240
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,820
the details of the case and the arrest were

241
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,300
known to an unrelated person,

242
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,140
which caused irreparable losses.

243
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,420
An unrelated person?

244
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,220
Yes.

245
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,180
Retell the situation at that time.

246
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,540
Sir,

247
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,620
I've stated everything in my report back then.

248
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,740
I'm ordering you to retell it.

249
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,540
Captain Gong, what is it?

250
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,180
(There's an urgent task this afternoon)

251
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,020
(at Wuyi square.)

252
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,140
(Get back to the Bureau now.)

253
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,060
An urgent task?

254
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,180
Who are we arresting?

255
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,460
(Du Dajun.)

256
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,980
Du Dajun?

257
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,420
Is it the suspect of Wu Gang Case?

258
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,340
(Just hurry.)

259
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,660
Roger that.

260
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,580
I'll be on my way.

261
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,900
Du Dajun?

262
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,420
Is it the person who killed my father?

263
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Wu Zhenfeng, I'm warning you.

264
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,300
It's our job to arrest the suspect.

265
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,260
It's none of your business.

266
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,180
You just

267
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,900
stay here.

268
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,700
And wait for my news.

269
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,660
Why did you lock me up?

270
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,980
Let me out.

271
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,860
(Because of my carelessness,)

272
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,860
Let me out.

273
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,540
(he overheard the details of the call.)

274
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,580
Chief Lin.

275
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,500
I...

276
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,780
It was my fault.

277
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,620
Retell the police casualties at the scene.

278
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,220
(We had people controlling)

279
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,900
(every corner of the Wuyi square.)

280
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,980
(When we move,)

281
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,340
(do not harm the citizens.)

282
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,100
(Make it quick.)

283
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,380
Roger.

284
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,820
Copy.

285
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,500
Copy.

286
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,380
(The suspect is here.)

287
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,820
(The suspect is in the trap.)

288
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,460
(We move after both parties)

289
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,180
(arrive.)

290
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,020
(I want to catch them with the goods.)

291
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,380
(To our surprise, Wu Zhenfeng)

292
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,380
(showed up on the scene.)

293
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,780
(Why is Wu Zhenfeng here?)

294
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,260
Chief Lin,

295
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,500
should we stop him?

296
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,060
Chief Lin, they're fighting.

297
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Arrest them, now.

298
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,260
Police.

299
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,340
Stop.

300
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,580
Don't move.

301
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,900
Don't come any closer.

302
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,100
Stop right there.

303
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,700
Captain Gong. Captain Gong.

304
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,140
(Because of my mistake,)

305
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,740
(the thorough arrest plan was)

306
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,860
(thrown into disarray.)

307
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,620
(The scene was disturbed.)

308
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,700
(Captain Gong ended up being disabled for life,)

309
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,540
(and had to quit the field work.)

310
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,940
Because of me.

311
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,540
Me.

312
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,180
Do you know why I forced you

313
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,180
to say all that?

314
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,140
It's been three years.

315
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,060
This thing has become a demon in your heart.

316
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,060
But today,

317
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,660
you have to face it.

318
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,660
The Law of the People's Republic of China
on the People's Armed Police Force.

319
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,460
Article four.

320
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,380
Say it.

321
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,420
The people's police

322
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,740
must take the Constitution and the law

323
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,780
as the guidelines for their activities,

324
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,420
be loyal to their duties, be honest and clean,

325
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,700
be strict in discipline,

326
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,220
obey orders, and strictly enforce the law.

327
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,100
Article twenty-two, clause two.

328
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,700
The people's police

329
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,100
shall not commit the following act.

330
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
To disclose state secrets

331
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,540
or secrets of police work.

332
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,260
Can you do it?

333
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,700
I can.

334
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,260

a chef of Weixiang Restaurant.

The autopsy report is on the first page.

390
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,140
There's a point

391
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,740
that the Trace Team

392
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
only found a fingerprint

393
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,340
on the hilt of the blade

394
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,300
at the scene.

395
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,060
The scene is rather complicated,

396
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,620
yet only one fingerprint is found.

397
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,060
It's obvious

398
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,300
that someone rearranged

399
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,700
the murder scene.

400
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,820
The motivation of the murderer is unclear.

401
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,300
But based on our preliminary analysis,

402
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,820
it's related to drug trafficking.

403
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,100
It is verified

404
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,020
to be

405
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,140
a novel kind of narcotic

406
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,100
that we had never known.

407
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,540
It's made of chemical substances purely.

408
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,220
The technical apartment is ratiocinating

409
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,660
its major components accordingly.

410
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,740
It's on the third page.

411
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,060
These are the items

412
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,940
we found at the deceased's tenement.

413
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,700
Some subtle amounts of it were also found.

414
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,860
The appalling part of the narcotic

415
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,140
is that it is

416
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,260
addictive to a grave extent.

417
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,780
Once getting addicted to it,
one can hardly get rid of it.

418
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,500
Also, the packaging adds to its crypticity.

419
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,580
Those can be disguised

420
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,580
to be normal capsules.

421
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,620
It makes our criminal investigation

422
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,060
even harder.

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
My report is all above.

424
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,900
Where does the novel narcotic come from?

425
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,660
What are its distribution channels?

426
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,860
Is it on a large scale yet?

Please look at the pattern.

439
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,060
The tattoo on the corpse

440
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,780
is the same as the one

441
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,780
we found three years ago

442
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,380
when we were catching Dusan.

443
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,140
So I hazard a guess

444
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,460
that the deceased, Hu Qingshan and Dusan

445
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,100
are under the same drug trafficking organization.

446
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,860
Or they might have

447
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
a special connection.

Let him say it.

451

Dusan is the suspected murderer

452
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,340
of the Wu Gang Case three years ago.

453
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,460
When we were capturing Dusan,

454
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,580
Wu Gang's son,

455
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,820
Wu Zhenfeng popped up

456
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,020
and caused a failure of the capture.

457
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
All clues were thus interrupted.

458
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,620
And this case was left unsettled.

459
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,580

460
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,940

00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,420
of our province and the country.

523
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,020
Now the novel narcotic is discovered.

524
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,940
The Party committee of the provincial department
paid great attention to it,

525
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,580
and ordered Yunhe Public Security Bureau

526
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,580
to set up a special investigation team,

527
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,180
so as to solve the case of the novel narcotic.

528
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,580
You must eliminate the narcotic

529
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,500
before its network
of manufacture and trafficking

530
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,820
develop into a large scale.

531
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,900
The time limit is one month.

532
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,220
Are you all clear on it?

533
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
You must settle the case within a month.

534
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,660
I will stay at Yunhe for a week.

535
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,220
You must show me the progress within a week.

536
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,300
I'll wait for your report.

537
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,380
Roger that.

538
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,300
Where's the drug?

539
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,940
The drug!

540
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,140
Thank you for this.

541
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,620
Remember me.

542
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,540
I'm Feng.

543
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,340
Once I arrived here,

544
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,580
I heard the locals say

545
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,660
that out of 100 people

546
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,780
there,

547
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,580
seven are junkers,

548
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,140
two are drug dealers

549
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,500
and one is police officer.

550
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,500
Is it?

551
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,860
It's absurd, isn't it?

552
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,020
Chief Chen, Divisional Captain Wang.

553
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,180
G-Goodbye.

554
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,260
Have you heard about it?

555
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,540
I...

556
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,420
But when you think of it,

557
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,660
it's rather shocking.

558
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,300
These years, there are more

559
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,340
major cases you settled,

560
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,980
and more narcotics you seized.

561
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,820
However, the population of drugsters

562
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,900
continues to rise.

563
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,220
As you mentioned,

564
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,020
the police force in Yunhe is rather limited.

565
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,940
Let me ask you.

566
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,140
What about the police force

567
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,540
in other counties near the border?

568
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,740
This cannot serve as an excuse.

569
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,020
No, it can't.

570
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,380
I think so.

571
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,260
You may go back.

572
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,340
Hello, this is Counter Narcotics Unit
of Yunhe County.

573
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,620
Here, I'll allocate the tasks.

574
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,260
Captain Liu.

575
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,380
It's transferred from 110.

576
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,780
Hello, I'm Liu Kaihua.

577
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,380
Anonymity?

578
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,820
Chief Lin.

579
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,660
Chief Lin.

580
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,260
Chief Lin.

581
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,460
Kaihua.

582
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,660
What's up?

583
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,020
Someone reported

584
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,540
that there are narcotics
hiding in Yunhui Pharmacy.

585
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:35,980
Chief Lin.

586
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,660
Yunhui?

587
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,380
Go then.

588
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,620
Chen Yu.

589
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,620
What are you doing? Let's go.

590
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,220
Coming.

591
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,700
This time, it'll be difficult

592
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,940
for you to tell it to Huang Daxian.

593
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,500
Mind your own business.

594
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,020
Who's Feng exactly?

595
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,300
I said that I have never met him.

596
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,620
Your pharmacy is targeted now.

597
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,820
He robbed you just now,

598
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,100
and he might rob you again.

599
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,340
Why don't you just put the rest of stock

600
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,060
at my place?

601
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,980
First, it's safe.

602
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,020
What's more, I can sell them for you.

603
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:36,980
This way, I can make up

604
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,980
for the money I owe you.

605
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,860
[L]

606
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:53,700
Hello.

607
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,180
Are you at the pharmacy?

608
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Someone reported you to the police.

609
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,820
The police will be there soon.

610
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,460
What's wrong?

611
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,540
I-I'm reported.

612
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,180
It must be that brat just now.

613
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,020
Peng.

614
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Just leave them to me.

615
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,500
It's safe indeed.

616
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,860
You have to return the money.

617
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,780
Don't worry.

618
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,220
I'll go then.

619
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,820
Hello.

620
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,020
We are from the Counter Narcotics Unit

621
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,100
of Yunhe Public Security Bureau.

622
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,100
We'll investigate your place according to the law.

623
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,340
Please cooperate.

624
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,580
Officer.

625
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,940
What's going on?

626
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,140
Are there narcotics?

627
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,740
There must be a misunderstanding.

628
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,460
I run this place lawfully.

629
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,580
How would it be involved in narcotics?

630
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,140
Captain Liu.

631
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,860
Where's its packaging?

632
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,940
It was like this when purchased.

633
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,380
It was like this when purchased?

634
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,940
It's the normal medicine for the cold.

635
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
I can explain.

636
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,420
OK, explain to us at our unit.

637
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:40,900
Take him.

638
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,220
It's a misunderstanding, officer.

639
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,140
Anran.

640
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,500
Take it back for an assay.

641
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:44,820
Roger that.

642
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,980
Qiang, we'll leave first.

643
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,940
Continue investigating.

644
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,060
So you are finally

645
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,860
calling me.

646
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,940
Something is wrong, Xian.

647
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,380
Ba's pharmacy got reported to the police.

648
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,420
What did you say?

649
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,820
The drug is robbed.

650
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,940
Ba was captured by police.

651
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,460
Who did that?

652
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,620
Someone called Feng.

653
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,260
He said he knew you.

654
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,700
I think it's okay if Ba is captured.

655
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,420
You still have me.

656
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,980
You can give me the rest of the stock

657
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,380
and I can

658
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,660
return the money I owe you.

659
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,020
I will earn you a great fortune.

660
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,900
You broke the rule.

661
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,740
I'll give you three days.

662
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,100
Within three days,

663
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,380
if you can't return the money,

664
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,180
you know what you'll face.

665
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,900
You won't give it to me? Fine.

666
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,020
Who do you think you are?

667
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,340
Your name?

668
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:49,660
Ba Peng.

669
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,140
Ba is for the bus.

670
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,980
Peng is for the roc.

671
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,140
My friends call me Ba.

672
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,300
Your age?

673
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:54,940
Thirty-three.

674
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,780
Your occupation?

675
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,380
I run a little pharmacy.

676
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,500
The one you investigated,

677
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,420
Yunhui Pharmacy.

678
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,020
You were in jail for three years
because of taking and dealing narcotics

679
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,580
and were released in January last year.

680
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,100
Do you have anything to tell us?

681
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,300
I've turned over a new leaf.

682
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,780
I'm now a proper merchant.

683
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,660
Then tell us about the item

684
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,820
we found in your place.

685
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,180
The capsules are just

686
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,060
Paracetamol Caffein Atificial Cow-bezoar
and chlorphenamine Maleate capsules.

687
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,140
They are used to treat normal colds

688
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,420
and those symptoms caused by flu,

689
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,580
namely fever, headache, rhinobyon...

690
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,500
Don't recite those to me.

691
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,380
Where is the packaging?

692
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,900
I threw it away.

693
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,460
It is not the same

694
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
as you mentioned at the pharmacy.

695
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,420
Then I must get it wrong.

696
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,020
It was like this when purchased.

697
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,540
No medicine can be sold

698
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,620
to a pharmacy without packaging.

699
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,700
Unless it's not medicine.

700
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,580
Say it! What's it?

701
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,020
Officers.

702
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,940
I'll say it.

703
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,380
Those were bought from other counties.

704
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,340
I admit it is fake medicine.

705
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,300
The true ones cost four yuan each pack.

706
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,420
I can only earn less than one yuan with that.

707
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,740
But the fakes can earn me over one yuan each.

708
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,340
So I bought three packs of them.

709
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,540
Do you know him?

710
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,860
What do you mean?

711
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,060
Nothing.

712
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,220
I'm just asking.

713
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,980
What about the empty one?

714
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
Where's its content?

715
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,860
I took them.

716
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
You took them?

717
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,140
Aren't you afraid of the poison?

718
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,340
I caught a cold some time ago,

719
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,780
so I tried them myself.

720
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,220
I thought I could purchase more of them
if it was effective.

721
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,060
But it turned out

722
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,940
it was useless.

723
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,100
So I threw them away without finishing them.

724
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,500
Let's drop the fact
whether it's medicine for a cold inside.

725
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,260
I'm telling you.

726
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,740
It's illegal to sell fake medicine.

727
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,860
You will be sentenced.

728
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,700
Do you know that?

729
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,860
I didn't sell them. I didn't.

730
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,620
I gave them all to you.

731
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,300
If there's no problem, just let him go.

732
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,940
What would you like to have?

733
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,020
Go to the old warehouse

734
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,340
and fake a scene.

735
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,100
Report to the police

736
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,060
that Hu Qingshan was killed by him.

737
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,700
By him?
