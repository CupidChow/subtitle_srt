for the next few days.

354
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,020
Too many things have happened lately.

355
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,500
I need a break.

356
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,470
Have...

357
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,990
Have you thought about

358
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,020
finding another place to stay?

359
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,020
I've been thinking

360
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,900
about what Wu Zhenfeng said

361
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,110
these past two days.

362
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,540
He said my dad was lucky.

363
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,380
That he was able to make it back alive.

364
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,260
That there was someone

365
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,180
who could prove his innocence.

366
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,180
He didn't want

367
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,710
to live as the son of a drug dealer

368
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,540
forever.

369
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,070
So he came back.

370
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,500
Do you remember?

371
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,950
I believe you.

372
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,590
You wouldn't suspect anyone

373
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,110
without reason.

374
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,660
But I can't change

375
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,140
who my father is.

376
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,950
Chen Yu.

377
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,350
I'm asking you this seriously.

378
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,590
Are you right

379
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,420
about him?

380
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,260
You know

381
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,140
I've been waiting for a clear answer

382
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,870
from you.

383
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,990
You know

384
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,830
I would never lie to you.

385
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,180
Yang Ling.

386
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,710
The only thing I can hold on to now

387
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,950
is to do

388
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,020
what I think is right.

389
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,710
I must find the evidence

390
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,230
and uncover the truth.

391
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,070
You want that too,

392
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,300
don't you?

393
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,260
He's here.

394
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,350
Hao Dong,

395
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,420
my men

396
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,500
have been asking for
the Yellow Capsules every day.

397
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,660
Zhuo,

398
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,990
I explained to you, didn't I?

399
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,300
But you didn't refund my money either.

400
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
It's not the best time

401
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,990
to do this.

402
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,830
I don't care about that.

403
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,230
You either give me the goods

404
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,630
or the money.

405
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,350
I must have one of them.

406
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,230
Zhuo.

407
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,470
Goods it is!

408
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,420
And I want them fast.

409
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,470
I want to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

410
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,470
Listen up.

411
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,590
Your feud with Mengka

412
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,590
has given me a lot of trouble.

413
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,350
I've already lost two shipments.

414
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,350
I don't want to lose another shipment.

415
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,710
Otherwise,

416
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,710
you and I both won't like

417
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,870
the consequences.

418
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,990
You're good, Ms. Qiong.

419
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,420
You had it all planned.

420
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,900
I told you

421
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,500
I'm not doing this anymore.

422
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,260
As if

423
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,750
you get to decide that.

424
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,230
Once you get into this business,

425
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,230
you're no different

426
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,630
from those who can't live without drugs.

427
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,350
You can't get out of it.

428
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,590
Even if you want to quit,

429
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,830
do you think your brethren in Yunhe would let you?

430
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,020
You heard

431
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,070
the buyers.

432
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,350
Even if you promise

433
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,140
to quit today.

434
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,540
Can you guarantee
that you won't pick it up again tomorrow?

435
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,380
Let's talk.

436
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,870
About how we're going

437
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,110
to deliver our shipments now.

438
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,900
I want to see Mr. Yu.

439
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,470
I won't go back to Yunhe

440
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,590
or talk business

441
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,630
until I see him

442
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,300
That's my condition.

443
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:12,670
[China]

444
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,750
Dong.

445
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,070
You've had it hard.

446
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,300
The car is ready.

447
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,140
Let's go.

448
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:52,950
Erliang.

449
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:26,950
Ms. Qiong.

450
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,140
Keep an eye out.

451
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,870
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,020
I want to see Mr. Yu.

453
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,590
I'm here.

454
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,870
Dong.

455
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,710
We can finally talk

456
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,870
face to face.

457
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,750
Let me introduce myself.

458
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,660
I am Yang Xingquan.

459
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,460
Thank you

460
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,910
for burning this place for me.

461
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,820
No wonder...

462
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,190
Lin Dezan.

463
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,870
Yang Xingquan.

464
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,670
So you

465
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,190
can rest assured now.

466
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,190
Lin Dezan

467
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,020
will be leaving soon.

468
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,500
Liu Kaihua isn't here either.

469
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,820
Wan Mengmeng hasn't regained consciousness yet.

470
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,430
She won't be able to say anything.

471
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,910
Now is the perfect time

472
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,500
to deliver the goods.

473
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,870
I can buy that Kun didn't sell me out.

474
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,470
But I refuse to believe

475
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,060
that the police haven't caught on to Wan yet.

476
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,500
You don't have to worry about anything.

477
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,780
Wanlutong Logistics is safe.

478
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,430
I've considered it from multiple aspects.

479
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,710
I want full control

480
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,060
of this delivery.

481
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,910
All right.

482
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,540
And

483
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,670
I want 20 percent more of the profits.

484
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,190
Dong.

485
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,740
We may call you Dong,

486
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,190
but do you really think you get to call the shots?

487
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,340
I've been on this path

488
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,110
for too long.

489
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,950
I want out.

490
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,980
These

491
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,670
are Yaba

492
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,580
and the latest Yellow Capsules.

493
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,020
You can have all of them.

494
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,150
You've thought about everything.

495
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,390
Thank you in advance.

496
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,150
I'll leave my words here.

497
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,980
Should you ever

498
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,540
need my help in the future,

499
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,340
tell me,

500
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,430
and I will

501
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,110
be there.

502
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,340
Don't bother hiding it.

503
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,230
I saw it.

504
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,910
Did you guys actually break up?

505
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,430
I'm here.

506
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,540
There, there.

507
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,670
Don't cry.

508
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,110
I'm here.

509
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,470
Kun.

510
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,740
Lei.

511
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,580
It's time to go back to your mother.

512
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,870
You can't stay in Yunhe anymore.

513
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
You're still young.

514
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,300
Be good.

515
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,470
There is no future

516
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,230
for people in this line of business.

517
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,580
Don't be like Kun.

518
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,470
One last hurrah.

519
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,980
Leave it up to fate.

520
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,430
200 kg.

521
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,670
We'll leave after we're done.

522
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,950
Nothing can go wrong

523
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,390
with the ingredients.

524
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,770
[Yunhe PSB Counter Narcotics Detachment]

525
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,060
How are things?

526
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,300
Director Lin.

527
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,630
Hao Dong and Wan Heda

528
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,020
entered the wood carving workshop

529
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,390
and Wanlutong Logistics last night.

530
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,060
After entering the border,

531
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,020
Hao Dong disappeared
from the unsupervised roads

532
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,190
for three hours.

533
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,300
We don't know where he went.

534
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,670
After that,
he went back to the wood carving workshop.

535
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,740
What about Jiang Lei?

536
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,950
He went to the border to pick up Hao Dong

537
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,740
last night.

538
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,500
He has been with him since.

539
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,260
He never came out

540
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,470
after entering the wood carving workshop.

541
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,740
Hello? Deputy Chief Chen?

542
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,950
Report.

543
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:43,980
Wan Heda and Hao Dong

544
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,470
have entered Yunhe

545
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,740
and met up with Jiang Lei.

546
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,910
It looks like our appeasement

547
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,260
had an effect.

548
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,260
Good.

549
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,500
However, we're still unclear

550
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,340
about the purpose of their gathering

551
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,630
at the moment.

552
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,780
We can't be sure if they're producing drugs

553
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,470
or trafficking drugs either.

554
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,780
Any news from Wu Zhenfeng?

555
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,190
Not since

556
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,820
the last time

557
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,740
Chen Yu contacted him.

558
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,110
In that case,

559
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,540
the only thing we can do right now

560
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,190
is monitor them closely.

561
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,950
Remember.

562
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,670
Be careful.

563
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,110
Do not let them discover us.

564
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,060
Yes, sir.

565
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,820
Stop him!

566
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,950
Since you are

567
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,950
standing here,

568
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,910
I'm sure you've made up your mind.

569
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,540
It's either

570
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,910
you won't leave this place alive

571
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,820
or...

572
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,150
