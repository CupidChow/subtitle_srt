3
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,850
Mengka betrayed me!

4
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,460
Your people are here.

5
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,330
But what about mine?

6
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,650
Where are my people?

7
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,700
Quit your crap!

8
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,180
Liu Kaihua was on that ship.

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,930
Liu Kaihua!

10
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,020
Impossible.

11
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,650
No way.

12
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,700
Lei wouldn't do that.

13
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,100
Dong.

14
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,540
Give me a solution.

15
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,570
Right now.

16
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,180
Don't tell me you don't have one.

17
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,100
I...

18
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,260
I...

19
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
I don't have one.

20
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,210
Zhuo.

21
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,340
Zhuo, about this...

22
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,020
We have to think it through.

23
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,770
It isn't that simple.

24
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,980
Zhuo!

25
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,820
Zhuo.

26
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,130
Zhuo, let me explain.

27
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,290
Don't do this, Zhuo.

28
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,650
Don't. Hear me out.

29
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,130
Give me some time!

30
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,490
Give me time to investigate.

31
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,930
Give me time to investigate.

32
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,050
I'll investigate it.

33
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,570
I have the Yellow Capsules!

34
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,620
I have the Yellow Capsules!

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,930
I have the Yellow Capsules.

36
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,050
Before this, you said

37
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,570
all the stock had been seized.

38
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,490
Turns out you pocketed it yourself.

39
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,850
You tricked me?

40
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,540
He's making it.

41
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,020
Kill me.

42
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,490
Kill me.

43
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,540
If you kill me,

44
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,570
you'll never know the answer.

45
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,850
Hello?

46
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm Wu Zhenfeng.

47
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,460
Wu Zhenfeng?

48
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,130
Take good care of Ms. Qiong.

49
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,570
I'll come to see you.

50
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,090
Wait for me.

51
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,250
Where is Wu Zhenfeng?

52
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,460
He took Can.

53
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,780
He has a motive.

54
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,460
Our operation in Shengjiang

55
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,410
didn't go well.

56
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,850
This could be our last chance

57
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,570
to capture them all.

58
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,900
He's betting everything on it.

59
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,690
Bet?

60
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,250
He's betting his life.

61
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,620
Why did you agree

62
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,970
to let him do that?

63
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,060
Deputy Chief Chen

64
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,530
has an informant in Hong Kong, China.

65
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,370
That person might be able to help him.

66
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,180
Pretty grand.

67
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,850
It's not what it used to be.

68
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,780
[Sha]

69
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,410
Are we filming a gangster movie or something?

70
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,690
Clear out.

71
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,970
Impressive, Sha.

72
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,570
You still command the stage.

73
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,020
I've always admired you.

74
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,620
But we never had a chance

75
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,660
to cross paths.

76
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,970
It's been this way for years,

77
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,740
hasn't it?

78
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,370
Hands that have touched drugs

79
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,180
cannot be made clean again.

80
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,250
I'm old.

81
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,970
Now, young guns rule the world.

82
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,970
Feng.

83
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,500
This

84
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,780
is the person you're looking for,

85
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,530
Mr. Zhuo.

86
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,340
Wu Zhenfeng.

87
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,850
Mr. Zhuo.

88
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,090
Buddy.

89
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,900
Sorry.

90
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,780
I went a little hard.

91
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
But you following me around

92
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,340
was getting in the way of me seeing Mr. Sha.

93
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
I hope you understand.

94
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,370
Wu Zhenfeng, what's your problem?

95
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,610
You tricked me again.

96
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,660
I was dropped off halfway through.

97
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,660
Thankfully,

98
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,420
I knew how to find the ship myself.

99
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,050
No need to guess.

100
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Let me introduce him to you.

101
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,660
Mr. Sha.

102
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
He's an old friend of my dad's.

103
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,370
You were with Mengka for so long.

104
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,860
How come

105
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,980
you've never mentioned him?

106
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,660
Why would I tell you?

107
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,570
Wan Heda has been arrested.

108
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,460
Your route is gone.

109
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,900
Mr. Sha has a ship.

110
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,370
I can do it.

111
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,370
From today on,

112
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,100
I

113
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,460
will run the route.

114
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,690
I

115
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,340
don't trust him.

116
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,860
Neither do I trust you.

117
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
I only came today

118
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,130
to talk it over with you

119
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,730
because of Ms. Qiong.

120
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,980
You need to get something straight,

121
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,660
Mr. Zhuo.

122
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,490
In Hong Kong, China,

123
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,610
you

124
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,370
aren't the only one who wants the goods.

125
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,460
Similarly,

126
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,170
it's not only Mengka that has the goods.

127
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,340
What are you up to?

128
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,660
Are you still with Mengka or not?

129
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,100
I used to be.

130
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,540
Forget it.

131
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,490
I told you.

132
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,570
They wouldn't believe you.

133
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
Let's go.

134
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,980
Come on.

135
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,490
Let's just go.

136
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,340
No need to get upset.

137
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,050
Stop right there.

138
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,020
Did I say you could leave?

139
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,050
Mr. Sha.

140
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,490
I'm Wu Zhenfeng.

141
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,020
Chen Liwen asked me to come to see you.

142
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,100
Chen Liwen?

143
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,250
So he finally wants me to repay the favor.

144
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,130
He saved me once.

145
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,220
I could now have a clean background

146
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,340
all thanks to him.

147
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
After so many years,

148
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,250
I thought he had forgotten.

149
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:07,810
Go on.

150
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,810
What do you need me to do?

151
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,370
Speak up.

152
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,690
Where are the Yellow Capsules?

153
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,980
There's none.

154
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,900
But someone is making it.

155
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,490
Tell me who is making it

156
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,340
and where this person is!

157
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,930
Hand everything over to me.

158
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,590
We found a production room

159
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,420
in the basement

160
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,150
of the wood carving workshop.

161
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,710
We found

162
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,270
raw materials for making drugs on site.

163
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,150
There were also replicas

164
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,220
with the same ingredients

165
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,590
as the Yellow Capsule replicas
found at Yundian Disco.

166
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,950
At the site,

167
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,270
we also found

168
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,830
a high concentration of diazepam.

169
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,620
The drug potency

170
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,910
is the same as the one

171
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,540
injected into Wan Mengmeng.

172
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,910
Wan Mengmeng was attacked in the rehab center.

173
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,350
Yu Miao, the nonresident doctor,

believe you?

That's not important.

But all of this

423
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,870
requires authorization from the higher-ups.

No way.

Even so,

442

he's gone this far

in an attempt to eradicate drugs.

444
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,340
I can't just do nothing.

Three years ago, I didn't help him.

This time,

448
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,260
I must be there by his side

449

and do my best to protect him.

450

Even if

451
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,740
I have to sacrifice myself.

452
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,190
I'll report to the higher-ups.

453

Do I still sleep in my old room?
