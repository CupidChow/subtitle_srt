Officer Yang.

301
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,060
The two of us

302
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,300

303

After the incident,

304
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,740
did Wu Zhenfeng

305
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,980
run off with you in the jungle?

306
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,380
He asked you a question.

307
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,260
Yes.

308
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,460
That's right.

309
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,740
He kicked you

310
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,900
off the cliff, right?

311
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,140
He seemed like a good fighter.

312
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,220
So I went with him.

313
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,500

315
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,540
I have a wife and kid at home.

316
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,100
And my wife was pregnant

317
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,620
when I was abroad.

318
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,940
She has always been physically frail.

319
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,740
She doesn't feel well

320
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,420
now and then.

321
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,620
If something had happened to me, then...

322
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,300
Hu Daming!

323
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
Just answer what is asked.

324
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,580
Got it?

325
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,460
Yes, sir.

326
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,580
Who saved you two?

327
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,820
I'm going to say this one last time.

328
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,140
Hand over the goods.

329
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,380
You asked for it.

330
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,340
Don't move! Drop the gun!

331
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,420
Don't move!

332
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,500
On your knees!

333
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,340
Drop the gun.

334
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,180
Release him.

335
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,820
Answer the question.

336
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,580
Mengka.

337
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,340
It was Mengka guerrilla.

338
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,780
Why did they save you?

339
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,260
I guess the people chasing us

340
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,860
trespassed into Mengka's territory.

341
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,780
So they saved us.

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,420
I count myself lucky

345
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,380
to have survived that.

346
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,660
Who would think about other stuff?

347
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,620
Am I right?

348
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,140
You're asking me?

349
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,500
We're the ones doing the questioning.

350
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,380
Where did you go

351
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,180
after being rescued?

352
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,940
After we were rescued,

353
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,020
we were locked up at the guerrilla base

354
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,860
for about half a year.

355
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,380
We were forced to work.

356
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,140
But thinking back,

357
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,660
I suppose it was a way to thank them

358
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,660
for saving us.

359
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,900
And then?

360
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,660
Then they let us go.

361
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,460
Wu Zhenfeng and I went separate ways.

362
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,820
Hello.

363
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,300
We are from Yunhe PSB's

364
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,100
Counter Narcotics Detachment.

365
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:34,660
May I ask

366
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,980
if you're Hu Daming's wife?

367
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,780
What do you want from me?

368
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,500
It's like this.

369
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,980
We came here

370
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,300
[Audio recording]
to ask you a few questions.

371
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,060
We will be recording

372
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,900
this interview.

373
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,100
I ask for your cooperation.

374
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,460
Do you know him?

375
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,500
You know him, don't you?

376
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,900
You're disturbing my business.

377
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,420
We really hope

378
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
you can cooperate with us.

379
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,620
Cooperate?

380
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,580
You took my husband away.

381
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,140
Our restaurant had to shut its doors.

382
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,460
Creditors harass us all day and night.

383
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,500
Did anyone come to our aid?

384
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,740
Only Feng did.

385
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,700
I guess he's a good guy.

386
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,420
He sent us money

387
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
every month.

388
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:22,820
He...

389
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,660
Did he bring the money himself?

390
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,020
(You know Wu Zhenfeng's whereabouts?)

391
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,420
Look.

392
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,620
You came to ask me about Wu Zhenfeng.

393
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,500
That means he must be back

394
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,380
in Yunhe.

395
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,540
Am I right?

396
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,860
To be honest, I kind of miss him.

397
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,740
What about you bring him along

398
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,860
the next time you come?

399
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,380
The three of us can do some catching-up.

400
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
How long has he been on drugs?

401
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,740
Who's on drugs?

402
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,820
Wu Zhenfeng?

403
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,540
No way. He never ever touches drugs.

404
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,340
What makes you so sure

405
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,180
he doesn't use drugs?

406
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,340
Because he didn't use drugs before.

407
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,740
If he's using,

408
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,180
it would be after I got incarcerated.

409
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,100
How long it has been since your last meeting?

410
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,340
Officer.

411
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,860
I told you.

412
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,740
We were locked up

413
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,820
in Mengka for half a year.

414
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,500
We never met again after that.

415
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,620
You're lying.

416
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,740
Feng

417
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,340
gave me 10,000 yuan

418
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,020
two weeks ago.

419
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,700
What did he say?

420
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,740
This is my name card.

421
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,060
Call me

422
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,260
if you remember anything.

423
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,420
Wu Zhenfeng is not using drugs.

424
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,140
We were set free after being locked up

425
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,020
for half a year.

426
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,860
In Mengka,

427
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
they produced heroin.

428
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,340
I saw an opportunity.

429
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,100
So I started a heroin business.

430
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,020
I used the restaurant as a cover.

431
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,540
What about Wu Zhenfeng?

432
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,380
He worked odd jobs overseas

433
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,540
while looking into his father's death.

434
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,460
What did he find out

435
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,460
in the past three years?

436
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,300
His father didn't leave behind

437
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,100
many clues.

438
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,660
So he had very little to go on.

439
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,620
It was very tough.

440
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,380
I don't know the details.

441
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,700
But he learned

442
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,900
that Dusan wasn't the only one

443
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,900
responsible for his father's death.

444
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,300
There was someone above Dusan.

445
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,020
So if he's returned

446
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,780
to Yunhe,

447
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,260
it must be to get revenge.

448
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,020
You said there's someone above Dusan.

449
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,420
Who?

450
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,060
I don't know.

451
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,700
The only thing I know is that his father's death

452
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,100
had something to do

453
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,220
with Yunhe's druglord, Li Linfan three years ago.

454
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,460
This is what people are saying.

455
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,220
Li Linfan was reported to the police

456
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,740
by Wu Zhenfeng's father,

457
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,940
Wu Gang.

458
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,820
That's why Wu Gang was targeted.

459
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,460
There's no way Feng would break the law,

460
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,860
let alone use drugs.

461
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,220
You must help him.

462
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,020
Help him with that?

463
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,020
It's been more than a year since you last saw him.

464
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,700
How could you be so sure he's still clean?

465
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,140
You two must be close.

466
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,580
I could tell

467
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,620
when I saw you two in Walin Town

468
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,260
three years ago.

469
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,460
You should help him.

470
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,180
Help him get his revenge.

471
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,980
He's a good man.

472
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,940
055, step inside.

473
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,540
I told you I'd come.

474
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,780
You're quite something.

475
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,500
Who the heck are you?

476
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,020
What is it you want?

477
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,140
I'm just a runner

478
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,340
that stole five kilos of Yaba
from the boss.

479
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,300
Get lost!

480
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,140
Who told you?

481
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,380
I did that.

482
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,620
How did you find out?

483
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,940
What do you want?

484
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,740
I thought that went over your head.

485
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
You work for K?

486
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,620
I'm here to save you.

487
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,980
Save me?

488
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,020
In Yunhe, Dong calls the shots.

489
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,700
Who do you think you are?

490
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,740
It's okay.

491
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,820
He wouldn't dare do anything.

492
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,140
There's surveillance.

493
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,340
That was for yesterday.

494
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,380
Let's talk.

495
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:50,980
Chief Gong.

496
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,260
Sorry.

497
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,700
It's been three years.

498
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:08,980
Chief Gong.

499
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,020
I came to say I'm sorry.

500
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,900
Wu Gang's son,

501
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
Wu Zhenfeng is back.

502
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,340
I found Wu Gang Case

503
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,900
to be related to Li Linfan Case.

504
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,420
So...

505
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,100
I wish to ask you about Li Linfan Case.

506
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,900
[To Dezan: Chen Yu wants to know...]

507
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,420
I'll tell you where I hid the stuff

508
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,660
I stole from Dong.

509
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,980
Give it back

510
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,780
to Dong,

511
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,780
and put in a good word for me.

512
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,500
Please, I beg you.

513
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,100
I came to you,

514
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,900
so that you could take me to Dong.

515
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,620
You don't know Dong?

516
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Are you a cop?

517
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,540
I'm from Mengka.

518
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,540
Mengka?

519
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,220
Bro.

520
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,620
Listen.

521
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
I don't know that Dong guy.

522
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,060
I'm in no position

523
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,380
to even cross paths with him.

524
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,900
Then who are you able to reach?

525
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,900
Mouse.

526
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,100
It was actually Mouse's goods I pocketed.

527
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,620
I'm not sure

528
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,420
if he is able

529
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
to reach Dong either.

530
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,060
Who is Mouse?

531
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,380
He's in charge

532
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,260
of K's biggest distribution point

533
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,300
in Yunhe.

534
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,940
It's an underground boxing gym.

535
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,620
Where is it?

536
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,220
Then I don't know.

537
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,980
The location is always changing.

538
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,900
I've been here

539
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,060
for quite some time.

540
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:11,940
I really don't know

541
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,140
exactly where it is.

542
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,460
Bro.

543
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,940
I really can't help you with this.

544
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,660
Wash up and sleep.

545
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,900
You better be sure.

546
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,100
Are you going

547
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,220
to hide in here forever?

548
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,740
What if one day

549
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,140
Dong comes for you?

550
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,300
Would he be talking to you nicely like this?

551
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,620
Director Lin.

552
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,260
Why are you looking at me like that?

553
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,140
If you wish to know

554
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,820
about Li Linfan Case,

555
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,140
you could've asked me.

556
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,300
Chief Gong was injured.

557
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,100
He can't talk.

558
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,260
You know that.

559
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,540
You are just making trouble here

560
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,580
by asking him.

561
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,220
The incident happened three years ago.

562
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,220
You were still in the Police University.

Why are you

00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,700
so interested in

587
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,780
Li Linfan Case?

588
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
I went to see Hu Daming.

589
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,660
Three years ago,

590
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,820
Wu Zhenfeng and I were abducted.

591
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,580
Hu Daming was on the same bus.

592
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,100
Hu Daming said

593
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,700
that Li Linfan was reported by Wu Gang.

594
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,420
Doesn't that put more question marks

595
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,420
on Wu Gang Case?

596
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,980
Hu Daming said Wu Gang was the informer

597
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,780
in Li Linfan Case.

598
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,500
Where's the proof?

599
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,500
That's what Hu Daming said.

600
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,220
So that is

601
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
what Wu Zhenfeng believes.

602
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,500
Three years ago, he was out there investigating

603
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,420
his father's grievance.

604
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,780
This also proves there's something wrong

605
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,020
with Wu Gang Case.

606
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,340
Mind the word you use. "Grievance"?

607
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,620
Based on what?

608
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,380
How much of what Hu Daming said is true?

609
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,860
I think it's trustworthy.

610
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,700
Motive.

611
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,580
What's the motive

612
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
for killing Wu Gang for the drugs?

613
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,100
Tell me.

614
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,740
Director Lin.

615
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,980
First of all,

616
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,700
I think our direction

617
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,460
is already wrong.

618
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,660
If they killed him for drugs,

619
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,260
would they leave the drugs behind?

620
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,020
Drugs were found on site.

621
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,980
Clearly, it was a set-up, a payback.

622
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,100
Hu Daming said

623
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,980
Wu Gang disclosed Li Linfan.

624
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,820
That is plausible.

625
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,460
At least it proves that there's more

626
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,660
to Wu Gang's death.

627
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,780
Moreover, Dusan, who was involved

628
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,580
in Wu Gang's death

629
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,260
was also killed in the end, right?

630
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,780
We did not get

631
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,620
the whole picture

632
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,380
regarding Wu Gang Case.

633
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,580
That's because it happened outside our borders.

634
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,100
But not so for Dusan.

635
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,660
(Our initial intel was)

636

Director Lin.

00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,740
a bright future ahead of him

648
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,500
spent three years out there investigating.

649
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,740
If he hadn't found a lead

650
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,980
on his father,

651
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,340
would he have persevered for so long?

652
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,780
I wish to crack this case more than you do,

653
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,300
but not based on personal feelings

654
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,300
or subjective assumptions.

655
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,660
Can you solve it like that?

656
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,620
No way.

657
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,420
Chief Gong.

658
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,180
I'm leaving.

659
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,740
I'll visit more often.

660
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,340
[Li Linfan, Wu Gang... Point of investigation!]

661

Here you are, Director Lin.

662
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,780
Perfect.

Whole prawns.

666
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,300
The rehab center called.

667
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,540
They said Wu Zhenfeng was moved
to a different cell.

668
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,500
Different cell?

669
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,060
What was the reason?

670
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,660
I asked Director Zhao.

671
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,740
He said it was normal

672
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,580
cell allocation protocol.

673
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,380
It was pretty vague.

674
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,580
Investigate it.

675
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,460
Find out who the brat interacted

676
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,500
in the rehab center.

677
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,580
By the way,

678
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,540
no need to ask Director Zhao.

679
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,940
Do it quietly.

680
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,300
What's up with you today, Director Lin?

681
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,780
