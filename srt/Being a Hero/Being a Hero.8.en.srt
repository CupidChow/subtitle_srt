00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,180
In other words,

173
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,060
who do you think is capable of sending him
to the rehab center?

174
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,180
Someone from our detachment.

175
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,140
Now you know why

176
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,740
we won't let you report

177
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,900
the arrest of Huang Wenlin to the superior.

178
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,140
Did Leng Feng verify the test results?

179
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,620
According to Leng Feng,

180
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,260
it could be an error.

181
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,460
She suggested sending the blood sample

182
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,100
to the provincial department for a second test.

183
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:39,900
What about this?

184
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,180
You get another sample from Wu Zhenfeng,

185
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,620
and send it to the provincial department
for a second test.

186
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,180
Sure.

187
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,060
Anran.

188
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Have you got the information I asked for?

189
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,420
I have.

190
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,540
On Wu Zhenfeng's

191
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,460
second day

192
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,020
at the rehab center,

193
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,340
he had some conflicts

194
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,260
with a guy named Li Shougui.

195
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,260
He was moved

196
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,460
to Li Shougui's room

197
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,180
that night.

198
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,700
We need to find out more about Li Shougui.

199
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,300
I found something.

200
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,420
He is nicknamed the Guishou.

201
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,980
The guys in the rehab center
dare not mess with him.

202
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,620
He's a long-time Yaba user.

203
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,460
He was forcefully admitted to the rehab center

204
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,740
a year ago.

205
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,460
How did they arrest him?

206
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,540
He turned himself in.

207
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,020
He turned himself in?

208
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,820
Yes.

209
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,660
What did he do before he came to the center?

210
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,660
He was unemployed.

211
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,500
He was sentenced to three years in prison

212
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,260
because of drug dealings.

213
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,060
After he was released from jail,

214
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
he was detained four times

215
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,260
due to his involvement in battery cases.

216
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,180
What drugs did he sell?

217
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,620
Yaba.

218
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Yaba with a "K" printed on them.

219
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,780
But how did Li Shougui

220
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,700
get in here?

221
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,700
You should find out what happened personally.

222
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,900
Pay attention to every news you got
from Director Zhao and Leng Feng.

223
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,900
Understood.

224
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,140
Remember to keep it a secret.

225
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,500
[Yunhe Compulsory Isolated Drug Rehab Center]

226
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,740
The worst-case scenario,

227
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,180
if the test report

228
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,420
returned by Kundu shows

229
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,180
that Wu Zhenfeng didn't use drugs,

230
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,940
the rehab center has to release him.

231
00:12:59,420 --> 00:12:59,980
Release him?

232
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,740
Then, he'll be at large.

233
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,620
(Your neighbor is quite impressive.)

234

the moment he came here.)

(and wished to smuggle goods
using the route Dong once used.)

Where are you going?

239
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,340
We can't let him get away.

240
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,900
Report.

241

Director Lin.

242
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,700
Report.

243
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,020
Suppose that the second test shows

244
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,700
that Wu Zhenfeng wasn't using drugs,

245
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,980
what are you going to do?

246
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,380
Report.

247
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,060
I'll bring him back to my place.

248
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,060
Do you know what you're talking about?

249
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,780
Young man.

250
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,140
Director Lin.

251
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,380
I've been thinking about this

252
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,180
on my way here.

253
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,900
Wu Zhenfeng is being

254
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,460
too suspicious.

255
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
We have completely no clue about what's going on.

256
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,060
You're planning to bring him back to your place,

257
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,940
but how are you going to justify that?

258
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,420
Because he was your neighbor,

259
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,060
a drug addict,

260
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,100
or a suspect?

261
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
Think this through.

262
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,780
Director Lin.

263
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,340
I've thought this through.

264
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,220
From my analysis,

265
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,060
even if Wu Zhenfeng was involved
in drug dealing activities,

266
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,300
it was definitely just
superficial participation.

267
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,700
If what Huang Wenlin said

268
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,220
is true,

269
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,780
it means Wu Zhenfeng knows nothing

270
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,740
about Dong from K.

271
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,260
He doesn't know anything about K.

272
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,460
If he knows K well enough,

273
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,660
he wouldn't have

274
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
beaten around the bush.

275
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,060
He didn't have to involve either Hu Qingshan

276
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,980
or Huang Wenlin.

277
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,940
Therefore,

278
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,180
the only thing we can do is to keep an eye on him.

279
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,540
Perhaps, that's how we bring down K.

280
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,940
You must answer this question truthfully.

281
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,180
Are you affected by your personal feelings?

282
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,380
I am,

283
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,540
but that's why we should make good use

284
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,900
of the emotions to bring K down.

285
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,460
I think there are two reasons

286
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,260
why Wu Zhenfeng

287
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,700
wouldn't say anything.

288
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,940
Firstly, he was heavily involved in this case.

289
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,580
Secondly, he doesn't trust us.

290
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,260
After interacting with him,

291
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,660
I believe it's the latter.

292
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,340
Therefore, I wish

293
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,980
to use my personal feelings to convince him

294
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,580
to open up to us,

295
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
so that he could help us

296
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,700
and provide us with clues.

297
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,220
You need to trust me.

298
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,460
What if he goes missing

299
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,180
after he's released?

300
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,940
Do you have any other ways?

301
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:58,780
What about this?

302
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,580
If you don't trust me,

303
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,180
you can send someone to keep a watch over us.

304
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,820
You can also install surveillance cameras
at my place.

305
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,900
Two things.

306
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,260
Firstly,

307
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,900
never disclose anything about the case.

308
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,460
Secondly,

309
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,540
report to me immediately

310
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,620
whenever something happens.

311
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:32,900
Yes, sir.

312
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm back.

313
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,540
Zhang,

314
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,420
go and get some rest.

315
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:55,980
I'll clean it up.

316
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,580
Don't worry.

317
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,500
You should get going.

318
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,700
The helper is here.

319
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,260
Thank you, Ling.

320
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,380
Thank you, Officer Chen.

321
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,220
Lingling.

322
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,780
I have something to tell you.

323
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,420
Someone

324
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,300
is going to stay with us for a few days.

325
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,420
You decide.

326
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,260
There's no need to inform me about it.

327
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,780
It was the guy I mentioned to you before.

328
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,580
He's one of my neighbor when I was little.

329
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,780
Isn't he at the rehab center?

330
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,260
There was an error with the test.

331
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,220
He didn't take drugs.

332
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,100
An error?

333
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,300
Really?

334
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,420
It's true.

335
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,860
He didn't take drugs.

336
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,020
You told me

337
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,580
that his father was a drug offender,

338
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,540
right?

339
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,340
Chen Yu, what are you planning to do?

How did you get into the rehab center?

767

Last night, there was someone

intentionally put it in.
