do you believe in what Wu Zhenfeng said?

5
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,980
Did you go through

00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,900
the security footage of the pharmacy?

7
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,780
Haven't you noticed anything?

8
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,620
Before we got there,

9
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,740
someone must have

10
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,620
tipped Ba Peng off.

11
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,220
What's your relationship

with Wu Zhenfeng?

13
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,980
You have the same jade pendant

14

as his.

15
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,940
They are exactly the same.

during the interrogation last night,

why did Chief Liu

19
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,860
tell you to go out?

20
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,460
Wu Zhenfeng said

21
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
it's possible that Huang Wenlin

22
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,340
is in Moyun Bar.

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,420
If Huang Wenlin is there

24
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,380
and we get to find

25
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,940
that there are narcotics at the scene,

26
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,380
we can catch him.

27
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,700
It's still early,

28
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,660
and the bar is not open yet.

29
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,180
If this gets out,

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,940
then things

He's upright.

38

He might not tell anyone...

39
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,420
Have you done the interrogation?

40
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,180
How's it?

41
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,100
Have you got any clues?

42

If

46
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,980
there's an uncertain clue

47
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,260
that needs to be verified,

48
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,780
do you think you should go?

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,820
An uncertain clue? What is it?

50
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,940
Wu Zhenfeng said

51
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,180
Huang Wenlin owns a bar,

52
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,660
and it's also a spot of trafficking.

53
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,060
And it's very possible

54
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,700
that Huang Wenlin is in it.

55
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,420
This is important, why didn't you report it?

56
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,380
I told you it's not verified yet.

57
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,020
Will you go?

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,900
It's a chance to render meritorious service.

Have you interrogated him?

64

Yes.

65
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,580
But we still need to go to Bowen

66

Go.

Why can't I have a look inside there?

No entrance now.

177

Get lost.

Go.

179
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,220
What nonsense is this?

180
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,260
Chen Yu, I got in.

181
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,020
Huang Wenlin isn't at the hall.

182
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,620
But there's an exit passageway

183
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,580
on the left after I got in.

184
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,900
The staircase inside it

185
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,860
is guarded by stooges.

186
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,140
He might be inside.

187
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,060
I'll check it out.

188
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,220
Got it.

189
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,100
Take care.

190
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,820

Ba?

Did Ba tell you to come here?

Yeah.

220

that if I can't find him,

Anran and I

316

Chief Liu happened to be busy back then.

So we didn't report it.

What were you doing back then?

328

Deshan West District Police Station

330
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,900

331
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,460
My nephew is really

332

a troublemaker.

333
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,020
So I went there to settle that.

334
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,420
At what time did you enter Moyun Bar?

335
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,180
Nine o'clock.

336

Nine?

337
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,020
Four hours and a half.

338
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,820
Why didn't you report it

339
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,780
when you had the time?

340
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,900
Why didn't you hand in the records of words
of the interrogation?

341
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,180
Director Lin, I...

You tell me.

344
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,300
Yang Yi.

345
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,900
Director Lin asked you a question.

346
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,060
Speak.

347
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,900
Report.

348
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,580
Chen Yu

349
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,020
has just come back
to the Counter Narcotics Detachment,

350
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,620
and may be eager to earn merits.

351
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,020
So he didn't report it.

352
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,620
Yang Yi!

353
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,180
What nonsense is this?

354
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,180
This is my personal opinion.

355
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,860
Report.

356
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,660
Director Lin.

357
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,220
Although Wu Zhenfeng

358
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,140
told us the location of Moyun Bar,

359
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,580
we didn't know

360
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,340
whether Huang Wenlin would be there

361
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
or whether there would be narcotics.

362
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,580
So I wanted to report it to you

363
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,620
after I verified it all.

364
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,980
I didn't want to cause a huge mess.

365
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,900
Is this mess you made not huge enough?

366
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,100
Do you think we don't know how to

367
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,420
investigate in disguise
and conduct a sting operation?

368
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,340
Do you think you are so great?

369
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,620
Do you know how dangerous

370
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,660
it is?

371
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,540
If Yang Yi didn't report to us in advance,

372
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,820
you wouldn't know

373
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,660
what consequence the three of you

374
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,500
would face today.

375
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,380
Report, Chief Liu.

376
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,580
It was my idea.

377
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,220
Last time, we found it was Ba.

378
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:36,940
But we didn't

379
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,180
get anything at the scene.

380
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,580
So we decided
that we should investigate it first.

381
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,420
We would report it once we verified it.

382
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,620
What were you worried about?

383
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,260
Were you worried that we wouldn't
go to arrest them

384
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,580
after you report it to us?

385
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,380
What about you?

386
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,660
What were you worried about?

387
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,180
We failed to catch Ba.

388
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,020
So you suspect

389
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,420
that someone tipped them off.

390
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,060
Very well then.

391
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,700
Who do you suspect?

392
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,620
Speak up.

393
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,260
You are young.

394
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,700
I can understand

395
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,900
that you want to show yourselves,

396

397

and moreover,

get trusted by others.

399
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,740
But the observance
of organization and disciplines

400
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,260
always comes first.

401
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,580
It's important to capture the drug dealers.

402
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,060
But what I care about more

403
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,420
is the safety of all of you.

404
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,100
This is my bottom line.

405
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,460
Haven't we had enough consequences?

406
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,620
You must remember it.

407
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,300
Write a self-criticism report.

408

Although we captured Huang Wenlin,

413
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,660
I think it is necessary

414

that we interrogate Wu Zhenfeng again.

415
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,620
