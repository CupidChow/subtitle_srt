Chief Liu,

Wu Zhenfeng,

173
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,770
and even Yang Xingquan,

174
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,690
everything doesn't make sense.

175
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,180
We have to investigate it.

(The boss was pretty secretive.)

180
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,300
He gave himself a nickname.

181
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,820
What was his nickname again?

182
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,620
Guishou.

183
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,940
Tonight, at 12 AM,

184
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,980
there's a job at Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory.

185
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:33,980
Lei, I'm sorry.

186
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,380
We'll pay you

187
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,450
the rest immediately!

188
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,260
Lei.

189
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,010
It's fine.

(They're smuggling drugs tonight.)

191

If they discovered

192
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,860
that I brought this with me,

193
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,820
they'd kill me for real.

195

Who are they?

200
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,530
I don't know.

201
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,740
Let me ask you this.

202
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,450
Why did you head to Yunhe Hospital

203
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:11,890
this afternoon?

204
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,380
I didn't go there.

205
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,770
I didn't go there.

206
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,090
Say that again!

207
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,210
How dare you still lie to me?

208
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,210
Tell me.

209
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,420
What's your relationship with Wang Yikun

210
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,180
and K?

211
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,300
I just went there to help them take a look!

212
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,300
What's wrong with that?

213
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,260
It was a hospital!

214
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,820
Did you think I went there to kill someone?

215
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,650
Come!

216
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,380
Uncle!

217
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,380
Uncle!

218
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,450
Uncle, where are we going?

219
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,570
Uncle!

220
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,500
Come with me!

221
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,130
Uncle!

222
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,740
Come with me!

223
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,890
Go and explain yourself!

224
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,330
Uncle!

225
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,770
Uncle!

Uncle!

227
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,820
I'll die for real

228
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,980
if you send me to the Public Security Bureau!

229
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,740
Uncle!

230
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,180
Uncle!

231
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,260
Uncle, release me!

232
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,620
I'll die if I go in there!

233
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,130
Get up!

234
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,820
Uncle!

235
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,530
Uncle!

236
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,090
Get up!

237
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,060
Uncle!

238
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,010
I cannot go with you!

239
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,130
Uncle, I'll die if I head

240
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,650
to the Public Security Bureau!

241
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,210
Stop right there!

242
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,180
Open it!

243
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,300
Open the door!

244
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,650
What are you doing?

245
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,420
Lei, open the door!

246
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,530
What are you doing?

247
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,090
Uncle, I cannot go with you!

248
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,860
I'll die if I go there!

249
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,180
Uncle!

250
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,180
Uncle, listen to me.

251
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,380
I'm going to tell them

252
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,940
everything I know.

253
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:23,890
You don't know what they're like.

254
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,820
Are you still the Lei who I'd raised?

255
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,010
Uncle!

256
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm begging you.

257
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,570
Just treat it as if you saw nothing.

258
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,260
Just release me.

259
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,770
Are you?

260
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,940
Are you trying to kill me here,

261
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,820
Uncle?

262
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,890
Are you trying to kill me?

263
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,450
Is that so, Uncle?

264
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,010
Can't you just turn a blind eye to this?

265
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,450
Just turn a blind eye to this, okay?

266
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:36,980
Uncle.

267
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,210
Uncle, I'll die if I go there!

268
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,380
Uncle!

269
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,890
Please let me go!

270
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,890
I knew too much.

271
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,570
You have no idea

272
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,740
what I had done.

273
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,860
Are you trying to kill me here,

274
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,820
Uncle?

275
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,570
I'll die if I go there!

276
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,330
Chief Gong,

277
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,500
sometimes,

278
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
I'm pretty envious of you.

279
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,530
Staying

280
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,650
within your own world

281
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
can actually help you
see things clearer and better assess

282
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,060
the situation.

283
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,650
Unlike me.

284
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,420
I can't figure it out.

285
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,770
I think I understand what Chen Yu is thinking now.

286
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,740
I think I understand

287
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,650
what he's feeling when Wu Zhenfeng

288
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,650
was suspected of drug dealing.

289
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,450
I'm sure he hoped

290
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,770
that everything was just an illusion.

291
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,420
Kaihua?

292
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,780
Director Lin.

293
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:02,930
What are you doing here?

294
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,420
I happen to have something to tell you.

295
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,660
We've compared

296
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,090
the fingerprint on the gun that killed Dusan

297
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,020
with Wang Yikun's fingerprint.

298
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,490
The crime scene technician

299
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,580
have verified it.

300
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,850
That means K Group killed Dusan

301
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,700
in order to silence him.

302
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,940
It's been so many years.

303
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,130
The boulder sitting on my chest

304
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,330
has finally been lifted today.

305
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,450
I know.

306
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,540
I know you two

307
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,330
don't need my apology.

308
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,180
But I still have to say this.

309
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,730
Chief Gong.

310
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,610
Kaihua.

311
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,330
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,610
Stop eating.

313
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,490
Just go.

314
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,730
I won't go.

315
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,450
You can go.

316
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,130
How could I go?

317
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,370
Her dad already hates me.

318
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,850
You're her elder brother. You should go.

319
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,020
What about this?

320
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,180
We can play rock paper scissors.

321
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,450
The loser will go.

322
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,180
Get up.

323
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:27,940
Get up.

324
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Rock, paper, scissors...

325
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,300
Yang Ling.

326
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,060
Yang Ling!

327
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,090
These duck necks

328
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,940
are too delicious.

329
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,970
Your brother finished all of them.

330
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,970
I'll go and buy some.

331
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,420
You guys can have a chat.

332
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,130
Don't go!

333
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,820
Don't go!

334
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,250
Ling,

335
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,730
we can place our order

336
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,450
with this app.

337
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,210
He doesn't need to go out.

338
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,450
You don't know what she likes.

339
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,210
I'll order them for you.

340
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,250
What are you saying?

341
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,300
How could I not know?

342
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,180
What are you guys doing?

343
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,370
What do you want to tell me?

344
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,370
Come.

345
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,900
What are you doing?

346
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,820
Is your dad at the tea factory?

347
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,370
Yeah.

348
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,370
Where else can he be?

349
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,180
Is he busy lately?

350
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,730
How's the business doing?

351
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,970
Why are you suddenly

352
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,780
concerned about the business of the tea factory?

353
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,090
Do you know how much

354
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,450
your dad's tea factory

355
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,250
earns per year?

356
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:26,900
Yi,

357
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,610
are you short on cash?

358
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,850
You should tell me then.

359
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,900
I'll transfer some money to you.

360
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,210
That's not it.

361
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,130
What I meant was,

362
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,850
I want you to do us a favor.

363
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,580
Can you check the tea factory's ledger

364
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,820
for us?

365
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,210
But why?

366
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,900
It's like this.

367
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,900
We've been investigating

368
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,450
this case lately.

369
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,180
Some of the companies that were investigated

370
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,700
were quite close

371
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,850
to the suspect's company.

372
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,450
Your dad's tea factory

373
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,370
was one of them.

374
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,250
That's why I was thinking

375
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,660
if you could do us a favor

376
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,060
and check the ledger for us.

377
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,490
Are you saying

378
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,130
that something's wrong with the tea factory?

379
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,700
I didn't say it was the tea factory.

380
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,450
[Tasty duck necks]

381
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:28,940
I'm done.

382
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,610
Place the order.

383
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,580
Wait, Yang Ling.

384
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,700
Don't overthink it.

385
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,250
This is not an investigation.

386
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,730
We just wanted you guys

387
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,850
to cooperate with us.

388
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,300
You see,

389
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,370
we definitely believe in your dad

390
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,820
and his tea factory.

391
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,730
However, we wish to pinpoint

392
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,820
the issues

393
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,540
in other companies

394
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,940
by comparing their ledgers.

395
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,020
It might also lead us

396
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,900
to some important clues.

397
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,850
So,

398
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,540
if you think this is inconvenient...

399
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,850
Of course not.

400
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,300
You two aren't outsiders.

401
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,180
I'll tell my dad about it then.

402
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,060
Or do you two want to investigate it yourselves?

403
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,020
How did you manage to come out?

404
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,490
My police buddy bailed me out.

405
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,450
Why isn't there any goods on my truck?

406
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,020
All of you knew

407
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,780
where to pick up the goods,

408
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,850
except for me.

409
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:31,940
What do you mean by that?

410
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,250
What did Wan Heda tell you?

411
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,180
I've been risking my life

412
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,420
to work for you guys

413
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,450
after my dad's passing.

414
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,820
For the past three years,

415
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,300
I've treated Mengka like my home.

416
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,330
I thought

417
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,580
you guys could trust me this time.

418
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,250
But in the end?

419
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,540
If you guys keep doing this to me,

420
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,330
do you believe

421
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,330
that I'll give you guys away?

422
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,250
Buddy,

423
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,090
we did so under Mr. Yu's instruction.

424
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,540
Hello?

425
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,580
It's me, Wan Heda.

426
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,090
Wan Heda.

427
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,660
So,

428
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,660
in your opinion, how did the cops

429
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,900
know about our operation?

430
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,090
Wan Mengmeng and Kun

431
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,540
were always under their surveillance.

432
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,370
Answer it.

433
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:05,900
Speak.

434
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,450
I brought Hao Dong out here.

435
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,020
We're in Walin Town.

436
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,660
Can we meet up?

437
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,660
You're outside?

438
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,850
Erliang, listen.

439
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,450
On account of

440
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,130
our past ties,

441
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,420
we should meet up and have a chat.

442
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,820
Are you sure

443
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,730
you guys weren't tailed?

444
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
We came here last night

445
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,090
using the old path.

446
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,250
We're perfectly safe.

447
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,730
Wait there.

448
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,660
Back then, I was transferred away
from the Counter Narcotics Detachment.

449
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,130
And Chief Gong was injured.

450
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,490
Back then, all of us thought

451
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,490
that you were the best candidate

452
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,330
to be the chief
of the Counter Narcotics Detachment.

453
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,060
Many years have passed since then.

454
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,300
I think I was right about you.

455
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,700
Director Lin.

456
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,540
What if you have

457
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,090
to bid farewell to your uniform one day?

458
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,610
What will you do after that?

459
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,090
Maybe I'll lead a life like Yang Xingquan's.

460
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,090
I would own a tea garden.

461
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,730
Green scenery outside the window

462
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,210
while my wife and my daughter
are inside the house.

463
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,020
[I'll be there too.]

464
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,540
Kaihua,

465
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,660
what about you?

466
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,450
In the past,

467
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,970
I've never thought

468
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,130
that I would retire from being a cop.

469
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,540
Initially,

470
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,250
I thought this would be my lifetime career.

471
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,090
Even if I were to be single all my life,

472
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,780
even if I were to have no descendants,

473
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,660
I have no way

474
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,130
to say goodbye to my career.

475
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,250
Many things had happened lately.

476
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,900
I understand

477
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,370
how sad and dejected you feel.

478
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,540
For example, Gong and I

479
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,700
have been cops for over 30 years.

480
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,730
There are many things

481
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,210
that we don't get to decide.

482
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,450
But sometimes, we have to decide.

483
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,660
For example,

484
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,090
should we persevere or give up?

485
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,300
Should we betray the organization
or stay loyal to it?

486
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,090
We had to make a choice.

487
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,180
That's why I've been thinking about this.

488
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,900
The hardest thing isn't the bullet you take

489
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,580
or the death of your beloved.

490
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,490
The hardest thing

491
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,210
might be the temptation we have to face.

492
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,180
As ordinary humans,

493
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,780
how should we face

494
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,820
the softest spot in our hearts?

495
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,180
Say,

496
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,490
will the cops arrest us as well?

497
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,700
If we bring them here

498
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,450
right now,

499
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,180
we'll be digging our own graves.

500
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,090
If we don't bring them here,

501
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,180
we'll fall out

502
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,210
with them.

503
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,940
We fell out with them long ago.

504
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,780
Before this, Mr. Yu

505
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,020
was just trying to teach them a lesson.

506
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,180
However,

507
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,180
we still have to do business with them.

508
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,250
Let's see if we can win Wan over
to our side completely

509
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,820
this time.

510
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,020
Erliang,

511
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,490
