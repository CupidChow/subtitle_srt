[Episode 17]

3
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,380
Wu Zhenfeng, think about it.

4
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,820
Did you think you'd be able
to make the trade successfully

5
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,140
if they had given you the real goods?

6
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,580
Listen up,

7
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,540
K

8
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,300
has never intended

9
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,700
to smuggle drugs for Mengka.

10
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,140
They already planned

11
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,220
to light up the trading venue.

12
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,740
Did you think

13
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,820
they did it on a whim?

14
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,380
They knew they were fake.

15
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,620
Why do you think they still burned it down?

16
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,100
You fell into their trap.

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,300
I fell for it too.

18
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,460
You did everything from the start until the end

19
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,140
in order to exact revenge against them.

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,300
Don't you think you're being selfish here?

21
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,380
I was wrong.

22
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,300
I was wrong about you.

23
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,580
To be honest,

24
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,540
I should've seen that coming

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,740
when receiving your first call.

26
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,620
Hello?

27
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
You must be Chen Liwen.

28
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,380
Who are you?

29
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,260
I have leads regarding Yellow Capsules.

30
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,860
Meet up with me

31
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,900
if you're interested.

32
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,660
Remember,

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,900
meet me at 6 PM.

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,220
Come alone.

[Baka Reservoir]

36
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,860
About Yellow Capsules,

37
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,300
they were made by Hu Qingshan.

38
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Ba was responsible for selling them.

39
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,020
Huang Daxian supplied it.

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Who are you?

41
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,860
I only set Ba up yesterday,

42
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,020
but he was released immediately.

43
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,940
Last night,

44
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,060
he and I went to the trade.

45
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,180
He was burned to death.

46
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,460
There's a traitor among your men.

47
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,020
How do you know me?

48
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,660
You were the last person

49
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,740
my dad called.

50
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,380
That means he trusted you.

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,940
You're the son of Wu Gang?

52
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,780
I've been investigating Mengka for three years.

53
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,980
The person who killed my dad

54
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,660
was from K.

55
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,900
The cops here

56
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,500
are also trying

57
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,940
to get rid of Yellow Capsules and Yaba.

58
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,260
I know a drug dealer

59
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,620
called Guishou.

60
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,460
After he intercepted

61
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,700
5 kg of drugs from K,

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,540
he went and hide inside the rehab center.

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
As long as you agree

64
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,580
to let me enter the rehab center,

65
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
I can approach him,

66
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,860
therefore, approaching K as well.

67
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,300
I will tell you

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,180
every detail I know.

69
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,820
In this deal,

70
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
you guys can crack down on their operation

71
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,300
while I can seek revenge.

72
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,780
It's a win-win situation.

73
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,140
Are you sure you can infiltrate K like this?

74
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,980
This is the only way.

75
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,780
(You wanted to enter the rehab center.)

76
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,420
(I helped you out.)

77
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,180
But what did you do for us?

78
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,380
You said

79
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,220
you met the members of K before.

80
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,060
But you didn't tell me about it.

81
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,420
You wished to exact revenge

82
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,780
by yourself.

83
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,580
Have you seen the consequences?

84
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,180
Did you see how Mengka treated you?

85
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,020
Did you see how K treated you?

86
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,100
You thought

87
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,620
you could eradicate these drug cartels

88
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,580
all by yourself.

89
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,300
You thought

90
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,820
you could prove
your father's innocence by doing so.

91
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,300
In your dreams!

92
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,740
You don't even understand

93
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,860
how to get your revenge.

94
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,380
Listen, Wu Zhenfeng,

95
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,380
if you still wish to be stubborn,

96
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,180
the next person who will die

97
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,060
will be you.

98
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,540
(It's been three years.)

99
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,020
(Three years.)

100

(I've done everything)

101
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,580
(I could.)

102
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,740
(But I couldn't change anything.)

103
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,580
(I don't know what else I can do.)

104
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,140
I know.

105
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,900
In your heart,

106
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,580
your father's clear reputation is above all else.

107
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,540
But to me,

108
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,220
your father

109
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,980
had a befitting death.

110
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,260
(I can understand your feelings.)

111
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,220
(However, I must tell you this.)

112
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,820
As long as the drugs are still around,

113
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,860
even if you have exacted your revenge,

114
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,700
countless others like you

115
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,140
with a terrible fate

116
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,460
will appear.

117
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,740
(They will follow in your footsteps.)

118
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,260
(They'll be filled with loneliness and fear)

119

(as they tread helplessly
upon the path of revenge.)

120
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,660
(Are you willing to let that happen?)

121
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,260
(I don't believe so.)

122
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,900
The only way is to get rid of all drugs!

123
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,620
You can understand this.

124
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,100
You should understand this.

125
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,220
Mr. Wan,

126
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,740
come on.

127
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,740
Let's celebrate the occasion.

128
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,780
Mr. Wan.

129
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,860
Before we proceed,

130
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,620
I have a question for you.

131
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,860
Do you not trust me?

132
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,340
Or are you just trying to use me?

133
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,700
I don't trust you?

134
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,540
Why would I ask Kun

135
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,900
to meet you at Shengjiang if I didn't?

136
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,100
Use you?

137
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,420
Mr. Wan, you're overthinking it.

138
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,580
I was just afraid that Mengka
would put you on the spot.

139
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,020
At least,

140
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,660
you didn't deceive them,

141
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,860
did you?

142
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,820
I was the one who deceived them,

143
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,860
am I right?

144
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,260
According to Hao Dong,

145
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,420
he wants us dead.

146
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,540
He wants Mengka to express a stand

147
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,620
regarding what happened three years ago.

148
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
He already knew that Li Linfan's death

149
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,500
was related to us.

150
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,820
I have plenty of goods

151
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,260
that I cannot sell.

152
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,340
What should we do?

153
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,180
If Mr. Yu wants to sell them,

154
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,460
we have to pass by the path owned by Hao Dong.

155
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,700
If he wanted to find someone

156
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,540
to bear the responsibility for Li Linfan's death,

157
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,580
the only scapegoat

158
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,460
would be me.

159
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,540
Ms. Qiong,

160
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,420
if that day does arrive,

161
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,940
what should I do then?

162
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,060
What's in it for you

163
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,940
for doing so?

164
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,740
They refused to listen to me.

165
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,340
I'd already

166
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,300
cut my ties with them three years ago.

167
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,740
Does he truly not understand what's going on?

168
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,540
Or does he take me for a fool?

169
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,180
Mr. Wan,

170
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,380
if I were you,

171
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,140
I would keep a distance from Mengka.

172

513
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,390
What the heck?

514
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Do you even know how to drive?

515
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,840
Hey, come down!

516
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,870
Chen Yu!

517
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,150
Chen Yu!

518
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,560
Chen Yu!

519
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,560
Get out of the way!

520
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,280
Chen Yu!

521
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,360
Tongtong!

522
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,390
Run!

523
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,910
Chen Yu!

524
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,320
Chen Yu!

525
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,120
Tongtong!

526
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,800
Hong!

527
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,600
The cops are here!

528
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,390
The cops are here!

529
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,190
Don't touch her!

530
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,280
The cops are here.

531
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,320
Do you know what to say?

532
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,470
I do.

533
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,670
Where did you get the drug?

534
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,840
The drug?

535
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,120
You got it from him!

536
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,000
Remember that?

537
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,710
Yes!

538
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,360
Dong, we're in trouble!

539
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
The girl who took the drug

540
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,840
set herself on fire.

541
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,600
Run then!

542
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,040
Run away!

543
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,360
Mengmeng!

544
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,190
Let's go!

545
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,040
Let's go!

546
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,190
Sir!

547
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,280
The burning of the tea factory

548
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,520
has nothing to do with me!

549
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,390
It truly has nothing to do with me!

550
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,120
Lin Dezan,

551
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,040
so you knew about this long ago.

552
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,670
Yang,

553
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,040
I...

554
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,500
My tea factory was burned down.

555
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,220
And you were already monitoring it long ago.

556
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,940
Wait, it's...

557
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,420
What is going on?

558
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,020
Police!

559
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,060
Get out of the way!

560
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,220
Police!

561
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,140
This is a raid!

562
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,460
Everyone, sit down!

563
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,380
All of you, sit down!

564
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,020
Hurry!

565
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,980
Chief Liu, you're here?

566
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,860
What's going on?

567
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,740
We came here immediately

568
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,700
after receiving a report.

569
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,340
From the victim's belongings

570
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,540
to the Yaba and drug-like capsules

571
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,820
we discovered on the scene,

572
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,060
we suspect it's a drug-related crime.

573
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,140
That's why we contacted you guys.

574
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,500
Chief Liu,

575
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,780
Chen Yu is inside Room 313.

576
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,620
Chen Yu is here?

577
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
We were preparing the drinks

578
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,300
for our customers in the room

579
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,460
when a fight broke out.

580
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,540
Chief Liu.

581
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,420
When I came here,

582
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,260
I saw a man and a woman

583
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,940
lying there.

584
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,380
Chen Yu,

585
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,900
what are you doing here?

586
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,980
Chief Liu,

587
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,660
Yang Ling was helping me locate Wan Mengmeng.

588
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,780
Wan Mengmeng?

589
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,460
That's right.

590
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,140
I wanted to prove
that Wan Mengmeng was taking drugs.

591
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,020
This way,

592
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,340
I can investigate Wan Heda officially.

593
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,700
Why didn't you tell us then?

594
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,500
Why didn't you tell us beforehand?

595
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,420
Chief Liu.

596
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
Chief Liu, come here for a second.

597
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,540
Chief Liu,

598
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,300
our men found Yaba

599
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,380
and these capsules on Chen Yu's jacket.

600
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,260
Who?

601
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,980
Chen Yu.

602
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,940
Chief Liu,

603
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,660
this is the manager.

604
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,740
He called the police.

605
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,260
This is the witness.

606
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,980
Were you here when the crime happened?

607
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,140
That's right.

608
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,460
Where did you find this drug?

609
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,700
I found it on the jacket

610
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,580
of that guy in Room 313.

611
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,020
You're spouting nonsense, aren't you?

612
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,180
Do you believe that I'll send you to prison?

613
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,460
I saw it myself.

614
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,340
I know he's a cop.

615
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,020
He said there are more of them in his house.

616
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,220
You guys can search his house
if you don't believe me.

617
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,740
Did you take this drug?

618
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,380
No.

619
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,580
Who else knows

620
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,620
that you went to that place?

621
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,380
Some of my friends.

622
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,700
Who else?

623
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,260
And...

624
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,020
Wu Zhenfeng's...

625
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,820
Wu Zhenfeng's friend, who is working as a cop.

626
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,860
Who did you say?

627
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,700
Wu Zhenfeng's

628
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,420
police buddy?

629
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,180
Are you sure about that?

630
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,180
I'm not sure.

631
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,900
I just heard it

632
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,620
from Man and the rest.

633
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,580
If the cops question you,

634
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,100
you must say

635
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,220
that you were there just to have fun.

636
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,540
Do not

637
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,820
give yourself away.

638
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,820
If not, they'll follow

639
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,860
the lead

640
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,820
and track down your dad

641
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,780
or me,

642
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,420
understood?

643
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,900
Let's go.

644
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,100
Everyone,

645
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,620
let's head to Mixiang Cafe.

646
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,900
Bring Jiang Yizhe to the detention center.

647
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,900
Yes, sir.

648
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,260
Yang,

649
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,900
I didn't know this would happen

650
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,180
to the tea factory.

651
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,100
Hello?

652
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,940
What?

653
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,780
Say that again?

654
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,340
Something happened.

655
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,740
As the investigation

656
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,500
on Yundian Disco is still ongoing

657
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,380
and Chen Yu

658
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,660
has intruded upon Wanlutong Logistics
without permission,

659
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,340
I hereby announce

660
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,180
that from today onward,

661
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,660
Chen Yu,

you have to pull out of this case

663
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,620
to avoid arousing suspicion.
