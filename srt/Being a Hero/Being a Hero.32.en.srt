Yang Xingquan entered
the border together with Yang Ling.

at the same location as Chen Yu.

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
They've entered the jungle.

Don't move!

Twenty minutes.

19

This is the final step.

20

106

It's still unclear where they'll be picked up.

110
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,280
All right.

111
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,440
Head to Hui's place

112
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,640

is covered by thick plants.

177

It's easy for drug dealers to conceal themselves.

They're armed.

I don't think you have the right to do so.

446
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,870
Back then, did you truly provide us

447

with intel

448
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,420
because you wanted to crack down
on the drug syndicates?

449
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,630
You used me.

450
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,110
You used me

451
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,110
to conceal the fact that you were a drug smuggler.

Was it drugs?

458
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,390
What do drugs represent?

459
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,630
They represent desire.

460
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,430
They represent your greedy desire.

461
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,430
It's the reason

462

behind your evil behavior.
