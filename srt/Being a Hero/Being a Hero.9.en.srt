If Wu Zhenfeng

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,140
is looking for that casino,

5
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,100
then it must be related to K,

6
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,780
and to drugs, by extension.

7
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,310
We caught them twice, but we found no drug.

8
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,100
That means they are quick

with their reflexes.

10
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,390
If you want evidence,

11
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,460
you have to plan an ambush ahead,

12

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,460
After you gather evidence,

15
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,740
the casino's involvement and the volume of drugs

16
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,990
can be proven.

17
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,350
Only then we can take action.

18
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,460
The casino now only admits regulars.

19
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,860
Gathering evidence will be difficult.

20

We have people

347
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,170
Not everyone is here yet.

348
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,410
I'm responsible for what happened this morning.

349
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,580
Chen Yu came to me.

350
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,050
He told me to let Wu Zhenfeng

351
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,820
stay at his place.

352
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,900
I did not stop him.

353
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,610
This morning,

354
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,260
I already told Chen Yu clearly

355
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,340
what I think of it.

356
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,380
Chen Yu

357
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,700
can be hot-headed,

358
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,820
but he is loyal.

359
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,730
He loves Lingling.

360
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,410
He won't let any harm come her way.

361
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,530
How can you be so sure of it?

362
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,170
Lin Dezan.

363
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,530
Tell me. How can you be so sure of it?

364
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,020
It's drugs we're talking about.

365
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,290
Don't you understand?

366
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,820
Forget about them two.

367
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,650
If something happens,
can you deal with the consequences?

368
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,970
I can tell, you know.

369
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,530
You want to fish out info

370
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,260
from Wu Zhenfeng.

371
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,700
You want him to work for you.

372
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,490
But that's not up to me.

373
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,170
He has his conditions.

374
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,460
Like he...

375
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,580
Like me.

376
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,020
This morning,

377
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,650
you said you trust me.

378
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,020
I'll chug it.

379
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,700
I don't trust you.

380
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,580
I trust Chen Yu.

381
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,010
And don't get me wrong.

382
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,650
I'm not helping you.

383
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm helping Chen Yu.

384
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,530
If this concerns you in any way,

385
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,530
then it would be because Chen Yu once told me

386
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
that you are an orphan too.

387
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,370
But Chen Yu,

388
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,370
my trust has a limit.

389
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,050
This morning,

390
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,370
Yaba was found in my shop.

391
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,890
You can't possibly blame my dad for being so upset.

392
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,050
Do you know

393
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,010
why my dad hates drugs this much?

394
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,700
Twenty years ago,

395
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,170
my dad reported a drug dealer to Uncle Lin.

396
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,370
And the price

397
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,940
was my mom's death

398
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,170
and ten years

399
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,740
of exile.

I couldn't keep Lingling company.

What I owe her

Think carefully.

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,170
It's the drug dealer

My dad will have none of it either.

I don't care if what happened this morning

432
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,260
was a result of framing or what.

433
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,210
I don't want it

434
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,260
to happen in my shop

ever again.

436
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,330
Chen Yu has done so much

437
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,540
for you.

438
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
If you still have any

good conscience left in you,

440
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,090
you won't let this

441

happen again.

442
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,020
Your dad is lucky, actually.

443
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,660
I mean it.

444
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,540
At least someone can prove

445
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
his innocence.

446
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,090
At least he could come back alive.

447
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,410
But what about my dad?

448
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,330
Has any one of you

449
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,740
ever tried

450
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,050
to prove his innocence?

451
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
No one.

452
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,540
Because you think

453
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,860
you're the cops

454
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,690
and my dad is the drug dealer!

455
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,780
He deserves to die.

456
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,290
He deserves to go to hell!

457
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,330
What then?

458
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,740
All these years,

459
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,660
did your dad

460
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,020
ever avenge your mom?

461
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,930
How?

462
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,450
By committing a crime?

463
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,380
With vigilantism?

464
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,410
Not only will you make it harder

465
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,330
to clear your dad's name,

466
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,260
but you'll even smear it.

467
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,540
What happened this morning is a prime example.

468
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,740
They can plant Yaba

469
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,860
whenever they want.

470
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,810
How are you supposed to track it?

471
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,210
Do you have enough lives to track it?

472
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,740
Your dad didn't die.

473
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,570
I will try everything!

474
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,450
Wu Zhenfeng!

475
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,210
This is no way to solve a problem.

476
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,380
You can't do anything alone.

477

you know.

you said Wu Zhenfeng

492
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,210
was dealing drugs in the morning.

493
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,930
Three years ago,

494
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,780
after he was rescued in Mengka,

495
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,050
he was kept there as a coolie.

496
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,290
He knows how to fight,

497
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,660
so he was enlisted into the guerillas.

498
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,570
Did he deal drugs?

499
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,410
I don't know.

500
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,050
But that place is closely associated

501
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,330
with drugs.

502
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,620
Although nothing there indicates

503
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,690
that he dealt drugs...

504
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,170
he was there for three years.

505
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,810
No one could walk out untarnished.

506
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
What about his connections?

507
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,540
Who from the outside

508
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,780
did he contact often?

509
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,020

Mengmeng.

690
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,490
I have to use the toilet.

691
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,210
Turn left over there.

692
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,020
Go.

693
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,210
Hit him!

694
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:30,930
Hit him!

695
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,340
Punch him.

696
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,620
Come on!

697
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,020
Hit it!

698
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,450
Chief Liu.

699
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:44,340
Chief Liu.

700
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:45,730
Lan Anran.

701
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,210
We are in position.

702
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,730
Be extra careful now.

703
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,930
Film anything that proves

704
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:50,580
drug trafficking.

705
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,540
Yes, sir.

706
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:52,930
Anran.

707
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,340
Wu Zhenfeng is in the arena too.

708
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,580
Beware.

709
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,820
Wu Zhenfeng?

710
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,410
Roger that.

711
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,140
Chief Liu.

712
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,340
I found a house.

713
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,410
It's guarded by four people.

714
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,780
They might be hiding their drugs

715
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,730
and money in there.

716
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,410
I'll try to get in.

717
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,140
Stay vigilant.

718
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,860
Has Wu Zhenfeng appeared?

719
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,650
Not at the moment.

720
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,620
Lan Anran.

721
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,860
What are you doing?

722
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,300
I'm looking for the toilet.

723
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,380
I said

724
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
the toilet is on the left.

725
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,540
That way?

726
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,140
Yes.

727
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,730
Don't wander off.

728
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,490
It's dangerous.

729
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,300
I can't go there?

730
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,210
You can't.

731
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,410
My friends. The match is about to begin.

732
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,140
Place your bet if you haven't already.

733
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,540
Don't miss your chance to be rich.

734
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,020
Now, let's invite

735
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,650
both fighters for the next round

736
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,140
to the stage.

737
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,930
Go! Go!

738
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,100
Go! Go!

739
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,170
Go! Go!

740
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,410
Go for it!

741
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,250
What is Wu Zhenfeng trying to do?

742
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,170
Go! Go!

743
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,210
Come on!

744
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,490
Go for it!

745
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,170
Go! Go!

746
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,380
Go! Go!

747
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,580
Come on!

748
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:11,690
Feng!

749
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,930
Feng!

750
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,690
All the best.

751
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,780
-Feng.
-Hit him!

752
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,690
Did you find Shu?

753
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,170
There are so many people here.

754
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,540
I did a round. I didn't find him.

755
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,410
Drink some water first.

756
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,170
Find him.

757
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,540
Lan Anran.

758
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,300
Pay attention to Wu Zhenfeng.

759
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,730
I'll give you orders later.

760
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,650
Good.

761
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,620
Bravo.

762
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,170
Who brought that person in?

763
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,490
Shu.

764
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,820
Hai brought him in.

765
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,540
I don't know him.

766
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,890
Kill him.

767
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,380
Don't let him get off the ring alive.

768
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
I told you.

769
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,650
Go for it!

770
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,730
Nice hit.

771
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:53,890
Feng.

772
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,690
Feng. Stop fighting.

773
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,490
Did you find him?

774
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,820
He's in the cabin right there.

775
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,690
Can you see it?

776
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,540
That one.

777
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,020
Lan Anran.

778
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,340
What is Wu Zhenfeng looking at?

779
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,450
Show me the image now!

780
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,210
Go! Go!

781
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,780
Bowen, zoom in.

782
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,340
Still not clear.

783
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,890
Closer.

784
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,540
Chief Liu, it's too far.

785
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,170
Listen.

786
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,140
The police have laid their ambush here.

787
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,860
The police?

788
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:46,970
Ambush?

789
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,490
If they catch you,

790
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,210
tell them

791
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,890
you brought me here for the match.

792
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,380
You don't know anything else.

793
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,410
You got it?

794
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,650
Shu.

795
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,450
What happened?

796
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,730
Stop the match.

797
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:01,860
Stop it?

798
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,210
But everyone has placed their bet.

799
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,380
The people you brought in

800
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,970
are here to make a scene.

801
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,450
They are here for me.

802
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,820
Bring the guy here.

803
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,170
Calm down, Shu.

804
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,340
I'll do it now.

805
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,250
Right away.

806
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,580
Stop fighting.

807
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,780
You'll die, Feng.

808
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,380
Start!

809
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,780
Stop!

810
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,730
This round doesn't count.

811
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,620
Why?

812
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,650
Those who have placed their bet

813
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,930
can come to me for a refund.

814
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,410
Mengmeng.

815
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,930
I'll check out the person I placed my bet on
for the next round.

816
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,140
Return quickly.

817
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,970
Don't wander off.

818
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,860
Don't worry.

819
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,930
Hurry. Return the money!

820
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,930
Return our money!

821
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,020
Refund double the amount!

822
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,780
Refund!

823
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,540
Follow me.

824
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,490
My boss wants to see you.

825
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,140
Wu Zhenfeng.

826
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,930
I have been looking for you.

827
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,250
You came here yourself instead.

828
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,650
It's been three years.

829
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,890
You still remember my name.

830
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,170
Educate him.

831
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,620
Wait.

832
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,540

833
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,100
