00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,820
Li Zhengqiang.

4
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,580
Now you know

5
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,820
who runs Yunhe.

6
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,940
Dong.

7
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,300
I... I was wrong.

8
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,580
P-Please forgive me.

9
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,460
Zhang,

10
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,660
tell our people to get the goods.

11
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,580
Come here.

12
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,900
Take all these.

13
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,780
Do... Dong.

14
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,980
Dong.

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,540
We...

16
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,500
We can work together.

17
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,940
Let's split

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,700
the profit fifty-fifty.

19
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,980
Fifty-fifty.

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,620
Give me the formula

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,180
and I'll let you go.

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,020
If I give you the formula,

23
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,140
will you still let me live?

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,940
Go on.

25
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,780
Dong.

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,020
The police are coming this way.

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,580
Dong.

28
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,860
Let me go,

29
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,900
then we all get to live.

30
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,220
Dong!

31
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,460
Dong!

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,820
Dong!

33
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,020
Go.

34
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,100
He's dead?

35
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,820
Yes.

36
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,140
We haven't brought Li Zhengqiang to justice,

37
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,580
which means we can't be sure
about the Yellow Capsules.

38
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,940
Continue investigating.

39
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,820
Start from the goods lost in the warehouse.

40
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,580
Come in.

41
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,420
Take a seat.

42
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,940
[Chen Liwen, Deputy Chief of the General Brigade]
I've heard about what happened to Li Zhengqiang.

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,180
Deputy Chief Chen,

44
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,780
Kaihua was just briefing me about it.

45
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,820
The death of Li Zhengqiang

46
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,100
is believed to be the result
of a gang fight for now.

47
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,340
Huang Wenlin confessed

48
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,620
that on the night of the 9th,

49
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,660
Wu Zhenfeng found him at the food stalls,

50
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,620
claiming that he came from Mengka

51
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,460
to do business with K.

52
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,580
The new drugs created

53
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,020
by Li Zhengqiang and others

54
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,180
affected K's profits

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,100
in the drugs market of Yunhe.

56
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,780
So the person that took the rest

57
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,700
of the drugs from the warehouse

58
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,900
could most likely be K.

59
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,900
We conducted a preliminary investigation

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,300
on the scene of Li Zhengqiang's death,

61
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,460
and found callus on Li Zhengqiang's

62
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,740
middle finger of the left hand,

63
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,340
which implies that he was left-handed.

64
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,100
This matches with

65
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,980
the results of our inquest

66
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,020
at the scene of Hu Qingshan's death.

67
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,100
With the confession of Huang Wenlin,

68
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,820
we could almost be sure

69
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,140
that the killer of Hu Qingshan was Li Zhengqiang.

70
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,940
Then what do you

71
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,140
plan to do next?

72
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,420
We only have

73
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,420
Huang Wenlin and Wu Zhenfeng now,

74
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,420
from whom we can't get

75
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,740
any more information.

76
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,660
Wu Zhenfeng.

77
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,420
Wu Zhenfeng is our breach.

78
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,220
According to Huang Wenlin,

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,740
Wu Zhenfeng came back to Yunhe

80
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,220
in search of K.

81
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,380
Thus, we have reasons to believe

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,020
there's still a lot that he hasn't told us.

83
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,500
How long have we

84
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,300
kept Wu Zhenfeng here with us?

85
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,340
Is it time to release him yet?

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,980
Director Lin, we can't let him go.

87
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,380
We are understaffed.

88
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,420
And we know so little

89
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,300
about Wu Zhenfeng.

90
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,860
If he leaves, we won't be able to monitor him.

91
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,460
Kaihua,

92
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,340
you call

93
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,180
Director Zhao

94
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,620
and I'll sign the papers.

95
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,900
Let's move him to the rehab center.

96
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,580
But

97
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,780
according to Leng Feng,

98
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,580
the doses Wu Zhenfeng used

99
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,060
isn't enough for us
to put him into the rehab center.

100
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,540
He's done drugs after all.

101
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
Figure something out.

102
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,060
Under the current circumstances,

103
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,660
this seems to be the only way.

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:34,940
Right?

105
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,500
Yes.

106
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,900
Kaihua,

107
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,660
do as our leader proposes.

108
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,620
You proposed it.

109
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,980
Also,

110
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,260
tomorrow at the Counter Narcotics Detachment,

111
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,500
hold a conference.

112
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm going back to the provincial detachment soon.

113
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,060
So I'd like to hear about your plans

114
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,180
to investigate this case

115
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,020
at the conference.

116
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,620
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,860
Director Lin,

118
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,820
is this appropriate?

119
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,540
Do you have any other solutions?

120
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,260
[Wu Zhenfeng]

121
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,420
Erliang, listen to me.

122
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,100
I know a gangster

123
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,980
who used to work for K.

124
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,460
He stole some goods from Dong,

125
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,020
and now he

126
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,100
is in the rehab center.

127
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
I want to look for him in there.

128
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,700
(I sent Bones)

129

(to find people working for K.)

130
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,580
(But unfortunately, K set him up)

131
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,940
(and put him in the rehab center.)

132

(You can go to him once you get in there.)

133
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,100
(See if he'll be able to help you.)

134
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,020
Thank you.

135
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,420
What for?

136
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,820
At least, you helped me prove

137
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
that I wasn't a murderer.

138
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,220
Huang Wenlin is guilty
for making and dealing drugs.

139
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,660
Arresting him

140
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,540
is part of my job as people's police.

141
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,740
Sitting with you like this

142
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,060
reminds me of what happened

143
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,540
three years ago on that car

144
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,580
in Walin Town.

145
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,780
Three years ago,

146
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,020
we weren't in a car like this.

147
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,060
Three years ago,

148
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,460
you weren't in handcuffs either.

149
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,340
Three years ago, I went after you.

150
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,980
If you had come back with me then,

151
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,940
you wouldn't be like this now.

152
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,380
No matter what,

153
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,780
I owe you an apology.

154
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,820
For what?

155
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,580
For what I've put you through in these three years.

156
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,180
Because of me,

157
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,460
you were transferred
to a regional police station.

158
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,980
The things I've been through?

159
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,180
Frankly,

160
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,700
having worked as a grassroots police

161

all kinds of people,

163
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,340
I've become better at judging people.

164
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,380
A drug dealer or not,

165
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,020
I can easily tell.

166
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,660
You are still the same person I know.

167
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,060
Nothing has changed.

168
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,260
What do you mean?

169
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,300
You've been convinced that I'm a drug dealer.

170
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,060
Your brain has made the whole story

171
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,660
flawless and logical in your mind.

172
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,540

Okay.

Did you do it?

No.

did for you when you were a kid?

I begged you to do for me.

for your father's innocence?

00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,140
who sells small does.

344
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,260
Otherwise,

345
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,100
I wouldn't have let him

346
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
find information for me.

347
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,620
Only after you find out the truth

348
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,500
about the Yellow Capsules
can you clear your name.

349
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,700
During the arrest in Moyun Bar,

350
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,260
Chen Yu and Anran didn't report to you.

351
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,900
Doesn't that feel weird to you?

352
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,340
Don't you think

353
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,340
it's because you found nothing in Ba's pharmacy?

354
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:28,980
Yes.

355
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,620
My way of working was wrong.

356
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,540
Let me ask you.

357
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,940
If something really

358
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,420
had happened during yesterday's arrest,

359
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,420
how would you explain it?

360
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,380
Sir.

361
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,140
After what happened yesterday,

362
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,540
Yunhe Public Security Bureau

363
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,500
should carry out organizational

364
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,460
and disciplinary education,

365
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,980
and implement internal rectification.

366
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,740
Rectification?

367
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,220
How much of K's Yaba

368
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,460
got out from here every year?

369
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,500
Do you know?

370
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,060
Didn't you say

371
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,180
that you had plans?

372
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,060
What were your plans?

373
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,580
Fine.

374
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,300
Even if Ba was your informer,

375
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,500
he was just a small dealer,

376
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,140
do you think a small dealer like him

377
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,580
had the access to the core of K?

378
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,100
But the Yellow Capsules

379
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,020
must be related to

380
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,980
their core benefit.

381
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,740
Li Zhengqiang's death

382
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,820
proved it.

383
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,900
Deputy Chief Chen,

384
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,260
my original plan

385
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,540
was to get to the bottom of K Group

386
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,820
through the key figures

387
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,900
of the Yellow Capsules.

388
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,420
That could be a breach.

389
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,780
Please trust me.

390
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,900
I, Lin Dezan,

391
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,140
am an experienced policeman.

392
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,100
This breach

393
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,380
could let me catch all

394
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,100
of them.

395
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,540
It's been three years, Lin Dezan.

396
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,180
Three years.

397
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,060
K showed up in Yunhe three years ago.

398
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,380
Since then, how much Yaba

399
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,740
has been delivered to Hong Kong, to everywhere?

400
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,100
This is a huge drug-making

401
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,740
and trafficking group and network.

402
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
Aren't you aware of that?

403
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,140
Chen Yu.

404
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,500
I was too harsh on you today.

405
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,820
Please forgive me.

406
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,540
Which part was harsh?

407
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,860
I shouldn't have said to the leaders

408
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,020
that you were eager for merits.

409
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,740
Then what should you say?

410
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,900
Chen Yu.

411
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,060
That's enough.

412
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,100
Here.

413
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,780
Yang Yi,

414
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,220
I can be honest with you.

415
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,540
Tell him, Lan Anran.

416
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,060
What did you find in Ba Peng's pharmacy

417
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,540
that day?

418
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,100
Chen Yu,

419
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,900
are you serious?

420
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,900
I prepared some sweet dumplings.

421
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,220
I'll go check if they're done.

422
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,980
Lan Anran

423
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,740
checked the surveillance footage

424
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,020
of the day we went to the pharmacy.

425
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,900
Right on that noon,

426
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,380
Director Lin

427
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,540
went there.

428
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,980
And I found that the pharmacy's bag

429
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,500
on his desk.

430
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,900
Wu Zhenfeng also confessed

431
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,060
that the pharmacy was involved with drugs.

432
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,220
Then why there was nothing

433
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,060
when we got there?

434
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,540
Who leaked the intel?

435
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,580
Tell me.

436
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,540
You

437
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,860
suspect that Director Lin did it?

438
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,580
You are capable of catching drug dealers.

439
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,740
These years, you've arrested

440
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,980
quite a lot of them.

441
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,500
Three years ago,

442
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,660
because of your thorough plan

443
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,020
in the Li Linfan Case,

444
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,220
the provincial detachment gave you a prize.

445
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,980
Thus you got the chance

446
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,980
to be transferred to

447
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,060
the Provincial Counter Narcotics Detachment.

448
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,340
Do you remember?

449
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,700
I do.

450
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,820
Your kid is studying at the university
in the provincial capital.

451
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
And we also helped

452
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,340
your wife find a job

453
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,300
and get transferred

454
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,620
to the provincial capital.

455
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,620
You two have been living apart

456
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,020
for three years.

457
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,500
Your work is important.

458
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,340
But your wife, your kid,

459
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,180
and your family life matter just as much.

460
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,260
Right?

461
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,380
Deputy Chief Chen,

462
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,420
where is this conversation going?

463
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,020
Why did you choose to stay in Yunhe?

464
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,180
(If you have any doubts,)

465
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,060
(you can go ask Director Lin directly.)

466
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,820
(Just based on speculation,)

467
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,700
(you two acted without authorization.)

468
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,220
(How could I...)

469
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
(Do you know how dangerous it was?)

470
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,220
(How do I ask him?)

471
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,500
(I just go straight to him)

472
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,900
(and ask him if he was protecting Ba Peng?)

473
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,220
(No.)

474
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,220
(If you suspect Director Lin like this,)

475
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,780
(what does that make of
Yunhe Public Security Bureau?)

476
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,460
(Tell me, who should I trust?)

477
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,700
At least, I can no longer trust him

478
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,060
because of what happened
the day before yesterday.

479
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,260
Are you done yet?

480
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,100
Now...

481
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,740
I heard you

482
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,380
talking about Uncle Lin.

483
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,940
I don't know what happened

484
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,980
between you.

485
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,020
And I don't know what you saw.

486
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,900
I only know

487
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,260
that Uncle Lin is a good person.

488
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,660
A good policeman.

489
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,940
[Welfare Center]

490
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,340
(My mother was killed by drug dealers)

491
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,180
(and my father fled abroad.)

492
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,420
(No one was there for me for ten years.)

493
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,820
(Except Uncle Lin.)

494
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Why aren't you playing

495
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,940
with your friends?

496
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,980
Your favorite nougat.

497
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,340
Uncle,

498
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,980
did you find my dad?

499
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,820
If

500
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,660
I haven't found your dad,

501
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,060
from now on, from today on,

502
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,140
let me be your dad, okay?

503
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,020
It's my birthday today.

504
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,580
This is your birthday gift.

505
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,820
Could you accompany me to play on a swing?

506
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,020
(Later,)

507
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,740
(I met my brother in the welfare center.)

508
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,900
(Just because I regarded him as my brother,)

509
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,940
Uncle Lin also took care of him.

510
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,140
You can be mad at my brother

511
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,460
for hurting your feelings today.

512
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,260
