bury them together.

342
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,050
I didn't do that to help you.

343
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,090
When I was a kid,

344
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,930
your parents took really good care of me.

345
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,930
This is what I should do.

346
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,410
According to Huang Wenlin,

347
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,210
you left Mengka and came back here

348
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,620
so that you could make a deal with K.

349
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,290
Li Shougui and Du Hai also said

350
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,260
that you wanted to work with Shu.

351
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,660
Is there anything

352
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,540
you want to tell me?

353
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,570
Uncle.

354
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,260
Are you

355
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,860
at Nancheng Bus Stop?

356
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,980
My friend saw you there.

357
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,260
Before we have any solid evidence

358
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,860
to prove

359
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,210
that your dad is innocent,

360
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,500
we can't

361
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,540
exculpate him.

362
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,780
(We will never)

363
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,740
(wrong a good man,)

364
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,450
(but we'll also never)

365
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,620
(let a bad guy go.)

366
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,290
Do you think

367
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,140
my dad was good or bad?

368
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,020
I'm still trying to find out,

369
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,050
but all I've got so far are just some minor clues.

370
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,410
I haven't managed to find any solid evidence.

371
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,330
I can't form

372
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,570
a complete chain of evidence

373
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,380
to prove your dad's innocence yet.

374
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:19,690
Thank you.

375
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,050
You must have visited them very frequently

376
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,020
in the past three years.

377
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,210
How clean the tomb is.

378
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,980
Thank you so much.

379
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,090
Wu Zhenfeng.

380
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,090
I know you want to avenge your parents' death,

381
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
but you're in grave danger

382
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,290
because you're getting more and more extreme.

383
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,210
You need us to help you.

384
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,380
Stop working on this.

385
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,210
The longer the investigation goes on,

386
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,860
the more dangerous it is for you.

387
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,020
Over the past three years,

388
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,140
I've learned that the closer you get to the truth,

389
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,620
the more dangerous it will get.

390
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,410
Exactly because it's dangerous,

391
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,900
you need our help even more.

392
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,290
You...

393
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,540
Are you sure

394
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,740
there's nothing wrong with your team?

395
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:38,980
Lei.

396
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,020
I'm at the cemetery.

397
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,810
There's someone beside him.

398
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,330
It's the policeman, Chen Yu.

399
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,210
Don't do anything there.

400
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,980
Keep following them.

401
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,860
Got it.

402
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,210
I'm sure Dong is trying to figure out a way

403
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,330
to get rid of us.

404
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,500
Dong is a very powerful man at Yunhe.

405
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,290
Feng.

406
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,980
What are you actually planning to do?

407
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,860
I've asked you the same questions many times,

408
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,980
but you never told me anything.

409
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,050
You are making me

410
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,900
really nervous.

411
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,290
From now on, you'll just do whatever I say.

412
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,020
You only have to enjoy life

413
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,410
and worry about nothing else.

414
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,290
I came back to Yunhe

415
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,410
to be the Drug King.

416
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,690
Feng.

417
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,540
All of us

418
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,380
will listen to you from now on.

419
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,140
-Hui.
-Hui.

420
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:00,780
Are you all right?

421
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,380
What are you doing?

422
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,860
Feng!

423
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,410
Feng!

424
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,690
Lei?

425
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,900
Are you working for Dong?

426
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,810
Leave Yunhe now.

427
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,330
Dong will never see you.

428
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,660
Let's go.

429
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,660
Feng.

430
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,380
Run, Feng.

431
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,620
After them.

432
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,620
Take the back alley.

433
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,410
Wu Zhenfeng.

434
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,740
I'm telling you.

435
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,170
You won't be able to leave Yunhe

436
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,410
even if you kill me today.

437
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,210
Do it if you don't trust me.

438
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,210
Call Dong now.

439
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,810
Do you want to talk to Dong?

440
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
Who do you think you are?

441
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,090
Shu was working for you.

442
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,570
You said that you kept his mom here,

443
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,540
yet the police took her away.

444
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,980
What did you promise me?

445
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,690
What did you promise me?

446
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,930
Tell you what.

447
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,810
The person he rats out has to be silenced.

448
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,020
This is the rule.

449
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,800
[Dong]

450
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,900
[Lei]

451
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,930
If you can't silence him,

452
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,210
I'll make sure you never get to talk again.

453
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,540
Dong.

454
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,620
Lei is calling.

455
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,450
Hey.

456
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Dong.

457
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,810
Wu Zhenfeng.

458
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,090
Wu Zhenfeng?

459
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
You did everything

460
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,900
just to hide from me.

461
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Are you scared of me?

462
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,690
Let Jiang Lei go,

463
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,780
and you can go back to Mengka alive.

464
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,140
Sure.

465
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,660
But before I leave,

466
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,170
I'll hand this man

467
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,570
to the police.

468
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,740
Just like what I did to the boxing casino.

469
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,450
Wu Zhenfeng.

470
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,570
Is that a threat?

471
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,050
Dong.

472
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,260
I'm very familiar

473
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,170
with the Counter Narcotics Detachment.

474
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,540
Do you want to bet?

475
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,540
Let's meet up, then.

476
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,380
Where did Wu Zhenfeng go?

477
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,170
It seems like the guy who hit us

478
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,170
kidnapped him.

479
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,170
Do you know the guy

480
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,170
who kidnapped him?

481
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,090
I don't.

482
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,570
Who do you think he is?

483
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,450
Probably someone who works for Dong.

484
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,050
Dong?

485
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,140
The guy in K.

486
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,140
Do you know Dong?

487
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,050
I don't.

488
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,450
Li Shougui.

489
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,690
Wu Zhenfeng went to the rehab center

490
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,780
to look for you, right?

491
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,500
You brought him to the boxing casino too.

492
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,810
You were also the one who bought him
all the boxing gear.

493
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:49,930
Say it.

494
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,090
Why did Wu Zhenfeng go to you?

495
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,980
When we were there,

496
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,450
Wu Zhenfeng told me

497
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,860
that he wanted to meet Dong.

498
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,740
He wanted me to bring him to Dong.

499
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,450
But I don't know Dong personally.

500
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,780
All I know is that he has a boxing casino.

501
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,980
He told me,

502
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,380
turn the boxing casino upside down

503
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,980
and Dong would go to him instead.

504
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,900
Why was Wu Zhenfeng looking for Dong?

505
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,540
I have no idea.

506
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,570
By the way,

507
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,260
when we were having lamb skewers,

508
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,290
Wu Zhenfeng said something

509
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,620
that threw me into fright.

510
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,020
What did he say?

511
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,260
He said he wanted to be the Drug King.

512
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,020
Listen, Li Shougui.

513
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,020
From now on,

514
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
you'll tell me

515
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,660
everything Wu Zhenfeng does,

516
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,660
every person he meets,

517
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,900
and everything he says,

518
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,260
including those he says to you.

519
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,290
Do you understand?

520
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,570
I'm telling you

521
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,740
that we are very positive

522
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,740
that Wu Zhenfeng is involved in a drug crime.

523
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,690
This is your chance,

524
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,050
so don't tell me
that you're not capable of doing it.

525
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,930
I can do this.

526
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,410
Hao Dong!

527
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,330
Hao Dong!

528
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,740
Give it to me.

529
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,860
The thing you got from your dad.

530
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,500
Don't blame me for showing no mercy.

531
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,140
Are you Dong?

532
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,380
Whatever I didn't do three years ago,

533
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,900
I'll do it today.

534
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,330
Do it.

535
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,090
Don't come near me.

536
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:18,780
Dong.

537
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,740
Dong, wait.

538
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,170
It was Erliang who sent me here

539
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,140
to make a deal with you.

540
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,810
Wait, Dong.

541
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,500
His uncle is a policeman.

542
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,740
His uncle is a policeman!

543
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,170
Trust me. I'll kill him.

544
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,780
Wu Zhenfeng.

545
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
You've got the wrong person.

546
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,500
Wu Zhenfeng.

547
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,740
Do you want to make a deal with me?

548
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,580
Let him go first.

549
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,850
Then we'll talk.

550
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,540
Dong.

551
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,690
Don't you have any other tricks?

552
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,370
Erliang sent you here.

553
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,740
Does Mengka have any other tricks?

554
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,210
Dong.

555
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,370
I trust you.

556
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,170
Bullshit.

557
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,260
Even I don't trust myself.

558
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,580
How can you trust me?

559
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,570
[Wu Zhenfeng]

560
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,130
(Over the past three years,)

561
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,580
(I spent every day looking for clues)

(When I was at the boxing casino today)

564

(and saw the guy nicknamed Shu)

(It was my first time)

(getting so close to the truth.)

00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,540
(Stop working on this.)

571
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,260
The closer you get to the truth,

572
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,730
the more dangerous it will get.

573
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,100
(Are you sure)

574
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,210
(there's nothing wrong with your team?)

575
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,780
You went in and out of the rehab center
as you wish.

576
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,450
You moved into the policeman's place

577
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,490
and brought the police to the boxing casino
to wreck the place.

578
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,690
Now, you want to be my business partner.

579
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,860
Since I've met you once,

580
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,060
I will leave your body intact.

581
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,820
The phone!

582
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,170
Dong!

583
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,140
It's from the cop!

584
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,780
Don't you want to know

585
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,250
how I can go in and out
of the Public Security Bureau

586
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,450
as I wish?

587
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:33,890
That's because of the policeman.

588
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,380
He is my childhood friend.

589
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,780
He's with me.

590
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,060
If you kill me today,

591
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,100
you'll not only upset Mengka

592
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,340
but the entire Public Security!

593
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,690
(Hi.)

Do you want to bet?

00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,020
Wu Zhenfeng.

599
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,580
Listen.

600
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,820
Go back to Mengka now,

601
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,690
or I'll do you a favor

602
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,890
by sending your dead body back.

603
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,490
Tell Erliang

604
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,690
that the business has been blown up.

605
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,860
Kill me if you dare.

606
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,020
Come back here.

607
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,340
Come back!

608
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,140
Wu Zhenfeng.

609
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,490
Here's a knife for you.

610
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,250
You can cut off the rope yourself.

611

Jiang Lei.

612
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,250
Don't go.

613
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,780
Jiang Lei, stay here!

614
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,410
Don't leave me.

615
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,930
Don't go!

616
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,020
Hao Dong.

617
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:02,860
Where is Wu Zhenfeng?

618
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,060
Where is he?

619
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:10,690
Is he dead?

620
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:12,890
You...

621
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,340
Did you kill another man?

622
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,380
How are we supposed to keep the business going?

623
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,970
The police will keep their eyes on us.

624
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,490
You...

625
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,930
He's still alive, Mr. Wan.

626
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,780
Hao Dong.

627
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,490
It's been three years

628
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,970
since we last dealt with Mengka.

629
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,580
We can't keep going like this.

630
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,140
This is a business.

631
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,690
All we want is to make money.

632
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,650
Peace brings money.

633
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,650
Mengka knew that I killed Wu Gang,

634
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,100
but they still sent Wu Zhenfeng here

635
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,170
to propose a business deal to me.

636
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,210
What should I do?

637
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,410
He had no means to smuggle the drugs, right?

638
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,100
I'm sure there is too much backlog of goods,

639
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,020
right?

640
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,650
They were trying to make peace.

641
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,450
We can get a 10% more commission

642
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,580
by providing them with the logistics.

643
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Money, money, and money.

644
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,930
When it comes to business,

645
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,820
I have the final say.

646
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,340
How could you talk to me like that?

647
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,930
Your dad never dared talk to me in this manner

648
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,690
when he was still around.

649
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,250
My dad?

650
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,690
Li Linfan?

651
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,890
You were business partners a few years back.

652
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,490
Now, he's dead, but you're still alive.

653
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,410
What are you talking about?

654
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,450
What's that supposed to mean?

655
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,210
When your dad was still around,

656
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,820
all his goods went through the route I picked,

657
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,890
in my vans, and on my boats.

658
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,140
Wu Zhenfeng knows the policeman.

659
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,650
What is their relationship?

660
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,340
I think they are childhood friends.

661
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,100
Otherwise,

662
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,890
how did he get released

663
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,100
from the rehab center so soon?

664
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,930
The policeman even told someone

665
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,140
to send him money.

666
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,970
Are you saying

667
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,380
that Wu Zhenfeng works for the police?
