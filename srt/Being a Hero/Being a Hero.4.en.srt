4
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,380
When did Chen Yu open fire?

5
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,180
What are your doubts?

6

You don't believe him?

7
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,700
I just want to know

8
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,260
why he wasn't on the scene

9
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,380
to arrest you.

10
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,660
What did he ask you?

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,500
It's the normal protocol.

12
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,060
Captain Liu asked the right question, didn't he?

13
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,620
Why the reaction?

14
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,660
Were you

15
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,180
thinking of something else back then?

16
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,340
No.

17
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,100
I wanted to capture him alive.

18
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,620
(Chilis?)

19
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,580
(Just a few.)

20

(No coriander, please.)

21
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,500
Okay.

22
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,300
Madam.

23
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,900
You only have one security camera

24
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,780
facing the pharmacy opposite your house?

25
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,420
Just one.

26
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,260
That pharmacy attracts a belligerent crowd.

27
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Before you came here yesterday afternoon,

28
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,580
they were fighting.

29
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,300
The yogurt drinks you asked.

30
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,020
Thank you.

31

Wu Zhenfeng?

32
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220
Look at the time.

33
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,940
The police station

34
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,020
received the call

35
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,220
at 3:04 PM

36
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,100
and the location of the phone call

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,460
was around Yunhui Pharmacy.

38
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,900
I have reasons to believe

39
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,220
Wu Zhenfeng called the police.

40
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,380
It is possible.

41
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,140
Where were you last night?

42
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,140
In a discontinued chemical factory

43
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,620
within the development zone.

44
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,220
Why were you there?

45
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,500
To get supplies from Ba.

46
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,380
How did you get in touch with him?

47
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,660
I checked. It wasn't from QQ.

48
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,500
Huang Daxian told me to go there.

49
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,220
You reported Bapeng's drugstore

50
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,300
then traded with Huang Daxian.

51
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,900
Did I get it right?

52
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,940
Think again.

53
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,100
If you want to lie,

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,340
go through it in your mind first

55
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,180
before speaking.

56
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,500
Tell us the truth now.

57
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,540
Did you go there to get your supplies?

58
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,500
Madam.

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,220
Where is the toilet?

60
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,940
It's quite far.

61
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,060
Turn right at this junction

62
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,140
and walk 100 meters.

63
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,780
Thank you.

66

we meet?

67
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,100
There were three boxes of burned supplies found

68
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,220
in the trunk.

69
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,620
That's a lot.

70
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,820
A simple deal?

71
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,020
Tell me then.

72
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,180
What kind of deal is that?

73
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,740
I went there to buy some drugs.

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,540
I didn't know

75
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,420
he would carry this much with him.

76
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,780
When I was there,

77
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,540
I realized it was a trap.

78
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,140
He wanted to set me on fire

79
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,260
so I ran.

80
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,300
Ba's death

81
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,540
has nothing to do with me.

82
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,500
Why did Bapeng set you up for a trap?

83
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,540
The day before,

84
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,420
I went to Huang Daxian for supplies.

85
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,100
He refused to sell them to me.

86
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,780
He even asked his subordinates to hit me.

87
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,420
The next day,

88
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,500
I went to the pharmacy
to buy some trauma ointments.

89
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,180
I saw rhubarb capsules

90
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,380
inside Ba's shop

91
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,340
so I reported it.

92
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,780
It was meant to be my payback against Huang Daxian

93
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,620
but then

94
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,020
he suddenly agreed to sell me drugs again.

95
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,540
He told me

96
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,420
to go to that discontinued factory

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,700
at around 9PM

98
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,940
to buy it from Ba.

99
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,700
When I arrived,

100
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,620
Ba told me

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
they planned to frame me

102
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,740
for the death that happened

103

in Weixiang Restaurant.

104
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,300
Why did Huang Daxian

105
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,780
want to frame you?

106
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,500

00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,020
Let's talk about Weixiang Restaurant.

178
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,620
Have you been there?

179
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,140
No.

180
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,740
Do you know him?

181
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,540
No.

182
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,500
I am also looking for it.

183
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,460
It might have broken apart

184
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,580
when I was fighting

185
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,300
Ba.

186
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,380
You have that piece, don't you?

187
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,420
I found this chard

188
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,260
from Hu Qingshan's

189

death scene.

190
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,260
Fix it

191
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,740
and see if it came

192
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,540
from your piece.

193
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,420
Dusan is my buddy

194
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,900
but the death of your father

195
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,460
has nothing to do with me.

196
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,420
You...

197
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,860
Don't tell Dong

198
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,420
that I produced drugs behind his back.

199
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,100
If he knows about it,

200
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,940
I'll die.

201
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,540
I want to see Dong.

202

[Hu Qingshan, Drug Dealer]

203
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,060
If you tell Dong

204
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,940
what I'm doing,

205
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,420
I'll kill you.

206
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,020
I just want to know where Dong is.

207
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,300
So you don't know where he is

208
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,100
as well.

209
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,460
Neither do I.

210
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,540
Leave now!

211
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,980
You think I won't be able

212
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,340
to find him if you don't tell me?

213
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,700
Let's see how long you can hide.

214
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,740
Why?

215
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,140
You want to kill me?

216
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,220
Come.

217

(Do it.)

219

Yes.

220
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,740
I did

221
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,140
go to Weixiang Restaurant that day.

222
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,180
But I didn't kill Hu Qingshan.

223
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,660
Why did you go there then?

224
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,740
To buy drugs.

225
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,540
To buy drugs?

226
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,500
First, you bought it from Huang Daxian.

227
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,140
Then, you bought it from Hu Qingshan.

228
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,820
Who do you think you can fool?

229
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,820
No,

230
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
I'm telling the truth.

231
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,740
I went there for drugs.

232
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,820
We found your fingerprint there.

233
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,540
The result was clear.

234
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,820
Wu Zhenfeng.

235
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,100
Explain.

236
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,460
That night when Hu Qingshan died,

237
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,580
I was drunk.

238
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,820
That night,

239
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,420
I went to Yiming Skewers

240
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,940
on Liugang Bridge to look for Huang Daxian.

241
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,940
I wanted to get some rhubarb capsules.

242
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,820
He didn't entertain me

243
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,660
and asked his subordinates to hit me.

244
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,020
Oh.

245
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,500
He drugged me.

246
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,980
He spiked my drink.

247
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,780
I phased in and out

248
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,740
during that night.

249
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,740
I can't remember everything.

250
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,580
However, I can swear

251
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,660
I didn't kill Hu Qingshan.

252
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,260
Truly.

253
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,940
How did you meet Hu Qingshan?

254
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,860
Do you know he made drugs?

255
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,220
Also,

256
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,900
who are his accomplices?

257
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,780
Sir.

258
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,780

Ba.

261
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,300
I know all of them.

262
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,260
But I never dealt drugs

263
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
nor killed anyone.

264
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,740

your Call for Investigation Assistance

266
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,940
so I turned myself in.

267
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,900
I believe in the government,

268
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,260
believe in the police

269
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,700
to discover the truth.

270
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,500
And I have been cooperative,

271
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,540
have I not?

272
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,020
[Special Investigation Team Office]
We watched the camera footage

273
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
of the Shanxi Noodles Shop

274
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,980
opposite of Yunhui Pharmacy.

275
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,180
We noticed that at 2:40 PM the day

276
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,220
Bapeng was found dead,

277
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
Wu Zhenfeng visited the pharmacy.

278
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,780
When he was there

279
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,620
for 20 minutes,

280
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,380
a brawl broke out.

281
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,460
At 3:03 PM,

282
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,220
he left the pharmacy.

283
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,580
One minute later,

284
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,140
the police station received

285
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,940
the call.

286
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,300
We can confirm that the location

287
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,060
of the phone call

288
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,580
was around Yunhui Pharmacy.

289
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
This can prove that Wu Zhenfeng

290
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,700
did call the police.

291
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
Why would a drug addict

292
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,300
report

293
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,660

294
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,380
Also,

295
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,220
how did he meet Hu Qingshan?

296
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,700
He didn't tell us about it.

297
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,100
After I interrogated him,

298
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,460
I believe the reason he came back

299
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,140
and did all these

300
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,620
was related to the death of his father

three years ago.

I once suggested combining both cases...

303
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,260
Of course, he wouldn't

304
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,980
tell you everything.

305
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,140
We have arrested drug addicts before.

306
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,980
As long as we can't locate their drugs,

307
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,180
they will deny everything.

308
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,460
They will make themselves

309
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
look as favorable

310
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,780
as possible.

311
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,580
So, continue investigating.

312
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,660
Two pointers.

313

First,

314
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
find out what Wu Zhenfeng did

the night Hu Qingshan died.

316
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,420
Second, find this Huang Daxian

317
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,380
as soon as possible.

318
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,260
It's getting late.

319
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,420
Let's end the meeting.

320
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,620
Something to report!

321
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,820
Come in.

Captain Liu.

323
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,780
I want to know

324
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,700
why you asked me to leave

325
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
during the interrogation.

326
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,660
Is it because you don't trust me?

327
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,820
If I don't trust you,

328
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,980
why would I bring you in here?

329
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,860
Where is your logic?

330
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,980
Go back and rest up.

331
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,020
Tomorrow morning, Yang Yi and you

332
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,780
will look for that skewers restaurant.

333
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,460
Captain Liu.

334
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
We have Wu Zhenfeng now.

335
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,900
I want to solve that case

336
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,740
from three years ago.

337
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,820
I don't want any mystery.

338
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,420
There is no mystery.

339
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,580
The suspect was killed on the spot

340
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,460
and Wu Zhenfeng fled.

341
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,900
To arrest him,

342
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,100
you left the jurisdiction on your own

343
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,900
and committed a grave mistake.

344
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,420
But since you're still young,

345
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,140
you are not expelled.

346
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,740
The moment you brought him
into the interrogation room,

347
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,340
I could tell from your eyes

348
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,060
that you were on the verge of losing control.

349
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,660
He noticed that too

350
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,780

Well, I went to Huang Daxian to buy some goods.

He then drugged me.

697
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,140
And I passed out.

698

went vague.

what happened afterwards at all.

even though I've told you the truth,

811
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,340
I'm sure you aren't able to find the goods.

812

Do you remember what happened to Ba back then?

813
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,860
I saw it with my own eyes

814
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,660
that there were rhubarb capsules

815
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,900
in his shop.

816
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,020

You don't?

820
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,700
Jot it down.

821

That's all I could say.

Three years can change a lot of things.
