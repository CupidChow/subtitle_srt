00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,300
It is now safe to say

174
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,130
that they are from Mengka.

175
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,770
Director Lin, Chief Liu. There's more.

176
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,330
By interrogating Wang Yikun's

177
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,570
sidekick, we also learn

178
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,300
that the Yellow Capsule replicas

179
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,090
we found in Yundian Disco

180
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,980
came from someone called Man.

181
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,090
That sidekick

182
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,450
was told by Man to place

183
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,130
the drugs in Chen Yu's room

184
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,740
to frame him.

185
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,530
We can now

186
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,060
clean Chen Yu's name.

187
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,300
As for Man...

188
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,090
Whether he works for K

189
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,260
and who is behind

190
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,380
this Yellow Capsule replica,

191
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,420
these remain to be found out,

192
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,330
hopefully via the interrogation

193
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,180
of Wang Yikun.

194
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,530
What are you doing, Chen Yu?

195
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,470
[Wang Yikun]

196
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,690
Give it to me.

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,770
That thing you got from your dad.

198
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,420
Who is he?

199
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,020
[Wang Yikun]

200
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,620
When did you capture him?

201
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:43,980
Chief Liu.

202
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,740
Director Lin.

203
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,420
Why didn't you tell me

204
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,940
he was arrested?

205
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,380
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

206
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,570
He has drugs in his truck.

207
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,420
I've been reporting to you.

208
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,260
Have you found the drugs?

209
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm still looking for them.

210
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,890
When did you confirm

211
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,820
that it was Wang Yikun's doing?

212
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,450
Hello?

213
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,450
What's going on? Tell us.

214
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,300
We have checked his truck.

215
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,500
No drug.

216
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,180
You...

217
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,090
Release him then

218
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,330
if you find no drug.

219
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,060
Mr. Wan.

220
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,620
Who is more worrisome?

221
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,380
Kun

222
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,650
or Mengmeng?

223
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,010
What do you mean?

224
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,420
The captured Kun

225
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,940
or Mengmeng who will regain consciousness,

226
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,890
who is more likely to snitch?

227
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,010
What are you trying to do?

228
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,980
You know what I mean.

229
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,530
If Mengmeng wakes up,

230
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,330
the police will grill her.

231
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,500
She won't be able to take it.

232
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,530
Are you human?

233
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,450
She's my daughter!

234
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,530
Don't worry.

235
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,570
She will die a painless death.

236
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:58,940
Mr. Wan!

237
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,860
Dong.

238
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,890
Stop it, Mr. Wan.

239
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,650
Move aside.

240
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,940
(You know him, don't you?)

241
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,180
You've been in Yunhe for a long time.

242
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,260
You have never met him before?

243
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,770
Why didn't you tell me?

244
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,130
Do you not understand what I said

245
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,180
or does my word

246
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,330
hold no weight here?

247
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,010
Release him!

248
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,300
Chen Yu.

249
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,500
Where is the key?

250
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:32,890
Give it to me.

251
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,260
I now announce

252
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,010
that you are to be reinstated.

253
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,450
Kaihua.

254
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,690
Brief him about the case.

255
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,090
We need to interrogate Wang Yikun later.

256
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,740
You'll do it.

257
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,210
Hao Dong.

258
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,180
I'm begging you.

259
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,530
I will go to the hospital now

260
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,980
and bring Mengmeng back.

261
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,010
Mr. Wan.

262
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,450
Are you crazy?

263
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,260
Can you bring her back?

264
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,180
Wanlutong Logistics has many routes,

265
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,180
but you have to take

266
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,620
a cul-de-sac.

267
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,530
I sympathize with you.

268
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,180
My dad

269
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,380
wouldn't be able to do it either.

270
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,010
But

271
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,060
if I were Mengmeng,

272
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,820
if I knew my dad was stuck in a pinch
because of me,

273
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,010
either I survive the interrogation,

274
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,450
or I die.

275
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,530
And you know very well

276
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,300
that Mengmeng

277
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,130
will not survive it.

278
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,860
Please. I beg of you.

279
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,210
I beg of you.

280
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,170
Mr. Wan.

281
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,410
Mr. Wan.

282
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,210
You know this very well.

283
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,570
How many drug addicts do you know

284
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,380
could stay clean forever?

285
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Do you truly think she can stay clean?

286
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,290
Do you think she wants to leave with you?

287
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,780
From the moment she takes drugs,

288
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,620
you should know

289
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,140
that it will end like this.

290
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,380
She will suffer.

291
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,410
Why not let us end the suffering

292
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,570
for her?

293
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,450
Where do you plan to deliver this batch?

294
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,210
Where is Mengmeng?

295
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,860
She is in the hospital.

296
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,330
Is she awake?

297
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,170
Is she in danger?

298
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,660
And her baby?

299
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,020
You know she is pregnant

300
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,050
and you still let her smuggle drugs?

301
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,780
What?

302
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,020
You didn't know?

303
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,980
We found drugs

304
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,050
in Wan Mengmeng's car.

305
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,450
Yellow Capsules.

306
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,860
She doesn't know.

307
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,780
I trafficked drugs. I smuggled drugs.

308
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,690
She has nothing to do with it.

309
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,170
I put those drugs in her car.

310
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:40,930
Wang Yikun.

311
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,380
Your expression tells me

312
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,170
you were just

313
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,450
as oblivious.

314
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,380
Tell me now.

315
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,860
Who put the drugs

316
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,050
in her car?

317
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,930
Who do you smuggle drugs for?

318
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,410
How long do you want to keep quiet?

320

The baby is gone too.

322
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,690
I want to see Mengmeng.

Do you think it's possible?

Wan Mengmeng is suspected
to be involved in drug trafficking.

No one is allowed to see her.

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,500
is over.

345
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,380
She is safe now.

346
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,290
I'll let the doctor tell you

347
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,330
about her situation.

348
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:48,900
Do not touch him.

349
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:49,980
Back off.

350
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:50,980
Back off.

351
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,380
You need to sign

352
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,660
some papers for some procedures.

353
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,820
Let go.

354
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,020
Let go of me.

355
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,180
Let go now. I'm warning you.

356
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,180
Mr. Wan.

357
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,580
The police are outside.

358
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,300
We have no time left.

359
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,180
Mr. Wan.

360
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,450
Let go of me.

361
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,420
Let go of me.

362
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,450
Let go of me.

363
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,180
Hello?

364
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,020
I'll be there right away.

365
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,090
Lan Anran, come with me.

366
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,610
Chen Yu.

367
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,540
Bring Yang Yi here. Grill him.

368
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,780
Yes, sir.

369
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,820
Mr. Wan.

370
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,540
If she lives,

371
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,820
all of us will die.

372
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,940
Let go of me.

373
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,820
Mr. Wan.

374
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,780
Mr. Wan.

375
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,330
Run!

376
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,700
You are committing obstruction of justice.

377
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,090
Do you know?

378
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,610
Right?

379
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,210
But that doesn't mean the police can do
whatever they want.

380
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,970
Of course not.

381
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,970
You can visit, of course.

382
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,300
But you'll need to register first.

383
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,900
Why can't you understand this?

384
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,730
Do you know the consequences

385
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,420
of doing this?

386
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,090
We do.

387
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,580
Chief Liu.

388
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,250
What's the situation?

389
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,490
They

390
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,540
barged in.

391
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,700
I couldn't hold them off.

392
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,780
Sorry.

393
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,940
It's my fault.

394
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,700
Chief Liu.

395
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,420
Protect the scene.

396
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,700
Call the Department of Forensic Service.

397
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,660
Yes, sir.

398
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,940
Come with me, Lan Anran.

399
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,580
Yes, sir.

400
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,370
What are you staring at?

401
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,820
You recognize me now?

402
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,610
Wang Yikun.

403
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,370
Three years ago,

404
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,820
you were hunting Wu Zhenfeng and me.

405
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,330
Who sent you?

406
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,020
What did you

407
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,210
have to do with Wu Gang's death?

408
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,610
Keen eye, officer.

409
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,420
Since you brought up the incident
from three years ago,

410
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,130
let's settle the score

411
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,820
bits by bits.

412
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,450
Knowing the relationship
between Wu Zhenfeng and you,

413
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,370
shouldn't you help me?

414
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,610
Do not throw me

415
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,540
an innocent look.

416
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,180
I'm in this business.

417
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,730
Everyone knows everyone.

418
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,610
What do you mean?

419
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,060
Your acting is so good.

420
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,130
If I say everything,

421
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,850
you'll go down too.

422
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,850
Officer.

423
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,370
Don't stop typing.

424
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,450
Write it down.

425
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,180
Write it all down.

426
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,250
What do you know?

427
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,130
Not as much

428
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,900
as you do.

429
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,330
You know better than anyone

430
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,300
what you know.

431
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,130
I see it now.

432
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,090
You think I've been shielding

433
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,850
Wu Zhenfeng.

434
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,300
But do you know

435
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,130
we are backed by someone more powerful?

436
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,780
Stop bluffing.

437
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,210
You are powerful enough.

438
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,250
Without you, Wu Zhenfeng
would have been dead by now.

439
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,450
Why, officer?

440
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,610
You won't admit it?

441
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,090
Should I remind you

442
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,610
how you found

443
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,820
Li Zhengqiang?

444
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,060
Without Wu Zhenfeng,

445
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:31,940
how did you find

446
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,020
Shu's boxing casino?

447
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,850
If Mengka did not have

448
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,540
a spy planted by the police force,

449
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,540
the drugs in the tea factory

450
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,370
wouldn't have been swapped for lime powder.

451
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,420
Also,

452
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
this time in Kumon Range.

453
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:39,820
Wu Zhenfeng

454
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,730
told you that, didn't he?

455
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,580
Or did you

456
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,300
get the news first

457
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,370
and then told Wu Zhenfeng?

458
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,700
That's why Mengka's people were there, isn't it?

459
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,900
Continue, please.

460
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,610
You're not done yet.

461
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,180
Officer Chen.

462
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,780
I'm curious.

463
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,420
What did Mengka

464
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,780
promise you?

465
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,180
Release me

466
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,090
and I'll give you double.

467
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,340
[2019-10-05, Saturday]

468
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,660
Pull this out.

469
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,020
Pause.

470
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:12,940
Zoom in.

471
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,540
Chief Liu.

472
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,180
Update me.

473
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,730
This is the lab report.

474
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,130
Analysis shows

475
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,420
that the residual fluid in the syringe

476
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,940
contains an overdose of heroin.

477
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,700
More than 40 mg

478
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,820
of heroin per kg.

479
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,300
Once injected into the vein,

480
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,540
the victim will die from poisoning.

481
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,540
We have questioned

482
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,730
the medical staff.

483
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,940
One thing is for sure,

484
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,180
no doctor has prescribed a new treatment

485
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,060
to Wan Mengmeng.

486
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,940
And the syringe

487
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,130
isn't from this hospital either.

488
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,020
Someone

489
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,130
was trying to silence Wan Mengmeng.

490
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,180
When we

491
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,370
were looking through the security footage,

492
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,300
we found someone

493
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,300
who looked like a nurse.

494
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,300
But our investigation

495
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,020
leads to the conclusion

496
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,490
that this person does not work for the hospital.

497
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Wan Mengmeng is...

498
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,420
Chief Liu.

499
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,820
Chief Liu.

500
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:39,700
What is the matter?

501
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,370
Director Lin.

502
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,020
Anything you would like to add?

503
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:42,900
Nothing.

504
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,540
Nothing.

505
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,060
Make sure to keep a close eye

506
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,370
on Wan Mengmeng.

507
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,180
Increase the personnel here for her safety.

508
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:49,820
Yes, sir.

509
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,450
I want my baby back...

510
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,180
Calm down.

511
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:54,780
Calm down.

512
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,610
Calm down.

513
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,850
Relax.

514
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,540
Relax.

515
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,700
I want my baby back.

516
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,090
Let go of me.

517
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,580
Calm down. Relax.

518
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,730
Sorry.

519
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,700
Relax. It'll be done soon.

520
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,020
My baby...

521
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,490
-Where is my baby?
-Hurry up.

522
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,660
It'll be done soon.

523
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,330
Doctor.

524
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,420
How is the patient?

525
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,090
She

526
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,210
suffers from serious mental trauma

527
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,300
and her withdrawal syndrome flares up.

528
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,450
She is depressed right now.

529
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,700
We recommend

530
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,660
immediate psychiatric care

531
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,610
with complementary medical treatment.

532
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,020
Thank you.

533
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,300
Director Lin.

534
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,300
Judging from Wan Mengmeng's situation,

535
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,540
can we truly send her

536
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,490
to a psychiatric ward?

537
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,940
Chief Liu.

538
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:39,850
Request

539
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,130
a medical team from them

540
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,940
to back us up.

541
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,210
I'll contact the rehab center.

542
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,130
Yes, sir.

543
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,330
Hello.

544
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,450
Director Zhao.

545
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,300
It's me.

546
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,780
I need a favor from you.

547
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,090
We have one suspect here

548
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,090
who needs isolated treatment.

549
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,540
Yes.

550
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,420
Drug addiction.

551
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,090
I'll let my subordinates contact you.

552
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,300
How should we hand in the statement?

553
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:08,850
As usual.

554
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,060
As usual?

555
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,940
What will Chief Liu think of it then?

556
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,420
What's on your mind?

557
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,780
Wu Zhenfeng must have mentioned me

558
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,700
in Mengka and K.

559
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,540
And he's using me.

560
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,250
Other than to protect himself,

561
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,490
what is he trying to do?

562
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:02,700
You.

563
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,370

Come over here.

Hurry up.

566
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,650
I couldn't do it.

to Hong Kong, China tonight.

571
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,100
On it now.

572
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,140
Wait.

573
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,650
Taking a plane is not safe now.

574
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,410
How can you make sure

575
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,140
that Kun won't rat you out?

576
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,140
Do you have another option?

577
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,100
Come with me to Mengka.

578
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,660
Mengka?

579
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,210
Mr. Wan.

580
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,420
This is my last time calling you that.

581
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,340
You snitched on Kun.

582
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,820
Now, you're snitching on me too.

583
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,620
Are you trying to get me killed?

584
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,690
Mr. Wan.

585
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,250
Are you trying to get me killed?

586
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:31,930
Mr. Wan.

587
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,820
Are you trying to get me killed?

588
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,530
Can I even get anyone killed now?

589
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,730
This is

590
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,770
the only way out now.

591
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,250
Are you going to be a sitting duck here

592
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,900
and pray that the police can't find you,

593
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,820
or are you coming with me to Mengka?

594
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,690
Think about it.

595
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,690
If you want to know

596
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,340
why I'm still helping you

597
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,660
right now,

598
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,820
I can tell you the reason.

599
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,530
It is

600
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,770
for my daughter.

601
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,690
Do you understand now?

602
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,340
Do you?

603
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,100
So I am your hostage now.

604
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,770
I'll leave tonight.

605
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,770
Think it through.

606
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,530
Call me.

607
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,860
Tonight, I'll cross the border

608
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,100
to Walin Town.

609
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,690
Then, I'll find a way to Hong Kong, China.

610
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,530
Dong.

611
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,930
Once you cross the border,

612
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,420
you'll be in Mengka's territory.

613
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,100
They will locate you.

614
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,490
You won't even be able to board the plane.

615
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,490
Mr. Wan is right.

616
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,820
If you stay with him,

617
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,660
it'll be safer.

618
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,100
Can I trust him?

619
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,180
Dong.

620
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,580
There is no other way.

(shipyard financial record.)

624
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,060
I realized that every so often,

625
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,420
there will be a transaction
to an oversea account

626
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,730
with irregular sums.

627
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,820
The oversea account

628
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,210
is on the Virgin Islands,

629
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,140
Pacific Islands.

630
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,770
Since it's an oversea account,

631
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,860
I cannot find any info

632
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,660
about it.

633
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,730
These are the bank account number

634
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,660
and the credit card number.

635
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,860
A shipyard owner of a county

636
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,770
transfers money to an oversea account.

637
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,420
Before the drug trafficking operation

638
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,820
in Kumon Range began,

639
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,060
a large payment was made.

640
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,010
Also,

641
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,010
the date of the previous bank transfer

642
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,660
coincides with the date the batch

643
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,900
of K-signed Yaba

644

mentioned by Deputy Chief Chen

645
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,770
was sold in Hong Kong, China.

646
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,250
I believe this oversea account

647
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,180
belongs

648
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,930
to the drug buyers.

649
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,820
This is their fund then.

650
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,100
What does this imply?

651
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,970
That Wang Yikun is guilty.

652
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,420
He must have a superior.

653
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,010
Besides, I also found out

654
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,210
that Kuntai Shipyard

655
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,820
had deals

656
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,930
with Wanlutong Logistics.

657
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:03,970
Many of them

658
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,100
were delivered to Shengjiang.

659
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,010
The items delivered

660
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,420
and the business activity of the shipyard

661
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,420
are mismatched.

662
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,860
Look.

663
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,060
A shipyard

664

in Kumon Range,

666
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,490
where was Wan Heda?

667
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,770
After Wan Mengmeng was hospitalized,

668
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,060
I tracked him.

669
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,730
He booked a flight ticket

670
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,580

Contact Ctrip.

674
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:30,770
Ask them to check
