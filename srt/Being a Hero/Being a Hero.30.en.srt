[Scientific Research Building]

172
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,740
Dr. Yu.

173
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,380
Officer Chen.

174
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,620
What brought you here?

175
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,060
Where is he?

176
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,870
Come with me.

177
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,790
The police will be here soon.

178
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,140
They're going to arrest you today.

179
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,500
Were you the one who made

180
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,380
the lethal Yellow Capsules?

181
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,430
You wanted to kill Wan Mengmeng,

182
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,110
but you regretted it later.

183
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,380
Am I right?

184
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,820
You did a precise calculation

185
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,940
and knew exactly when the drug
was going to take effect.

186
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,550
Then, you got

187
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,430
the flumazenil ready

188
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,870
because you knew

189
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,550
that there was an overdose of diazepam.

190
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,990
Did you see Yu Miao?

191
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,870
I didn't.

192
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,140
He's going to give a talk later.

193
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,140
How is it possible that didn't you see him?

194
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,670
I haven't seen him

195
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,110
since I got here.

196
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,180
Then, try and think

197
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,820
if anyone else saw him.

198
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,550
Well...

199
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,710
Director Lin.

200
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,830
Chen Yu has taken Yu Miao with him.

201
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,030
Everything is going according to our plan.

202
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,790
Wait. Stop.

203
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,380
Hurry up.

204
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,980
There's no turning back for me now, right?

205
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,310
I can assure you

206
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,070
that there's no turning back for you.

207
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,670
What should I do now?

208
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,100
What should I do?

209
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,860
What should I do now?

210
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,790
What are you carving?

211
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,910
My dad.

212
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,070
I heard that you were a good craftsman.

213
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,070
Do you know how to make coffins?

214
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,590
Do you know him?

215
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,550
Does it look like him?

216
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,550
Where are we going?

217
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,740
Where is Hao Dong?

218
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,740
You were supposed

219
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,620
to be a good pharmacist.

220
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,340
How did you end up doing this?

221
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,620
Tell me.

222
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,860
How did you meet Hao Dong?

223
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,620
I was just

224
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,260
an assistant pharmacist

225
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,500
at the rehab center.

226
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,100
I was earning very little and I needed money.

227
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,670
That was why I needed some side hustles.

228
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,620
One of the jobs required me

229
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,710
to help those who refused to get admitted
to the rehab center

230
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,460
quit drugs.

231
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,380
(Hao Dong just got back to Yunhe.)

232
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,790
(He was living in agony)

233
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,380
(as he mourned his dad's death.)

234
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,100
(That was when he started using drugs.)

235
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,260
(One of my returning clients)

236
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,140
(introduced me to him.)

237
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,980
Dad...

238
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,500
(His dad's death caused him)

239
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,140
(to start using drugs.)

240
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,950
I have more.

241
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,910
(He quit drugs)

242
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,260
(so that he could avenge his dad.)

243
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,500
After he quit,

244
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,590
he never tried drugs again.

245
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,260
That's why I think

246
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,100
it's not the drug withdrawal that matters.

247
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,620
What matters the most is the person's strength

248
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,550
from within.

249
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,030
Can we

250
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,620
even things out now?

251
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,070
Sure.

252
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,740
We talked it out when we were in Hong Kong, China.

253
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,140
Right, Ms. Qiong?

254
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,590
We can let go of the grudges
we've been holding onto in the past three years,

255
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,790
but there are grudges between us...

256
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,500
(Let me go!)

258

(Let me go!)

259
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,550
That have lasted for more than three years.

(There are debts)

271
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,670
we can only pay off by shedding blood.

272
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,190
Do you think you can pay off a debt
that involves drugs

273
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,430
by shedding blood?

274
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,710
Yang Xingquan.

275
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,910
Think about it.

276
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,590
Can you blame me

277
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,340
for what you've become today?

278
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,190
Or do you want to blame my dad for that?

279
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,980
What do you think?

280
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,310
Your dad tore my family apart.

281
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,380
I stay alive until today

282
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,910
so that one day,

283
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,740
I can avenge

284
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,380
my wife's death.

285
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,500
Who can you blame

286
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,670
for your wife's death?

287
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,340
You only have yourself to blame.

288
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,260
You were the one who informed the police.

289
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,590
You ratted out one guy

290
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,790
after another.

291
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,220
What do you want, Yang Xingquan?

292
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,860
What do you want?

293
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,740
You too!

294
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,620
He wouldn't have run into you
if his wife were still alive.

295
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,340
Without you, Mengka would never have existed.

296
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,550
You owe me thanks.

297
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,070
Do you have a death wish, Hao Dong?

298
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:00,910
I know...

299
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,590
I won't be able to stay alive if I don't say this.

300
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,670
I know you want to shoot him down.

301
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,430
Here. Let me fulfill your wish.

302
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,860
Yes, I was the one who killed your dad.

303
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,980
But did you know

304
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,030
how I knew he was the one?
[K💖I💖S💖S💖K💖H]

305
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,790
Kill him with this pistol.

306
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,590
He sold it!

307
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,260
Hold it!

308
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,140
He sold it!

309
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,340
He used Wan as his pawn.

310
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,550
He used your dad, you,

311
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,030
and everyone...

312
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,620
Kill him!

313
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,710
He took advantage of everything he had.

314
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,500
He set up this trap.

315
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,620
Dong was very grateful for me,

316
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,790
and he always introduced me
to some part-time jobs.

317
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,590
Three years ago, he told me

318
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,550
that he had taken his revenge

319
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,460
and taken over his dad's business.

320
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,790
He asked me if I would like to join him.

321
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,100
He wanted me to use the convenience

322
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,070
I had at work and my expertise

323
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,910
so that we could produce Yaba together.

324
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,620
From then on,

325
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,550
my life has completely changed.

326
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,220
When he gave me

327
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,070
my first remuneration,

328
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,790
my thirst for money

329
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,460
increased tremendously.

330
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,500
I had never seen

331
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,620
so much cash in my life.

332
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,670
From that day onward,

333
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,140
I could no longer smell
the pungent smell of the medicines

334
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,340
when I was making Yaba.

335
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,950
All I could smell

336
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,710
was the fragrance of money

337
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,220
and the sense of security it brought me.

338
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,380
At that moment,

339
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,070
I thought I could produce priceless items

340
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,030
as long as Hao Dong

341
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,500
was by my side.

342
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,980
That's why

343
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,070
you think Hao Dong helped you.

344
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,070
Of course.

345
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,220
Do you know anything about being presentable?

346
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,030
You need money for that.

347
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,190
When I was in college,

348
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,220
I had a girlfriend.

349
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,670
I went to her place after our graduation.

350
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,140
That was my first time knowing

351
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,190
that when you visited a house in the city,

352
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,260
you needed to take off your shoes.

353
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,710
Every question her parents asked me

354
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,030
over dinner that evening

355
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,260
was money-related.

356
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,460
I just graduated from college,

357
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,910
and my parents were from the countryside.

358
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,460
I...

359
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,430
You have no idea

360
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,310
how embarrassed I was that day.

361
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,860
What happened next?

362
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,430
Nothing.

363
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,340
They asked for a dowry worth 200,000 yuan,

364
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,620
and that ended our relationship.

365
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,460
So

366
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,590
you're telling me

367
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,550
that you only got involved in drug dealing
because you were poor.

368
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,500
That's such a pity.

369
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,030
You were supposed

370
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,790
to save lives.

371
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,100
When one starts doing drugs,

372
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,550
they'll keep doing it.

373
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,460
When one starts to earn a living by making drugs,

374
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,500
he'll be no different from a drug addict.

375
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,380
But you were not as good as Hu Qingshan.

376
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,500
Nonsense.

377
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,740
That's rubbish!

378
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,860
Tell you what.

379
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,740
He was just lucky.

380
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,590
It was nothing more than a coincidence.

381
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,220
I...

382
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,910
If I had his formula,

383
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,740
I could have done way better than he did.

384
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,340
Take my word for it.

385
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,710
One day,

386
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,860
I'll definitely produce

387
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,620
the best Yellow Capsules in the world.

388
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,220
Take my word for it.

389
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,100
Sure.

390
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,950
That's why I'm here.

391
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,830
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,100
I have the formula.

393
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,740
The raw materials

394
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,980
are on their way here too.

395
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,190
Let me help you

396
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,620
make the Yellow Capsules.

397
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,380
Do you have the formula?

398
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,380
Give me the formula.

399
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,710
Give it to me!

400
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,500
Now!

401
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,670
Don't worry,

402
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,670
Dr. Yu.

403
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,340
I've memorized it all in my brain.

404
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,500
I'll tell you the formula,

405
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,620
provided that

406
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,380
you trust me

407
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,140
no matter what happens.

408
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,220
Can you do that?

409
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,260
Wu Zhenfeng.

410
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,950
Your dad was the reason

411
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,550
you ended up here.

412
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
My dad was the reason

413
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,260
I ended up here too.

414

Yang Xingquan!

415
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,100
Do you think your daughter

416
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,980
will get punished for what you did?

417
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,030
Does your daughter know

418
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,620
what you've done?

419
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,950
What will she think of you?

420
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
When you get involved in drugs,

421

your children are bound to suffer.

Even if you kill me today,

I'll always stick with you.

425
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,710
I'll stick with your daughter,

Yang Ling, too.

427
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,620
I'm sure someone will avenge me

428
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,100
soon after my death.

429
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,030
Yang Xingquan!

Dr. Yu, get on the truck.

00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,070
We're from Deshan West District Police Station.

439
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,980

what he's up to?

459
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,190
I would rather grow up here

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,430
Yu Miao.

512
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,070
Don't forget what I told you.

513
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,260
Enough with that nonsense. Go.

514
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,630
-Go.
-Go.

515
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,590
Move.

516
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,590
Open the door.

517
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,300
Get in there.

518
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,020
I quit.

519
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,300
I'm leaving.

520
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,110
I quit.

521
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,460
I'm leaving.

522
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,020
I'm leaving.

523
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,150
Yu Miao.

524
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,700
Don't be afraid.

525
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,830
Don't be afraid. Come here.

526
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,670
I quit.

527
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,350
Look at me.

528
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,670
I quit.

529
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,020
I quit.

530
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,700
Yu Miao.

531
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,220
It's the end for K.

532
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,670
Now,

533
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,870
you work for Mengka.

534
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,540
Sir.

535
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,110
From the surveillance footage,

536
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,070
Chen Yu has crossed the border.

537
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,390
Everything is going according to our plan.

538
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,590
Contact the local police as soon as possible.

539
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,070
Tell them to get ready to back us up.

540
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,780
Remember this.

541
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,780
Our goal

542
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,260
is to locate

543
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,390
the real drug manufacturing site.

544
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
We'll arrest all of them red-handed

545
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,590
when they're producing the drugs.

546
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,110
Make sure not to alert them.

547
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:39,980
I understood.

548
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,300
Sir.

549
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,350
I have an idea.

550
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,070
Fire away.

551
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,540
Yang Xingquan's daughter, Yang Ling,

552
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,670
has found out

553
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,020
the true identity of her father.

554
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,110
She volunteered

555
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,700
to help with our investigation.

556
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,150
What do you think about this?

557
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,460
Do you have confidence in her?

558
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,430
Deputy Chief Chen.

559
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,500
I watched that kid

560
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,980
grow up.

561
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,190
I have confidence in her.

562
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,870
Chen Yu.

563
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,980
It's been a while.

564
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,630
You're here to propose a business deal to me,

565
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,350
and that only means one thing.

566
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,460
