3
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,570
I've calmed her down with some sedatives.

4
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,250
She can sleep for now.

5
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,700
Dr. Yu,

6
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,060
we cannot let her give birth to the child.

7
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,570
Do an abortion for her.

8
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,850
I'm not an obstetrician.

9
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,490
I cannot do you this favor.

10
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,740
See you.

11
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,690
Mengka

12
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,940
is showing you respect now.

13
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,900
You better know what's good for you.

14
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,770
Are you threatening me?

15
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,770
Who do you think you are?

16
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,970
You weren't even born yet

17
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,210
when I was doing business with Mengka!

18
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,130
I'll say this one last time.

19
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,300
Call Erliang

20
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,940
right now.

21
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,300
I won't.

22
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,210
You can stay here.

23
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,740
Mr. Wan.

24
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,050
It's me.

25
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,210
Hao Dong.

26
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,850
What are you doing here?

27
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,540
Wu Zhenfeng isn't around, right?

28
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,700
How did you find me?

29
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,010
I can as long as I wish to.

30
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,820
I came here

31
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
to tell you

32
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,380
that you should let Mengmeng

33
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,540
leave together with Kun.

34
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,770
I will give Kun

35
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,820
enough money.

36
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,420
They won't need to return.

37
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,330
Now, Mengmeng is pregnant with his child.

38
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,860
You know that, right?

39
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,730
If so, you should know

40
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,540
their stand.

41
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,260
You should know

42
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,010
Mengmeng's character as well.

43
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,380
You're going to be a grandfather soon.

44
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,420
Under such circumstances,

45
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,210
if you don't calm yourself down,

46
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,010
your daughter might sever her ties with you.

47
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,730
Now, the safest plan

48
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,010
is for them to leave the country.

49
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,730
Zhuo is in a hurry

50
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,290
to buy some Yellow Capsules.

51
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,940
I plan to let Kun

52
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,770
smuggle the next batch.

53
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,860
Mengmeng will join him

54
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,860
in heading to Shengjiang and Hong Kong, China.

55
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,580
After that, they'll leave the country.

56
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,860
Are you saying

57
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,140
that you want Mengmeng

58
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,210
to smuggle the drugs?

59
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,330
Do you have any other way

60
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,540
to let her leave the country?

61
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,290
Do you think the cops can't find this place

62
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,140
when I can?

63
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,380
The best solution right now

64
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,890
is for them to start anew.

65
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,100
Continue.

66
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,170
Tell me your entire plan.

67
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,330
After one week,

68
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,700
they'll exit Yunhe through a small path.

69
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,490
They'll travel to the neighboring county
and use the expressway.

70
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,260
They'll travel to Shengjiang directly.

71
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,330
I know the path you speak of.

72
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,050
Do you think there's any other path out there?

73
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,580
Just go.

74
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,580
Mr. Wan.

75
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,730
Say no more.

76
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,700
Give me some time.

77
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,420
I need to spend some time
with my daughter one last time.

78
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,470
Erliang,

79
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,340
do you still wish to kill Hao Dong?

80
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,990
Is Wu Zhenfeng around?

81
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,060
Yes.

82
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,540
Pass the phone to him.

83
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,990
Erliang.

84
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,990
You've accomplished your mission.

85
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,460
You should head back first.

86
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
I'll look for you if I need anything else.

87
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,390
Understood.

88
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,900
Erliang,

89
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,460
they will smuggle their goods

90
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,660
from Kumon Range to Shengjiang

91
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,390
in a week.

92
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,340
Yellow Capsules.

93
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,430
Are you sure?

94
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,310
Yes.

95
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,390
Hao Dong wants my daughter

96
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,630
to smuggle them together with Kun.

97
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,630
I don't care what method you use.

98
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,430
You must ensure my daughter's safety

99
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,900
and bring her to Mengka.

100
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,310
After I'm done here,

101
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,870
I'll pick her up in Mengka.

102
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,660
No problem.

103
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,510
Hao Dong wants me to head to Shengjiang.

104
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,780
I will book a flight ticket

105
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,990
to make it look convincing.

106
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,020
Once you initiate your mission,

107
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,390
I'll cross the border.

108
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,070
So, you must be prepared to receive me

109
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,270
in Walin Town.

110
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,700
All right.

111
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,510
I'll arrange for that.

112
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,750
How did you get this wound?

113
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,020
Wu Zhenfeng was released.

114
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,460
I tailed him.

115
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,390
He saved Wan Mengmeng.

116
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,460
I still couldn't arrest him.

117
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,660
This Wu Zhenfeng

118
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,900
is no ordinary man.

119
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,660
I'd been monitoring him

120
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,700
ever since he was released.

121
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,100
He didn't contact anyone.

122
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,020
If so, how could he know

123
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,270
where Wan Mengmeng was hiding?

124
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,340
How powerful

125
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,220
is his backing?

126
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,140
Chen Yu.

127
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,390
Do you know what it is
that I worry about the most now?

128
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,540
It's your current state.

129
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,900
What makes you think that you can monitor him

130
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,700
by yourself?

131
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,700
I think you should at least

132
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
place your trust in someone else.

133
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,430
Who are you referring to?

134
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,310
You're the only person

135
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,540
I can trust now.

136
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,630
I think

137
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,950
you should at least

138
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,220
trust Uncle Lin as well.

139
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,430
I'll do it myself.

140
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,270
You should head back and rest.

141
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,660
I'll make some supper for you.

142
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,340
No need for that.

143
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,660
I'm tired.

144
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,430
I don't feel like eating.

145
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,780
You should rest early too.

146
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,750
Remember to lock your doors.

147
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,580
Hello, Erliang?

148
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,990
Leave the border

149
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,700
and head to Wajia Hotel in Walin Town.

150
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,220
Bones will be waiting for you.

151
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,950
Right now?

152
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,780
Is this an emergency?

153
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,870
We can talk about it when you reach Walin Town.

154
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,430
Bones will tell you

155
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,950
the details.

156
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,460
Don't give yourself away.

157
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,310
We'll know

158
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,390
if we can trust Wu Zhenfeng

159
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,270
after this trip.

160
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,270
We have no choice, huh?

161
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,340
I'll keep an eye

162
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,430
on Wu Zhenfeng.

163
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,990
You guys can bring back

164
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,830
both the goods and the girl.

165
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,140
Don't worry about it.

166
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,340
Director Lin,

167
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,990
Kun will smuggle Hao Dong's goods

168
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,140
by tomorrow.

169
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,750
Right now, Erliang

170
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,830
hasn't trusted me completely yet.

171
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,750
That's why he didn't tell me the details.

172
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,630

173

that they'll reach the neighboring county
using a small path

174
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,950
and use the expressway after that.

183

184
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,020
Just now,

185
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,340
Erliang looked for me.

186
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,540
He told me to head to Walin Town immediately.

187
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,020

According to the surveillance footage,

192
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,340
on the day

193
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,750
when Wu Zhenfeng took Wan Mengmeng away,

194
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,390
Wang Yikun

195
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,580
vanished after exiting Xingrong Motel

196
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,870
through the back door.

197

When we toppled

198

He Jiashu's boxing casino,

199
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,430
Wan Mengmeng once mentioned

200
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,190
that Wang Yikun had
an extraordinary relationship

201
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,780
with He Jiashu.

202
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,900
Now, we can confirm the relationship

203
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,990
between Wang Yikun and Wan Mengmeng.

204
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,390
So, I suspect

205
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,310
that Wang Yikun

206
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,510
is directly connected to K,

207
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,900
and he has provided a constant drug supply

208
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,510
to Wan Mengmeng.

209
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
This morning,

210
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,750
many kinds of vehicles had arrived

211
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,430
at the shipyard,

212
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,140
including motorcycles, tractors,

213
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,310
trucks, sedans,

214
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,100
and so on.

215
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,340
I think they'll use them to smuggle their drugs.

216
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,950
That's right.

217
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,830
On the day when the tea factory was burned down,

218
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,140
Wang Yikun

219
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,950
appeared at Shengjiang as well.

220
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,430
So, we suspect

221
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,830
that Wang Yikun has been smuggling drugs

222
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,070
for K all along.

223
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,630
Before we find Wang Yikun,

224
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,100
we have no choice

225
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,020
but to keep a close eye on Wan Mengmeng.

226

Wan Mengmeng is inside this vehicle.

574
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,910
Kun is right behind her.

575
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,430
Let Wan Mengmeng pass first.

576

the tractor was intercepted.

Someone is robbing the drugs.

Do not act alone.

586

who do you think is more likely

What are you up to?

665

will surely interrogate Mengmeng
when she wakes up.

667
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,590
She won't be able to handle it.
