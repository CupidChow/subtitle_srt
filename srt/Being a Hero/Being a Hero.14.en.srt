Hello, Mr. Zhuo.

Dong,

7
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,380
it's been a while.

8
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,180
Do you have any news?

9
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,050
Uncle,

10
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,130
I heard from them

11
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,020
that they were supposed to gather
at the back hill.

12
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,770
Which back hill?

13
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,300
I don't know.

14
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,660
What time?

15
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,210
Tonight.

16
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,940
As for the exact time,

17
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,050
they didn't tell me.

18
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,820
How many men have they recruited?

19
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,610
This...

20
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,490
There's no way I can find out.

21
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,210
Uncle,

22
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,490
I think

23
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,940
there should be at least ten.

30

it's been a long time

31
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,330
since you guys

32
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,820
last worked together with Mengka.

If I'm not mistaken,

34
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,660
it's almost been three years.

35
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,540
Why are you guys working together again?

36
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,460
Don't you think

37
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,460
the taste of this tea has changed?

38
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,770
What do you mean by that?

39
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,130
You and I

40
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,490
were enjoying the drink.

41
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,050
But you just had to add something to it.

Don't stir up trouble for me,

46
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,580
okay?

47
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,100
In Hong Kong, China, I'm the one

48
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,730
who decides the kinds of drugs to be sold.

50

You guys should be careful.

54
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,890
Take extra care when you handle them.

55
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,420
Mr. Wan,

56
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,730
why did you get yourself

57
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,730
such a huge truck?

58
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,730
I can't fill it up

59
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,660
even if I load everything in here.

60
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,420
If the road is rocky,

61
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,580
my goods will be done for.

62
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,980
Don't worry.

63
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,890
You're an old client of ours.

64

It's been so many years.

65

Have we been involved in any accidents before?

It's different this time.

67
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,100
All of these are aged tea leaves.

68
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,010
They're expensive.

69
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,940
Never mind tea leaves,

70
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,730
even if they're antiques,

71
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,860

72

that I'll deliver them in one piece.

Don't try to go against other people all the time.

79

Don't try to cut off
other people's path to wealth.

80

Since when

81
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,610
have I cut off your path of wealth?

82
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,860
Don't worry.

If you insist on buying heroin,

84
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,770
I can search around for you

85
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,890
and deliver them to you.

86
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,770
This time, you're getting
both Yaba and Yellow Capsules.

87
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,010
It's a bargain.

88
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,540

89
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,980

in Hong Kong, China.

92
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,450
However, don't think of

93
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,890
stealing even one gram of Mengka's goods

94
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,940

I'm here today

96
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,610
to greet you in advance.

97
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,980
I don't want people to say
that I don't know the rules

98
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,540
after the incident.

99
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,380
If I'm not mistaken,

100
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,770
I'm sure you're fully prepared.

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,610
So, I won't be able

102
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,540
to get Mengka's goods no matter what I do,

103
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,290
huh?

104
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,140
That's right.

105
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,580
Mr. Yang,

106
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,170
take care.

107
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,290
Jin Rui,

108
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,490
come down.

109
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,420
This time, Mengka is smuggling

110
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,860
50 kg worth of contraband goods.

111
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,330
A tea cake is around 50 g.

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,140
According to that ratio,

113
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,100
there should be more than 1,000 tea cakes

114
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,290
and 150 bags.

115
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,580
Clear up some space in the truck

116
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,010
according to the ratio

117
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,100
that I had mentioned.

118
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,490
Fill up the rest of the space

119
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,210
with those tea cakes,

120
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,010
understood?

121
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,420
Also,

122
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,730
check all the vehicles beforehand.

123
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,580
Make sure their tanks are full.

124
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,380
Remember to double check

125
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,610
all the necessary tools.

126
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,820
Tell the logistics company

127
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,660
to send their boxes

128
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,660
to them right now.

129
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,770
No problem. Don't worry.

130
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,010
I'll wait for you at Shengjiang.

131
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,420
Go now.

132
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,490
Come on, hurry up!

133
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,380
Chief Liu.

134
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,820
Were you looking for me?

135
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,750
Do you have a job to complete tonight?

136
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,470
I'm giving you a chance here.

137
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,220

As for the matter,

141
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,430
you have to say that Wu Zhenfeng was behind it.

142
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,310
So,

143
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,660
Feng...

144
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,340
Feng told me

145
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
to recruit some men

146
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,990
on his behalf.

147
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,390
He has a job to complete

at 12:00 midnight

149

tonight.

151
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,950
Say that again?

152
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,310
We have a job

153
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,540
to complete

154
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,990
at Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory.

155
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,100
Who recruited those men for you?

156
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,340
It was Gou.

157
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,630
When will they arrive?

158
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,270
Where are they going?

159
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,830
Chief Liu, I have no idea.

160
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,660
I...

161
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,070
I'm not joining them.

162
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,990
I have to go earlier

163
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,950
to pick up Feng.

164
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,870
Where will you pick him up?

165
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,750
Around the border.

166
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,950
The area around the border is huge!

167
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,020
What's the exact location?

168
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,700
The exact location? I...

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,580
I have no idea.

170
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
I'm waiting for his update too.

171
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,220
After that,

How many kilograms is he smuggling?

I have no idea.

That's all he said.

Do you know how many weapons he'll be bringing?

No. Not at all.

Am I considered an informant then?

You should know

how much reward you'll get
for seizing one gram of drugs.

It's not about the money!

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Look at the state

345
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,580
you're in right now!

346
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,390
Give it back!

347
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,220
No way!

348
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,510
-Look at you!
-I was winning!

349
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,390
-Just look at you!
-Give it to me!

350
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,870
I was winning!

351
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,630
Did you forget how it felt like

352
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,300
to be locked up in prison?

353
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,940
Give it back!

354
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,870
Look at yourself right now!

355
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,940
Give it back!

356
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,420
You must be out of your mind!

357
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,550
Give it back!

358
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,270
Practice caution

359
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,180
when you smuggle the goods.

360
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,060
I will take good care of Mengmeng.

361
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:49,990
Please don't worry.

362
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,300
Stop pretending.

363
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,820
I know you want me to go to prison.

364
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,340
Listen up,

365
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,580
as long as I'm alive,

366
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,630
it's impossible

367
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,820
between you and Mengmeng.

368
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,460
Mr. Wan,

369
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,420
I'm afraid you don't get to decide that.

370
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,940
Why did you suddenly want to meet me here?

371
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,630
I couldn't think of a better place

372
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,460
to meet you.

373
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,180
I found this when I was cleaning

374
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,180
the house yesterday.

375
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,300
I was planning to give this to you yesterday.

376
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,870
I remember this photo.

377
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,670
I took this photo

378
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,820
in your house

379
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,270
when you guys were leaving Kundu.

380
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,180
You hated taking pictures when you were a kid.

381
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,220
That's why we didn't have many group photos,

382
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,340
not to mention those that are kept until now.

383
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,910
You should keep this.

384
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,510
You need it more than I do.

385
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,990
I think you should keep it.

386
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,870
It's inconvenient for me to keep it.

387
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,460
Thanks.

388
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,790
I appreciate it.

389
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,820
So, what's the matter?

390
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,030
Where did you go last night?

391
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,060
You spent the whole night outside.

392
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,630
I went to Walin Town

393
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,420
last night.

394
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,510
I think your previous analysis

395
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,420
was on point.

396
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,820
I'm sure something went wrong

397
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,270
with the transportation when my dad was killed.

398
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,790
That's why I wanted to investigate it.

399
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,910
I wish to see

400
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,870
if the employees under my dad

401
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,580
still remembered

402
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,820
what happened on the day he was killed.

403
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,340
Maybe they'd remember his chauffeur

404
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,270
and what he looked like.

405
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,390
Maybe I'd find some additional clues.

406
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,910
What did you find out?

407
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,430
Liu sold the shop away.

408
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,910
I couldn't proceed with it.

409
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,910
What about tonight?

410
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,070
What's your plan for tonight?

411
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,980
Tonight?

412
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,100
Do you need anything from me?

413
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,190
No.

414
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,260
Let's have dinner together.

415
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,860
I'll wait for you at home.

416
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,460
I can't make it for dinner tonight.

417
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,860
I have something to attend to.

418
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,430
Why must it

419
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,340
be tonight?

420
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,980
What do you mean by that?

421
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,310
If so, what time do you plan to come back?

422
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,500
Maybe tomorrow.

423
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,140
I'm definitely not returning tonight.

424
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,620
Are you busy tonight?

425
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,340
I'll make a move first.

426
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,430
Take care.

427
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,500
Chen Yu.

428
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,140
Do you have anything to tell me?

429
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,790
I hope you can trust me.

430
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,190
Why did you say that out of the blue?

431
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,790
What were you referring to?

432
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,310
Just remember this.

433
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,740
Put your trust in me.

434
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,860
My dad

435
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,190
would be heartbroken if you didn't,

436
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,790
am I right?

437
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,380
I'll make a move first.

438
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,100
Everything is progressing smoothly.

439
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,980
Tonight, at 12:00,

440
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,980
Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory.

441
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,140
I think they will repackage them as tea leaves.

442
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,830
I predict

443
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,310
that they will be using Wan Heda's truck.

444
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,460
Seems like the cops of Yunhe

445
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,590
had set their sights on us.

446
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,220
I got it.

447
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,950
Follow their plan.

448
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,670
Tail them.

449
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,430
You just need to monitor them.

450
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,460
I'll station our men.

451
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,430
You must be careful.

452
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,220
Hello?

453
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,310
Uncle,

454
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,790
I'll go once I finish dinner.

455
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,790
Lei,

456
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,070
take this.

457
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,190
There's a micro camera inside.

458
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,620
Bring it in.

459
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,140
Uncle,

460
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,590
you didn't tell me

461
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,670
that we were going to use something like this.

462
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,550
Uncle,

463
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,550
you want me to fight for your sake?

464
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,710
That's fine.

465
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,030
But they're smuggling drugs tonight.

466
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,740
If they discovered

467
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,100
that I brought this in with me,

468
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,140
they'd kill me for real.

469
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,950
I don't dare to do so.

470
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,980
Lei,

471
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,830
we're running out of time.

472
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,830
I'll cut it short.

473
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,670
Listen closely.

474
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,790
This is the switch.

475
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,220
You just need to turn it on

476
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,190
and lay low

477
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,830
in a quiet corner.

478
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,910
Use your wrist to film

479
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,380
the areas you need to film.

480
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,340
The number of drugs,

481
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
the number of weapons,

482
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,190
and the personnel involved,

483
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,590
record them all.

484
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,620
I'll know your position

485
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,460
and the situation inside

486
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,670
as long as the camera is on.

487
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,830
However, you need to be prepared

488
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,980
for the fact
that they might confiscate all phones

489
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,030
and electronic devices before heading in.

490
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,710
No matter what happens,

491
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,620
do not panic.

492
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,070
If they're going to confiscate your phone,

493
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,190
send a text message to me before you head inside.

494
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,340
Understood.

495
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,670
And most importantly,

496
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,740
stay safe.

497
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,500
If there's no chance to film anything,
don't do it.

498
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,190
Even if you filmed nothing,

499
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,790
it's better than you getting into trouble.

500
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,460
Understood?

501
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,790
If anything happens,

502
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,070
escape immediately.

503
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,100
If you cannot escape,

504
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,190
find a safe spot

505
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,740
and hide.

506
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,070
If you have no chance to hide,

507
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,260
you should get down.

508
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,790
Protect important parts

509
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,260
like your head and your heart.

510
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,430
Did you hear me?

511
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,310
Wait.

512
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,340
Uncle,

513
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,030
if it's that dangerous,

514
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,220
I don't think I should wear it.

515
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,100
I have to go.

516
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,030
You must remember this.

517
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,670
It doesn't matter if you help me out or not.

518
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,980
Your safety is your number one priority.

519
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,430
See you.

[Counter Narcotics Detachment]
Tonight, at 12:00,

521
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,550
a drug cartel will be smuggling drugs
through the border.

522
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,430
They will attempt to infiltrate Yunhe
through Nandian Village

523
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,340
at the edge of the border.

524
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,070
After that, they will repackage the drugs
in Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory

525
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,030
and transport them out.

526
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,860
Our mission is to obtain absolute control.

527
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,620
We must ensure that all of their moves

528
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,860
are under

529
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,550
our surveillance.

530
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,830
And we will arrest them

531
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,070
when they attempt to repackage

532
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,430
the drugs in the tea factory.

533
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,190
We mustn't let them off.

534
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,910
Chen Yu.

535
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,910
Chen Yu?

536
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,790
Everyone, please take a look
at the tea factory's map.

537
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,790
Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory

538
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,460
is 15 square kilometers wide.

539
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,590
There are four entry points in total.

540
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,550
We assume that they will enter the tea factory

541
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,460
through the southwest entrance

542
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,740
or the southeast entrance.

543
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,220
We will station most of our men

544
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,500
at the two entrances.

545
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,550
We will also arrange for drones

546
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,260
to take photos as evidence.

547
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,190
At the same time,

548
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,590
every road leading to the tea factory

549
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,620
will be guarded by our men.

550

Chen Yu, Yang Yi.

551
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,500
Yes, sir.

552
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,310
Yes, sir.

553
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,620
You guys are responsible

554
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,430
for stationing our men nearby Nandian Village.

555
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,030
Try your best to procure evidence.

556
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,220
Do not alert them to our presence.

557
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:12,950
Yes, sir.

558
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,500
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

562
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,190
You guys will be in charge
of the southwest entrance.

563
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,830
Yes, sir.

564
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,740
Liang Hao,

565
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,260
you'll be in charge

566
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,190
of the southeast entrance.

567
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,340
Yes, sir.

[Counter Narcotics Detachment]

569
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,030
Listen up.

570
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,220
I'm the commander-in-chief of this operation.

571
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,190
Kaihua will be our on-site commander.

572
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,310
Everyone here

573
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,220
is not allowed to commit any careless mistakes.

574
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,740
If anyone drops the ball,

575
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
you'll be sacked!

576
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,140
Now,

577
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,030
everyone, head to the equipment room
and retrieve your weapons

578
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,100
and equipment for obtaining evidence.

579
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,030
Remember,

580
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,670
we mustn't let them smuggle

581
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,670
even a single gram of drugs out of Yunhe.

582
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,030
Are you clear?

583
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,910
Move out!

584
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,220
Salute!

585
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,860
Good job, everyone.

586
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,620
Stand by for now.

587
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,030
Come with me.

588
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:27,950
Yes, sir.

589
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,500
We just received news

590
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,190
that Mengka will be smuggling

591
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,460
their drugs into Yunhe.

592
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,070
We're arranging
an emergency deployment right now.

593
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,460
I think this is the first cooperation

594
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,430
between Mengka and K after so many years.

595
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,590
Through this operation,

596
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,030
we have to find out all of their members

597
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,310
and deal a fatal blow

598
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,380
to their transportation chain.

599
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,740
You guys did great in handling the deployment.

600
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,030
However, right now,

601
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,550
the Provincial Public Security Bureau

602
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,100
will take charge of this case.

603
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,830
Our organization needs

604
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,460
the cops of Yunhe

605
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,710
to cooperate with us

606
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
and maintain a centralized deployment.

607
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,790
Since the Provincial Public Security Bureau
is in charge,

608
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,830
where will we arrest them?

609
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,260
Hong Kong, China.

610
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,860
We will cooperate with the cops
in Hong Kong, China,

611
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,460
to seize the drugs.

612
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,030
Those who are involved in the operation

613
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,910
must be arrested as well.

614
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,030
You guys must do a good job at procuring evidence.

615
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,140
Do not leave out any details.

616
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,380
Deputy Chief Chen,

617
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,670
may I ask you a question?

618
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,740
Go ahead.

619
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,220
Is the news source reliable?

620
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,430
Let me repeat it.

621
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,460
The Provincial Public Security Bureau
is in charge now.

622
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,220
Understood.

623
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,030
How do you need us

624
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,390
to cooperate with you?

625
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,110
The operation was canceled.

626
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,660
Sorry. That's not it.

627
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,980
I mean we have a new mission now.

628
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,310
Our new objective is to monitor them
and procure evidence.

629
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,660
Chief Qian, I'm sorry.

630
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,260
The SWAT team may pull out from this for now.

631
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,310
Everyone, we must monitor
any movements from them.

632
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,790
From the time the drugs enter our border

633
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,830
until they leave

634
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,260
the borders of Yunhe,

635
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,870
I expect each and every one of you

636
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,460
to keep a close eye on their movements.

637
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,350
Do not give your positions away.

638
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,110
Everyone will remain in the same position.

639
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,590
Let me emphasize this.

640
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,550
Without my order,

641
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,110
no one is allowed to arrest them.

642
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,150
Does everyone understand?

643
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,460
Move out.

644
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,420
Sir.

645
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,390
Director Lin,

646
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,940
Chief Liu,

647
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,940
I request permission

648
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,420
to bring my phone along tonight.

649
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,660
No can do.

650
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,310
All phones will be confiscated.
No exceptions are allowed.

651
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,550
Where's your discipline?

652
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,980
If so, Director Lin,

653
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,070
please keep an eye on my phone.

654
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,260
You might receive news.

655
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Please answer it by then.

656
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,700
Chen Yu,

657
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,830
go and get ready.

658
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,220
Yes, sir.

659
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,870
Hello, Dong.

660
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,350
Did you do what I ask of you?

661
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,790
Yes.

662
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,550
Wu Zhenfeng

663
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,590
won't leave the factory alive.

664
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,180
I will surely

665
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,460
get Mengka's goods.

666
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,940
What's wrong?

667
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,740
It's nothing.

668
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,070
Are you really okay?

669
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,700
Dong, I'm fine!

670
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,020
Why are you so nervous?

671
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,500
Calm down.

672
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,110
Do a clean job.

673
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,670
Don't be soft-hearted.

674
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,020
How do you plan to explain yourself

675
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,940
to Mengka?

676
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,500
Don't worry.

677
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,430
Even if something happens,

678
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,940
Mengka won't be able to push the blame on you.

679
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,590
They can only blame themselves

680
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,940
for not being capable enough
to smuggle them out of Yunhe.

681
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,740
Mr. Zhuo,

682
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,500
I think you should know

683
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,540
what you should say and what you shouldn't.

684
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,430
If not, you won't get

685
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,670
any Yaba or Yellow Capsules from us.

686
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,300
Ms. Qiong.

687
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,590
The journey must have been tough.

688
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,590
Come, have a seat.

689
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,700
Mr. Dong,

690
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,460
it's rare to see you here.

691
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,390
Ms. Qiong,

692
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,740
please don't call me Mr. Dong.

693
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,390
I don't deserve that title.

694
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,460
Come.

695
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,150
Since all of us are already here,

696
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,300
let's have a toast

697
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,830
and dissolve our feuds.

698
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,870
Since we're having dinner together,

699
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,460
we shouldn't hold it against each other.

700
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:31,940
Dong,

701
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,630
we should let bygones be bygones.

702
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,670
This cooperation

703
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,150
can be considered a new partnership.

704
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,980
Thank you for your generosity.

705
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,220
What are you saying?

706
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,590
I just got my thoughts sorted out.

707
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,780
It's just business.

708
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,910
Hello, Gou.

709
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,700
It's me.

710
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,110
Listen up.

711
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,540
Tonight,

712
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,870
bring your men and get the goods personally.

713
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,020
Examine them personally.

714
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,190
From now on,

715
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,390
you'll be my boss.

716
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,350
You hear me?

717
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,740
(I can promise you this.)

718
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,300
(If I get into contact)

719
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,500
(with any drug dealers,)

720
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,780
I will notify you

721
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,110
immediately

722
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,260
as long as I obtain any substantial evidence.

723
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,350
Why must it be there?

724
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,940
What's wrong with you today?

725
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,110
I thought something was off about you

726
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,110
during the mission briefing.

727
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,830
It's nothing.

728
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,940
Chen Yu,

729
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,220
don't you think it's strange?

730
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,150
I don't know.

731
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,460
