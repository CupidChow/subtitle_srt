00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,060
Yang Ling.

5
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,380
Come outside with me.

6
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,180
Uncle Lin.

7
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,780
My dad needs to rest.

8
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,300
I know.

9
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,100
Lingling.

10
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,580
Step outside for a bit.

11
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,420
I can manage.

12
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,220
Dad.

13
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,060
Lingling.

14
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,380
It's the standard procedure.

15
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,020
Hello, Mr. Yang.

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,380
I'm the chief

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,620
of the Counter Narcotics Detachment, Liu Kaihua.

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,980
I have some questions

19
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,740
regarding what happened at the tea factory.

20
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,860
We will be recording this session.

21
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,340
Please answer truthfully.

22
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,500
When the factory caught fire,

23
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,260
how come you were near

24
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,340
the packaging workshop?

25
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,620
I had finished tidying up the tearoom

26
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,980
and was about to take a break.

27
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,660
But something felt off.

28
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,900
So I took a walk around.

29
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,940
That's how I ended up at the hill.

30
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,140
What did you see?

31
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,380
People were going in and out of the workshop.

32
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,180
Seemed like it was in operation.

33
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,620
Who has access to the factory

34
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,460
at night?

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,020
Only the staff.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,380
We arrested

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,660
the suspects at the site.

38
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,620
None of them

39
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,780
were staff members.

40
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,140
Do you think someone from the factory

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,700
is involved with drug dealers?

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,100
If yes,

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,420
do you have a suspect in mind?

44
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,420
I will look into it thoroughly.

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,860
When I find them,

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,860
I'll hand them over to you immediately.

47
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,540
Since it has already happened,

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,660
just find a solution.

49
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,980
Peace brings money, right?

50
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,660
There's no need to blow things up.

51
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,660
Mr. Zhuo.

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,540
You knew of their plan

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,860
right from the start, didn't you?

54
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,700
Boss.

55
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,260
Dong's goods have arrived.

56
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,940
We've distributed it to the dealers.

57
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,900
Now,

58
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,180
they're ready to be sold.

59
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,100
Hao Dong, what's the meaning of this?

60
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,900
Ms. Qiong.

61
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,260
It's our first time working together,

62
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,620
and you brought lime powder.

63
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,020
What is the meaning of that?

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,060
You planned the arson

65
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,300
and threw Mengka to the police.

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,540
I've received

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
K's welcome gift.

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,140
News travels fast.

69
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,940
Is there a Mengka spy within the police?

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,540
Or is one of my men

71
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,860
working for you?

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,220
Mr. Yang.

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,940
Please don't mind

74
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,860
me asking another question.

75
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,100
It has to be asked.

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,900
Were you aware that drug deals

77
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,660
were taking place at the factory?

78
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,300
Chief Liu.

79
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,740
What are you saying?

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,340
Why do you think

81
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,940
those people did that

82
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,340
at my tea factory?

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,900
Lin Dezan.

84
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
Don't turn your back on me.

85
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,820
Look at me.

86
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
Tell me, what do you think?

87
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,460
I don't mean anything else, Mr. Yang.

88
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,220
This is routine questioning.

89
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,060
You only need to answer

90
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,900
yes or no.

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,020
Was it because I sent someone to Mengka

92
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,820
to help you find out news

93
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,300
about Wu Zhenfeng?

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,700
So this was their warning to me.

95
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,740
Or was it

96
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,140
also a warning to you,

97
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,100
Lin Dezan?

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,980
Sorry.

99
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,500
I don't know.

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,860
Why is this happening?

101
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,380
Has my dad not lost enough?

102
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,420
Now, even the tea factory was burned down.

103
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,740
How do you expect him to live?

104
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,780
Ling.

105
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,980
Trust us.

106
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,140
We will give you an answer.

107
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,540
We'll find out what happened.

108
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,020
Time to head back.

109
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,940
Yes, sir.

110
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,100
Don't worry.

111
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,060
So he is Liu Kaihua.

112
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,780
Yes.

113
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,220
He has a nephew,

114
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,620
called Jiang Lei.

115
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,860
Ms. Qiong.

116
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,060
Do me a favor.

117
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,900
I'm just a businessman.

118
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,100
This is the first time in three years

119
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,580
you two are working together.

120
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,260
There is bound

121
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,460
to be some distrust.

122
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
But I believe,

123
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,580
Dong will not

124
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,940
make it difficult for you

125
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,140
next time.

126
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,260
As long as I'm around,

127
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,980
Mengka's goods

128
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,340
will not enter Hong Kong, China.

129
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,660
I'm no fool.

130
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,100
I looked into

131
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,060
what happened three years ago.

132
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,500
Wu Gang wasn't in this business.

133
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,340
Why would he drag my dad into it?

134
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,020
Wu Gang wasn't one of Mengka's men.

135
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,940
I'm afraid you're asking the wrong person.

136
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,860
You know very well

137
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,100
whether I'm right or wrong.

138
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,020
Why don't you

139
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,060
go ask Mr. Yu?

140
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,860
Check the accounts.

141
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,940
If everything is fine,

142
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
you should go too.

143
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,620
But just another reminder.

144
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,940
I don't want my business to be interrupted

145
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,900
due to your bad blood.

146
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,500
Zhuo.

147
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,100
As long as you've got K's goods,

148
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,180
you need not worry about making money.

149
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,900
Qiang.

150
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,900
Can we see who that is?

151
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,820
This is the document you wanted.

152
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,580
It's too dark.

153
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,620
Impossible to discern.

154
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
Are these Li Shougui

155
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,500
and Gou Sheng's burned phones?

156
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,540
Yes.

157
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,620
I recovered

158
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,740
the data from both phones.

159
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,140
I noticed that Gou Sheng

160
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,780
and Li Shougui were regularly in contact

161
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,820
with the same number recently.

162
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,860
Look.

163
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,220
[Type of call, number dialed, call duration]

164
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,060
That's the number.

165
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
But it's a temporary number.

166
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,540
It's been canceled.

167
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,460
There's no way

168
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,580
to find out the user details.

169
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,180
Hold on.

170
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,180
This timing.

171
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
It's the day Yaba

172
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,060
was found at the cafe.

173
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,300
Wu Zhenfeng was with me at the time.

174
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,420
He wouldn't have had

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,340
the chance to call Gou Sheng.

176
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,940
Li Shougui's and Gou Sheng's cause of death

177
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,380
was determined to be asphyxiation

178
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,260
and severe burns.

179
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,860
Also,

180
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,860
their bodies

181
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,140
had knife wounds

182
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,260
and broken bones.

183
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,020
This points

184
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,380
to a physical altercation before death.

185
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,940
We found these cotton strips

186
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,500
like this

187
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,420
at the tea packaging workshop.

188
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
After testing the substance

189
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,540
taken from the strips,

190
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,140
we found that they had been

191
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,620
soaked in diesel oil beforehand.

192
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,300
Which means

193
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,260
that the tea factory incident

194
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,460
was a deliberate arson

195
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
someone had planned.

196
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,420
I inspected the entire workshop.

197
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,580
If they hadn't prepared in advance,

198
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,820
it would be hard

199
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,060
to create such a huge blaze in a short time.

200
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,980
Chen Yu.

201
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,020
What are you looking at?

202
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,260
The video from the tea factory.

203
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,460
Quick.

204
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,020
See if they poured diesel oil

205
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,860
and threw cloth strips beforehand.

206
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,420
What do you mean?

207
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,100
Are you saying it's arson?

208
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:48,980
Yes.

209
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,060
Nothing was caught on tape.

210
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,500
It can't be.

211
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,060
That's not

212
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,940
the only oddity.

213
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,300
Chen Yu.

214
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,020
He was helping us.

215
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,340
When I questioned Jiang Lei,

216
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,380
he became noticeably nervous when I mentioned

217
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,820
Wu Zhenfeng and He Jiashu.

218
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,540
I suspect

219
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,700
there has to be a reason

220
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,180
why He Jiashu named Jiang Lei.

221
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,220
And Jiang Lei's relationship with Wu Zhenfeng

222
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,420
is surely more complicated

223
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,100
than we thought.

224
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,780
Mr. Wan.

225
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,940
Kun is here.

226
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,420
Let him in.

227
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,540
Okay.

228
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,660
Mr. Wan.

229
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,020
Mr. Wan.

230
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,220
You're angry

231
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,740
about what happened.

232
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,060
I get it.

233
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,260
But it's Mengka

234
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,660
Dong was after.

235
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,580
I hope

236
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,340
you can understand.

237
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,940
Why didn't he

238
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,380
tell me right from the start?

239
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,540
My men

240
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,300
were the way to get the goods.

241
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,540
What if they had arrived early?

242
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,420
What if they were arrested?

243
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,740
Tell me.

244
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,460
Dong

245
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,780
doesn't trust you.

246
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,540
Dong

247
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,500
doesn't trust me?

248
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,140
Why doesn't he trust me?

249
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Three years!

250
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,460
Have I ever contacted Mengka?

251
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,380
I'll tell you right now.

252
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,740
Chen Yu is going to find this place very soon.

253
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,620
If there had been an ounce of dishonesty

254
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,540
toward you and Hao Dong,

255
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,420
would I need to look for Mengka?

256
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,340
Three years ago, you were the one

257
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,940
who got us to kill Wu Gang.

258
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,460
The one who drove Wu Gang across the border

259
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,260
was you.

260
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,660
You were also the one who killed Dusan

261
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,620
at Wuyi Square.

262
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,700
Am I right?

263
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,460
It was you!

264
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,260
What's with all the shouting?

265
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,900
Can't you talk properly?

266
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
What were you two talking about?

267
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,500
You're not needed here.

268
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,260
Go upstairs.

269
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,740
Kun.

270
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,740
Tell me.

271
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,540
What was my dad saying?

272
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
What did he say?

273
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,820
I said it's none of your business.

274
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,500
No.

275
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,380
Go upstairs!

276
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,180
I'm not going!

277
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,460
He is a murderer!

278
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,220
He killed people when he was abroad.

279
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,860
Then he did it again after he returned here.

280
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,220
Are you still going to be with him?

281
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,380
Have you killed people before?

282
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,620
Have you?

283
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,500
So what?

284
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,540
Wan Heda.

285
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
Restrain yourself.

286
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,220
I think the tea factory incident

287
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,860
was supposed to be a drug deal.

288
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,820
But Wu Zhenfeng put two and two together

289
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,140
after speaking with Chen Yu

290
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
and swapped the drugs

291
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,820
with lime powder beforehand.

292
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,540
Of course,

293
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,780
there are still questions

294
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,940
pertaining to the other party.

295
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,900
But I trust

296
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,220
in my judgment of Wu Zhenfeng.

297
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,420
Moreover,

298
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,540
his behavior during the questioning

299
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,740
happened to validate

300
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,820
my assumption of him.

301
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,060
I'm done waiting.

302
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:35,460
[Chief's Office]

303
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,140
Sir.

304
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,220
Come in.

305
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,100
Director Lin.

306
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,180
What's the matter?

307
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,980
Chief Liu.

308
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
I have something to report.

309
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,540
I...

310
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,060
I suspect Jiang Lei.

311
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,980
Do you have proof?

312
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,260
Leng Feng found that the cloth strips

313
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,020
collected from the tea factory

314
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,340
were soaked with diesel oil.

315
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,740
That points to planned arson.

316
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,380
In Jiang Lei's video taken at the scene,

317
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,060
there was nothing showing those things.

318
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,000
I suspect

319
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,920
that he's trying to hide those things

320
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
from the police.

321
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,160
When Wu Zhenfeng

322
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,430
took out the lime powder,

323
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,430
there was a moment
lasting 1 minute and 23 seconds

324
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,310
in Jiang Lei's video

325
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,950
where the camera was pointed

326
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,830
at a random spot.

327
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm guessing

328
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,430
he was on the phone with someone.

329
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,400
Perhaps he was asking the person in charge

330
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,830
of K Group what to do

331
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,800
when he learned the goods were fake.

332
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,110
Chen Yu.

333
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,230
These are just your assumptions, right?

334
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,110
Yes.

335
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
But if my guess

336
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,800
is right,

337
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,110
then the tea factory incident

338
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,800
is a double-cross.

339
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,560
Don't touch me.

340
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,560
Don't touch me.

341
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,350
Let me go. I don't want to go there!

342
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,520
Kun!

343
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,470
You...

344
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,640
Mr. Wan.

345
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,070
You should know.

346
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,110
Dong didn't come back

347
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
just for the business.

348
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,110
It was also to avenge his dad.

349
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,920
Before Dong came back,

350
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,760
your relationship with Mengka

351
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,920
was pretty close, no?

352
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,560
After Dong's dad, Li Linfan, died,

353
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,040
I doubt

354
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,230
Mengka offered you anything.

355
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,710
What are you saying?

356
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,520
For instance,

357
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,560
after Li Linfan's demise,

358
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,830
the business in Yunhe

359
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,000
should all be yours.

360
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,280
Packaging, transport, and sales,

361
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,520
you'd control everything.

362
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,920
Wan Heda would have the last say.

363
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,470
Kun...

364
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,110
Three years ago,

365
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,640
or to be more specific,

366
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,160
before Li Linfan died,

367
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,110
you had gone to Mengka, didn't you?

368
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,310
And on the day Li Linfan died,

369
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,680
you were supposed to send someone

370
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,640
to deliver the goods to him.

371
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,710
But coincidentally,

372
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,070
all the drivers at your company

373
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,280
were on leave that day.

374
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,110
So, Mr. Wan,

375
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,710
how could Dong tell you

376
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,430
about our plan to take out Mengka?

377
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,350
Are you going

378
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,830
to tell Hao Dong

379
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,280
what Mengmeng told you?

380
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
I love Mengmeng.

381
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,070
And you're her father.

382
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,920
Dong should be back by now.

383
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,590
Better decide how you're going to greet him.

384
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,710
Don't be like today.

385
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,230
That is what

386
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,760
I'm most worried about.

387
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,310
Get out.

388
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,880
Kun!

389
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,160
You come back here!

390
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,950
Dad.

391
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,800
I didn't mean it.

392
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm warning you one last time.

393
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
Do not cross the line!

394
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,710
What you can say

395
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,950
and what you cannot say.

396
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,920
Think before you speak!

397
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,950
I can dote on you.

398
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,920
But

399
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,830
I can also cripple you.

400
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,160
Remember that.

401
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
I'll give you an answer

402
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,710
regarding Jiang Lei's actions.

403
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,950
Because I taught him so.

404
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,160
I told him that safety comes first.

405
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,000
Obtaining evidence is secondary.

406
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,310
Make sure not to overexert

407
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,590
in case of danger.

408
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,470
The first thing you mentioned

409
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,680
was that Jiang Lei did not capture

410
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,230
footage of them pouring diesel oil.

411
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,190
That's because he only just

412
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,350
infiltrated the scene of the transaction.

413
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,760
He also

414
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,310
just received the camera from me.

415
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,470
He needed time to familiarize himself

416
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,710
and get in the zone.

417
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,190
Not to mention, he had to do it discreetly.

418
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,680
If he had taken the risk

419
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,280
and stayed together with the arsonists

420
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
and tried to film

421
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,280
the people pouring the diesel oil,

422
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,000
the outcome would be unthinkable

423
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,470
if he got found out.

424
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,110
The second point.

425
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,640
He didn't capture the people's reactions

426
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,430
when they realized

427
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,920
Wu Zhenfeng had brought fake goods.

428
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,880
Please think carefully.

429
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,280
When a dealer realizes he's been duped,

430
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,760
what would his first reaction be?

431
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,830
Wouldn't they

432
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,000
be at each other's throats?

433
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,040
In that situation,

434
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,560
was Jiang Lei supposed to continue filming

435
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,280
despite the risk of being found out

436
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,590
and injured in the process?

437
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,680
I think the way Jiang Lei reacted

438
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,640
was normal survival instincts.

439
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,470
He sensed danger.

440
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,950
So he found a safe place

441
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,800
to hide.

442
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,430
After about a minute,

443
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,680
he remembered the task

444
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,040
that was given by Counter Narcotics Detachment.

445
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,920
Thus, he went back to the scene

446
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,800
and quietly continued filming.

447
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,920
Jiang Lei isn't a drug dealer.

448
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,280
There's no need for meritorious deeds.

449
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,070
And he had

450
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,350
no prior experience in dealing drugs.

451
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,160
It was his first time

452
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,800
being tasked with infiltrating such occasions.

453
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,950
He would've been scared.

454
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,760
He risked his life to support us,

455
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,400
solely because of me.

456
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,640
He wanted to help

457
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,880
Counter Narcotics Detachment.

458
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,110
He hoped our operation

459
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,000
would be successful

460
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,280
and the drug dealers could be caught.

461

is weighing heavily on me.

my dad and I can't seem to bridge.

600

Only by capturing Wu Zhenfeng

can you undo the knot in your heart.

only by capturing those drug dealers

can my dad and I reconcile.

Jot everything down.

Tell me,

609
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,260
how exactly did lime powder

610

show up at the deal?

611
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,380
Who swapped the goods?

612
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,940
When was it switched?

613
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,020
It was only a short time.

614
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,300
The goods were switched with lime powder.

615
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,900
They must have been prepared beforehand.

616
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,260
All right.

617
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,460
More importantly, how did they know

618
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,860
we had set something up?

619
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,540
Guishou is dead.

620
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,820
Have you ever seen

621
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,380
a living, breathing person

622
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,900
burning to their death in front of you?

623
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,700
If not for you,

624
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,140
how long would he have stayed at the rehab center?

625
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,380
Was he going to hide forever?

626
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,060
Some errors cannot be made.

627
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,460
Once you get into drugs,

628
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,700
you'll pay the consequences.

629
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,660
It could be your health

630
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,420
or wealth.

631
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,300
It could be your family's safety

632
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,420
or even your own life.

633
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,900
What about my dad then?

634
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,020
Does he deserve to be stigmatized

635
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,140
as a drug dealer his whole life?

636
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,180
Don't you forget.

637
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,300
The last phone call he made three years ago

638
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,620
was to you.

639
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
These past three years,

640
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,060
what exactly have the police done?

641
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
We've never stopped

642
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,740
investigating your father's case.

643
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,260
It's been three years.

644
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,820
Your father's case

645
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,140
is still far from being closed.

646
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,420
That's because you've never

647
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,660
fully trusted us.

648
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,340
Have you ever trusted me then?

649
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,900
Didn't I inform you

650
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
about the tea factory

651
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,060
the moment I found something out?

652
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,380
Someone on your side

653
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,700
swiftly sold it off to Mengka

654
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,860
and Mengka swapped the goods.

655
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,220
I almost lost my life in the factory!

656
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,260
There's a rat within the police force.

657
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,100
Did you look into it?

658
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,740
I will surely get to the bottom of this!

659
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,940
And give you a proper explanation.

660

Uncle.

661
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,180
I brought you a blanket.

662
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,260
The bed is hard.

663
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,740
Line it with the blanket.

664
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,420
I brought you a box of Werdery.

665
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,580
Drink it after your meals.

666
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,780
Share it with your cellmates.

667
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,780
Better get along with them.

668
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,540
Don't try to stand out.

669
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,420
It's different inside.

670
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,060
Uncle.

671
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,180
This isn't my first time inside.

672
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,660
I know the rules.

673
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,820
It's not the same.

674
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,260
Before, you were held in a police station.

675
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,500
This is a detention center.

676
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,140
Don't you know

677
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
what kind of people are locked in here?

678
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,300
Don't worry too much.

679
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,420
Hang in there for a few days.

680
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,300
You've got this.

681

A few years ago,

on my dad's birthday,

685
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,380
Wan Heda brought her to the tea factory.

686
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,460
It was one brief encounter.

687
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,380
Zhang

688
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,260
had worked in many other places before.

689
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,820
He knows all sorts of people.

690
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,700
He should be able to find something out.

691
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,460
How about this?

692
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,460
I'll handle Wan Mengmeng.

693
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,860
I'll help you look for her.

694
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,540
At first, Wanlutong Logistics' data

695
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,380
was the best breakthrough.

696
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,180
But it got destroyed.

697
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,820
Does the data

698
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,020
not have a digital copy?

699
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,060
Wan Heda said

700
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,540
they were a small company.

701
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
There's no digital record.

702
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,860
Everything was handwritten.

703
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,020
He lied to you.

704
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,420
Nowadays, no matter the size of the company,

705
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,860
operations are all digitized.

706
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,700
Even my little cafe

707
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,060
uses digitized data.

708
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,420
Moreover,

709
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,300
Wanlutong is one of Yunhe's big corporations.

710
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,620
How could they

711
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,660
not have a digital copy?

712
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,660
If Wan Heda deliberately lied,

713
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,700
it means the data

714
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,700
must contain clues.
