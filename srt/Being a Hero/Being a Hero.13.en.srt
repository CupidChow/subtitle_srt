As for the matter,

I need to test the water.

165
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,490
However, you need to give me

166
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,650
10% of the profit.

167
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Look at all the goods you have here.

168

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,260
But here's the problem.

173
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,900
How do I deliver my goods to you?

174
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,170
Call this number.

175
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,820
This is Jiang Lei's number

176
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,900
in Yunhe.

177
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,700
After your goods have entered the border,

178
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,380
call him.

179
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,460
Let it beep three times, then hang up.

180
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,490
He'll call you back.

181
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,780
Is the man he spoke of reliable?

182
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,650
He's Hao Dong's trusted aide.

183
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,730
Young and ruthless.

184
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,900
Young man,

185
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,580
don't be so quick to judge others.

186
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,260
Who do you plan to dispatch

187
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,940
as your smuggler?

188
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,700
Feng is more familiar with Yunhe.

189
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,730
I'll send him there.

190
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,020
Erliang.

191
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,820
I wouldn't use him

192
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,340
if I were you.

193
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,140
But why?

194
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,380
He has committed various crimes in Yunhe

195
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
for over a month.

196
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,260
The cops had their eyes on him long ago.

197
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,290
When it comes to business,

198
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,260
it depends on feng shui and one's luck.

199
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,970
Our deal stopped

200
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,900
with Wu Gang's death.

201
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,490
And now, we're making another deal

202
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,610
because of Wu Gang's son.

203
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,140
It doesn't sound auspicious to me.

204
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,650
Anyway, I don't feel

205
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,940
too good about it.

206
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:07,820
Wan,

207
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,610
the past three years...

208
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,220
I wouldn't have

209
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,530
let this kid suffer in Yunhe alone

210
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,650
if I had

211
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,170
a better candidate three years ago.

212
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,610
Look at him.

213
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,170
Now, he has

214
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,490
a foothold in Yunhe.

215
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,730
And he even has several dependable buddies.

216
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,730
Since you've already said that,

217
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,170
it would be my fault

218
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,900
if I tried to change your mind again.

219
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,820
Here.

220
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,260
Deliver the goods to Yunhe
by morning two days later.

221
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,460
That's a short time.

222
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Is the road safe?

223
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,900
I'm not boasting here.

224
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,610
In Yunhe,

225
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,170
there's no other road

226
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,170
safer than this.

227
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,170
You,

228
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,340
call your buddy right now.

229
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,650
Now.

230
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,730
He's talking to you.

231
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,410
Call him right now.

232
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,650
[Feng]

233
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,290
Hello?

234
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,730
Feng?

235
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,290
Wait for me on Nanshan's border

236
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,340
by 12 AM tomorrow.

237
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,410
All right.

238
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,850
Feng?

239
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,610
He hung up.

240
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,340
Lei,

241
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,170
you're sending me to my grave here.

242
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,140
You won't be implicated

243
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,290
by this.

244
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,970
But what about me?

245
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,490
That's not it.

246
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,340
I'm sending Wu Zhenfeng to his grave.

247
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,650
Think carefully.

248
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,020
By the way,

249
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,380
my uncle will surely go to you.

250
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,820
I'm sure I don't need to teach you

251
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,530
what to say or do by then,

252
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,730
am I right?

253
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,580
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

254
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,650
I appreciate your effort.

255
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,090
Follow me.

256
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,410
Stop!

257
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:18,820
Let go of him.

258
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,940
Tell me.

259
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,740
Were you

260
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,940
old acquaintances with Wan Heda?

261
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,580
Why didn't you tell me?

262
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,940
Because it's useless for you to go to him.

263
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,340
He won't help you out.

264
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,620
Do you know

265
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,100
how much

266
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,290
I've suffered in Yunhe all this while?

267
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,290
I almost died there!

268
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,220
What about Hao Dong?

269
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,050
Did Hao Dong kill my dad?

270
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,100
You've seen Hao Dong yourself.

271
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,250
Do you think you can deal with him

272
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,860
in your current state?

273
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,410
You knew

274
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,580
who killed my dad long ago.

275
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,410
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,860
It's been three years since I joined Mengka.

277
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,620
Three years!

278
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,340
Mate!

279
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,130
Who do you take me for?

280
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,100
Mate!

281
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,650
Calm down!

282
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Calm down!

283
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,220
We can talk about it

284
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,250
when we're upstairs,

285
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,410
okay?

286
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,220
Let's talk upstairs.

287
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,460
Feng,

288
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,620
actually, I already knew

289
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,770
you traded in Yunhe

290
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,980
long ago.

291
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,620
I just didn't expect you

292
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,770
to come back alive.

293
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,460
In this field,

294
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,700
life and death mean nothing.

295
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,940
Since you've made it back alive,

296
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,410
I'll tell you

297
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,410
whatever you wish to know.

298
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,140
Actually, we first met each other

299
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,660
in Yunhe.

(for me.)

327
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,900
Hao Dong always thought

328
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,020
that Wu Gang was the one who got Li Linfan killed.

329
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,140
He was sure that Wu Gang

330
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,780
wasn't the only one involved with his dad's death.

331
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,930
He thought Mengka was involved too.

332
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,930
That's why he returned to Yunhe three years ago

333
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,620
in order to avenge his dad.

334

Since Hao Dong is out to get you,

335

why are you still doing business with him?

336

I have no other choice.

337
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,140
Mengka is dominant outside the border area.

Why do you think so?

339
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,780
It's because our goods...

340
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,620
bring in good money.

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,740
If we wish to earn money,

343
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,210
we have to smuggle them to Hong Kong, China.

344
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,540
Our only way to get inside Yunhe

345
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,450
is through K.

346
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,090
I am aware of all of that.

347
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,980
What about my vengeance then?

348
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,660
Feng.

349
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,780
Business is business.

350
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,020
Your feelings have nothing to do with this.

351
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,260
This is how you do business.

352
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,980
You have to let it go.

353
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,380
Wan Heda came here today.

354
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,210
That means I wasn't wrong about you

355
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,260
and I didn't save the wrong person.

356
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,380
Hand over the goods.

357
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,500
Freeze!

358
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,810
Put down your gun!

359
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,020
No one moves!

360
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,140
Duck!

361
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,140
Put down your gun!

362
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:44,660
Duck!

363
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,050
His goods belong to me.

364
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,140
They're mine.

365
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,450
I will tell you this again.

366
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,930
His goods belong to me.

367
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,780
Is Mengka

368
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,210
declaring war against us?

369
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,050
Declaring war against you guys?

370
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,450
We declared war against you guys long ago.

371
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,210
Don't think that I have no idea

372
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,410
what you guys have done

373
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,930
at Wuyi Square.

374
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,860
Go back and tell Hao Dong

375
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,260
that Wu Gang is dead

376
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,780
and that should be the end of it.

377
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,780
It'll be bad for everyone

378
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,020
if we fall out with each other.

379
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,210
Scram!

380
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,210
Let's go.

383

for saving me.

384
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,690
Tell me about your police buddy

385
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,570
in Yunhe.

386
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,930
I heard that he helped you out a lot.

387
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,170
Your father's case,

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,170
the rehab center,

390
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,690
and the boxing casino.

391
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,210
He's pretty good for a lowly cop

392
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,290
who had just returned

393
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,980
to the Counter Narcotics Detachment.

394
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,410
What?

395
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
Did I say something wrong?

396
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,900
Why did you send me to Yunhe

397
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,500
since you knew Wan Heda long ago?

398
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,810
Wan Heda wouldn't have the chance

399
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,900
to join Mengka if you hadn't gone to Yunhe.

400
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,780
He's just a low-ranking cop.

401
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,660
He's young and he wishes
to achieve something great.

402
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,540
He was indebted to my dad.

403
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,980
He truly intended to help me avenge my dad.

404
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,930
From today onward,

405
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,020
you're my sworn brother.

406
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,570
I promise you

407
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,570
that I will surely avenge your dad for you.

408
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,500
However,

409
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,660
we must do it at the appropriate time.

[Counter Narcotics Detachment]

Bowen,

412
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,780
what's the situation?

413
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,290
According to the surveillance footage,

414
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,410
Wan Heda returned to Yunhe

415
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,170
at 2 PM.

416
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:57,690
After that,

417
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,860
he went to Wanlutong Logistics

418
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,780
and never left the building.

419
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,860
Where's Wu Zhenfeng?

420
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,050
There's no news of him yet.

421
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:03,900
Keep a close eye on them.

422
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,290
Yes, sir.

Ms. Qiong.

426
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,330
Seems like Mr. Yu is a bit worried.

427
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,660
After all,

428
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,410
it's been three years since we worked together.

429
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,210
We have to give it a try somehow.

430
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,570
They're not buying a huge amount anyway.

431
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,020
What about him?

432
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
Has he done this before?

433
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,260
It's his first time.

434
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,860
But he's pretty capable.

435
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,170
He's familiar with Yunhe too.

436
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,380
We have no one else to depend on.

437
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,660
Let's give it a try.

438
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,570
Thank you, Ms. Qiong.

439

Director Lin,

440
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,570
we found something suspicious

441
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,260
before the records

442
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,380
of Wanlutong Logistics were burned.

443
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,450
The vehicle that Wu Gang rode

444
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
belonged to Wanlutong Logistics.

445
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,330
However, the name of the driver was left blank.

446
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,500
So, Wu Zhenfeng must've left the border

447
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,290
to investigate

448
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,260
the cause of his dad's death.

449
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,570
You always go over your superior's head!

450
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,500
What's going on here?

451
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,330
Director Lin,

452
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,450
if Wu Zhenfeng was contacting
the drug dealers on purpose,

453
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,810
I'm sure he did so to lure them into his trap.

454
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,410
He will tell the police about this.

455
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,410
Hu Qingshan,

456

Yellow Capsules,

458
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,140
even Shu's boxing casino,

459
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:30,740
he told us everything.

460
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,290
Don't let him deceive you!

461
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,020
We found all of them

462
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,050
due to our own diligence!

463
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,900
Wu Zhenfeng told us nothing

464
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,860
beforehand!

465
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,450
He wasn't willing to help us!

466
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,660
He even harbored ulterior motives!

467
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,330
He even wanted to use us!

468
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,050
Director Lin,

469
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
it has been proven

470
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,330
that there's something wrong

471
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,090
with Wanlutong Logistics's accounts!

472
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,260
It was obvious that Wu Gang

473
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,900
wasn't smuggling anything

474
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
before he was killed!

475
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,860
From Shu's testimony,

476
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,620
we can be sure

477
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,540
that Wu Gang didn't turn against them.

478
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,740
That's why I don't think

479
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,930
Wu Zhenfeng is a drug lord.

480
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,090
That's impossible!

481
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,090
This is not how you deduce a case

482
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,020
as a police officer!

483
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,930
Who taught you this?

484
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,410
Mengka and K

485
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,930
contacted each other again

486
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,930
because Wu Zhenfeng arrived in Yunhe.

487
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,930
Isn't that the truth?

488
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:04,860
Yes, sir.

regarding our investigation and usage

491
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,740
of Wu Zhenfeng,

492
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,620
they cannot be judged from a surface level.

493
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,780
We have to base it

494
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,020
on all the information we have!

495
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,290
It paves the way for our investigation

496

of Mengka and K.

497
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,260
Do you agree?

Great.

However, in my opinion,

501
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,930
since we have incomplete information

about the situation,

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,380
I would rather believe in Wu Zhenfeng

00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,900
Your birthday party

513
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,140
is at 7 PM.

514
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,620
How could I forget?

515
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
I already bought your present.

516
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
I'll be right there. Don't worry.

517
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,090
I have some things to attend to at the moment.

518
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,540
Tell me.

519
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,090
The plush toys you see

520
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,900
on the racks of the coffee shop,

521
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,260
where's the nearest place that sells them?

522
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,410
Tell me!

523
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,330
The department store at Wuyi Square.

524
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,660
You better reflect on yourself!

525
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,980
Dong, these are the ingredients
for Yellow Capsules

526
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,410
you requested.

527
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,290
I've already delivered

528
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,620
the ingredients for Yaba to them.

529
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,210
They've started working on it.

530
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,050
I've arranged a deal with Guishou as well.

531
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,330
Mengka will be done for.

532
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,410
But what if

533
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,810
Wu Zhenfeng wasn't the smuggler?

534
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,020
What should we do then?

535
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,210
These are nougats

536
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,810
made from trehalose.

537
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,660
It's very milky.

538
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,980
Your family will surely love it.

539
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,620
Okay, thank you.

540
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,380
Hello.

541
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,210
I will have two bags.

542
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:14,780
All right.

543
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,780
Watch out.

544
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,050
Don't worry.

545
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:32,900
The drumsticks

546
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,330
look so appetizing.

547
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,740
Yeah, it looks great.

548
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,570
Later,

549
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,140
you should grab it.

550
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,020
It's mine then.

551
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,210
Ling,

552
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:48,660
I think

553
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,290
you should head downstairs.

554
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,050
The air is still down there.

555
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,500
If I must say,

556
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,500
why don't we

557
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,620
let Director Lin handle it?

558
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,090
It's pretty troublesome indeed.

559
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,380
I'll go.

560
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,900
I know my dad's temper.

561
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,410
I'll go.

562
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,780
I told you before.

563
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,780
Wu Zhenfeng was a member of Mengka.

564
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,450
Both Mengka and K are drug cartels.

565
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,540
If you keep him here,

566
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,900
we'll get into trouble eventually.

567
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,690
Yesterday, our cafe was burned down.

568
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,090
Now, he has left the border.

569
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,810
Tell me then.

570
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,900
What exactly is he up to?

571
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,860
Yang.

572
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,540
I can no longer stop

573
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,540
my daughter.

574
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,500
Tonight,

575
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,210
you must express your stand.

576
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,020
Today's my birthday.

577
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,140
Can we talk about something else?

578
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,050
That's right.

579
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,450
Here's your birthday present!

580
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,260
Lingling, here.

581
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,090
I'll put it on the rack then.

582
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:04,900
I...

583
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:05,810
Over there.

584
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,500
I'll put it over there.

585
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:06,980
That's right.

586
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,290
I...

587
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,210
Maybe over here.

588
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,020
Over here.

589
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,500
What do you think?

590
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,290
That's great.

591
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,330
Put it over there.

592
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,210
Here?

593
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,660
You've bought her the same thing for 17 years.

594
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,930
How long

595
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,980
do you intend to continue this?

596
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,020
You see,

597
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
Lingling likes them.

598
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,330
That's why I have to buy her one

599
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,050
for every birthday,

600
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,690
don't you think so?

601
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,780
Let me do it.

602
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,620
Come on.

603
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:48,570
Dad,

604
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,810
what present did you buy for me?

605
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,980
I can unwrap it myself.

606
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,810
A laptop?

607
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,260
I always wanted this!

608
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,050
Thanks, Dad!

609
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,450
I love it!

610
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,660
Thank you.

611
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,260
I'm serious!

612
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
The cake is here!

613
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:16,980
The cake is here.

614
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,170
Mr. Yang.

615
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,090
You guys are so early.

616
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,170
Here's a box of nougat.

617
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,740
Lingling said it's your favorite.

618
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,380
This was the last box.

619
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,660
I bought it especially for you.

620
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:33,780
I'm out of hands. Please hold it for me.

621
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,690
Dad, take it.

622
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,050
Uncle?

623
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,620
I'm back.

624
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,050
Uncle.

625
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:25,660
Uncle,

626
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,500
I'll spend the night outside tomorrow.

627
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,050
I just got a huge job.

628
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,330
A rich man

629
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,570
is paying me a lot for this.

630
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,210
You don't need to wait for me tomorrow.

631
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,930
Uncle,

632
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,450
I have something funny to tell you.

633
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
The man tried to act secretive

634
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,170
and got himself a nickname.

635
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,620
What's his nickname again?

636
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,660
Wait a second.

637
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,410
I think it was Guishou.

638
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,570
He went to Gou

639
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,090
and said he was looking for people

640
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,540
who knew how to make tea cakes.

641
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,780
If he wasn't a rich idiot,

642
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,820
I wouldn't have agreed to his request.

643
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,500
I thought I could repay my debt.

644
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,930
Who was it?

645
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,890
Who did you say?

646
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,210
Where? Where is he recruiting them?

647
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,780
You scared me.

648
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:23,890
Uncle.

649
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,820
Uncle,

650
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,540
is there something wrong

651
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,340
with this job?

652
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,260
It's nothing.

653
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,610
For this job,

654
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,690
you should try to get a hold of it
as soon as possible.

655
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,370
Tell me if you have any news tomorrow.

656
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,580
Don't forget.

657
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,890
Before I blow out the candles,

658
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I would like to offer a toast

659
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,340
to both of my dads.

660
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,820
Lingling,

661
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,370
you can only offer a toast

662
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,410
to one father.

663
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,780
You can offer a toast to your dad first.

664
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,690
Dad.

665
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,410
Lingling,

666
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,170
offer a toast to Uncle Lin first.

667
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,100
Lingling,

668
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,540
you only have one father.

669
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,340
Here, Uncle Lin.

670
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,850
Lin Dezan,

671
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,650
with this drink,

672
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,500
I hope you can promise me something.

673
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,610
Promise me that you'll tell
Wu Zhenfeng to move out.

674
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,260
Yang.

675
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:41,690
Wait.

676
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,300
Mr. Yang.

677
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:42,930
Mr. Yang,

678
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,100
this is a misunderstanding.

679
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,060
Please allow me to explain.

680
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,210
Regarding yesterday's incident,

681
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
it was all my fault.

682
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,410
I just hope

They came to our door

685
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,980
and they hid their drugs in our shop.

686
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,300
How can I avoid them?

why I left the country

698
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,890
and why it took us a decade to reunite?

699
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,490
As long as you're my daughter,

700

you have to listen to me.

701

Yang, are you not done yet?

702

What happened 20 years ago was an accident.

703
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,140
It has nothing to do with her.

704

Today's her birthday.

705

Why must you do this to her?

it'll be worth it.
