you are now under arrest.

518
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,380
Take him away.

519
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,300
(Wu Zhenfeng.)

520
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,900
(Don't you feel guilty at all?)

521
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,900
(The one who murdered my dad)

522
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,420
(is still at large.)

523
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,220
Don't you feel guilty then?

524
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,340
It's been a while.

525
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,020
[Physical evidence]

526
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,780
From the suspect

527
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,700
Wu Zhenfeng's place,

528
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,340
we found

529
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,620
two rhubarb capsules, a new type of drug.

530
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,940
We found his fingerprints

531
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,020
at Hu Qingshan's murder scene.

532
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,340
So we can almost

533
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,140
close Hu Qingshan's murder case.

534
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,660
What about the rhubarb capsules?

535
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,580
I want leads for rhubarb capsules.

536
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,460
The drug cartel, their base,
the principal offender.

537
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,220
We'll get the info soon.
We'll investigate him tonight.

538
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,980
I want a complete picture.

539
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,460
One

540
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,180
that is without any mistakes.

541
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,820
Name?

542
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,820
I thought you

543
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,460
were still working
at Deshan West District Police Station.

544
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,660
So I went there to turn myself in.

545
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,460
Your name.

546
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,540
Wu Zhenfeng.

547
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,900
Do you use drugs?

548
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,180
I guess you've searched

549
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,340
my place thoroughly.

550
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,860
Why did you go to the Nancheng bus stop

551
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,180
at noon?

552
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,820
To buy drugs.

553
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,380
From whom?

554
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:15,900
Huang Daxian.

555
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,420
What's his real name?

556
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,900
No idea.

557
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,980
I just know that he's called Huang Daxian.

558
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,220
Back then,

559
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,860
you got into a black car,

560
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,500
were you guys dealing drugs

561
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,700
in the car?

562
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,700
The fact that you guys

563
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,100
were monitoring that place

564
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,820
shows that you've already found

565
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
the QQ group.

566
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,940
It was stated clearly in the group

567
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,380
that the trade will be done
at the Nancheng bus stop

568
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,860
instead of inside that car.

569
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,940
My addiction relapsed,

570
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,820
so I was there to see if I could get some for free.

571
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,540
You saw it yourself.

572
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,260
Someone kicked me out.

573
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,260
Do you think this

574
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,100
is how drug dealers do their trades?

575
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,060
Wu Zhenfeng.

576
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,300
Mind your attitude.

577
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,940
Just answer the question.

578
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:10,900
Chen Yu.

579
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,940
Go out.

580
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,780
Captain Liu.

581
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,460
Out.

582
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,500
Madam.

583
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,340
Where's the washroom?

584
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,900
It's a bit far from here.

585
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,020
Make a right turn at this junction,

586
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,100
walk another 100 meters, then you'll be there.

587
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,740
Thank you.
