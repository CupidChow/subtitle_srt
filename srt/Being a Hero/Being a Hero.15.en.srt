00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,040
that you're digging your own grave here?

350
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,110
We've messed up the deal with Mengka!

351
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,280
Do you think they'll let us off?

352
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,920
Name?

353
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,950
Liu Dazhuang.

354
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,310
Gender?

355
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,190
Male.

356
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,640
Where did you come from?

357
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,040
I'm not a local.

358
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,160
I came here to make a living.

359
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,560
How long have you been here?

360
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,110
Around six months.

361
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,070
All right.

362
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,190
What about you?

363
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,520
We came from the same place.

364
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,470
I came here to make a living too.

365
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,280
Dad!

366
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,830
Dad!

367
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,800
Dad!

368
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,000
Dad!

369
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,070
Dad!

370
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,230
Someone!

371
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,560
Help!

372
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,070
(This isn't it.)

373
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,470
(This is lime powder.)

374
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,000
(Shut the door!)

375
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,110
(None of you)

376
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,520
(shall leave this place alive!)

377
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,710
(Beat them up!)

378
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,070
(Feng, run!)

379
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,520
Wu Zhenfeng,

380
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,230
raise your head.

381
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,310
Who's this person

382
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,590
who sent you to the border?

383
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,070
Is he a member of Mengka?

384
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,800
(You're Guishou?)

385
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,000
Do you know me?

386
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,880
(You must be a cop.)

387
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,520
Fine, it's my fault.

388
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,430
(I'll follow your instruction.)

389
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,520
Wu Zhenfeng,

390
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
where are the real drugs?

391
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,230
(Feng,)

392
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,830
(why don't we head back?)

393
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,190
You may be able to return to Mengka

394
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,190
without any issues.

395
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,110
But what about me?

396
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,520
(I'm sure Dong)

397
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,560
(is trying to kill us here.)

398
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,190
(Dong is ruthless in Yunhe.)

399
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,430
Wu Zhenfeng, listen up.

400
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,920
Don't think that you'll get away easily

401
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,710
just because the drugs were fake.

402
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,190
You're a drug dealer.

403
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,430
(Feng!)

404
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,710
The factory is crumbling!

405
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,160
Feng!

406
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,230
But judging from your expression,

407
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,680
it seems like you were in the dark.

408
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,160
Do you know

409
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,470
who set you up?

410
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,070
Why did you head to the tea factory

411
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,110
that night?

412
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,310
To make some money.

413
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,830
Who recruited you?

414
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,280
Guishou.

415
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Gou brought me there.

416
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,310
Who recruited you?

417
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,400
Gou.

418
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,670
Tell me the time and location.

419
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,800
It was on the 14th.

420
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,120
As for the location,

421
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,710
it was in the alley of an urban village.

422
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,470
It was on the 14th,

423
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,430
in an urban village.

424
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,470
It was on the 14th, in an urban village.

425
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,710
Who else was present?

426
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,280
Ma.

427
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,520
And Dou.

428
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,710
Ma.

429
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,430
And Lei...

430
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,800
Lei.

431
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,190
The second screen.

432
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,800
(How did you guys enter the tea factory?)

433
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
(Gou brought me in.)

434
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,390
(He knew the people there.)

435
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,910
(Do you know)

436
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,600
(the people who met up with you?)

437
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,560
(I don't.)

438
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,280
It was Gou's connection.

439
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,080
Gou again?

440
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,910
You beat up Gou Sheng in his house,

441
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:55,910
yet you still refer to him so politely?

442
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,280
I beat him up because he owed me some money.

443
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,390
He paid up

444
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,950
and introduced this job to me.

445
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,080
I have to listen to him.

446
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,080
That's the rule.

447
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,870
These two are different matters.

448
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,280
Gou

449
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,000
and Guishou

450
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,870
are very close with Wu Zhenfeng.

451
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,150
Officer,

452
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,910
Wu Zhenfeng was smuggling drugs.

453
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,390
I'm serious.

454
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,430
But I didn't do so.

455
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,230
I don't dare to do so.

456
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,000
You said Wu Zhenfeng was smuggling drugs.

457
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,760
Do you have any proof?

458
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,080
He comes from Mengka.

459
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,280
In a place

460
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,630
like Mengka,

461
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,000
everyone is doing drugs.

462
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,910
Seems like you know Wu Zhenfeng quite well.

463
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,280
How many times have you seen him?

464
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,230
I don't know him well.

465
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,630
Today's our first encounter.

466
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,120
You beat him up before, didn't you?

467
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,600
And you did it more than once.

468
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,760
I did beat him up once.

469
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,150
But that was the only time.

470
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,000
Do you know He Jiashu?

471
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,230
He Jiashu?

472
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,950
I don't.

473
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,190
But he knows you.

474
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,910
(You heard from Chen Yu)

475
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,390
(that we were going to deploy our men, right?)

476
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,950
(Who else did you tell)

477
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,000
(after receiving the news?)

478
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,710
How did you enter the drug rehab center

479
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,120
and how did you get out?

480
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,280
You have someone who can protect you
in the Public Security Bureau?

481
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,280
Or is he in Mengka?

482
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,470
Who is that person?

483
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,910
Do I know him?

484
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,190
Officer!

485
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,120
What kind of questions are these?

486
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,520
Why are you asking me

487
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,470
about these sidekicks?

488
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,520
Don't you know

489
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,560
what happened last night?

490
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,080
Can't you just ask me
about what happened last night?

491
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Why did you even bring me here?

492
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,150
Who told you to burn down the tea factory?

493
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,280
Burn down the tea factory?

494
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,600
You guys think I torched the tea factory?

495
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,670
How could it be me?

496
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,670
You work for K, don't you?

497
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,600
Who's your boss?

498
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,600
My boss?

499
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,360
My boss is Liu Kaihua.

500
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,000
Do you know him?

501
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,360
Liu Kaihua

502
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,150
is my uncle.

503
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,390
He was the one who told me

504
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,360
to do all of these tonight.

505
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,080
What's with the questions?

506
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,040
Do you guys think I'm a criminal?

507
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,120
Officer,

508
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,910
I risked my life

509
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,760
to film the videos

510
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,710
that you guys are watching

511
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,190
on your computer screen right now,

512
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,760
did you know that?

513
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,360
Why are you shouting?

514
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,360
Everyone present

515
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,560
will have to be interrogated.

516
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,000
No exceptions are allowed.

517
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,800
Understood?

518
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,520
I don't!

519
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,360
I filmed the videos for you guys.

520
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,280
If you have any other questions,

521
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,630
you can ask your chief of detachment.

522
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,190
K made the deal with you, right?

523
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,600
Since they've agreed to make a deal with you,

524
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,390
I assume you've met many of their members.

525
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,190
Who are they?

526
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,950
The deal that couldn't be done three years ago,

527
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,520
I'll do it today.

528
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,560
On account of our first encounter,

529
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,000
I'll leave you with a complete body.

530
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,320
Sit.

531
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,520
Even if you know the truth,

532
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,840
your dad cannot be revived.

533
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,760
You won't get off this easily

534
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,560
if I see you

535
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,230
in Yunhe again.

536
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,430
They torched the tea factory.

537
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,950
They wanted to take your life.

538
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,560
Even so, you're still trying to defend them?

539
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,000
Tell me.

540
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,080
Who are the members of K?

541
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,950
Who's the boss of K?

542
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,470
(Uncle,)

543

(are you coming home for dinner?)

544

Buy a steam pot chicken

545
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,670
on your way home.

546
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,800
Wu Zhenfeng, answer me!

547
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,390
It was Jiang Lei.

548
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,630
Go and ask Jiang Lei.

549
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,320
He knows

550
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,390
much more than me.

551
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,230
Are you doing this on purpose?

552
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,260
[First People's Hospital of Yunhe County]
[Outpatient Department]

553
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,230
Dad.

554
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,600
I have no appetite.

555
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,280
Just leave it there for now.

556
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,840
I'll have it later.

557
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,950
Dad, I'm sorry.

558
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,670
I shouldn't have trusted Wu Zhenfeng.

559
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,800
You were implicated because of me.

560
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,950
Silly girl,

561
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,430
I'm your dad.

562
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,080
I will never be implicated by you

563
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,120
Dad,

564
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,700
I believe Chen Yu and the rest

565
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,380
will definitely get to the bottom of it.

566
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,780
I do not

567
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,780
expect much from him.

568
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,980
Yang.

569
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,940
Yang.

570
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,580
Look at what we brought.

571
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Uncle Lin, pass it to me.

572
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,540
Mr. Yang.

573

How was it?

574
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,660
Are you okay?

575
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,380
Mr. Yang, are you okay?

Mr. Zhuo,

577
