Of course, it's insufficient to be the evidence,

to raise suspicion.

121

Wan owned it.

You can't rush it.

The more desperate you are,

It's all Wan Heda's fault.

He's a coward.

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,750
He called you

348
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,870
many times.

349
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,630
Why didn't you pick up?

350
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,950
You're with Mengka.

351
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,470
I'm with K.

352
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,950
Tell that to Erliang.

353
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,900
You can leave now.

354
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,590
We were all set up

355
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,900
that day in the tea factory.

356
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,870
Erliang asked me to come here

357
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,900
because he still respects you.

358
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,350
Do not take it for granted.

359
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,870
Try me.

360
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,260
You two are...

361
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,470
Hi, is Mr. Wan here?

362
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,780
We're from Yunhe Counter Narcotics Detachment.

363
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,470
Why do you want to see him?

364
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,710
We'd like to know more

365
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,710
about Wan Mengmeng.

366
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,230
I hope he can cooperate with us.

367
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,140
Mengmeng?

368
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,110
Mengmeng is not here.

369
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,140
You see...

370
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,060
What's the matter?

371
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,950
Mengmeng left on the 17th

372
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,020
and hasn't come back since.

373
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,060
Hi, Mr. Wan.

374
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,750
Hi.

375
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,870
On the 17th,

376
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,870
there was a death reported

377
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,660
in Yundian Disco

378
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,750
due to

379
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,110
drug use.

380
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,540
Your daughter

381
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,350
was with the victim,

382
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,470
and according to the evidence on the scene

383
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,780
and the camera footage,

384
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,020
we suspect

385
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,950
that Wan Mengmeng
is involved in an illegal drug trade.

386
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,140
Can we talk inside?

387
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,950
Mr. Wan.

388
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,590
How many people occupy this house?

389
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,830
Just Mengmeng and I.

390
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,950
And the housekeeper.

391
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:52,990
What time

392
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,990
did Mengmeng leave that night?

393
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,260
After nine.

394
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,140
She left after dinner

395
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,380
and said she was hanging out with friends.

396
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,780
She hasn't returned until now.

397
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,110
I can't reach her phone either.

398
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,990
By the way,

399
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,180
can you

400
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,590
investigate thoroughly?

401
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,870
My daughter does not deal drugs.

402
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,020
Like I said,

403
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,780
we are only suspecting her.

404
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,020
We still hope

405
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,990
that she

406
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,780
can come to us

407
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,230
and explain everything.

408
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,710
If you see her

409
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,990
or know where she is,

410
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,180
please advise her

411
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
to come to us

412
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,630
to tell us the truth.

413
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,300
We'll appreciate it.

414
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,300
Oh, Mr. Wan.

415
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,900
Where is Mengmeng's room?

416
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,350
Can we have a look?

417
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,350
Mr. Wan.

418
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,060
Is this the only room on the second floor?

419
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,780
Yes, only Mengmeng lives on the second floor.

420
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,300
Mengmeng

421
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,180
is not a bad kid.

422
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,110
She has her temper, that's all.

423
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,540
I don't think

424
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,300
she'll ever

425
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
commit a crime.

426
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,900
Anran!

427
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,110
I truly don't know about this.

428
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,540
It has nothing to do with me.

429
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,870
I'm not aware of it.

430
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,750
I truly know nothing about it.

431
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,020
What is this?

432
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,990
I don't know.

433
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,140
If you have

434
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
any news,

435
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,420
please inform us right away.

436
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,630
It's the best you can do

437
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,510
as her family.

438
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,900
Chen Yu is calling?

439
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,660
Look to your right.

440
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,590
Behind the gray car.

441
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,660
Why are you here?

442
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:18,990
Get in first.

443
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,750
We'll talk later.

444
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,590
Hurry.

445
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,710
Mr. Wan.

446
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,060
Your family is in deep trouble.

447
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,870
Bugger off.

448
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,830
Erliang wants you

449
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,780
to call him back.

450
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,510
I'm here on his order.

451
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,950
Tell him I won't.

452
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,230
Erliang.

453
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,750
What are you trying to do?

454
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,420
You sent someone to my house

455
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,140
to intimidate me?

456
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,510
Make him

457
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,590
leave my house.

458
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,780
Wan.

459
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,710
It's not nice of you

460
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,510
to set us up.

461
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,140
Mr. Yu is very angry. He wants to get his revenge
on Hao Dong

462
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,630
and he wants you to work for us.

463
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,300
What he means by that

464
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,060
is that since we go way back,

465
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,780
we cannot fault you for the feud

466
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,260
between us and Hao Dong.

467
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,420
This has nothing to do with me.

468
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,300
I wasn't aware that Hao Dong

469
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,870
was setting you up.

470
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,750
Tell your man

471
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,990
to get out of my house now.

472
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,540
Erliang.

473
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,660
It's me.

474
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,780
Wan is in trouble now.

475
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,900
The police are looking for her daughter.

476
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,230
Wan.

477
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,590
What happened to your daughter?

478
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,540
Wan.

479
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,990
Wu Zhenfeng?

480
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,260
Why is he here?

481
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,020
He went in before you.

482
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,300
Listen.

483
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,180
Wu Zhenfeng

484
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:40,870
must be close

485
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,630
to Wan.

486
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,540
He came...

487
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,350
Chen Yu.

488
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,060
You're now

489
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,110
on a temporary suspension.

490
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,750
Stop making more mistakes.

491
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,540
I have told Director Lin about this.

492
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,510
I said Wu Zhenfeng would do something

493
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,350
once he is out.

494
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,710
Director Lin refused to listen.

495
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,950
Yang Yi is right.

496
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,510
Stop spying here.

497
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,380
Go back.

498
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,540
Don't tell them I was here.

499
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,110
Why are you so stubborn?

500
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,780
Go back now.

501
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,950
Do not waste your time

502
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,870
on me.

503
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,470
Your vendetta against Hao Dong
has nothing to do with me.

504
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,300
I just want

505
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,950
my daughter's safe return.

506
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,710
What do you want us to do?

507
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,830
I don't want you to do anything.

508
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,900
I want my daughter.

509
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,180
Feng.

510
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,300
Yes, Erliang?

511
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,180
I don't care what you do.

512
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,950
Make sure Wan Mengmeng returns in one piece.

513
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,630
You hear me?

514
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,590
Yes.

515
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,950
Bring me my daughter

516
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,940
and we'll talk.

517
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,270
This is what

518
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,670

nearby Donghu.

in Yundian Disco.

we can confirm the driver is Wang Yikun.

00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,220
Sorry.

692
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,180
Sorry.

693
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,590
I shouldn't have touched drugs.

694
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,390
Just let me go.

695
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,590
Let me leave with Kun.

696
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,790
I'm pregnant.

697
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,980
I'm pregnant.

698
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,660
After Wu Zhenfeng was released,

699
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,980
he went to Wan Heda's house right away.

700
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,390
Then, he escaped with Wan Mengmeng.

701
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,350
Don't you think

702
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,830
something is fishy?

703
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,900
I watched over

704
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,260
Wu Zhenfeng all day long

705
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,660
and I found Wan Mengmeng.

706
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,590
If you had listened to me

707
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,900
and planned an ambush,

708
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
he wouldn't have escaped.

709
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,980
Look at you now.

710
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,980
I get it.

711
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,660
Go back home.

712
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,630
Treat your wounds.

713
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,700
We cannot just sit by and do nothing.

714
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,030
Director Lin.

715
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,630
I want to keep watching Wu Zhenfeng.

716
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,740
My work

717
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,660
has been suspended anyway.

718
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,030
I have plenty of time to keep an eye on him.

719
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,660
I know where he lives.

720
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,830
Do not follow

721
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,830
this lead anymore.

722
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,590
You.

723
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,550
Write a reflection report tomorrow morning

724
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,390
and give it to Chief Liu.

725
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,660
A thorough

726
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,630
reflection.

727
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,070
Call Erliang.

728
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,980
Get off my back.

729
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,830
Dr. Yu.

730
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,390
Where is she?

731
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,070
On the third floor.

732
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,350
Come in.

733
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,870
Dr. Yu.

734
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,870
Mengmeng is pregnant.

735
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
Be mindful of the dosage.

736
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,790
Can you call him now?

737
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,110
You are relentless.

738
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,180
How many times have I told you

739
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,070
I'll do it later?

740
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,390
Dong.

741
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,150
Wu Zhenfeng

742
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,500
rescued Wan Mengmeng.

743
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,350
Will Wan

744
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,590
work for Mengka now?

745
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,390
Will he betray us?

746
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:26,940
Dong.

747
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,870
I don't think

748
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,500
Wan Heda has the guts

749
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,740
to bet with her daughter's life

750
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,790
against me.

751
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,350
I'll go to him.

752
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,350
Erliang.

753
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,220
You still want to eliminate Hao Dong?

754
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,980
In a week,

755
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,180
they will deliver a batch from Kumon Range

756
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,900
to Shengjiang.

757
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,870
Yellow Capsules.

758
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,500
Is Wu Zhenfeng there?

759
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,070
Erliang.

760
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,260
Your work is done there.

761
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,660
