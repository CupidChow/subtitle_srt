00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,290
Director Lin.

176
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,020
Chief Liu is here too.

177
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,780
You shouldn't barge in.

178
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,410
Was Wu Zhenfeng home

179
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,530
last night?

180
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,970
No, he came back this morning.

181
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,940
Did he mention where he went?

182
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,610
I didn't ask.

183
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,170
I didn't have the time.

184
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,900
How can you leave out

185
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,970
such an important detail?

186
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
I...

187
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,850
I...

188
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,460
What can I help?

189
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,650
Director Lin.

190
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:29,900
Thanks to

191
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,220
our investigation of the Wu Gang case,

192
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,260
we have earned

193
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,220
Wu Zhenfeng's trust.

194
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,090
I want to get to the bottom

195
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,780
of the Wu Gang case

196
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,780
to further persuade Wu Zhenfeng.

197
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,290
With his help,

198
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,460
we can eradicate K.

199
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,380
Chen Yu.

200
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,820
Answer me first.

201
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,220
Did Wu Zhenfeng deal drugs?

202
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,090
Do you have the answer?

203
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:47,940
Chief Liu.

204
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,410
I believe

205
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,490
my investigation was thorough enough.

206
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,380
Wu Zhenfeng came back to Yunhe

207
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,170
to avenge his father.

208
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,490
Even if he was involved with drugs,

209
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,490
he didn't play a major role.

210
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,730
I want to get his help.

211
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,850
And if he would like,

212
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,490
I want to save him too.

213
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,490
Chen Yu.

214
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,460
Be mindful of your stance.

215
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,730
Have you forgotten the lesson
from three years ago?

216
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,900
Sir.

217
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,700
Three years ago, Wu Zhenfeng

218
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,090
insisted that his father wasn't a drug dealer.

219
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:14,940
At the moment,

220
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,260
it does look like Wu Gang was framed.

221
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,490
That's just one side of the story

222
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,460
told by He Jiashu.

223
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,970
How can you prove that Wu Gang

224
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,580
wasn't a drug dealer?

225
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,610
That's why I'm investigating.

226
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,820
Chief Liu.

227
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,260
Wu Zhenfeng is the only clue we have now

228
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,780
that can lead us to K.

229
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,780
I would choose...

230
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,940
to believe him.

231
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,780
Where do we start?

232
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,730
Director Lin.

233
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,410
According to the clue provided by Wu Zhenfeng,

234
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,820
the car Wu Gang used to exit the region
before he was killed...

235
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,970
belonged to Wanlutong Logistics.

236
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,900
I need a warrant to get all info

237
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,220
regarding the vehicles and the drivers

238
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,780
to re-enact the scene.

239
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,580
Wan Heda of Wanlutong Logistics

240
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,050
is a famous entrepreneur

241
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,020
in Yunhe.

242
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,970
He's reputable

243
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,140
and you want to investigate him.

244
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,970
Remember this then.

245
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,220
Make sure you sound humble.

246
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,850
Don't let him get your Achilles' heel.

247
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,940
You'll be in deep trouble then.

248
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,090
Noted.

249
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,380
Also,

250
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,730
all details of this case

251
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,820
are not to be made privy to Wu Zhenfeng.

252
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,820
Can I have that?

253
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:29,780
Yes, sir.

254
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,410
Chen Yu.

255
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,580
I'll reiterate this.

256
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,380
Unless you're under special circumstances,

257
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,780
do not report above your immediate superior.

258
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,050
Yes, sir.

259
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,020
Go now.

260
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,140
Chief Liu, I shall get going.

261
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,700
Director Lin.

262
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,260
Chen Yu is still young.

263
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,020
I'm worried

264
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,260
that he might be used by Wu Zhenfeng.

265
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,290
Kaihua.

266
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,340
When

267
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,410
I see him,

268
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,940
he sometimes

269
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,940
reminds me of you when you were young.

270
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,650
We will pay close attention

271
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,650
to Wu Zhenfeng.

272
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,610
If we are sure that he is

273
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,460
a drug dealer,

274
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,380
we will prioritize Chen Yu's safety.

275
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,460
Okay.

276
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,060
Thanks, Dong.

277
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,890
Dong.

278
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,260
Do you truly want to work

279
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,420
with Mengka?

280
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,530
What is the name of the person

281
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,180
close to Wu Zhenfeng?

282
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,890
Guishou.

283
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,180
Find him.

284
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,530
Ask him to tell Wu Zhenfeng

285
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,130
that tomorrow morning,

286
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,770
he'll need to pick someone up in Walin Town.

287
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,500
I'll on it now, Dong.

288
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,620
Kun.

289
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,660
Go to Kundu later.

290
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,540
Can is waiting there.

291
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,780
Ask him to have a look at the goods.

292
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,500
This will be your formal meet-up

293
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,690
with him.

294
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,380
For all subsequent batches,

you will be in charge of the hand-off.

296

Use Wan's channel.

297

What about Mr. Wan then?

298

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,450
Is that so?

347
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,090
Not for the money?

348
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,380
Tell me.

349
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,260
How long have you known Mengmeng?

350
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,410
How long have you known Mengmeng?

351
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,050
Tell me.

352
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,020
Why wouldn't Wan agree to it?

353
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,690
Why does he always say no?

354
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,930
Why?

355
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,860
Not for the money?

356
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,330
Without money, he'll ignore you.

357
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,980
He won't let you date Mengmeng,

358
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,780
and you two will eventually have a fallout.

359
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,170
Have you thought about that?

360
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,540
Have you?

361
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,330
When will you fall out with him?

362
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,660
Today?

363
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,020
Tomorrow?

364
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,410
When?

365
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,500
You don't want to fall out with him?

366
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,500
You will get nothing then.

367
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,290
He'll refuse to listen.

368
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,620
You won't have anything.

369
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,740
The paperwork is done?

370
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,810
Yes.

371
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,210
I'm reminding you again.

372
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,410
Remember what you said last night.

373
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,570
I won't forget it.

374
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,090
Lei.

375
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,170
Lei.

376
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,290
You're out.

377
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,290
Yes.

378
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,290
I'm here to pick you two up.

379
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
To welcome you back.

380
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,450
No need, Lei.

381
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,780
We can just walk back.

382
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,740
Did you meet my uncle last night?

383
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,660
Yes.

384
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,330
Don't worry, Lei.

385
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,780
I said nothing.

386
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,690
You met him.

387
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,290
Okay.

388
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,210
Let's talk in the car.

389
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,900
No need.

390
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,930
We can walk back.

391
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,090
Mr. Wan.

392
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,290
Based on our information,

393
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,050
on the 28th of August,

394
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,140
2016,

395
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,660
Wu Gang transported a batch of jade stones

396
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,620
back here.

397
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,020
He hired a vehicle from your company.

398
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,570
Yes,

399
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,210
he did.

400
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,450
Do you know drugs were stowed away in that car?

401
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,620
How can I possibly know

402
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,690
that there were drugs in the car?

403
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,860
You don't check the goods
when you load them into the car?

404
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,330
Officer Chen.

405
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,500
The goods belong to the customers.

406
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,570
I just transport them.

407
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,290
Mr. Wan.

408
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,540
Can you provide us

409
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,380
with the info regarding the driver?

410
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,810
Li.

411
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,330
Do we have that?

412
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,500
Mr. Wan.

413
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,050
We can't provide that.

414
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,090
Why not?

415
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,500
Officers.

416
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,210
We were still a small company back then.

417
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,570
Drivers came and went.

418
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,500
They didn't leave any info.

419
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,810
If you truly need it,

420
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,170
I can try looking into it.

421
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,900
Can you give us

422
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,450
the soft copy of the vehicle record that day?

423
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,410
Officers.

424
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,380
Back then, we recorded it with our hands.

425
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,330
There is no digital copy.

426
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,450
Then get the written record.

427
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,740
Hello?

428
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,780
Mr. Wan.

429
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,380
Mengmeng is having a relapse again.

430
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,570
What should I do?

431
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,570
Why are you wasting the time then?

432
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,290
Get Dr. Yu now.

433
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,090
Mr. Wan.

434
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,330
What should we do?

435
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:22,780
Stop pestering me.

436
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,930
Deal with it yourself.

437
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,260
You hear what I said?

438
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,290
I need it.

439
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,620
Just one pill.

440
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,780
Just one.

441
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,210
Just one.

442
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,290
Mengmeng, listen to me.

443
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,020
I'm on my way to Kundu.

444
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,690
I can't head back now.

445
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,980
Call Dr. Yu.

446
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,570
Pour it.

447
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,210
You're going to Kundu?

448
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,380
Why are you going there?

449
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,500
To Kundu...

450
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,780
I need the pill.

451
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,170
I need it now.

452
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,900
It's so hot. I'm dying.

453
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
You idiot.

454
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,690
Did you not understand my instruction?

455
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,290
How can you

456
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,660
let them get their hands on that?

457
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,020
Mr. Wan.

458
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,210
They followed me way too closely.

459
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,260
I didn't have the time

460
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,290
to destroy those documents.

461
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,570
What should we do then?

462
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,380
Find several reliable people

463
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,620
and get those things

464
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,330
back.

465
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,930
Otherwise, we are screwed.

466
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,210
Wu Zhenfeng knows a cop.

467
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,740
What is their relationship?

468
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,380
The cop

469
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,410
seems to be

470
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,860
his childhood friend.

471
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,170
Seems?

472
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,500
How else

473
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,290
did he get out

474
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,500
of the rehab that quickly?

475
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,980
He even get to decide

476
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,900
when he would be let out.

477
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,330
That cop even had someone

478
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,540
transfer money to him.

479
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,900
So,

480
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,690
Wu Zhenfeng works for the police?

481
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,500
Definitely not.

482
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,660
He went to ruin Shu's boxing casino

483
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,570
and he almost beat Shu to death.

484
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,570
If he works for the police,

485
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,020
he wouldn't dare to kill someone.

486
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,620
Lei.

487
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:06,900
Find a time

488
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,210
to fetch Wu Zhenfeng a message.

489
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,020
Tell him to pick someone up
in Walin Town tomorrow.

490
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,500
If he fails to do that,

491
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,660
you know the consequences, don't you?

492
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,170
Of course.

493
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,090
Let's go.

494
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,290
Yaba...

495
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,500
Yaba...

496
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,660
Wan Heda.

497
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,980
I want it.

498
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,570
Wan Heda.

499
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,740
I want it.

500
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,050
I want it.

501
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,810
I want it.

502
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,540
Give me Yaba.

503
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,740
Dad.

504
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,810
I'm begging you.

505
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,570
I'm suffering.

506
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,500
Yaba.

507
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,290
Just one. Dad.

508
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,620
I beg you.

509
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,690
Mengmeng.

510
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,570
Dr. Yu is here.

511
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,450
I don't want Dr. Yu.

512
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,050
I want Yaba.

513
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,570
Hurry up and cross-check.

514
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,450
Find anything.

515
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,380
I have to bring it back to the bureau.

516
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,050
[Vehicle Registration Form]

517
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,450
We have gone through almost all of it.

518
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,570
Look.

519
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,540
Other than the empty

520
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:39,900
driver column

521
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,050
on the 28th of August,

522
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,500
the rest is normal.

523
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,090
The 28th of August.

524
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,570
The logistics company for this jade company,

525
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,780
Wanlutong Logistics.

526
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,410
Driver...

527
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,260
Nothing here.

528
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,810
It looks like it has been tampered with.

529
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,500
Can this prove

530
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
something's fishy with my dad's death?

531
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,330
Be back in a second.

532
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,290
Yaba.

533
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,170
Let go of me.

534
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,090
Yaba.

535
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,020
I want it.

536
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:26,740
Speak.

537
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,860
Mr. Wan.

538
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,900
I have followed them

539
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,500
to where they live.

540
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,050
Don't worry.

541
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,210
And how long did you take?

542
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,380
This is just one small thing.

543
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,690
You're supposed to do it in five minutes,

544
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,740
but you took one freaking day.

545
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,450
Yaba...

546
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,810
Get it done now.

547
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,860
Now!

548
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,570
Got it.

549
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,620
Give it to me.

550
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,290
Give it to me.

551
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,980
Wan Heda!

552
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,330
Upstairs.

553
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,860
Are you Wu Zhenfeng?

554
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,740
Stop right there!

555
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,020
Zhang, what happened?

556
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,740
They were carrying bats.

557
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,210
Call the police.

558
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:28,900
Okay.

559
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,980
Get the thing then scoot.

560
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,050
Let go of me.

561
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,500
I called the police.

562
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,020
I called the police.

563
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,380
Burn the documents. Burn them.

564
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,380
Let go!

565
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,330
I called the police!

566
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,570
Let go of me!

567
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,450
I called the police!

568
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,900
I called the police!

569
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,780
Are you okay?

570
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,290
I'm fine.

571
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,140
Put out the fire.

572
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,500
Speak.

573
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,540
Mr. Wan.

574
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,930
We didn't get the documents back,

575
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,290
but we burned them.

576
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,570
Nothing was left.

577
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,900
I will do the hand-off from now on.

578
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:16,930
We'll use

579
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,380
the same channel.

580
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,860
Kun.

581
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,740
Won't you

582
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,090
cross Wan like this?

583
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,140
You want the goods.

584
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,570
As long as they are here,

585
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,020
who cares who delivers them?

586
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,900
Have a look.

587
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,410
Dong is a man of his words.

588
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,290
Name your price.

589
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,780
Yaba. 10% of the cut.

590
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:54,860
And the capsules?

591
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,380
We only made two bundles,

592
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,740
so 200 yuan will do.

593
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,170
When is the delivery?

594
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,210
Morning the day after tomorrow.

595
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:01,860
Okay.

596
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,540
She's asleep.

597
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,930
Wan.

598
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,660
Every time she has a withdrawal symptom,

599
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,900
you call me in.

600
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,170
Then, you leave her high and dry.

601
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,900
You can't

602
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,050
carry on like this.

603
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,900
Mengmeng grew up without a mother.

604
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,210
I owe her.

605
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,540
Help me help her,

606
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,860
will you?

607
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,380
I told you

608
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,860
to send her to the rehab center.

609
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,780
I'll help her stay clean.

610
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,980
No.

611
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,570
She's still young. She has a future.

612
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,740
Once she's in the rehab center,

613
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,020
it's all gone.

614
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,090
Besides, I'm Wan Heda.

615
00:31:59,410 --> 00:31:59,980
I can't possibly

616
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,330
have a daughter addicted to drugs.

617
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,380
What kind of darned logic is that?

618
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,290
She grew up without a mother, you said?

619
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,540
You mean

620
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
no one was there to discipline her?

621
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,420
Is it Mengmeng's fault for taking drugs?

622
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,730
It's yours.

623
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,900
It's your responsibility.

624
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,370
It's your sin.

625
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,970
All patients

626
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,420
in my rehab center

627
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,060
have their own reason to take drugs.

628
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,900
Loneliness,

629
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,420
emptiness,

630
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,130
lack of education.

631
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,730
In the end, it's the lack of love.

632
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,210
They don't feel loved.

633
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,250
Do you have love in you?

634
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,370
Do you love her?

635
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,060
I'm telling you now.

636
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,020
If you don't send Mengmeng

637
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,020
to a rehab center,

638
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,850
she will be too far gone.

639
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,450
Also,

640
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,610
look around you.

641
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,060
Why are you still so hung up on your pride?

642
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,450
Pride... Pride!

643
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,210
Can your pride save her life?

644
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,970
I'm telling you.

645
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,900
She's gone.

646
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,850
She's beyond salvation.

647
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,210
Thank you.

648
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,730
Thanks.

649
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,490
There are germs on it.

650
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,210
Mr. Wan.

651
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,490
I have talked to Can.

652
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,490
For the batch on the day after tomorrow,

653
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,450
I want to deliver them

654
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,940
alongside Mengka's goods.

655
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,180
Mr. Wan?

656
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,300
I thought Can

657
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,540
was supposed to contact me.

658
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
I let Kun do it.

659
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,370
Kun.

660
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,900
You went to Kundu today

661
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,180
to meet Can?

662
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:15,970
Mr. Wan.

663
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,140
Don't overthink this.

664
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,490
Zhuo called me.

665
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,690
He said it was urgent.

666
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,490
I didn't have time to plan everything,

667
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,540
so I told Kun to deliver the goods.

668
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,580
I had to get in touch with Mengka
as soon as possible,

669
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,690
and I didn't want to be late.

670
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,060
Isn't Wu Zhenfeng in Yunhe?

671
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,170
Go to him.

672
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,860
Mr. Wan.

673
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,580
If you can,

674
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,620
are you willing

675
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,690
to head to Mengka?

676
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,380
Yes.

677
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,300
I count on you then.

678
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,300
Someone will pick you up tomorrow morning

679
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,650
in Walin Town.

680
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,380
You have had everything ready.

681
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,410
You'll know once you're there.

682
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,300
Hao Dong.

683
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
Can I ask you

684
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,170
a question?

685
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,540
Do you truly want to do business

686
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,450
with Mengka?

687
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,060
Mr. Wan.

688
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,170
If I don't want to do business with them,

689
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,380
why would I send you there?

690
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,020
After all,

691
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,060
among all the people here,

692
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,020
they

693
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,730
only trust you.

694
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,170
What?

695
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,410
Feng.

696
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,100
I heard from K

697
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,780
that they are sending someone

698
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,450
to Mengka to negotiate a deal.

699
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,380
They want you to pick the person up

700
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,380
tomorrow morning.

701
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:53,540
Who?

702
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,100
Where?

703
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,780
They said he knows you.

704
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,970
It'll be in Walin Town.

705
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,450
The person will go to you.

706
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,970
He knows me?

707
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,860
Feng.

708
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,340
Do you think this is a trap?

709
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,730
Were they

710
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,820
after Wu Zhenfeng?

711
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,970
Not necessarily.

712
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,690
Why then?

713
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,930
Sorry, Yang Ling.

714
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,380
We found

715
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,100
a clue about my dad's case.

716
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,780
They were here because of this.

717
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,170
What did you find?

718
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,020
Which company?

719
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,650
Tell me which company it is.

720
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,300
I can help you.

721
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,170
Chen Yu, come with me.

722
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,140
Director Lin.

723
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,210
Who told you to bring it here?

724
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,730
Why didn't you take it to the bureau?

725
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,730
Director Lin.

726
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,580
Chen Yu

727
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,410
has already informed me of this.

728
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,450
What is this?

729
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
A violation of rules.

730
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,170
Sorry, Director Lin.

731
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,490
I just wanted to cross-check it

732
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,340
with the flash drive

733
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,250
Wu Zhenfeng gave us.

734
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,930
But then, someone came here to take it.

735
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
It must be Wan Heda's doing.

736
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,930
Did you get anything?

737
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,250
What are you going to do?

738
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,250
I can confirm

739
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,860
that Wan Heda

740
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,140
and Wanlutong Logistics

741
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,210
have dirty businesses.

742
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,020
Your confirmation

743
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,100
serves nothing.

744
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,380
How are you supposed to answer everything?

745
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,140
Wan Heda sent his people to take the documents.

746
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,250
He came prepared.

747
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,540
We still don't know

748
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,100
who's supporting Wan Heda.

749
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,380
Listen. Watch him closely.

750
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,130
[Yula Port of the People's Republic of China]

751
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,890
According to the security footage,

752
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,170
Wu Zhenfeng just exited

753
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,020
the border.

754
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,890
No idea where he is going.

755
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,380
Chen Yu.

756
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,970
Did Wu Zhenfeng tell you

757
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,820
that he was leaving the country?

758
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,060
No.

759
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,210
However, Chief Liu,

760
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,020
we found

761
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,970
a new lead yesterday.

762
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,020
Wu Gang used

763
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,820
Wanlutong Logistics' service

764
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,890
when the incident took place.

765
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,930
I speculate

766
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,210
that Wu Zhenfeng...

767
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,890
Do not speculate.

768
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,170
Wu Zhenfeng didn't even tell you
that he left the country.

769
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:03,930
How can you speculate

770
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,820
his reason for departure?

771
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:07,780
Bowen.

772
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,820
Check Wan Heda's position.

773
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,780
Chief Liu.

774
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,020
Wan Heda left the country too.

775
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,930
When?

776
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,300
10 AM this morning.

777
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,020
And Wu Zhenfeng's exit time?

778
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,690
9:50 AM.

779
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,300
Bowen.

780
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,970
Monitor Wu Zhenfeng's

781
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,210
and Wan Heda's movements.

782
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,490
See when they return.

783
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
And if they return together.

784
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,450
Keep me updated.

785
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:36,930
Yes, sir.

786
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,540
Meanwhile,

787
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,250
pay close attention

788
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,540
to Wanlutong Logistics.

789
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,020
Check all the vehicles it owns

790
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,210
in secret.

791
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
Be cautious.

792
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,020
We don't want to alert our enemy.

793
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,100
Yes, sir.

794
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,100
This is Gou.

795
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,490
Hi, Gou.

796
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,340
Guishou.

797
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,140
Find me 15 people tomorrow

798
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,380
who can compress tea cakes.

799
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,100
For work purposes.

800
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,970
Lei.

801
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,490
We already

802
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,580
have Gou for it.

803
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,620
