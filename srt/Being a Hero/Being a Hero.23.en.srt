00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,720
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,620
Erliang,

4
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,740
I've been observing this place

5
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,810
for several hours.

6
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,850
I don't think I'm followed.

7
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,100
Wu Zhenfeng,

8
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,060
what are you doing?

9
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,570
Wu Zhenfeng!

10
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,970
It's pretty tough to meet you in person.

11
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,330
Stop hitting him!

12
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,690
How will you explain yourself to Erliang

13
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,940
if you beat him to death?

14
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,410
Hello?

15
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,300
Erliang,

16
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,460
I've found them.

17
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,900
Okay.

18
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,100
Dr. Yu,

19
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,260
thank you so much.

20
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,970
Luckily, you reacted quickly.

21
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,540
If not, we would've been in huge trouble.

22
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
It was my duty to do so.

23
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,970
What drugs did you use on her back then?

24
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,260
Since she had an excessive amount of diazepam,

25
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,570
I injected flumazenil into her vein.

26
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,770
How did you know

27
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,770
that it was an excessive amount of diazepam?

28
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,940
I heard from the nurse

29
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,410
that there were many types of drugs
that could cause this to happen.

30
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,210
This...

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,460
I drew the conclusion from my experience.

32
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,050
I had no choice but to take a bet.

33
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,900
Luckily, I made the right bet.

34
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,020
Do you know her before this?

35
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,540
Actually, I was her doctor

36
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,380
before this.

37
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,050
How did you get to know her?

38
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,130
Her dad knew
that she was diagnosed with this illness.

39
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,410
However, he didn't dare to send her
to a rehab center.

40
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,770
That's why

41
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,900
he begged me to do him a favor.

42
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,850
I told Wan

43
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,970
that this method wouldn't work.

44
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,900
But he wasn't willing to listen to me.

45
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,130
This...

46
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,690
I thought she was pretty pitiful too.

47
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,980
How long has it been since then?

48
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,860
It's been almost two years.

49
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,580
Chen Yu, listen.

50
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,490
I'm only telling the truth for your sake.

51
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,660
You must keep it a secret.

52
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,010
If not,

53
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,940
my practice license will be revoked.

54
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,660
We've already verified it.

55
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,820
Dr. Ding's prescription record

56
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,260
and the medicine delivered

57
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,380
by the First People's Hospital of Yunhe County

58
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,100
were the same.

59
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,940
It was the right dosage.

60
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,540
The doctors and nurses
who handled the procedures

61
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,170
can testify for them.

62
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,820
I even retrieved the footage

63
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,730
of the ward's surveillance camera.

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,860
Chen Ying used

65
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,210
a disposable syringe.

66
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,260
That means

67
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,540
the excess dosage of diazepam

68
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,940
could only be prepared beforehand.

69
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,540
However, the volume of diazepam

70
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,380
in the rehab center remained the same,

71
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,100
including that in the doctors' offices.

72
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,580
Basically, we can be sure

73
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,210
that the excess amount of diazepam

74
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,700
came from somewhere outside the rehab center.

75
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,580
Deputy Chief Chen,

76
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,860
Wan Mengmeng

77
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,980
is in a deep coma right now.

78
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,820
To ensure her safety,

79
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,260
I request

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,050
a transfer to Kundu Rehab Center

81
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,540
for treatment in isolation.

82
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,100
Request permitted.

83
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,010
Due to the complex situation

84
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,820
in Yunhe right now,

85
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,330
I'll contact Kundu Rehab Center immediately.

86
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,820
Finish the handover as soon as possible.

87
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,860
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,770
Wu Zhenfeng has sent us updates.

89
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,770
[Li Xiandong (Hao Dong)]

90
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,490
Hao Dong, the legal representative
of the wood carving workshop.

91
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,290
His true name is Li Xiandong.

92
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,580
He's the son of Li Linfan.

93
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
He went back to Yunhe together with Wang Yikun

94
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,820
three years ago.

95
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,660
He adopted a new name, Hao Dong,

96
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,730
and established the wood carving workshop.

97
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,940
Erliang, his true name is Yan Meng.

98
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,770
He's a foreigner

99
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,450
and a key member of Mengka.

100
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,260
He was the one

101
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,450
who intercepted Wang Yikun's vehicle

102
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,380
in Kumon Range.

103
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,860
Through the analysis
of the footage used as evidence,

104
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,290
he might be the one

105
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,610
who passed the goods to Wu Zhenfeng

106
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,450
at the border

107
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,490
during the tea factory case.

108
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,820
Let's take a look at another picture.

109
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:12,980
Ms. Qiong,

110
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,330
another key member of Mengka.

111
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,170
[Li Yiqiong (Ms. Qiong)]
Her true name is Li Yiqiong.

112
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,770
She's from Meihe City in our province.

113
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
She rarely returned to the country

114
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,490
after leaving with her father in 2000.

115
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,540
That's all we know about them for now.

116
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,210
All right.

117
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,490
Now,

118
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,420
we know what they look like.

119
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,450
I've reported this
to the Provincial Public Security Bureau

120
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,770
and requested international assistance.

121
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,660
How did you get those pictures?

122
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,210
They're very defined.

123
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,450
From our informants.

124
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,050
The next phase

125
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,050
of our operation

126
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,540
is to investigate

127
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,260
their true identities.

128
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,980
If you guys

129
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,730
have no questions,

130
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,660
you may resume your work.

131
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,860
By the way, Director Lin,

132
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,580
these are the account information
and crime evidence

133
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,980
regarding Wang Yikun's case.

134
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,140
I've already organized them.

135
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:06,730
All right.

136
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:09,940
Director Lin,

137
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,770
Wang Yikun's evidence chain

138
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,610
is basically complete.

139
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,540
I request another interrogation.

140
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,170
Kaihua.

141
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,170
Do you wish to know how Wan Mengmeng is doing?

142
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,030
How is she?

143
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,190
What happened to her?

144
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,710
She survived

145
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,820
after receiving emergency treatment.

146
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,150
However, someone tried

147
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,780
to assassinate her in the hospital

148
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,060
when she was still in a coma.

149
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,540
I assume you know

150
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,830
the culprit

151
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,780
who's trying to silence her.

152
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,190
(I told you before.)

153
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,220
(Mengmeng is a burden!)

154
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,830
How could you hide her away?

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,070
Tell me!

156
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,310
How long

157
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,430
can you hide her away?

158
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,270
They failed their first attempt.

159
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,990
Therefore,

160
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,100
they tried a second time.

161
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,580
What did you say?

162
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,020
Are you guys a bunch of useless fools?

163
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,310
All you cops are good-for-nothing!

164
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,660
Tell us what you know

165
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,510
and we might be able to save her.

166
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,780
Speak.

167
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,540
Who's trying to kill her?

168
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,390
I brought them back.

169
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,750
Don't try anything funny.

170
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,660
Get down.

171
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,020
Hurry!

172
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,510
Get down!

173
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,340
Hurry!

174
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,950
Erliang.

175
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,900
This is Dong.

176
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,900
Please go easy on him.

177
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,220
Be nice.

178
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,750
Dong, huh?

179
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,020
Be nice.

180
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,700
Erliang!

181
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,580
-Stay put!
-Stay put!

182
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,580
Every dog has its day, huh, Dong?

183
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,340
I'm honored

184
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,750
to greet you here today.

185
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,020
Erliang!

186
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,950
How dare you come to Mengka?

187
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,310
Do you still remember the bad deeds you had done?

188
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,780
Bones, Wu Zhenfeng, the tea factory,

189
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,540
what else did you do, huh?

190
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,540
Do you need me to remind you?

191
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,510
Go!

192
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,510
Stay put!

193
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,750
Erliang, listen to me.

194
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:32,870
Go!

195
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,460
Calm down!

196
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,900
Hao Dong, we'll be fine!

197
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:36,700
Go!

198
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,430
Hurry up!

199
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,580
Please! For my sake!

200
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,830
Can we talk this over?

201
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,070
Erliang!

202
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:44,830
I'm serious!

203
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,950
Hao Dong!

204
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,870
Hao Dong, we'll be fine!

205
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,340
Calm down!

206
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:49,950
Go!

207
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,630
Erliang,

208
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,140
we've been friends for so many years!

209
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,700
Wan Heda!

210
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,190
Erliang!

211
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,950
You can't treat me like this!

212
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,700
Wan Heda!

213
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,750
Think about your daughter!

214
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,430
Erliang!

215
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:00,950
Erliang!

216
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:01,830
Erliang!

217
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,540
For our old times' sake!

218
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,900
For our old times' sake!

219
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,750
Please listen to me!

220
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,540
Erliang,

221
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,390
listen.

222
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,310
I never betray my friends!

223
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,990
You can't do this to me!

224
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,700
Erliang!

225
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,310
Go!

226
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,630
We can talk this over!

227
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,070
Wan Heda!

228
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,020
Wan Heda!

229
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,140
What did I tell you before we came here?

230
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,140
You should think about your daughter!

231
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,750
Go!

232
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,140
Hao Dong!

233
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,020
Hao Dong!

234
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,780
Hao Dong!

235
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,020
Hao Dong!

236
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,630
Hao Dong!

237
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,990
Hao Dong!

238
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,140
Hao Dong!

239
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,540
Wang Yikun,

240
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,750
listen up.

241
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,990
You will receive

242
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,870
the death penalty.

243
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,780
Do you know what death row prisoners do

244
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,990
before they are executed?

245
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,460
They act like you usually do.

246
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,270
Fearless.

247
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,990
However, on the day of their execution,

248
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,070
every one of them

249
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,310
cries like a baby.

250
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,630
They hope to see the people they love

251
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,950
or care about.

252
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,100
Unfortunately,

253
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,140
that's too late.

254
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,140
I hope you can see her again.

255
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,780
Hao Dong!

256
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,510
Hao Dong!

257
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,270
Let go of me!

258
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,830
Let go of me!

259
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,020
Get out of my way!

260
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,580
Erliang,

261
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,020
you and I have been friends

262
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,070
for so many years.

263
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,430
I'm begging you here.

264
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,340
Please let him go.

265
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,750
We can talk about the rest.

266
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,900
Please do me this favor

267
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,020
on account of our ties,

268
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:45,750
okay?

269
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,700
Let him go.

270
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,100
Erliang?

271
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:48,750
Er...

272
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,870
Stop burying him!

273
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,510
Stop burying him!

274
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,270
Stop!

275
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,220
Stop immediately!

276
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,700
You guys have to bury me first

277
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,580
before you bury him!

278
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,780
Wan.

279
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,700
Listen.

280
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,830
I'm Dong.

281
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,070
If so,

282
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,190
who is this?

283
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,310
Do you think Hao Dong is Dong?

284
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,390
Are all cops

285
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,140
as dumb as you guys?

286
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,630
He's Li Xiandong, the son of Li Linfan.

287
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,020
Does that sound convincing enough?

288
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,430
So what?

289
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,430
I told you already. I'm Dong.

290
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,510
I'm Dong.

291
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,190
Li Linfan entrusted K to me.

292
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,430
What's your relationship with Li Linfan?

293
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm his foster son.

294
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,630
Did Li Xiandong sell drugs together with you?

295
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,870
He had no idea.

296
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,900
My foster father sent him overseas long ago.

297
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,390
When was it?

298
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,270
It was 20 years ago.

299
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,100
Why did he send him overseas?

300
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,870
Back then, another drug smuggler

301
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,270
in Yunhe

302
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,990
stole a deal from my foster father.

303
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,270
My foster father decided
to kill his entire family.

304
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,340
In the end, that man escaped.

305
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,510
He only managed to kill his wife.

306
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,750
My foster father was afraid

307
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,780
that that person might seek revenge against him.

308
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,140
That's why he sent his son, Li Xiandong,

309
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,630
overseas.

310
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,430
Who was the other drug smuggler you referred to?

311
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,310
I don't know.

312
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,700
You should re-investigate
the homicide case 20 years ago.

313
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,900
Go ahead, officer.

314
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,780
(I'm hiding outside the border as I'm a fugitive.)

I don't know!

Die or tell?!

Three years ago.

Right after I killed Wu Gang

and avenged my foster father.

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,140
I was the one who killed Wu Gang.

345
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,630
I was the one who should take over K
from my foster father.

346
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,020
Officer, I did everything!

347
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,310
It has nothing to do with Li Xiandong!

348
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,270
Wan,

349
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,270
we can let bygones be bygones.

350
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,140
As long as you're willing,

351
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,070
we can be a family.

352
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,460
Are you guys

353
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,870
truly trying to kill Hao Dong here?

354
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,830
He's already at his wit's end.

355
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,460
There's no need for you

356
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,390
to defend him any longer.

357
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,990
No way.

358
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,750
Release Hao Dong immediately.

359
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,270
If not,

360
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,390
the deal is off.

361
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,700
Yi,

362
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,940
why did you ask for

363
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,150
my childhood photos out of the blue?

364
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,940
Our organization

365
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,910
will hold a bonding activity soon.

366
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,460
They want my childhood photos.

367
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,700
I don't have any.

368
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,630
That's why

369
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,820
I'm trying my luck here

370
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,300
to see if you have

371
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,220
photos of us two together.

372
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,630
Let me check the album.

373
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,340
All right.

374
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,030
What kind of photos are you looking for?

375
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,910
Let me help you out.

376
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,180
No need for that.

377
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,220
I can do it myself.

378
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,670
It's fine.

379
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,910
They're pretty picky.

380
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,990
I'll do it myself.

381
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
This must be Ms. Qiong, the lady

382
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,100
who visited you when you were young.

383
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:21,870
What's the matter?

384
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,340
I'll take this photo with me.

385
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,990
Why do you need it?

386
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,220
It looks excellent.

387
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,340
Give it to me, okay?

388
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,390
Well,

389
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,270
I'll keep looking for photos of us two together.

390
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,030
I'll give it another search.

391
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,990
This one is great.

392
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,700
Look.

393
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,060
Do you know these two?

394
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,510
Say, officer,

395
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,670
don't you know them yourself?

396
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,790
Didn't Wu Zhenfeng tell you anything

397
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,630
about his protective umbrella in Mengka?

398
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,630
You're Chen Yu,

399
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,460
right?

400
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,910
I should've killed you three years ago.

401
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,220
If it weren't for you,

402
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,100
Mengka would never dare

403
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,270
to set foot in Yunhe.

404
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,910
Do you think Wu Zhenfeng alone
is capable of doing that?

405
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,510
He would've been dead long ago

406
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,750
without you.

407
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,750
Speaking of which,

408
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,700
I am confused

409
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,580
about something.

410
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:51,910
What do you mean?

411
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,340
Mengka...

412
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,990
The cops had arrived even before Mengka

413
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,460
stolen my goods.

414
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,340
Are you Mengka's

415
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,460
protective umbrella?

416
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,550
Or is Wu Zhenfeng

417
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,670
one of you?

418
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,460
(I don't know what you're suspecting here.)

419
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,300
You suspect that I smuggle drugs, right?

420
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,550
(When did you ever see with your own eyes)

421
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,550
(that I smuggled drugs?)

422
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,060
(I was the one who tipped you off every time!)

423
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,940
I'm doing my duties here!

424
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,030
(Do you still remember)

425
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,420
(what you said in front of my dad's grave?)

426
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,870
(Have you ever truly trusted me?)

427
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,460
Mengka and K

428
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,100
have confronted each other for so many years.

429
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,460
It's time to end this once and for all.

430
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,820
Fine.

431
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,870
However, I need

432
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,870
to make myself clear regarding some things.

433
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,150
Three years ago,

434
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,460
the bullet that killed Dusan

435
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,870
was actually meant for me, right?

436
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,940
That's right.

437
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,340
Three years ago,

438
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,550
my dad died

439
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,420
because you guys set him up, right?

440
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,220
Li Linfan went against the rules.

441
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,390
He raised the price during our deal.

442
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,670
We just wanted

443
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,820
to teach him a lesson.

444
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,030
Am I right, Wan?

445
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,060
Back then, you were the one who recruited Wu Gang

446
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,510
because he was clean.

447
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,340
You believed that he would definitely

448
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,910
tip the cops off

449
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,100
regarding Li Linfan's drug trade.

450
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,630
Speed up!

451
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,580
(Man proposes, but God disposes.)

452
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,750
(We didn't expect)

453
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,270
(that he would handle
the transportation himself that day)

454
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,820
(and later, killed by the cops.)

455
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,870
Back then, Mr. Yu promised you

456
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,030
that you could replace Li Linfan's position

457
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,670
once the deed was done.

458
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,300
It's a pity

459
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,030
that Dong came back

460
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,390
at the wrong time.

461
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,060
Wan Heda!

462
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,060
Wan,

463
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,030
do you need our help?

464
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,150
How many times have I told you?

465
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,700
Hao Dong is still Dong!

466
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,550
Don't you understand me?

467
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,630
Three years ago,

468
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,180
it was just a momentary slip.

469
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,340
I had no idea

470
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,420
it would end up like that.

471
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,100
If I had known it,

472
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,420
I wouldn't have...

473
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,300
Trust me.

474
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,180
Trust me.

475
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,700
Erliang,

476
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,100
Ms. Qiong,

477
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,460
stop guilt-tripping me with this incident,

478
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,460
okay?

479
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,460
It's been so many years!

480
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,180
Are you guys truly trying to help me out here?

481
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,820
You guys just wanted to

482
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,630
get back at Li Linfan for Mr. Yu, don't you?

483
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,420
Hao Dong,

484
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,820
that's because your dad

485
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,670
killed Mr. Yu's wife!

486
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,150
I didn't want to say that initially.

487
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,340
If I said it,

488
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,100
everything would crumble.

489
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,220
We won't be able to do business together by then!

490
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,820
All of us are responsible

491
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,340
for Li Linfan's death one way or another!

492
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,220
The feud between Mengka and K

493
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,300
isn't the point here!

494
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,150
How can we find out

495
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,670
what the cops will do

496
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,670
before they discover us?

497
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,940
That's our priority right now!

498
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,420
Wu Zhenfeng.

499
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,420
What exactly is your relationship

500
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,700
with Chen Yu?

501
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,700
He's my buddy.

502
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,790
My protective umbrella in Yunhe.

503
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,300
Is he truly your protective umbrella?

504
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,700
Or is he doing this for something else?

505
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,710
Ms. Qiong,

506
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,710
I suggest you guys do a background check on him.

507
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,860
I might be the unlucky one today.

508
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,380
However, you guys will be next.

509
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,220
As the saying goes, like father, like son.

510
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,550
Hao Dong,

511
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,670
this is our family affairs.

After that, it stopped for three years.

But there's something suspicious here.

601
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,620
Just a few days
before the tea factory was burned down,

the oversea account

transferred a sum to Li Yiqiong.

604
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
After that, Li Yiqiong

605
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,950
transferred the money

606
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,220
to Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory.

607
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,460
Wan Heda rejected the deal.

608
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,100
He's still not willing to give up on Hao Dong.

609
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,860
Also, they're not clear

610
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,710
about the current situation in Yunhe.

611
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,950
They don't know what the cops

612

have discovered.

613
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,260
Since Yang Xingquan

614
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,460
has been contacting Mengka all along,

615
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,140
what's the relationship

616
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,860
between Wu Zhenfeng and Yang Xingquan?

617
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,500
If Yang Xingquan is truly one of them,

618
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,950
what's with the big fallout

619
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,100
between them before this?

620
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,830
Was it all an act?

621
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:52,860
Chen Yu,

Hurry.

624
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,670
In my opinion,

625
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,260
Wu Zhenfeng isn't a high-ranking member

626
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,860
in Mengka.

627
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,260
All the tasks that Mengka had assigned to him

628
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,100
were just ruses and distractions.

629
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,710
Mengka doesn't trust him at all.

630
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,310
They don't care about his life either.

631
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,260
That's why he often

632
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,100
talks about me,

633
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,190
right?

634
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,070
Chen Yu,

635
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,340
during the bust of Shu's boxing casino,

636
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,910
he risked his life in search of evidence.

637
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,460
When the tea factory was burned down,

638
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,260
he went all out to save Guishou.

639
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,620
So, I think

640
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,340
there's still a way back for Wu Zhenfeng.

Why is he crying so loud?

What's going on?

Sister, you have no idea.

724
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,150
He was messing around with a bunch of drug dealers.

Drug dealers?

726

Aren't there plenty of drug dealers in Yunhe?

Besides,

728
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,110
he didn't know

729
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,260
that they were drug dealers

730
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,350
when he made friends with them.

731
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,870
In the end,

732
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,220
it's your responsibility.

733
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,540
You failed to take care of him on my behalf.

734
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,590
Think about

735
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,910
how I brought you up.

736
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:19,830
Back then,

737
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,070
you had plenty of terrible friends too.

I told you already.

739
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,020
You just need to take care of him for two years.

740
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,220
I'll take him abroad with me
once I acquire permanent residence.

Now there are only two months to go.

You have no idea

745
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,910
what he has done.

746
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,540
Regardless of anything,

747
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,070
he's your nephew.

748
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,910
Just ask him

749
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,590
to tell you what he knows.

750
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,780
Don't tell me you're going to arrest him for real.

751

We're a family.

752
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,350
Lei is still young.

753
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,630
Just educate him.

754
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,940
Two more months.

755
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,020
I'll take him away in two more months.
