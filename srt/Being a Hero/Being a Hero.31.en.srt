3
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,230
Do you know?

4
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,680
When Hao Dong died before me,

5
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,080
I thought I would be over the moon.

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,630
I thought I finally

7
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,630
had my revenge.

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,550
But instead,

9
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,230
I felt nothing.

10
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
I don't know if I had

11
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,230
my revenge.

12
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Are you still hanging in there?

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,830
This is nothing.

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,310
It's been three years.

15
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,080
Where did you live

16
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,680
in those three years?

17
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Do you see that?

18
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,600
Behind this house.

19
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,750
I lived there.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
The room's not big

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,270
but it's a cozy one.

22
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,360
I know you would be visiting

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,240
this exotic land today

24
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,320
so I brought you here to gaze at the moon.

25
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,440
A welcome gift, I suppose.

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
You were praised

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
and encouraged for the first time in your life

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,910
when you made the abstinence medication

29
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,390
for the rehab center.

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,440
But that is trivial.

31
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,720
Do you know

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,190
what your worth is?

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,670
Look at me.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
I'm telling you.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,670
The culmination of your life

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,360
is that you made Yaba.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,670
Yet you failed

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,600
to make Yellow Capsules.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,910
Isn't that a shame?

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,520
We're in Mengka.

41
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,800
My territory.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,240
This is your last chance.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,470
Understand?

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,240
What Hao Dong gave to you,

45
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,030
I can give them to you too.

46
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,160
The Black Card Heroin

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,550
that we made here

48
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,910
used to be all the rage.

49
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,110
But the future

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,470
belongs to the Yellow Capsules

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,080
that you will be manufacturing.

52
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,160
You can even

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,080
rename it.

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,440
The formula.

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,630
The formula.

56
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,160
Make Chen Yu

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,030
give me the formula

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,830
and I'll make a better one.

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,390
I can.

60
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,800
I definitely can!

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,750
If something bad happens later,

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,160
remember,

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,830
you have to stay alive.

64
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
I came here

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,240
so that you can return alive.

66
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,470
Stop it already.

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Growing up, I have always

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,670
been the one protecting you.

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,830
But it's different now.

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,270
I am a cop.

71
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,160
Just like what we did in Shengjiang.

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,200
I was the one scouting.

73
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,070
I have to be the one

74
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,510
charging in.

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,550
Do you understand?

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,830
Forget it.

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,550
I'll do it.

78
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,510
I don't have

79
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,550
anything left.

80
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,350
But you're different.

81
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,320
Yang Ling

82
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,790
is a kind girl.

83
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,640
Actually, I have been spending

84
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,390
the last three years

85
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,440
like this.

86
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm used to it.

87
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,070
If something did

88
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,480
happen to me,

89
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,790
just buy me some good liquor.

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,950
Don't you fool me.

91
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,160
I want good-quality liquor.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,830
Visit me

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,830
and pour the liquor in front of my tombstone.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,390
We'll see who will visit whose tombstone.

95
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,110
All right?

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,510
For me, I want fresh flowers.

97
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,350
No wreath, please.

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,920
A wreath is made from paper nowadays.

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,720
It's cheap.

100
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,440
Fresh flowers are much more expensive.

101
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,600
What? Do I not even deserve some fresh flowers?

102
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,040
Oh,

103
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,670
before I came,

104
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,510
I visited your dad on your behalf.

105
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,200
I lit a cigarette for him.

106
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,760
I have to say,

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,350
the smoke smells awful.

108
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,550
Why did your dad love it so much?

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,550
Thank you.

110
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,200
Get up.

111
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,920
Come out.

112
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,950
Follow me.

113
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,270
Hurry.

114
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,230
Move.

115
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,230
Chen Yu.

116
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,600
It's been a while.

117
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,000
Should I call you Mr. Yang

118
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,110
or Mr. Yu?

119
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,040
Doesn't matter.

120
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,070
What matters is that we

121
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,510
can still stand before each other

122
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,200
like before.

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Is that so?

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,640
As long as you are willing.

125
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,390
Have you always been suspecting me?

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,350
Yes.

127
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,000
But before I see it with my own eyes,

128
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,070
I refuse to believe it.

129
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,070
Does the Public Security Bureau know?

130
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,350
If they know,

131
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,550
I won't be the only one

132
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,350
standing before you.

133
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,670
Why didn't you tell them?

134
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,440
Because you're Yang Ling's father.

135
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,280
Maybe you don't care.

136
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,550
Because you're heartless.

137
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,200
You even did Yang Yi in.

138
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,550
He countered narcotics.

139
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
I produced narcotics.

140
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,280
We are bound to be enemies.

141
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't you have any other options?

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,590
If I do,

143
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,670
I won't live until now.

144
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,440
Lingling.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,590
Your dad had a tough life.

146
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,550
I know

147
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,590
sometimes, you feel like

148
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,910
you don't understand him well enough.

149
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,200
You cannot fathom him.

150
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,200
Sometimes, I get the same feeling too.

151
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,030
But I know

152
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,320
he did everything

153
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,350
for you.

154
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
He wants you to come this time

155
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,400
because

156
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,910
he wants you to understand him better.

157
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,000
He trusts you.

158
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,880
Don't you want to see

159
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,440
where your dad has lived all these years?

160
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,110
Remember.

161
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,470
No one in this world

162
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,000
loves you more than your dad does.

163
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,000
Be a good girl

164
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,520
and come with me.

165
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,520
Why didn't he come to me in person then?

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,760
He's waiting for you.

167
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,320
Chen Yu too.

168
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,230
Don't you want to know

169
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,350
what Chen Yu is doing there?

170
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,550
Come with me

171
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,520
and you'll know

172
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,000
everything you want to know.

173
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,790
As friends, the two of you are quite interesting.

174
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,550
One is a cop

175
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,470
while the other wants to be a drug lord.

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,940
Tell me.

177
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,670
What exactly are you after here?

178
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,230
To do business with you.

179
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,910
Only I have the routes for the transportation

180
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,030
and I only trust him now.

181
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,350
I'm puzzled by one thing.

182
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,990
Sha has retired for many years

183
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,060
but when you appeared,

184
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,550
he made a comeback.

185
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,670
I have explained it to you.

186
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,310
He owed my dad a favor.

187
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,910
I wonder

188
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,910
how big that favor was.

189
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,140
Mr. Yu.

190
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,500
I have the person you want.

191
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,790
Ask

192
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,700
whatever you want to ask.

193
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,140
You want to threaten me with this?

194
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,470
You think

195
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,140
I didn't see it coming?

196
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,580
Just you wait.

197
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,110
We

198
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,870
will settle this score sooner or later.

199
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,350
Hit him.

200
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,870
Wu Zhenfeng.

201
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,580
Your dad and I

202
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,380
are even now.

203
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,230
Tell me.

204
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,990
What exactly are you after here?

205
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,870
Revenge.

206
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,030
The best way

207
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,060
to avenge my dad

208
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,700
is to get to your level.

209
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,940
Or even better,

210
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,350
to kill you.

211
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,500
Sha.

212
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,670
Please don't blame me for this.

213
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,790
Mr. Yu would not send the goods to me.

214
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,110
Please understand.

215
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,470
Are you done?

216
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,580
You have two options now.

217
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,140
One,

218
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,430
kill

219
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,110
Wu Zhenfeng and me.

220
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,140
Two,

221
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,310
once you deliver the goods,

222
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,380
I'll take

223
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,700
50% of the cut.

224
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,500
I'll look past everything.

225
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,740
We're all in this business.

226
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,060
I get it.

227
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,790
Make your choice.

228
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,940
Everything

229
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,990
goes way too smoothly.

230
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,260
Chen Yu, I believe I know you quite well.

231
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,820
Our nature hardly changes.

232
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,180
There's only one explanation

233
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,110
for why you came to talk business with me.

234
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,990
This is just a trap.

235
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,380
Am I right?

236
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,470
Whoever lives

237
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,740
can talk business with me.

238
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,550
You don't want the Yellow Capsules already?

239
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,670
How will you deal with Zhuo?

240
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,620
Don't! Don't shoot!

241
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Without an accurate ratio,

242
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,700
I-I won't be able to produce it.

243
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,580
Someone died from a wrong formula before.

244
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,500
You will produce it.

245
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,550
I can give you time.

246
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,260
I can't.

247
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,430
I have the formula.

248
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,260
I need him. I need the ratio.

249
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,260
He can't die.

250
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,620
-You can do it!
-If he dies...

251
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,790
If I die,

252
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,030
then you'll have nothing!

253
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,350
Nothing!

254
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,910
Tell me.

255
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,990
Is this a trap set up by the police?

256
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,700
Chief Liu was caught.

257
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,740
Yang Yi died too.

258
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,700
He is my buddy.

259
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,790
This day will come to me sooner or later.

260
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,140
I'm done being an officer now.

261
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,580
Go on. Kill me!

262
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,910
You won't get the formula.

263
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,030
If you don't kill me here,

264
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,790
I

265
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,350
will make the drugs myself.

266
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,310
My buddy here will deliver the goods.

267
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,140
Both of us will share the profit evenly.

268
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,940
Come on!

269
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,740
Kill me then, Yang Xingquan.

270
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,670
Kill me!

271
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,030
Continue.

272
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,670
Hit them.

273
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,430
Hello?

274
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,740
Any news from Chen Yu

275
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,590
and Wu Zhenfeng?

276
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,070
Nothing so far.

277
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,430
Yang Ling is now heading to Mengka.

278
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,260
As long as she meets with Chen Yu,

279
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,070
she will give that thing to him.

280
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,790
Chen Yu will find an opening

281
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,310
to send us the location

282
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,860
of the drug manufacturing site.

283
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,070
We're now

284
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,070
waiting for the signal.

285
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,950
Okay.

286
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,100
Monitor it closely.

287
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,100
Let me know

288
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,670
if anything happens.

289
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,380
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,830
Stop!

291
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,860
You wanted to do me in?

292
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,030
You're too young for it.

293
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,670
Come.

294
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,910
Meet your old friend.

295
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,190
Mr. Yu.

296
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,260
Don't overdo it.

297
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,260
If you don't want to do business,

298
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,430
just say no.

299
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,620
I don't want to die

300
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,670
for this.

301
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,030
I'm warning you.

302
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,980
If something happens to Wu Zhenfeng,

303
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,460
Mengka will never be able

304
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,430
to deliver their goods anywhere.

305
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,860
Is this part of the welcome gift too?

306
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,340
Oh, no.

307
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,140
No one will give me free liquor now.

308
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,310
Nonsense.

309
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,310
You'll buy the liquor.

310
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,030
Hello?

311
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,860
You fought well when you were a kid.

312
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,310
And you've been a cop for three years.

313
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,100
Shouldn't you be able to fight just as well?

314
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,310
Continue fighting then.

315
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,100
Lingling.

316
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,620
Where is Chen Yu?

317
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,790
Chen Yu!

318
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,260
Chen Yu!

319
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,220
Chen Yu!

320
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,590
Release him!

321
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,030
Open the door!

322
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,590
Release him!

323
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,550
Open the door!

324
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,590
Chen Yu.

325
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,340
Lingling.

326
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,140
Lingling.

327
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,740
If I stay alive,

328
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,860
we will leave this place forever.

329
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,550
I will give you

330
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,950
the simple and happy life

331
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,430
that you

332
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,340
deserve.

333
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,590
I will accompany you

334
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,710
to do what you want.

335
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,460
We'll live the simple and happy life

336
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,620
that you

337
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,550
deserve.

338
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,980
But that life only exists

339
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,790
in a world without drugs.

340
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,100
I know

341
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,620
I'm not

342
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,910
a good boyfriend.

343
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,620
I owe you too much.

344
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,910
I don't want to be like Yang Yi

345
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,430
and miss the chance

346
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,670
to say what's on my mind.

347
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,190
Chen Yu.

348
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,910
Chen Yu.

349
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,950
Please believe me.

350
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,590
Everything I do

351
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,100
will be worth it.

352
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,910
And believe me too

353
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,710
when I say I love you.

354
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,380
Please believe me

355
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,550
when I say I love you.

356
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,140
There shall be no lies

357
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,910
in our relationship.

358
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,670
(Why did you end up here?)

359
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,830
My dad bought drugs from him

360
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,790
and he was killed.

361
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,380
I was then imprisoned here.

362
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,500
I will kill him one day.

363
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,300
Let him go.

364
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,070
Give me water

365
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,470
and medicine.

366
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,380
He cannot die.

367
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,260
Chen Yu.

368
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,870
Chen Yu.

369
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,900
Do you still remember

370
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,420
when you fed me medicine?

371
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,420
When I met you back then,

372
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,230
I trusted you like that too.

373
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,070
We rely on each other

374
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,750
and entrust our lives to each other.

375
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,020
Yang Ling is doing the same.

376
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,470
Mr. Yu.

377
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,870
You should have done this earlier.

378
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,780
I have to do

379
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,180
what I had to do.

380
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,420
What's the arrangement?

381
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,710
When is it?

382
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,660
Wait for my message.

383
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,830
I'm telling you.

384
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,380
During the hand-off,

385
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,540
Wu Zhenfeng has to be there.

386
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,500
That was a smart move.

387
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,180
You pointed your gun at Yu Miao.

388
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,540
Yu Miao matters the most to them.

389
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,180
I want to force him

390
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,470
to come to our side

391
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,750
so as to give them pressure.

392
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,020
Thank you.

393
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,540
(Lingling.)

394
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,590
This thing here.

395
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,230
Give it to Chen Yu when you know

396
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,140
he will be safe.

397
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,710
Once he confirms the location

398
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,830
of the drug manufacturing site,

399
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,630
press this button

400
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,300
and we will receive

401
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,750
the signal right away.

402
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,870
Water.

403
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,470
Some water, please.

404
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,420
What are you looking at?

405
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,540
Keep it.

406
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,500
Before we know

407
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
the time and the location

408
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,020
of the drug production,

409
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,300
keep it.

410
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,830
Zhuo and Sha called again

411
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,350
to ask when we will start.

412
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,420
Make them wait.

413
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,630
What is your plan?

414
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,470
I'm finding

415
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,260
a time slot

416
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,830
that no one will be aware of.

417
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,470
It will start and end

418
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,870
immediately.

419
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,540
So make them wait.

420
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Hello? It's me.

421
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,710
Any news from them?

422
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,540
No.

423
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,660
It's been two weeks

424
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,630
since they crossed the border.

425
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,660
There's no news from them.

426
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,750
Perhaps the drug dealers

427
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,260
have started making drugs already.

428
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,950
I believe in our comrades.

429
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,140
They will give us the signal

430
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,260
when it's possible.

431
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,420
If all else fails,

432
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,500
the drug dealers will definitely pass by Yunhe

433
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,230
when trafficking drugs.

434
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,710
Yunhe Public Security Bureau

435
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,830
will not let

438
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,780
Okay.

439
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,830
Let me know if there's anything.

440
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,750
All right.

441
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,500
Where is your jade pendant?

442
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,070
I gave it to Yang Ling.

443
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,780
If something happens,

444
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,950
I don't know who else to give it to.

445
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,070
If something happens to me,

446
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,870
I don't know

447
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,350
who else to give my jade pendant to either.

448
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,380
You'll be fine.

449
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,110
I'll make sure Yang Ling and you

450
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,110
stay with me.

451
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,870
She's brave.

452
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,660
She doesn't have to come here.

453
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,380
Enough.

454
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,710
Stop chatting.

455
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,180
How many days has it been?

456
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,110
How many days?

457
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,780
Will Mr. Yu take back his words?

458
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,900
Don't worry.

459
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,870
You were

460
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,230
Hao Dong's money maker.

461
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,590
Now, you're Mr. Yu's.

462
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,830
You'll be safe.

463
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,300
Otherwise,

464
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,020
he won't even get

465
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,830
one Yellow Capsule.

466
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,780
Yellow Capsule.

467
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,230
What's the formula

468
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,990
of the Yellow Capsule?

469
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,830
Tell me.

470
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,380
I have tried many methods.

471
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,420

472
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,470
its underlying pharmacology

473
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,750
but I can never

474
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,140
get the ratio right.

475
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
What did I do wrong?

476
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,990
What?

477
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,660

No need to stay awake.

482
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,260
Rest if you're tired.

No sign of Wu Zhenfeng.

and stopped after 20 km.

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,980
He is where he should be.

521
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,260
He is injured.

522
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,740
Where is he?

523
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,740
Lingling.

524
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,830
Chen Yu is fine at the moment.

525
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,980
Good.

526
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,980
It's all here.

527
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,220
These are all I need.

528
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,830
Let's start.

529
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,670
The raw materials are here.

530
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,460
Make the call.

531
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,190
Before he fulfills my conditions,

532
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,910
I will not make anything.

533
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,500
Make the call.

534
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,300
You don't have the final say anyway.

535
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,430
Yes, Erliang?

536
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,070
Hand the phone to Yang Xingquan.

537
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:41,940
Hello?

538
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,740
Let me see Wu Zhenfeng and Yang Ling.

539
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,500
Otherwise,

540
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,830
I won't make anything.

541
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,350
How can you convince me

542
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,190
that you can make it?

543
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,500
Bring them here

544
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,670
and I'll show you the sample.

545
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,390
Only when I see them

546
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,350
will I mass produce it.

547
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,390
Hand the phone to Erliang.

548
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,780
Mr. Yu?

549
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,590
Get ready.

550
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,830
I will be there.

551
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,460
Noted.

552
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,260
Leave.

553
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,220
I'll begin soon.

554
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,940
You too.

555
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,780
I...

556
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,460
Leave.

557
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,260
Where are we going?

558
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,940
Don't you want to see Chen Yu?

559
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,700
Yiqiong.

560
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,430
Thank you for managing this place

561
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,860
so I could return to Yunhe

562
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,820
and have a few days of peacefulness.

563
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,470
Why are you telling me this all of a sudden?

564
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,740
I have a hunch.

565
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,630
Yang.

566
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,630
It's okay

567
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,630
to quit.

568
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,950
There's no turning back.

569
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,500
Have you forgotten?

570
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Both of us have died

571
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,430
many times.

572
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,470
And we just lit the incense.

573
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,980
Two of our men

574
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,540
are still there

575
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,950
trying to stall those drug dealers.

576
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,710
We have to turn the drug manufacturing site

577
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,390
inside out

578
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,780
before they

579
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,950
can deliver the goods.

580
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,770
[Weapon Room]

581
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,020
No drug dealer

582
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,630
is allowed to escape

583
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,980
during this operation.

584
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,670
