I have told you

174
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,830
about Jiang Lei.

175
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,830
Do you think Chief Liu

176
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,220
has ever suspected Jiang Lei?

177
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,140
If he has,

178
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,750
has he ever told Jiang Lei

179
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,870
the misgivings he has?

180
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,700
Liu Kaihua has been my comrade-in-arm

181
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,780
for more than a decade.

182
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,630
His body still bears

183
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,780
the bite scar from a drug dealer.

184
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,140
Why would I distrust him?

185
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,220
Do you think Jiang Lei deals drugs then?

186
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,830
Where is the evidence?

187
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,630
Chen Yu.

188
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,270
Humans have desires.

189
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,990
Police officers are humans too.

190
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,950
Ordinary humans.

191
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,070
They have families

192
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,310
and siblings.

193
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,310
Therefore...

194
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,750
Then according to the police communique,

195
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,830
do you think Wan Heda

196
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,630
is dodgy?

197
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,540
You have all of Wanlutong Logistics'

198
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,070
financial reports.

199
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,990
What did you find?

200
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,580
When I was investigating Wanlutong Logistics,

201
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,990
I found that he had been in contact

202
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,310
with a tea factory in Yunhe three years ago.

203
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,100
But then it stopped.

204
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,310
What do you think is the reason?

205
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,460
Which tea factory?

206
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,460
Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory.

207
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,990
[Yunhe Public Security Bureau]

208
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,750
Officer Lan chugs soft drinks

209
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,630
when she is annoyed.

210
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,580
This box of drinks is now yours.

211
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,190
Cheer up.

212
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,070
Don't frown.

213
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,990
Thanks, Qiang.

214
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,140
Yang Yi.

215
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,140
I'll be going now.

216
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:24,950
Where is Chen Yu?

217
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:27,830
When I arrived this morning,

218
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,580
he'd already done packing.

219
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,700
I guess he went back first.

220
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,190
I was about to call him.

221
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,270
This brat.

222
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,310
He must be very eager to leave.

223
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,580
See you, my friends.

224
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,310
Go back to your work.

225
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,020
Go on.

226
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,830
No need to walk him out.

227
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,660
Just stay here.

228
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,580
If we miss Qiang,

229
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,780
we can just go to the canteen

230
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
of the Exit-Entry Management Detachment

231
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,220
next door.

232
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,830
The food there is amazing.

233
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,660
All right.

234
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,780
-Come.
-See you, Bowen.

235
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,460
Bye.

236
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,900
Go back to your work.

237
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,580
Work.

238
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,580
I welcomed you when you arrived.

239
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,630
Now, I walk you out when you leave.

240
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,460
A perfect ending.

241
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,580
Now that I'm leaving,

242
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,870
I feel that I'll miss you all.

243
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,510
When I was looking into

244
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,580
Li Yiqiong's account,

245
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,820
I also

246
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,790
came across transactions

247
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,700
with Guangmang Mountain Tea Factory.

248
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,030
Also,

249
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,180
the aunt Yang Ling mentioned

250
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,100
who lives abroad

251
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,340
is Li Yiqiong.

252
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,870
What are you insinuating?

253
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,300
Director Lin.

254
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,820
Do you think Yang Xingquan is involved
in the drug business?

255
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,270
Chen Yu.

256
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,580
Let's say your speculation is right.

257
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,180
But what if Yang Xingquan

258
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,910
comes out with an explanation?

259
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,990
If he says that these transactions

260
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,510
only occurred due to normal tea leaves deals

261
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,750
that are completely legal,

262
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,990
what will you do then?

263
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,460
You said

264
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,550
it was three years ago.

265
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,180
If you want to get to the bottom of it

266
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,900
and obtain a complete chain of custody,

267
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,670
you need to trace back to ten years ago,

268
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,790
even 20 years ago.

269
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,190
You have to investigate everything

270
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,550
thoroughly.

271
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,100
How do you do that?

272
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,030
Do you have a way?

273
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,030
Sorry.

274
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,070
I haven't thought about it.

275
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,670
Think then.

276
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,550
I'll give you the time to think about it properly.

277
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,310
Director Lin.

278
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,620
I have one last question.

279
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,830
Go on.

280
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,380
Wu Zhenfeng.

281
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,140
Was he involved with drugs?

282
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,310
You should give me the answer.

283
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,220
You two used to be neighbors when you were little.

284
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,140
After he returned to the country,

285
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,310
you kept a close watch on him.

286
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,950
You even risked everything

287
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,140
to intercept his truck.

288
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,220
Just to find the evidence of his selling drugs.

289
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,100
Tell me now then.

290
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,950
Is he a drug dealer?

291
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,740
Director Lin.

292
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,500
Do you think I'm an idiot?

293
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,670
If you're an idiot,

294
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,340
Kaihua won't bring you

295
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,310
into the Counter Narcotics Detachment.

296
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,070
In my opinion,

297
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,430
you

298
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,860
have exceptional logical thinking skills

299
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,830
and can think outside the box.

300
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,430
But I feel like an idiot.

301
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,380
When did you begin

302
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,260
to think that way?

303
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,790
(After I interrogated Kun the second time,)

304
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,710
(I felt like an idiot.)

305
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,380
(After I intercepted Wu Zhenfeng's truck,)

306
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,550
(I felt like an idiot.)

307
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,710
(Tell me now then.)

308
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,950
(What exactly are you doing?)

309
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,340
(I am doing what I should be doing.)

310
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,620
(If you prove)

311
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,910
(my father was innocent,)

312
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,500
(I am innocent.)

313
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,340
In hindsight,

314
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,910
no matter whether it was when we tried
to crack the Yellow Capsule Case,

315
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,030
when Shu was captured,

316
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,670
or when the tea factory was burned to the ground,

317
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,030
I've been an idiot this whole time.

318
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,310
Chen Yu.

319
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,340
You're young.

320
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,790
You despise evil

321
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,310
but you're also reckless.

322
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,500
Always remember this.

323
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,100
You're a policeman,

324
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,950
a member of the police force.

325
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,740
Not only do we have

326
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,950
to have an iron will,

327
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,380
but we also have to have an iron-clad discipline.

328
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,790
That is what I can say to you now.

329
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,100
When your passionate self

330
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,460
is fully engrossed in your work,

331
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,740
do not doubt anything.

332
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,710
Do not doubt

333
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,790
the effort you've made

334
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,340
and everything you have achieved.

335
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,100
You hear me?

336
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,190
Director Lin.

337
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,740
Are you truly leaving?

338
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,380
This is the higher-ups' decision.

339
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Still,

340
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,710
thank you.

341
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,070
Thank you all

342
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,500
for your support

343
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,070

claiming that they have dismantled K Group

and arrested their leader, Wang Yikun.

The communique should be authentic.

We killed together.

to look after each other forever.

362

How do you know

368

if the communique is real or fake?

369
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,310
The police released it.

370

What if that's part of their plan?

371

What if it's just a trap?

His uncle is a chief.
