Yi, what's going on?

4
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,710
We received an anonymous tip.

5
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,910
Chen Yu is hiding drugs here.

6
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,670
Hiding drugs? No way.

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,030
Chief Liu, who reported it?

8
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,860
Don't fret. Proceed as usual.

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,070
Come on. What kind of protocol is this?

10
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,180
I told you,

11
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,630
Yang Ling went to look for Wan Mengmeng.

12
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,590
If I can prove

13
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,220
Wan Mengmeng is taking drugs,

14
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,180
I'll be able to investigate her.

15
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,740
If I investigate her...

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,910
Chief Liu, I got something.

17
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,590
It's been three years.

Are you hurt?

I'm fine, really.

Are you sure?

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,740
We found this in Chen Yu's room.

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,270
Why did you go to that place?

I'm sorry, Mr. Yang.

45

It's my fault.

46

No.

I'd never tell him.

I told you.

[Tuesday, 2019-09-17]
on the night of the incident.

345
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,420
The time is not long

346
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,510
after the incident at Yundian Disco.

347
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,460
In the video,

348
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,750
a suspicious-looking man

349
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,940
snuck into the cafe.

350
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,460
We reckon

351
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,940
that the man was the one

352
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,180
who left the drugs

353
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,060
in Chen Yu's room.

354
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,820
But due to insufficient lighting,

355
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,990
and he was wearing a mask,

356
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,580
we haven't yet been able to identify

357
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,030
the man's appearance.

358
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,870
[Tuesday, 2019-09-17]
This is a specific clip

359
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,220
from last night's footage taken at Yundian Disco.

360
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,220
But due to insufficient lighting

361
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,630
and the fixed camera angle,

362
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,940
we weren't able to discern

363
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,340
the person who hurt Yang Ling.

364
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,420
Plus, there was no camera in the private room.

365
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,460
Hence we're unable

366
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,820
to see what happened inside.

367
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,220
Chief Liu.

368
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,390
Director Lin.

369
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,300
The footage shows

370
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,750
that before the victim died,

371
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,700
she had entered

372
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,150
a room with Wan Mengmeng.

373
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,460
After the incident,

374
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,100
Wan Mengmeng fled the scene

375
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,940
in fright.

376
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Our main focus right now

377
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,550
should be to locate Wan Mengmeng

378
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,910
and investigate

379
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,910
her social circle thoroughly.

380
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,030
Listen here.

381
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,270
Considering the ongoing investigation

382
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
of the Yundian Disco's case,

383
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,910
and considering

384
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,180
how Chen Yu trespassed
into Wanlutong Logistics,

385
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,870
I hereby announce,

386
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,700
from today onward,

387
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,180
Chen Yu,

388
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,790
you'll drop out

389
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,510
from the investigation to avoid gossip.

390
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,910
I'll be clear.

391
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,700
You will continue

392
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,870
to punch in for work daily.

393
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,390
Understand?

394
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,870
Yes.

395
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,300
Director Lin.

396
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,180
When will I be able to resume my work?

397
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,790
When we find the evidence

398
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,940
and get to the bottom of the matter.

399
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,940
Then we'll discuss that.

400
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,700
Yes, sir.

401
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,060
Who said you could take it?

402
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,420
I'm not finished.

403
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,630
The most important thing
about the Yellow Capsule is the ratio.

404
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,750
The ratio!

405
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Did you think about that?

406
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,150
There's not much stock left.

407
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,060
So I wanted to try it sooner.

408
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,580
Provincial Public Security Bureau sent word.

409
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,670
A large amount of Yaba

410
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,820
was confiscated in Hong Kong, China.

411
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,340
There was also the new-type drug,

412
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,390
the Yellow Capsule.

413
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,510
According to their analysis,

414
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,060
the batch of narcotics

415
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,220
was smuggled from Yunhe

416
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,790
the night the tea factory caught fire.

417
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,630
This means the tea factory fire

418
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,270
was merely a ruse.

419
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,910
The drug dealers set it up

420
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,340
to divert attention away.

421
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,630
While we focused

422
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,870
all our power

423
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,630
on the tea factory,

424
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,030
the real narcotics

425
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,940
brushed past us.

426
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,990
They were quietly smuggled out of Yunhe

427
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,790
right under our noses.

428
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,940
As the head

429
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,220
of the operation,

430
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,270
I reflect on my oversight.

431
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,550
I'm not spared

432
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,750
from making mistakes.

433
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,420
It's my responsibility.

434
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
But the real drugs

435
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,510
were smuggled out from Yunhe.

436
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,820
And no one

437
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,030
foresaw it.

438
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,030
You should all reflect too.

439
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,340
Now, imitations

440
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,870
of the Yellow Capsule have been discovered.

441
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,820
Think about it.

442
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,750
What has happened?

443
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,180
You've heard it many times,

444
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,270
but I'm still going to say it today.

445
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,030
All of you here.

446
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,340
Aren't you ashamed

447
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,550
to be wearing the police uniform?

448
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Can you proudly put on the police hat?

449
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,990
I admit.

450
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,270
As a border county, the drug scene

451
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,790
in Yunhe is complicated.

452
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,390
Drug deals are rampant.

453
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,630
Counter Narcotics is tough.

454
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,220
But all of that

455
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,580
is no reason or excuse for us

456
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,270
to not do our best.

457
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,940
Here is my order.

458
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,060
This case will be investigated thoroughly.

459
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,270
Find the source

460
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,510
of the counterfeit Yellow Capsules.

461
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,670
Publish a police notice immediately.

462
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,870
Make a statement

463
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,580
regarding the tea factory incident

464
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,510
and the Yundian death by fire.

465
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,940
Give the public a reasonable explanation.

466
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,510
Sir.

467
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,510
I am responsible.

468
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,220
I will organize and lead the team

469
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,060
to crack the case.

470
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,630
I'll make sure the police force

471
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,220
and the public

472
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,270
get a satisfactory answer.

473
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,580
Sir.

474
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,990
I was negligent.

475
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,420
I wasn't thorough enough.

476
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,990
I should be held responsible.

477
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,580
I care not about guilt

478
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,630
at this point.

479
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,550
Or who it is

480
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,870
that should bear the responsibility.

481
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,990
I know everyone's been working hard.

482
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,340
I also know what each of you

483
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,510
had to deal with

484
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,670
at your job.

485
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,820
You are paid a meager salary.

486
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,580
Yet you are placed in the front line.

487
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,990
Faced with temptations,

488
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,870
questions from family members,

489
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,060
varying

490
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,550
and complicated situations,

491
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,300
and even death itself.

492
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,060
But I did not see

493
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,550
anyone cower in fear.

494
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,990
What I saw

495
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,390
was your doubling down at your work

496
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,820
and putting yourself

497
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,340
through more hardship and misunderstandings.

498
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Your will

499
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,670
is strong and resolute.

500
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,150
Because I firmly believe

501
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,460
that in your heart,

502
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,870
you think of this job

503
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,670
as life itself.

504
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,340
Behind every one

505
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,670
of the enemy's rampant actions,

506
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,390
there will surely be loopholes.

507
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,100
All the difficulties and pressure

508
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,180
are opportunities

509
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,420
for us to discover the problems.

510
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,630
It is our chance

511
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,700
to regain our foothold.

512
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,100
So hold your heads high.

513
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,700
Straighten your backs.

514
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,790
It is in times like these,

515
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,150
that we have to trust more in ourselves

516
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,940
and have faith in our comrades.

517
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,750
We are a tough team.

518
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Our will is as strong as steel.

519
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,420
Comrades.

520
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,670
Now is not the time to be dispirited.

521
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,670
What I need from you

522
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,390
is that you gather all your courage

523
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,220
to face it and defeat it!

524
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,940
Bring all drug dealers

525
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,580
to justice.

526
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,150
Eliminate the drug scene

527
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,750
once and for all

528
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,990
from Yunhe.

529
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,870
You can do this!

530
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,150
You will.

531
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,630
Am I right?

532
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,030
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

533
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,940
Game over.

534
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,300
This is game over.

535
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,340
The police will soon find this place.

536
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,870
They'll find this place.

537
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,180
I'm done.

538
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,910
I quit.

539
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,420
No need to be scared.

540
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,940
Within Yunhe,

541
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,910
only I know what you did.

542
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,300
If I keep quiet,

543
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
you'll be fine.

544
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,220
This was an accident.

545
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,030
Rest assured.

546
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,340
I'll take care of the rest.

547
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,820
They're waiting there in Hong Kong, China.

548
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,990
I told you.

549
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,790
I need more time.

550
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
And don't simply promise

551
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,580
the people in Hong Kong, China.

552
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,270
All right?

553
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,700
There's no use pushing me.

554
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,670
This isn't something that can be done

555
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,460
in a few days.

556
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,940
Remember.

557
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,670
Don't simply touch my stuff again.

558
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,670
If there's nothing else,

559
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,550
don't come here again.

560
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,670
Dismiss.

561
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,180
Deputy Chief Chen.

562
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,670
I'd like to have a word with you in private.

563
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,030
Deputy Chief Chen.

564
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,180
Every word you said just now

565
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,550
was like a knife through my heart.

566
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,460
I made mistakes on the job.

567
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,820
I admit it.

568
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,270
I sincerely ask to be admonished

569
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,060
by the organization.

570
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,870
I hope the organization would reconsider

571
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,700
the candidate for the director of Yunhe PSB.

572
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,340
My wish is to bring new life

573
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,820
to the counter-narcotics work in Yunhe.

574
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,270
I'd also like to ask the organization

575
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,510
not to transfer me away from Yunhe.

576
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,990
Is that possible?

577
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,790
I asked you before

578
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,790
why you insisted on staying at Yunhe.

579
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,550
I hope to get

580
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,750
an honest answer from you.

581
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,150
It's been a long time.

582
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,990
There isn't a day when

583
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,670
I did not wish to eliminate

584
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,750
all criminal organizations from Yunhe.

585
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,790
Every day, I wish

586
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,220
I could bring all those drug traffickers

587
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,390
to justice.

588
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,870
But I've been in this position

589
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,750
for three years.

590
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,870
I haven't been able to do it.

591
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,700
Chief Gong suffered a gunshot wound

592
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,180
and is yet to regain his ability to talk.

593
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,550
Kaihua

594
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,100
was bitten by a drug dealer with AIDS

595
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,580
and ended up not being able to get married.

596
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,870
My informant from 20 years ago

597
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,820
and his daughter

598
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,030
are once again implicated.

599
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,460
Their safety is compromised.

600
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,630
And those

601
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,870
who are buried at the cemetery of martyrs.

602
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,820
My former brothers.

603
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,460
I have to answer to them.

604
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,150
I haven't been able to do it.

605
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,630
To answer to the people of Yunhe,

606
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,060
the families that were ruined by drugs,

607
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,300
and the people who died because of drugs.

608
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,270
I wasn't able to do it.

609
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,870
So, I can't leave.

610
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,220
Nor will I.

611
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,900
Sir!

612
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:25,750
Chief Liu.

613
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,620
I have something

614
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,790
to report to you.

615
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,860
While carrying out the operation

616
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,220
at the tea factory that night,

617
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,380
I made a call.

618
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,660
To whom?

619
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,220
My sister, Yang Ling.

620
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,460
When did you call her?

621
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,110
When Chen Yu

622
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,310
and I were on the way to the border.

623
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,550
I made the call using a public telephone.

624
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,310
You told her

625
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,220
details about the operation?

626
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,940
No.

627
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,140
I wouldn't divulge those details

628
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,110
to anyone.

629
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,110
I was just worried about her safety.

630
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,590
So I told her

631
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,590
not to go back to the factory that night.

632
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,660
I did not say

633
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,750
a word more.

634
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,510
Chief Liu.

635
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,420
I'm sorry.

636
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,310
I broke the rule.

637
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,380
I will accept punishment.

638
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,140
Write me a detailed report.

639
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,350
And a reflection.

640
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,700
Yes, sir.

641
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,350
You've asked me before

642
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,900
about the transfer
to Provincial Public Security Bureau.

643
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,180
You asked about my family,

644
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,420
wife, and daughter.

645
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,110
I really have no answer.

646
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,180
Because you're not me.

647
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,550
Over the years,

648
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,460
I've gotten used to it.

649
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,350
It's fine even if you don't get it.

650
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,700
Perhaps one day you will.

651
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,310
But Yunhe

652
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,700
is where I put on my police uniform.

653
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,380
It's been more than 30 years.

654
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,140
I do not want

655
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,830
it to be a comma when I take off

656
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,380
my uniform.

657
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,270
I want it to be a full stop.

658
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,350
I am an anti-narcotics police officer.

659
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,630
This is what I'm meant to do.

660
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,180
I understand.

661
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,030
And I admire

662
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,550
your dedication to countering narcotics.

663
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:14,940
At the same time,

664
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,030
I also wish to apologize to you.

665
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,630
To be honest, I had doubts

666
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,150
about you at one point.

667
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,630
Particularly when Ba died

668
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,660
and the counter-narcotics operation in Yunhe

669
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,220
was at a standstill.

670
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,030
I sent Lan Anran

671
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,110
to your team.

672
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,870
So she could monitor your every move.

673
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,980
I hope you understand my position.

674
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,830
You said

675
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,220
that if you don't maintain some doubt

676
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,460
while countering narcotics in Yunhe,

677
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,390
that is a dereliction of duty.

678
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,180
I get it.

679
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,150
From today onward,

680
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,590
I will not question your conviction

681
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,220
as a police officer again.

682
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,980
I also hope

683
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,740
you'll trust me wholeheartedly.

684
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,630
