00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,020
CRASH

2
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:36,311
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:39,020
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,561
CERTIFICATE OF ENTRY
AND DEPARTURE

5
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,853
I found out that he came back
to Korea a year and a half ago.

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,353
You met Kim Minsung, right?

7
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,269
I thought he had died.

8
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,020
He was alive.

9
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,353
Where is he now?

10
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:04,812
I can't tell you.

11
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:08,645
-Jungsub.
-He still has unfinished business.

12
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,311
No matter what it is,

13
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:15,269
I plan to protect him.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,103
RESTRICTED CALL

15
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:45,895
Hello?

16
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:52,978
-Who are you?
-I actually told him not to do it.

17
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:54,561
But Jungwook said

18
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:57,103
that we shouldn't leave her be.

19
00:01:58,062 --> 00:01:59,436
He said she saw his face.

20
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,478
He said we must kill her.

21
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:03,436
Han Kyungsoo. You're Han Kyungsoo, right?

22
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:11,269
I'm telling you the truth.
I tried to stop him.

23
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:13,770
But Jungwook, that bastard…

24
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,269
He's unstoppable when he goes crazy.

25
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,561
He always gets his way.

26
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:21,228
I tried to stop him,

27
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,228
but he hit that woman
with his car in the end.

28
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,728
Who are you, you bastard?

29
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,478
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:31,311
I'll send you a location. Come alone.

31
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:35,645
If you tell anyone,
I'll post this on the Internet.

32
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:38,228
Hello? Hey. Hello?

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,311
Damn it.

34
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,144
Are you going to leave him be?

35
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:57,103
This bastard killed Jaeyoung.
You need to take revenge.

36
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,728
I want to tear him to pieces,

37
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:03,978
but Myunghak insists on
keeping things lawful.

38
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:06,645
Uncle, for goodness' sake.

39
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:11,561
Chairman Yang,

40
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:14,436
since when did you abide by the law?

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,062
To be completely honest,

42
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,770
wasn't this what my father needed you for?

43
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:22,436
How will you get anything done
if you abide by the law?

44
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:31,228
Forget it.

45
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,062
I'll go alone.

46
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:39,311
I'll avenge

47
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,269
Jaeyoung's death.

48
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:46,728
Jungwook.

49
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:50,394
I feel ashamed.

50
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:54,603
I didn't prioritize Jaeyoung
as much as his friend did.

51
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,186
Where are they?

52
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:25,853
What are you looking for?

53
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:28,186
NFS materials. Anything will do.

54
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,561
National Forensic Service? Hold on.

55
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,728
National Forensic Service.

56
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:38,020
Here. This is a tire analysis
we received when the rapist,

57
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,186
Park Sungjin, ran over the victim.

58
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:51,436
What? Why does this…

59
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,770
KIM HYUNMIN

60
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:21,978
I heard you graduated from KAIST.
I'm also a fellow graduate.

61
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,645
Excuse me.

62
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,020
The culprit who drives the black car…

63
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,436
KIM HYUNMIN

64
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:38,895
…has a crippled leg.

65
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:47,520
Oh, Inspector Cha, what brings you here
at this hour?

66
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:51,561
Mr. Kim Minsung.

67
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,561
Perhaps, I should call you
Mr. Kim Hyunmin now.

68
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:05,686
CRASH

69
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:08,520
EPISODE 10

70
00:06:16,603 --> 00:06:18,186
I never imagined

71
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,186
that we'd meet like this.

72
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:28,561
I'm glad to see you're alive.

73
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,978
Did the name, Kim Hyunmin,

74
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:41,020
come from Lee Hyunsoo and your name?

75
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:48,686
It was our baby's name.

76
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:51,853
Our unborn baby.

77
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:55,561
It was my wife's idea.

78
00:06:57,103 --> 00:06:58,812
I never imagined that I'd use it.

79
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:05,645
Did you plan this from the start?

80
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:09,144
You faked your death,
changed your identity,

81
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,353
and became a forensic analyst, all to--

82
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,186
The man named Kim Minsung

83
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:16,228
died along with Hyunsoo
at the scene of the accident.

84
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,062
I simply wanted

85
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:23,394
to lead a normal life like the others

86
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,062
as if nothing had happened.

87
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:30,561
I wanted to forget everything
and move on, like a coward.

88
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,520
But…

89
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:38,812
I couldn't do that.

90
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,478
EUNDONG JUNCTION ACCIDENT

91
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,978
Since I found out the truth.

92
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:56,937
TIRE MARK ON THE VICTIM'S BODY
AND TIRE MARK OF SUSPECT'S TIRE

93
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,603
TIRE MARK ON THE VICTIM DOES NOT
MATCH THE SUSPECT'S TIRE

94
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,603
The tire mark on Hyunsoo's body…

95
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:10,311
THE TIRE MARK IS NOT A MATCH

96
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:11,895
…didn't come from your car.

97
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,353
So I wondered why there was
no further investigation.

98
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,895
EQUUS E330 TIRE

99
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,062
The reason was simple.

100
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:28,812
EQUUS E330 TIRE

101
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,978
The culprit was running the investigation.

102
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,186
There were two tire marks.

103
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:38,478
One came from forward movement.

104
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,686
One from backward movement.

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,103
Those bastards killed her.

106
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,436
She was still alive, but they killed her.

107
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,186
That doesn't give you
the right to murder for revenge.

108
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:56,394
Then what makes you different from them?

109
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:59,186
You could've let the law be the judge.
Why did you--

110
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,937
Let the law be the judge?

111
00:09:03,353 --> 00:09:06,478
While working here at NFS,
I've followed many cases.

112
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:10,269
I know what evidence is crucial
and how severe the sentence will be.

113
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,978
There was no evidence.

114
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:17,394
I couldn't prove the tire
belonged to Pyo Myunghak.

115
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:20,394
Oh, Han Kyungsoo said

116
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,103
that I'll never be able to catch
Pyo Myunghak and Pyo Jungwook.

117
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,020
Where do you think he got that conviction?

118
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,770
The world must've taught him.

119
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:33,812
He must've seen it happen repeatedly.

120
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,311
-Where are you visiting?
-It's an urgent arrest. Open up.

121
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:43,812
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,436
Hurry and let them in.

123
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
Mr. Cha Yeonho.

124
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:58,186
Why did you become an officer?

125
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,144
You saw it too.

126
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:02,812
You saw how those bastards were living.

127
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,686
Even after committing
such a horrendous crime,

128
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,812
they keep repeating the same mistakes
without any remorse.

129
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:12,645
Putting those bastards in prison
won't change a thing.

130
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,895
What is the point of punishment
if the culprits aren't remorseful?

131
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,311
What is the point of punishment
if the victim can't agree to it?

132
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:24,853
Just because the victim can't agree
and the culprits aren't remorseful,

133
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:27,978
it doesn't justify what you're doing now.

134
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,062
No one has the right
to take another person's life.

135
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,144
How unfortunate.

136
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:43,103
I thought we understood each other.

137
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,269
I thought about that night
hundreds and thousands of times.

138
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:49,269
"What if I had left later?

139
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:52,812
What if I hadn't dropped the CD?
What if I had turned the wheel sooner?"

140
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,353
But the conclusion was always the same.

141
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:58,937
No matter how much I regret it,

142
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,603
I can't change what happened.

143
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:08,186
But it's possible to correct a wrong.

144
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:12,353
Pyo Myunghak and Pyo Jungwook's
impressive status doesn't matter.

145
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,103
The real culprits who killed Lee Hyunsoo…

146
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,103
I promise I'll catch them.

147
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:19,436
So please just trust me

148
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,144
and turn yourself in.

149
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,520
Because of me, the two of you…

150
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:35,269
To the two of you,

151
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,686
I don't know what I should say
to beg for forgiveness.

152
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,812
No, I don't even deserve forgiveness.

153
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:46,895
Though it's much too late…

154
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,186
I really wanted to tell you this.

155
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:57,394
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,895
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,062
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:25,978
I still have unfinished business.

159
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,228
I'm sorry, Mr. Cha Yeonho.

160
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,686
I spotted the car.

161
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:52,478
Stop!

162
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:05,269
-Don't just stand there! Get the car!
-Yes, sir!

163
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:09,561
Darn it.

164
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:00,353
Chairman Yang, we found the car.

165
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,353
Bring him to me after a good beating.

166
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:06,895
Make sure he's still breathing.

167
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:10,186
I'll carry out the last blow.

168
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,186
Jungwook.

169
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:06,853
Commence operation.

170
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,895
First, decide which way
you're going to turn. If it's the left,

171
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:25,394
count to three in your head.

172
00:19:58,311 --> 00:19:59,895
STOP

173
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:17,978
Arrest them all for attempted murder
and reckless driving.

174
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,228
Yes, sir.

175
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,353
Come on.

176
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:26,394
All right.

177
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:34,062
-You okay? Were you hurt?
-I'm fine.

178
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:52,812
Kim Minsung, get out.

179
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,728
Min Sohee.

180
00:20:57,436 --> 00:20:58,937
Hey, he's running away.

181
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,603
-Where's Kim Minsung?
-Kim Minsung?

182
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:05,937
By now, he should be
at Namgang Police Station.

183
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:11,020
It's from the same printer.

184
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,020
TEN HOURS AGO

185
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,353
Kim Hyunmin, the forensic analyst,
is Kim Minsung.

186
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:18,937
He's getting revenge for his late wife
after changing his identity.

187
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,144
He'll go after Pyo Jungwook soon.
We must catch him first.

188
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:23,394
Let's arrest him right away.

189
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:25,686
May I

190
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:28,937
try to persuade him?

191
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,728
I'll ask him to turn himself in.

192
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:33,812
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

193
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:36,728
I want to give him a chance.

194
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:40,186
I'm sure he knows exactly what he's doing.

195
00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:43,686
Okay. Go ahead.

196
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:48,144
While Inspector Cha persuades Kim Minsung,
we'll surround the area and wait.

197
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:50,436
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

198
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:55,812
Because of me, the two of you…

199
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,520
To the two of you,

200
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:01,186
I don't know what I should say
to beg for forgiveness.

201
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:02,853
I don't even deserve forgiveness.

202
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:05,812
Though it's much too late…

203
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:09,436
I really wanted to tell you this.

204
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,353
I'm sorry.

205
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:16,937
I'm sorry.

206
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:21,228
I'm sorry.

207
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:25,978
I still have unfinished business.

208
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:28,186
I'm sorry, Mr. Cha Yeonho.

209
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:29,144
Inspector Cha.

210
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:30,103
-Lieutenant.
-Wait.

211
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:33,478
You two, follow me.

212
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,645
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

213
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,686
Inspector Cha, are you okay?

214
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,686
Yes, but Kim Minsung…

215
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,144
Kim Minsung got away.

216
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:58,436
Kim Minsung.

217
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:01,728
That's enough now.

218
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:05,394
Mr. Kim Hyunmin…
I mean, Mr. Kim Minsung has been found.

219
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:06,311
Take him.

220
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:07,394
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,895
Captain.

222
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,020
Why does it have to be today?

223
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:29,228
All these years, you couldn't do anything.

224
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:32,144
You didn't know anything.

225
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:33,895
So why does it have to be today?

226
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,895
Han Kyungsoo told me everything.

227
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:41,269
He told me how
Pyo Jungwook killed my dear Hyunsoo.

228
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:44,020
TEN YEARS AGO

229
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,062
Jungwook, your father's car is amazing.

230
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:49,020
-I know, punk. He gets so many bribes.
-Pay up, you jerk.

231
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:51,062
Among the girls we met yesterday,

232
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:53,353
what about the lunatic
who is in love with you?

233
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:57,520
Get lost. You can have her, you punk.

234
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,311
-All right.
-Hey, let's take a photo.

235
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,645
What was that?

236
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:13,812
-Did you hit a person?
-I told you to drive carefully.

237
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:17,394
A person… A person…

238
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:18,311
Damn it.

239
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:25,311
Gosh.

240
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:27,520
Hey.

241
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:32,311
Hey. Hey!

242
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:36,478
For goodness' sake.

243
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,645
What are we going to do?

244
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,228
I told you to drive carefully, you idiot.

245
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:49,770
What are we going to do?

246
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,311
Hey, that person…

247
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:55,394
What are we going to do?

248
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:59,561
We need to call 911.

249
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:05,686
Shut up, you punk.

250
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,895
Can't you see what happened?
Have you no idea?

251
00:25:07,978 --> 00:25:10,645
What are you doing?
Let's run before someone sees us.

252
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:14,269
- Come here.
- Please help me…

253
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,645
Please…

254
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:29,186
Please help me.

255
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,020
Jungwook, Jaeyoung.

256
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:37,020
She's pregnant. What do we do?

257
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,478
What are we going to do?

258
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:45,103
My goodness.

259
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:48,062
What should we do?

260
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:49,978
What do we do?

261
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,269
My baby…

262
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,812
Please save my baby…

263
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:15,478
Please.

264
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:23,937
Hey, Jungwook!

265
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,812
-Jungwook. Pyo Jungwook.
-Let go of me.

266
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:29,020
Pyo Jungwook! You crazy bastard!

267
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:31,478
Stop calling my name, you punk.

268
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:33,645
Hey, my dad is a police officer.

269
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:35,937
He's a high-ranking police officer!

270
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:39,228
It's all because of you.

271
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:43,520
This is all because
you called my name, you punk.

272
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:53,269
Hey!

273
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:55,228
Where are you going?

274
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:59,770
Jaeyoung.

275
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:03,520
Hey.

276
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:08,686
-What is he doing?
-Hey!

277
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,478
Is he driving?

278
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,770
What are you doing?
You bastard!

279
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,603
Please…

280
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,728
You crazy bastard!

281
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:49,561
Pyo Jungwook killed her.

282
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:52,770
He did it in cold blood
even though Hyunsoo was alive.

283
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,311
At the very least,

284
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:58,144
I should've killed him with my own hands.

285
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,311
Why?

286
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:04,144
Why are you saving someone like him?

287
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:06,812
He doesn't deserve to be saved.

288
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,062
We aren't doing this to save Pyo Jungwook.

289
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:12,728
We're here to stop you
from committing more crimes.

290
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:18,436
Mr. Kim Minsung.

291
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:22,353
You know about
my father's accident, right?

292
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:28,020
I want to catch Pyo Jungwook
more than anyone.

293
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:30,853
So please give me a chance.

294
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:35,812
I'll catch Pyo Jungwook by all means.

295
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:55,520
I was supposed to meet Pyo Jungwook.

296
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:57,561
Where?

297
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:03,478
IF YOU WANT TO MEET ME
COME TO THIS ADDRESS

298
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:05,186
- Wonseong-gu?
- Hold on.

299
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:08,603
I know this address.

300
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:11,144
Yang Jaeyoung attempted
to take Kim Minju there.

301
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:12,770
It's the company's vacation home.

302
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,020
Hold on.

303
00:29:14,978 --> 00:29:15,978
It's a trap.

304
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:18,645
We could use it to catch Pyo Jungwook.

305
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:23,020
What is it?

306
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,269
What should we do?
It's Director General Lee Taeju.

307
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,561
Listen carefully.

308
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,603
We can't hand over Kim Minsung
if we want to catch Pyo Jungwook.

309
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:37,603
Pyo Jungwook will move
only if Kim Minsung shows up.

310
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:43,645
Your black car with tinted windows
is here, right?

311
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,228
-I'll lure them.
-Okay. Lieutenant Min, lure them.

312
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:50,937
The rest will cut off the retreat.

313
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,144
Yes, sir.

314
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,228
Why? Did you think
that we missed Kim Minsung?

315
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,394
Or did you want us to miss him?

316
00:30:03,478 --> 00:30:05,353
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

317
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,353
- We have Pyo Jungwook's location.
- Okay.

318
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:09,353
-Did you say Pyo Jungwook?
-Pardon?

319
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:11,186
Hey, why would that name come up?

320
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,561
Lieutenant Min, get going.
I'll take care of this.

321
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:16,978
Yes, sir.

322
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:18,478
Hold on.

323
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:20,436
Take them. Come on.

324
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,394
You should stay here for a second.

325
00:30:22,478 --> 00:30:24,853
There's still a rat to catch.

326
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:31,103
You must be mistaken.

327
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:35,394
I'm currently in charge of TCI
at Namgang Police Station.

328
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:37,311
You're waiting to be assigned.

329
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,978
Please do me a favor.

330
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,770
Why don't you mind your own business?

331
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:50,062
Don't meddle and risk losing your team.

332
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,937
Damn it. Hey.

333
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,603
I didn't know you had that side.

334
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,978
I guess I forgot to tell you.

335
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:09,353
I used to be in the Major Crimes Division.

336
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:12,686
I'm worried for you.

337
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,144
-You'll lose your pension at this rate.
-It's okay.

338
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:18,520
I'm not the one
who needs to worry about that.

339
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,062
It's you and Pyo Myunghak.

340
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:48,144
Do you remember what you learned?
The shoulder throw?

341
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:52,020
Forget it. Throwing big men
will give you a herniated disc.

342
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:54,394
Just beat them
with the police baton, okay?

343
00:31:55,394 --> 00:31:56,895
No, I'll give it a try.

344
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
I'm more worried about Detective Woo.

345
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,103
He should live up to his size.

346
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:05,186
Do you know why I don't use my fists?

347
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,895
It's because people will die
if I use my fists.

348
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:11,103
Whatever.
It's dangerous, so stay in the back.

349
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:14,144
Let's wrap things up and eat out.

350
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:15,812
All right. What will we eat?

351
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:17,770
- How about spicy pork?
- Spicy pork again?

352
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,686
Seriously?
Inspector Cha, don't be like that.

353
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:34,020
What's going on?
Why haven't we heard from them?

354
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:36,311
Here.

355
00:32:37,853 --> 00:32:39,394
What happened?

356
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:43,062
Chairman Yang Seokchan.

357
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,478
I'm Lieutenant Min Sohee
of Namgang Police Station.

358
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,353
Please open the door.

359
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:52,311
Damn it!

360
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,394
-Hey, break it open.
-Okay.

361
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:03,561
Hey, Jungwook.

362
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:06,645
Go out from the back door.
I'll take care of this.

363
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:09,436
Let's go.

364
00:33:15,812 --> 00:33:17,311
Gosh, there's a lot.

365
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:19,228
Raise your hand if you're in a tracksuit.

366
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:24,228
Who's wearing a tracksuit? Okay.

367
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:25,770
Take care of the tracksuits.

368
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,645
Hands down. Suits, raise your hand.

369
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:29,186
Who's wearing a suit?

370
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,062
Okay. Inspector Cha, they're ours.

371
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,812
- Okay.
- Put them down.

372
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:38,269
Tracksuits, that way. Suits, this way.

373
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:40,311
- This way?
- Yes.

374
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,269
All right.

375
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,603
Thank you.

376
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:49,853
You punks, get it together. Okay?

377
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:56,394
Have you punks lost your minds?

378
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:59,269
How dare you come here
with just three people?

379
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:00,895
Chairman, there are four.

380
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:03,895
Isn't he one of us?

381
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:07,269
-He's one of us!
-Excuse me? I'm a police officer!

382
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:09,728
Hey, a police officer shouldn't look

383
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:11,103
like that.

384
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:14,603
I look cuter than you.
You look like my toe.

385
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:15,728
That's too far.

386
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,228
Guys.

387
00:34:19,186 --> 00:34:20,436
Go get them.

388
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:22,937
All right.

389
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,770
Hey! You bastard!

390
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:09,228
Mr. Toe.

391
00:35:09,812 --> 00:35:11,311
You're here.

392
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:16,978
For goodness' sake. Hey.

393
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:19,603
Hey, bring it on.

394
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:21,937
Come on.

395
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:33,561
I'm exhausted.

396
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:35,812
Lieutenant, leave them to us.

397
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,645
-Catch Pyo Jungwook.
-Okay.

398
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:39,144
Go that way. I'll go this way.

399
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:41,603
Gosh.

400
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:02,186
Damn it.

401
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:10,144
Mr. Pyo Jungwook. Let's go now.

402
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:12,603
Get in while I'm asking nicely.

403
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:16,478
How entertaining.

404
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:23,895
You guys are trying so hard.

405
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:26,895
Come here.

406
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:34,436
- All right.
- Hey.

407
00:36:47,186 --> 00:36:49,269
What do you think you're doing?

408
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:51,895
Why do you punks keep bothering--

409
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:54,353
What's this? Hey, what the hell?

410
00:36:54,436 --> 00:36:56,228
Let go of me, you bastard!

411
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:59,020
- Let go of me.
- Hey!

412
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,144
- Let go!
- Mr. Yang Seokchan.

413
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:14,812
You're under arrest for conspiracy
and aiding and abetting murder.

414
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:17,728
It wasn't me! Let go of me!

415
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,603
- Assisting in murder?
- Yes, sir.

416
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:35,645
Where are they now?

417
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,645
They were moved to Namgang Police Station.

418
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:40,062
I told them to keep things down!

419
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:43,103
Okay.

420
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,394
At Seoul Namgang Police Station,

421
00:37:53,478 --> 00:37:55,478
Chairman Yang Seokchan
of YSC Constructions

422
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:57,770
and Pyo Jungwook,
Commissioner General Pyo's son,

423
00:37:57,853 --> 00:38:00,520
are confined for conspiracy
and attempted murder.

424
00:38:00,603 --> 00:38:03,020
Namgang Police Station is

425
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:06,520
the talk of the town these days.

426
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:09,645
I've hated getting attention
ever since I was in middle school.

427
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:13,520
My favorite phrase is "safe and sound."

428
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:15,728
That was why I became a civil servant.

429
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:20,228
Commissioner General Pyo's son,
a gangster-turned-chairman--

430
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:23,144
And who was the other one?
The man named Kim something.

431
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:26,269
The murder suspect who's an analyst
at National Forensic Service.

432
00:38:29,144 --> 00:38:33,062
Are you sure
this is something we can handle?

433
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,436
Why can't we handle it?

434
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,353
If it's too much,
Criminal Division can take over.

435
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:39,937
Hold on.
That isn't what's important.

436
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,103
We should consider the severity
of the situation and choose our direction.

437
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:48,103
It sounds like you want us to come up
with a frame before the investigation.

438
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:50,436
Why would you twist my words?

439
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,853
Your words were loaded.

440
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:55,186
- My words weren't loaded.
- Listen--

441
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:56,394
Quiet!

442
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:02,561
Don't you understand
the current situation?

443
00:39:02,645 --> 00:39:04,436
Let's put aside the other matters.

444
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,853
What should we do about Pyo Jungwook,
Commissioner General's son?

445
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:10,937
When he was brought in
for Lieutenant Min's father's case,

446
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,895
we used all our might.

447
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:18,394
What happened as a result?
Captain Jung got a disciplinary action.

448
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:20,853
What makes you think
it won't happen again?

449
00:39:20,937 --> 00:39:22,645
Then we'll arrest him again,

450
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:24,812
no matter what it takes.

451
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:30,770
Pyo Jungwook is the driver
who caused my father's accident.

452
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:33,144
He's the murderer
who ran over Lee Hyunsoo.

453
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:36,353
He has conspired and attempted
the murder of Kim Minsung.

454
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:38,520
We have enough evidence.

455
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:42,020
So why couldn't we put him behind bars?

456
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:45,603
There's only one reason.

457
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:47,478
Because we feigned ignorance.

458
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:49,144
We turned a blind eye.

459
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:52,020
It resulted in a second criminal,
like Kim Minsung.

460
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:55,561
Perhaps he may get away again,
just like last time.

461
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,394
Then we should arrest him again and again

462
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:02,228
until the end.

463
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,062
You can't enter.

464
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:07,436
What do you mean
Kim Minsung is off-limits?

465
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,853
Excuse me.

466
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:12,228
No one can visit him
without Director General Lee's permission.

467
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,144
We're the ones who arrested him.

468
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:17,353
Director General Lee is in charge, okay?

469
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:21,186
Go back.

470
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,812
Mr. Kim Hyunmin.

471
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:36,812
Do you admit to Yang Jaeyoung's murder?

472
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,020
What did you do to Mr. Han Kyungsoo?

473
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,728
You tried to murder
Pyo Jungwook too, right?

474
00:40:53,062 --> 00:40:54,645
What was the reason?

475
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:58,812
Because you lot couldn't do it.

476
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:02,853
Because you lot
couldn't punish those bastards.

477
00:41:02,937 --> 00:41:04,020
That's why…

478
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:07,853
That's why my wife

479
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:10,478
was murdered by those bastards.

480
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,478
Why do you think
the victims killed your wife?

481
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,520
Han Kyungsoo has testified.

482
00:41:34,645 --> 00:41:38,228
I told him not to do it.

483
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,311
Is this what you're talking about?

484
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:42,186
…that we shouldn't leave her be.

485
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:44,686
But he said she saw his face.

486
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:47,228
He said we must kill her.

487
00:41:57,062 --> 00:41:59,561
This footage was
from the dashcam of your car.

488
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,436
Didn't you get this testimony
through torture?

489
00:42:13,937 --> 00:42:15,728
A coerced confession.

490
00:42:16,394 --> 00:42:20,353
As for the video of Han Kyungsoo,
the evidence is inadmissible.

491
00:42:20,436 --> 00:42:24,686
A confession that's obtained
through torture, violence, or threat

492
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,561
is inadmissible due to coercion.

493
00:42:34,144 --> 00:42:36,853
How about attempted murder?

494
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:41,937
Wasn't it the work
of Chairman Yang's subordinates?

495
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:45,478
Kim Minsung was the one
who asked to meet first.

496
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,728
Once he heard
that Kim Minsung wanted to meet,

497
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:51,020
Chairman Yang lost his mind
and took an unpremeditated action.

498
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:56,478
Painting this as attempted murder
would be nonsense.

499
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,770
Right?

500
00:43:04,728 --> 00:43:07,311
-Lawyer Sung, you're good.
-Please raise my salary.

501
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:09,895
Of course.

502
00:43:11,603 --> 00:43:14,520
We're painting the attempted murder
of Kim Minsung

503
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:16,728
as Chairman Yang's unpredicted action.

504
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,686
Since Han Kyungsoo's testimony
came under duress,

505
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,645
it isn't admissible evidence.

506
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:25,478
Unless Han Kyungsoo is still alive.

507
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:28,394
I feel bad for Chairman Yang,

508
00:43:28,478 --> 00:43:30,770
but I'll use this chance to cut all ties

509
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:33,269
before the public say
I'm connected to a gang.

510
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:37,186
I'll give the reporters some breadcrumbs
regarding Chairman Yang's corruption.

511
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:40,603
Okay. You're in charge of the rabbit hunt.

512
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,812
How's Jungwook doing?

513
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:45,895
He met Lawyer Sung
and came up with a defense strategy.

514
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,770
He's eating well too.

515
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:52,478
Keep an eye on Kim Minsung.
Make sure he doesn't run his mouth.

516
00:43:53,228 --> 00:43:54,603
Don't worry, sir.

517
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:56,937
My men are watching him 24 hours a day.

518
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:03,353
Taeju.

519
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:05,978
You're nearly there.

520
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:08,478
Don't let your guard down.

521
00:44:09,353 --> 00:44:10,353
Yes, sir.

522
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:21,937
By the way,

523
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,770
where could he be?

524
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:29,311
Han Kyungsoo.

525
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,770
Captain,

526
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:46,020
at least pretend to fill out the report.

527
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,770
It's just a formality.

528
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,311
Chaeman.

529
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:52,686
Okay?

530
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,853
Hello.

531
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,020
-Hello.
-Min Sohee, why are you here?

532
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,103
-Did you get disciplinary action too?
-No.

533
00:45:00,186 --> 00:45:02,020
I need to see Captain for a second.

534
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,603
Captain, let's have a cup of tea.

535
00:45:07,353 --> 00:45:08,353
Put that down.

536
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:11,269
Goodbye.

537
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:13,062
Have a nice day. Thank you.

538
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,520
All right.

539
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:19,103
Here.

540
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:23,186
I'm happy to see everyone here.

541
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:25,311
You should be annoyed, not happy.

542
00:45:25,394 --> 00:45:29,561
We had to visit the police administration
in order to meet Captain.

543
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,269
Where's Kim Minsung?

544
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,728
He's in the holding cell.
Lee Taeju won't let us approach him.

545
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:38,269
It's obvious he'll quickly get a warrant
and wrap up the case.

546
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:40,978
That's Director General Lee's specialty.

547
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,812
And the analysis
of the tire mark on Lee Hyunsoo's body?

548
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:48,020
It wasn't in Kim Minsung's house or car.

549
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:50,853
I checked with National Forensic Service,

550
00:45:50,937 --> 00:45:54,686
but materials from 2014 were discarded
at the beginning of the year.

551
00:45:56,603 --> 00:46:00,228
If Han Kyungsoo is alive,
we might be able to find a way.

552
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:04,645
There's something on my mind.

553
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,520
At Kim Minsung's house, there were photos
of those who were involved.

554
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:16,228
Han Kyungsoo's photo wasn't marked.

555
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:23,686
Kim Minsung has another hideout.

556
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:26,686
What about the dashcam on his car?

557
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:29,436
Director General Lee's team
took all the materials.

558
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:50,645
Cheongmyeong 405.

559
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:53,311
Mr. Pyo Jungwook.

560
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,895
Do you admit to aiding and abetting

561
00:46:55,978 --> 00:46:59,062
Mr. Kim Minsung's murder
and the murder of Lee Hyunsoo?

562
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:01,062
I have nothing to say without my lawyer.

563
00:47:03,228 --> 00:47:06,144
Mr. Han Kyungsoo revealed it all.

564
00:47:07,978 --> 00:47:09,645
What you did that night.

565
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:14,103
He revealed how you murdered Lee Hyunsoo.

566
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:19,895
Is that so? Han Kyungsoo?

567
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:23,353
He was tortured.

568
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,645
What was it? A coerced confession?

569
00:47:25,728 --> 00:47:29,478
A confession that's obtained under duress
is inadmissible due to coercion.

570
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,561
You're a police officer, so you must know.

571
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:57,103
Come on in.

572
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:09,353
Let's resume after your lawyer gets here.

573
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:15,520
You messed with the wrong person.

574
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:17,436
Mr. Cha Yeonho.

575
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,353
The world is

576
00:48:20,645 --> 00:48:22,020
quite unfair.

577
00:48:23,478 --> 00:48:24,937
But that's just how it is.

578
00:48:27,394 --> 00:48:28,645
The world.

579
00:49:20,645 --> 00:49:23,686
How long will you stall?

580
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,311
It's a human rights violation.

581
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:28,353
You'd better be prepared
if you can't get a warrant in 48 hours.

582
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:29,645
Uncuff him.

583
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:51,228
What are you doing here?

584
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:03,103
THREE HOURS AGO

585
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:06,103
What about the dashcam on his car?

586
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:09,103
Director General Lee's team
took all the materials.

587
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:11,103
Not all of them.

588
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:17,770
The footage from his dashcam.
I backed it up just in case.

589
00:50:17,853 --> 00:50:20,937
- Seriously?
- Well done!

590
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,353
Han Kyungsoo.

591
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:42,520
Are you okay? Han Kyungsoo.

592
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:46,269
Are you okay?

593
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,020
Can you walk?

594
00:51:12,394 --> 00:51:13,686
Hey, Jungwook.

595
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:17,436
Let's stop now.

596
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:21,103
Stop what? What did we do?

597
00:51:23,561 --> 00:51:26,520
-You killed that woman.
-Shut up, you fool!

598
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:27,812
Sit down, Pyo Jungwook.

599
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,728
Please calm down.

600
00:51:33,436 --> 00:51:34,436
Pyo Jungwook.

601
00:51:36,436 --> 00:51:38,103
This is just the beginning.

602
00:51:38,186 --> 00:51:39,728
From now on,

603
00:51:40,895 --> 00:51:43,228
I'll make you pay for all your sins.

604
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,686
Hey. Say something.

605
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,269
Why--

606
00:51:58,353 --> 00:52:00,812
Why are you all out to get me?

607
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,937
-Why?
-Take him outside.

608
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:05,770
- Come here.
- Damn it.

609
00:52:05,853 --> 00:52:07,478
- Let go of me!
- Come here.

610
00:52:08,937 --> 00:52:10,228
Let go!

611
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:13,186
Damn it!

612
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:15,478
It's insufferable!

613
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:27,937
Why do you think
Mr. Kim Minsung kept you alive?

614
00:52:30,645 --> 00:52:32,520
Although it's late,

615
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,686
you should testify truthfully in court.

616
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:40,186
That's the only way
to atone for what you did

617
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:42,103
to Kim Minsung and the late Lee Hyunsoo.

618
00:52:54,645 --> 00:52:56,020
I'm sorry.

619
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:03,770
I'm so sorry.

620
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:07,228
I…

621
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:10,853
I'm sorry.

622
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:21,520
I'm sorry.

623
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,478
Pyo Jungwook, the son
of Commissioner General Pyo Myunghak,

624
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:30,436
was confined for a murder charge
at Seoul Namdong Detention Center.

625
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,020
Along with Yang Seokchan,
Chairman of YSC Constructions,

626
00:53:33,103 --> 00:53:36,812
Mr. Pyo was under investigation
for conspiracy and attempted murder.

627
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:40,603
He was also charged for the accident
at Eundong Junction ten years ago

628
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:45,228
and murdering the victim, Ms. Lee,
by running her over.

629
00:53:45,311 --> 00:53:48,311
Meanwhile, Mr. Pyo's father,
Commissioner General Pyo Myunghak

630
00:53:48,394 --> 00:53:51,978
was the chief of Eunseong Police Station
at the time of the accident--

631
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:21,812
THE PYO FATHER AND SON'S
DIRTY TRUTH

632
00:54:23,269 --> 00:54:24,436
TEN YEARS AGO, PYO MYUNGHAK

633
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,561
CHIEF OF EUNSEONG POLICE STATION
RECEIVED A CALL

634
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:28,269
Father, I'm in trouble.

635
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:30,812
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

636
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:34,186
Commissioner General Pyo put the blame
on Mr. Cha, a college student,

637
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:36,812
and turned his son, Pyo Jungwook,
into a witness.

638
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:39,561
Pyo Jungwook currently
uses drugs and drives aggressively

639
00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:41,937
and leads the life of a true gangster.

640
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,311
I'm a gangster.

641
00:54:43,394 --> 00:54:46,062
Gosh, Koreans are quite talented.

642
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:47,770
How are they so creative?

643
00:54:47,853 --> 00:54:50,436
That's right. This is the power
of Korean content.

644
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
Who uploaded this video?

645
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:54,520
It's someone you know.

646
00:55:00,978 --> 00:55:02,062
Someone I know?

647
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,770
He's coming out.

648
00:55:08,186 --> 00:55:09,311
Over here.

649
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:13,353
Do you have anything to say?

650
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:21,645
I didn't think you'd actually
catch him. You are all incredible.

651
00:55:21,728 --> 00:55:23,937
- It's thanks to you, Reporter Ha.
- No way.

652
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,603
The timing was perfect, right?

653
00:55:25,686 --> 00:55:26,937
Yes.

654
00:55:27,561 --> 00:55:30,478
What? Were you the one
who uploaded that video?

655
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,436
Well, he asked me to do it.

656
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:36,311
You guys did it without my knowledge.

657
00:55:36,394 --> 00:55:39,353
You could get into trouble
if it becomes known.

658
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,812
I wouldn't have uploaded it
if I were afraid of trouble.

659
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:44,478
Just you wait.

660
00:55:44,561 --> 00:55:46,269
I'm preparing a second video.

661
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,353
Father, when can I leave?

662
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:24,728
This place is cold and suffocating.

663
00:56:26,269 --> 00:56:27,978
You can't leave for a while.

664
00:56:30,228 --> 00:56:31,062
What?

665
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:37,728
I have a press conference today.

666
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,937
Including the past accident,
I know nothing of your wrongdoings.

667
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,603
They were the actions of my immature son
when he was mentally unstable.

668
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:49,770
I'm the unrighteous father
who failed to educate his son.

669
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:53,937
What?

670
00:56:54,728 --> 00:56:57,436
I knew that you were unrighteous.

671
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:01,311
Are you cutting ties with your son too?

672
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:04,478
What would you do
if I tried to bring you down?

673
00:57:07,853 --> 00:57:10,103
If you want a reduced sentence,

674
00:57:11,603 --> 00:57:14,103
you need me in my position on the outside.

675
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:21,895
So please just keep your mouth shut.

676
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:25,353
"It's all my fault.
My father is unrelated."

677
00:57:25,436 --> 00:57:26,937
Repeat those words like a parrot.

678
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,144
Understood?

679
00:57:42,686 --> 00:57:44,937
My goodness, you're something else.

680
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,645
I still have so much to learn from you.

681
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,020
COMMISSIONER GENERAL
PYO MYUNGHAK

682
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:07,020
Please give me more radish kimchi.

683
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:08,561
Okay. Radish kimchi.

684
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,561
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

685
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,353
A word, please.

686
00:58:49,978 --> 00:58:52,186
Please say a few words.

687
00:58:57,561 --> 00:58:58,686
Go home.

688
00:59:08,895 --> 00:59:11,895
So please just keep your mouth shut.

689
00:59:11,978 --> 00:59:14,812
"It's all my fault.
My father is unrelated."

690
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:16,436
Repeat those words like a parrot.

691
00:59:17,228 --> 00:59:18,353
Understood?

692
00:59:20,645 --> 00:59:21,770
Cha Yeonho.

693
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,895
Cha Yeonho! Hey, Cha Yeonho!

694
00:59:26,978 --> 00:59:28,478
Bring Cha Yeonho here!

695
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:30,770
I have something to say! Bring Cha Yeonho!

696
00:59:30,853 --> 00:59:32,686
Be quiet.

697
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:54,937
Where are you going?

698
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,353
Why are you…

699
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:07,144
You are…

700
01:00:09,062 --> 01:00:10,186
Pyo Myunghak.

701
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:12,603
If you try anything funny,

702
01:00:12,686 --> 01:00:15,103
you'll end up
at the bottom of a river with me.

703
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:31,103
CRASH

704
01:00:58,478 --> 01:01:00,436
Commissioner General Pyo was kidnapped.

705
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,895
-Stop the car!
-Jungwook's father made me do it.

706
01:01:02,978 --> 01:01:05,311
-We need direct evidence.
-There might be an evidence.

707
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:07,394
Sir, let's get a jump on them.

708
01:01:07,478 --> 01:01:08,603
Get out!

709
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:10,937
Nothing is over yet.

710
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,353
I'd like to call

711
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:14,103
Commissioner General Pyo Myunghak
as a witness.

712
01:01:14,186 --> 01:01:16,103
I had some business
at the inspection office.

713
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:18,228
-The unlicensed taxi case.
-Give it a go.

714
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:21,603
As he was underage
at the time of the crime…

715
01:01:21,686 --> 01:01:22,686
I give my verdict.

716
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,937
Pyo Myunghak will use
any means to evade responsibility.

717
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,603
I won't let that happen.

718
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,728
