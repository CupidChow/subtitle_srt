00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:58,358
I'm GO Gwang-ryeol.

00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,233
What?

4
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,652
Goni sent me.

5
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:02,779
- You know my son?
- Yes.

6
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:03,446
Goni?

7
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:07,909
He sent this money.

8
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,078
Our company can't run without him there.

9
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,372
What company is that?

10
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,415
You must be his uncle.

11
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:15,750
What do you make?

12
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,921
Well, we make ah... zapping batteries!

13
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:21,130
Is that cash?

14
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,923
Yes.

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,300
Oh my!

16
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:25,635
Must've made it big.

17
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:27,220
I'll count it.

18
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:29,055
Are you okay?

19
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,641
- Get some pants.
- Okay.

20
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:35,978
Dae-gil, stay inside.

21
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:37,230
Tell me the truth...

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,192
Damn it.

23
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,862
Hi. Who are you?

24
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,743
You're Goni's nephew, right?

25
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,454
You look just like him! Come in.

26
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:55,873
Handsome boy.

27
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,084
What's your name?

28
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,671
My last name was PARK,
then it changed to HAM Dae-gil.

29
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,256
But my step dad died last year.

30
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,258
My name could change again.

31
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,634
Life is full of changes.

32
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,514
Is that so?

33
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:15,935
I'll give you some money.

34
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:20,940
This is for listening to your mom.

35
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,024
Thank you.

36
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,025
And this...

37
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,986
- for studying hard.
- Thank you.

38
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:26,279
And this...

39
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,739
for not fighting with friends.

40
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,116
Right. Don't fight.

41
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,451
For eating well.

42
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:34,495
Right. Eat well.

43
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:35,997
For not J-walking.

44
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:40,752
Right. Don't J-walk.

45
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:43,296
This kid's a hustler!

46
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,590
- See you next time.
- Thank you!

47
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,804
What's a hustler?

48
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,854
It's almost time to go, so let's bet big.

49
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:00,813
400 cards.

50
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:04,317
We're eating out
tonight, so let's end this.

51
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:05,526
I'll see you.

52
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,528
And raise you 600!

53
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,155
I'll see you.

54
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:15,411
And raise you 1000!

55
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,043
Lend me 800 cards.

56
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,170
80 cards interest, okay?

57
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:27,340
Robot pair!

58
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,176
Only the universe or water can beat robots!

59
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,844
But there are no such cards!

60
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,306
Thank you!

61
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:36,849
Wait.

62
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,477
Dying to eat out. What's the rush?

63
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,523
Stupid!

64
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,484
Doc can't beat a snail! Stupid!

65
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:47,235
Stupid!

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,861
Water beats robots, right?

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,245
Sweat isn't water!

68
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:58,830
Sweat isn't water!

69
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:02,500
I want one...

70
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,002

Having a baby when I gotta play!

89
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:11,819
You can't leave.

90
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,405
With a player missing, it's not fun, right?

91
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:16,157
Just get a new player.

92
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,993
Dae-gil? Play till I get back.

93
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:19,702

Though there's no class in gambling...

How can I win off a kid

97
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,878
Can a hustler play?

98
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,714
We agreed no substitutes!

99
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,382
But this is handmade!

100
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:38,220

So, you're the kid who's a hustler

111
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,667
I heard your name is Gwang-chul.

112
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,834
What?

113
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,963
Gwang-chul... bro.

114
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:16,258
In gambling, money is king
and the better player rules

115
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:19,011
Shit.

116
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,641
Prepare to wet your pants, kid.

117
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:25,810
Sure.

118
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,324
7 pair! He wins again!

119
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:41,367
Did I wet my pants?

120
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:44,328
Out of cash already?

121
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,914
Y'all got curfews?

122
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,542
Shut up and deal.

123
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,584
Sure man!

124
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,669
Sure man

125
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,839
See. Never seen this, huh

126
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,968
Hurray, he's up to it again.

127
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:15,526
Get your foot off me!

128
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:17,028
And go change!

129
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:19,530
Keep your eyes off her!

130
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,740
Look, young man.

131
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,075
Make money by honest work.

132
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,785
Go to your room!

133
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,710
Yes, I'll move the car.

134
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,170
We walked here.

135
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:46,515
You know me?

136
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,100
First time seeing you.

137
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,020
First time seeing a stranger?

138
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,651
Just checking if I saw right.

139
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,322
YUP, you're pretty.

140
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:07,703

141
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:11,248
I'm HAM Dae-gil.

142
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:12,333
Move.

143
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,502
Gwang-chul's younger sister...

144
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:16,629
named Gwang-sook?

145
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:17,546
I'll start.

146
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:20,174
What?

147
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,433
What are you doing!

148
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:34,939
Bro! Don't get me wrong!

149
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,333
She's dang cute!

150
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,129
There's a pretty girl in our town! Yes!

151
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:12,810
How sweet!

152
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,520
Bastards!

153
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,731
Think I'm a sucker? This game is rigged!

154
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,024
- You set me up!
- Shut up!

155
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:22,778
Screw you! Know who my nephew is!

156
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:25,072
You'll all rot in jail tonight!

157
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:28,868
I saw you change cards!

158
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,494
Call the cops!

159
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:34,373
I'm sorry, sir!

160
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:35,374
Sorry...

161
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:39,503
Making me pound a man twice my age...

162
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,130
Damn it.

163
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,674
It's time I break your habit.

164
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,759
- Take off your briefs.
- What?

165
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,594
Strip naked.

166
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:49,096
And stand here for a picture.

167
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:50,472
Please! I'm sorry!

168
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:52,349
You'll be even sorrier.

169
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,059
I won't do it again!

170
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,978
Cut the crap.

171
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,022
Ghost speaking.

172
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,065
Yes, Mr. JANG!

173
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:01,525
No, sir.

174
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:03,485
Hold on.

175
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:07,531
If he's not naked when I'm back, you'll be.

176
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,949
Yes, sir!

177
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:12,369
Are you okay?

178
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:13,621
Smiling?

179
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,873
Son of a bitch!

180
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:19,793
Take off your briefs
or I'll crush your balls.

181
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,796
Old bastard.

182
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,382
Stand straight!

183
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,175
Good.

184
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,134
Head up.

185
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,178
Not like that, fool!

186
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:30,387
Good.

187
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,765
One, two...

188
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:38,771
Grandpa!

189
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,859
I lost 60 grand.

190
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,573
Your mom's savings. What do I do, Dae-gil

191
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,951
First, get dressed.

192
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,869
Let's talk at home.

193
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,579
Let's go.

194
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,179
Come on, asshole!

195
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:14,306
A knife

196
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:21,897
You're the Chinese
food boy. Why you little!

197
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,525
Get up! You fool!

198
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,910
Son of a bitch...

199
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,884
Let's go, Dae-gil!

200
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:54,263
Let's run! Hurry!

201
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,267
There's $6000 inside. Take it and run!

202
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:02,479
He's not dead. Just stay low.

203
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:06,191
Things happen in life.

204
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,860
Don't worry.

205
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,570
You'll get through this.

206
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,989
It's okay. Stay healthy.

207
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:13,949
It's okay.

208
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,535
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- It's okay.

209
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:30,758
Gwang-sook.

210
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:41,810
Do it again?

211
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,936
No, wait!

212
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
Want my brother?

213
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,939
No, I came to see you.

214
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,608
For what?

215
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,152
What's your real name?

216
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:54,239
HUH Mina.

217
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,324
HUH Mina, I love you.

218
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:56,992
- Thanks.
- Hey, wait!

219
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:03,207
Even if you liked me,
I suck now so it's no good.

220
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,250
I'm leaving town.

221
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:07,044
But...

222
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:10,297
When we meet again,
I'll be worth your while.

223
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:11,840
If you wait...

224
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:13,967
I'll come for you in style.

225
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,886
Are you proposing?

226
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:18,514
Yup.

227
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,099
You're cute.

228
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,517
- Wanna kiss?
- No.

229
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:22,851
Next time, then.

230
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:24,645
No problem.

231
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:25,938
Stay healthy.

232
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:26,897
HAM Dae-gil.

233
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:30,150
Your zipper's down.

234
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,527
You bowed to me.

235
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:35,656
HUH Mina.

236
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:40,119
I proposed to you! I'll come for you!

237
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,204
Oops. Not here.

238
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:44,998
You know what?

239
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,583
You're so cute!

240
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,804
Jjari! Heard you made it big!

241
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:01,473
You're all I've got!

242
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,433
Okay-

243
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,684
Thank you!

244
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,102
I gave you a good deal.

245
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,854
It'll take me 3 hours.

246
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:09,022
Wait for me!

247
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:10,983
Thanks a lot!

248
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,861
No need to thank me, man.

249
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:16,697
Some people are born to make it.

250
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:19,324
You should be driving
a Benz and living large.

251
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:21,827
A Benz sounds nice.

252
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:23,203
When can I start

253
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,371
Hold on, man.

254
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,957
You taught me to play. I got your back.

255
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,002
A Rolex

256
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:31,962
Gangnam gambling houses must be hot.

257
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,882
Gambling for work is hard.

258
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:35,924
You said you stopped gambling.

259
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,760
Just asking.

260
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:40,929
Gambling's brutal here.

261
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,556
No fun. Just money.

262
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,351
Learning gambling from
you back home was fun.

263
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,812
- Bro
- What?

264
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,899
Aren't you going back home?

265
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,358
Why would I go back?

266
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:55,777
You going back

267
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:59,907
Not like this.

268
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,826
I saw some nice buildings on the way.

269
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:06,497
I'll buy one within 5 years
and give you a floor.

270
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,167
For fun.

271
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:13,003
Come on! At least give me half!

272
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,925
Anyway, now that
you're in Seoul, live it up!

273
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,301
Here. Cheers!

274
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,844
FIGHTING!

275
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:24,306
And call me Charlie here.

276
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:25,307
Drink it.

277
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,353
You won't find a place here for this price.

278
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:32,689
It's quiet with a good view.

279
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:36,068
"MOVE UP NEXT YEAR!"

280
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,821
"ME, TOO! MOVE UP NEXT YEAR!"

281
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:55,212
Charlie!

282
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:59,424
Why are you so late?

283
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:00,884
Bought shoes?

284
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,513
This is it?

285
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,015
Let's start by parking.

286
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:08,433
Hustlers park cars here

287
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,269
The man in charge is out.

288
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,564
Morning, sir.

289
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,819
Where's SHIN?

290
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,237
Out to collect, sir.

291
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,531
Did you find a cook?

292
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:25,534
It's hard to find the right person, sir.

293
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:26,868
Greet him.

294
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:28,704
Who's he?

295
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,748
A hometown friend, sir. So many cars came.

296
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:34,001
We can't let just anyone work here.

297
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:37,170
He'll just help out today. Trust me, sir.

298
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:40,966
Get to work.

299
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,969
- Charlie Ramen noodles.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:47,222
Cool. Who's that?

301
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:48,682
He's Ggojang-

302
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:49,891
What?

303
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:51,393
The boss.

304
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:55,063
Today's horoscope.

305
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:58,317
A helper will come...

306
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,947
Hope you like abalone, sir.

307
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,247
Right amount of water.

308
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,960
It's good.

309
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:20,464
Ah, sir?

310
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:23,258
I want to work here, sir.

311
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:27,179
What's your name?

312
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,389
HAM Dae-gil, sir.

313
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,225
HAM Dae-gil.

314
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,518
Nice name.

315
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:36,813
Date of birth?

316
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,857
November 4th, 1987, sir.

317
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,525
A Scorpio.

318
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:43,987
Scorpios are loyal and
good at getting revenge.

319
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,781
Give me your hand.

320
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,621
Your palm lines look good. You're loyal.

321
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:55,207
A man should be loyal.

322
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,377
What did Jjari say about me?

323
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:00,921
That you live on loyalty.

324
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:07,386
Go get him.

325
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,139
Boss is very picky with people,

326
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:12,933
but it's cuz you're my friend.

327
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,267
The hell

328
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,353
He read that I'm a hustler.

329
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:18,855
Who'd gamble here?

330
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,698
It's like a real company here.

331
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:30,450
We're raking in the dough.

332
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,163
This is Chief SHIN, head of security.

333
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm HAM Dae-gil, sir.

334
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,333
Security is everything here.

335
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,837
Why so many crackdowns?

336
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,296
Get the curtains

337
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,047
US$50

338
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,967
One, two, three, four.

339
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,137
Old MacDonald

340
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:52,013
had a farm

341
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:54,766
E-I-E-I-O

342
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,852
Stand hut! One, two!

343
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,286
One by one, please!

344
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,913
There's nothing here, inspector.

345
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:18,415
Dropped your cigarettes

346
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,083
Yup. It's mine.

347
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:21,626
See ya.

348
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,087
Let's just go! Your zipper's down.

349
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:28,008
She's Madam Little.

350
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,177
Sorry, Director LEE.

351
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:35,098
She lends money and takes the vig here.

352
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:37,058
- Know what a vig is?
- What?

353
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,771
During their 6-hour slots,
some people run out early.

354
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:42,230
- Then what?
- Thanks!

355
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,067
- They get a loan from her.
- A loan, please.

356
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,027
I'll pay you soon!

357
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:50,238
- Win big!
- They borrow and borrow...

358
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,616
and lose it completely.

359
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:57,579
The customer who loses money is king here!

360
00:19:58,413 --> 00:19:59,414
Hello, sir.

361
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:00,791
Why you!

362
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:04,085
Think you're a hustler
cuz I let you play lead

363
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,088
Why didn't you close the door?

364
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:08,507
Who's this?

365
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,966
The new skivvy, sir.

366
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,808
Acts so big. Who's he

367
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:19,810
Chief SEO, the main player here.

368
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,395
A Gangnam hustler?

369
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,647
A total son of a bitch!

370
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:27,651
I wanna crush him so bad!

371
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:30,111
- Bro
- What

372
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:32,697
What does a skivvy do?

373
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:34,115
Two ramen! $100, please.

374
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:34,825
Looks good!

375
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,743
Dae-gil! Got a Dunhill?

376
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:39,955
$20, please.

377
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:42,874
$20 for just a pack of smokes

378
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,293
Prices went up a lot these days, sir.

379
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,254
- Give me two packs.
- Great!

380
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,464
- Hurry!
- You take a stab.

381
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,259
What's to think. A man should go straight!

382
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,221
- Vitamin drinks here!
- Okay!

383
00:20:57,347 --> 00:21:00,517
$20 for <i>2</i> bottles but
I'll give you 4 for $50!

384
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:02,310
So cute!

385
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,436
Cuz you're special.

386
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,938
- Did you eat?
- Who cares?

387
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:09,651
<i>- I'll</i> pay. I wanna give him a tip.
- No, I'll pay!

388
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,113
Way to go.

389
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,622
Boss wants you.

390
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:06,416
How long did you work here?

391
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,001
Almost 5 months, sir.

392
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:09,669
Heard you played back home.

393
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,671
The best in my town, sir.

394
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:13,256
Some country suckers are coming,

395
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:16,092
but SEO's appendix burst. Done.

396
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,095
No need to borrow a player, right

397
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:23,141
How about it?

398
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:30,398
So sorry! I won again!

399
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:33,360
Told 'ya rainy days are lucky!

400
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,737
Damn noisy, I feel like puking.

401
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:38,698
Then, take some pills.

402
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,867
Hurry on up and deal!

403
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,243
Bet.

404
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:44,120
Oh, right! One, two, three...

405
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,665
Three times the charm!

406
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,999
Oh my!

407
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,046
I'm on a roll!

408
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:54,839
Hey!

409
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,549
How many cards you got?

410
00:22:57,425 --> 00:22:58,385
Four, right

411
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:00,345
You gave me six! See

412
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,681
You dealt wrong.

413
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,266
$1,000 for the mistake and start over!

414
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:09,813
Deal right, will you?

415
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:12,232
It's not your first time.

416
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,609
Sorry. My mistake.

417
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:16,861
It's okay. I had bad cards anyway.

418
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,739
How about a break?

419
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,283
Let me deal for once.

420
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:26,663
Who cares who deals? I'll win anyway!

421
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,164
Hurry up and deal!

422
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:31,584
Hold your horses pal!

423
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,796
Here! I bet $10,000.

424
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:38,842
<i>7</i> points.

425
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:39,509
9 points.

426
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:40,385
You win.

427
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,177
Seven pair.

428
00:23:41,302 --> 00:23:41,970
Eight pair!

429
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,887
Stop!

430
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,264
Let's play cards.

431
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:47,517
It all adds up to 256 points!

432
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:50,478
That's $25,600 each!

433
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:53,023
Anyone need a loan?

434
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,072
Seven points.

435
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,742
Eight points.

436
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:06,161
Six pair!

437
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:08,997
Eight pair!

438
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:11,541
One Go!

439
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,777
Don't tell Jjari.

440
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:40,987
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM!"

441
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:43,782
- Nothing for me?
- Why you!

442
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,740
Leaving already?

443
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,867
You left your phone, Ms. WOO.

444
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:30,995
What's wrong?

445
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,710
You always win!

446
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:39,587
Why are you crying?

447
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:41,881
You always get the good cards!

448
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:43,925
And take all the good
cards, right before me!

449
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:45,718
It's just a game. Don't cry!

450
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,596
Stop it!

451
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:50,974
Don't cry.

452
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:52,559
Teach me how to play cards.

453
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:53,309
What?

454
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:55,186
You're a hustler. Please

455
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:57,981
Please teach me!

456
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:00,608
Teach me!

457
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:01,776
Fine!

458
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:03,194
I'll teach you everything.

459
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,237
So stop!

460
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:07,240
I'll buy drinks. Let's go.

461
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,660
Let's drink, play cards, and talk

462
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,371
I don't have any money...

463
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,373
I have lots!

464
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,709
How does wine sound?

465
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:21,337
Wow, Ms. WOO!

466
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,132
What's your name?

467
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:26,176
Me

468
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:28,011
WOO...

469
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:30,555
Ji-yeon.

470
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:31,681
HAM...

471
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,100
Dae-gil.

472
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,438
Seeing anyone

473
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,815
Yes, of course.

474
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,818
I'll get some beer.

475
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,779
This is my lover.

476
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:51,868
Shit.

477
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,705
Like any man can resist you.

478
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,207
Can I call you babe?

479
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:02,545
I haven't met the right man,
so this is my lover.

480
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:19,896
Do you love me?

481
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,970
Do you love me?

482
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:55,556
I love you.

483
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:02,707
She's the easiest target. A rich widow.

484
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,252
With the old man gone, she's living it up.

485
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:07,962
How much is she worth?

486
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:09,672
At least $10 million.

487
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:13,259
- Who is?
- Ms. WOO.

488
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:19,432
Let's set her up. Mind as well eat the cake
before someone else.

489
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:21,851
How much is our goal?

490
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,896
She could brush off $1 million as bad luck.

491
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,566
$3 million should keep
her from gambling again.

492
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:29,942
Lesson learned.

493
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:34,322
Fine, $3 million. Who'll play?

494
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:37,658
I'll play and Madam
Little can add to the pot.

495
00:29:37,784 --> 00:29:39,202
Will one player do?

496
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:40,328
So, I was thinking...

497
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,500
I think Dae-gil should play the lead.

498
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,836
Women all love Dae-gil.

499
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:51,672
Good looking, fun, with a big dick.

500
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:53,424
Saw it?

501
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,719
I can tell.

502
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,138
The set up is best coming
from someone close.

503
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,141
Play by the book. What do you think?

504
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,436
I think Jjari would be safer...

505
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,187
No.

506
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:08,147
SEO is right.

507
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:13,027
The set up has to be perfect.
Next time, Charlie.

508
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:15,905
Yes, sir.

509
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:17,907
Who'll lure her in?

510
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:20,743
Mrs. SONG is perfect.

511
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:24,622
She's the one who first brought her here.

512
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:28,543
She gambles so much,
she's about to lose her shop.

513
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:32,713
WOO's close with her.
She won't suspect a thing.

514
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:35,967
I love this game!

515
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:40,346
She wants to raise the stakes.
She's asking to die.

516
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,557
Then, so be it!

517
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,851
Good acting, Dae-gil.

518
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:46,519
Looking so worried.

519
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,395
$100 grand!

520
00:30:47,437 --> 00:30:52,442
Win at first, then lose it all at the end.

521
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,363
Nine pair.

522
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:02,201
Don't sulk when others win!

523
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:06,747
Wait! This is so heavy!

524
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:11,836
When will we ever win?

525
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,089
- Let's go get a massage.
- Sure!

526
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,174
Wanna come

527
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,259
Dang noisy!

528
00:31:28,394 --> 00:31:29,604
Thank you.

529
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:41,866
Lose $400 grand more.

530
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:45,369
If this job fails, we'll go under.

531
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:50,958
Honey?

532
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,769
Don't come here anymore.

533
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,313
Did I win too much?

534
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,774
They're losing to get to your money.

535
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:17,318
Who?

536
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,535
SEO, Madam Little, and Mrs. SONG.

537
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:27,828
Why are you so naive?

538
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:30,039
What about you?

539
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,252
Don't come here.

540
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:36,587
Then, nothing will happen.

541
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:53,563
She hasn't shown in 3 weeks!

542
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,191
Then, we won't get our cuts

543
00:32:57,483 --> 00:33:00,361
What if the bitch heard something?

544
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:03,656
HAM Dae-gil.

545
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,158
Yes

546
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:08,494
I...

547
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:12,540
want ramen noodles.

548
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,167
Dae-gil!

549
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,211
She's here! Go in!

550
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:19,880
- Go on! Hurry!
- Who

551
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,592
Give me that.

552
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,135
Go get her!

553
00:33:27,096 --> 00:33:30,891
Learn to play from me.

554
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:34,437
Mrs. SONG never stops...

555
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,193
This is getting boring.

556
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:43,654
Let me deal for a change.

557
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:49,368
Can I bet $2 million?

558
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,914
Now!!

559
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,001
End it here.

560
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,504
Change cards.

561
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:06,969
Let's play-

562
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:09,889
$100,000 on 'lo.

563
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,433
I bet $100,000 on 6.

564
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,393
If I die, don't play at my funeral.

565
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:15,728
$700,000 on 5!

566
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:19,148
What if you lose big?

567
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:21,233
We'll see about that.

568
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:22,568
Dae-gil?

569
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,407
$100,000 on 6.

570
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:32,119
Okay. Lady luck.

571
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,120
Let's win!

572
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:37,667
- Come to mama!
- Chief SEO, pass the lighter

573
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:41,545
Forget the lighter, how's this?

574
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,964
Cool!

575
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,346
I should've bet $700,000.

576
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,057
9 points.

577
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,935
Looks good.

578
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:58,521
Okay, there.

579
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:00,314
9 points, too.

580
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:03,984
I got seven pair.

581
00:35:03,984 --> 00:35:04,777
Seven pair!

582
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:07,405
She'll buy a building!

583
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:08,906
Come on...

584
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:10,241
One...

585
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:11,659
Three...

586
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:16,288
What? 9 pair

587
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:17,415
Oh my!

588
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:19,500
I got a 9 pair!

589
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,376
Look!

590
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:22,503
Oh my!

591
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,797
I won! I'm rich!

592
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:29,677
I told you I'm lucky here!

593
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,025
No word from Ms. WOO

594
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,902
Of course not.

595
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:51,949
The boss lost everything. He's screwed.

596
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,744
Where's SEO these days?

597
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:57,037
He's out gambling to help the boss.

598
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,706
So stupid.

599
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:02,960
Acting so big, but losing to a dang girl.

600
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:05,296
Any place I can gamble, too?

601
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:08,340
It's hard to win on others' turf.

602
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:14,889
But I know this one rich fool.

603
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:17,725
You came a long way. I'm JANG Dong-shik.

604
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:19,018
This way, please.

605
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:23,355
He used to be famous in his hay days.

606
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,482
For what?

607
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,317
Crimes of course.

608
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,987
- Hit me!
- You bitch!

609
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:34,408
The people are nice here. Very kind.

610
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,243
They're...

611
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,879
You're their bodyguard

612
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:49,882
Worried about your winnings

613
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,426
We don't pull that shit.

614
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,887
Have some coffee in the next room.

615
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,388
No use standing and watching.

616
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:00,434
The new kid's good.

617
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:02,311
- KIM!
- Yes

618
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:06,732
Go

619
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:08,150
Wait there.

620
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:17,159
Come on in!

621
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,829
Is someone else joining?

622
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:26,168
My niece wanted to play.

623
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,003
You'll like her.

624
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:29,713
She's really pretty.

625
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:33,801
Come in.

626
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:41,183
Sit down.

627
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,155
Know each other?

628
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:56,073
You know me?

629
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,412
No.

630
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:04,790
First time seeing a stranger.

631
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:07,877
I told you she's pretty.

632
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,131
I'm Charlie from Gangnam. And you?

633
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,383
They call me Gwang-sook.

634
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:15,718
Okay!

635
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:17,678
Now that we're all acquainted...

636
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,514
Let's set the rules.

637
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:21,891
Share the winnings

638
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:24,310
- Sure. Whatever.
- Wait.

639
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,979
Why share the winnings. We're not friends.

640
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,439
You know me?

641
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,734
Fine. How about a cap?

642
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:32,484
What?

643
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:35,112
Limited or unlimited liability
to major winnings

644
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:36,030
Unlimited!

645
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:43,704
Such a manly young man!

646
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:48,626
Shall we start with $10 a point

647
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,294
Let's begin.

648
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:58,636
I fold.

649
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:06,977
Shit.

650
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,733
Losing big from the start...

651
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:14,360
How about $20 a point?

652
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,153
Why not.

653
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:33,379
$50 a point.

654
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,848
Damn it!

655
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:48,352
$100 a point. Okay?

656
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,646
Where's the bathroom?

657
00:39:52,648 --> 00:39:53,816
Dae-gil.

658
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:55,818
What?

659
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:58,487
We won lots, let's stop.

660
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,159
Don't worry and follow my lead.

661
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:11,417
Damn. When will I win big?

662
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,210
Cut the deck good.

663
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,799
That reeks.

664
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:21,969
Did you shit your pants?

665
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:35,399
It doesn't stink.

666
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,692
Then, what's this stench?

667
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:38,569
It doesn't smell!

668
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,737
Dang.

669
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,656
Sucks. I fold.

670
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,371
Yes!

671
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,165
I'm on a roll!

672
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:05,220
Oh my!

673
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:06,722
One card each, please

674
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:08,891
One Go!

675
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:27,034
Two Go!

676
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,746
Let's go!

677
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:44,593
This quadruples my points.

678
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:53,977
Three Go!

679
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:17,251
Four Go!

680
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:33,725
Shit.

681
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:35,769
Doesn't look good.

682
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,486
Five Go!

683
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,045
Let's do this.

684
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:06,633
$1 million divided by 12 months.

685
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:14,016
That comes to around $82,000 a month each.

686
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:19,938
Not too bad for young men like you. Right.

687
00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:21,982
SHIN!

688
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:23,066
KIM!

689
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:26,653
- SHIN!
- KIM!

690
00:43:26,653 --> 00:43:27,529
SHIN!

691
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,371
Yes, boss

692
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,543
Go bring the thing.

693
00:43:42,294 --> 00:43:44,713
"LOU"

694
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:49,176
Ever heard of WANG,
who tried to run from me

695
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:51,178
He lost his you know what.

696
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:53,972
I'll pay you, sir.

697
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:04,816
An eye for an eye.

698
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:08,111
How dare he play his boss for a fool.

699
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:12,908
He's lucky we didn't break his bones.

700
00:44:13,492 --> 00:44:15,619
I appreciate your help.

701
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,288
Thank you.

702
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:21,667
It was fun.

703
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:25,712
It'll be a month soon. Think he'll pay up

704
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:34,137
I'll squeeze it out of him.

705
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:04,334
Who are you bastards!

706
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:16,138
Mom I'll call you later.

707
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:18,223
Get the kidney as usual.

708
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,725
Let's do it.

709
00:45:35,657 --> 00:45:37,451
My hand!

710
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:43,206
Shit...

711
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:55,135
Up already

712
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:56,178
You okay

713
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:58,430
What the hell did you do!

714
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,514
What's with his hand?

715
00:45:59,848 --> 00:46:01,683
Hit it on the way.

716
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:04,811
How can I get my money with him like that?

717
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:09,358
Just drug him up and
give him to the bitches.

718
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:10,692
I'll kill you!

719
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,082
Only to here. Perfect.

720
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:29,628
Don't strain yourself and listen.

721
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,506
Your apartment and accounts...

722
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:37,094
and the kidney paid for 2 months.

723
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:38,720
Get better.

724
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:42,015
Take this if it hurts.

725
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,893
It works well.

726
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,439
<i>I'll get you!</i>

727
00:46:54,903 --> 00:46:56,446
Hope you don't run off.

728
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:58,615
Try if you dare.

729
00:46:59,908 --> 00:47:02,452
Give him an IV to heal faster.

730
00:47:02,828 --> 00:47:03,662
Okay-

731
00:47:03,662 --> 00:47:05,914
How long till he can go?

732
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:08,750
I'll send him out next week.

733
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:14,005
Make sure you get everyone. Here he comes.

734
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,383
On the van, now!

735
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,510
Boss won't be out for a while.

736
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,013
SEO and Madame
Little went into hiding, too.

737
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:24,015
Stay low till I call you.

738
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:27,519
And watch out for JANG.

739
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:48,457
- Are you done
- Yes.

740
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:12,230
Get up. JANG's men are coming.

741
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:22,782
This place is good.

742
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:25,660
No smoking!

743
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,120
We're done.

744
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,753
Got one.

745
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,138
Shit.

746
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,771
Wanna go some place nice to talk

747
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:55,607
How about the sea

748
00:48:56,525 --> 00:48:58,276
You're on the run.

749
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:01,029
But I'm tied down.

750
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:06,743
What's this?

751
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,161
It's yours.

752
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:17,295
Money from selling you out.

753
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:19,714
It's yours now.

754
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:24,427
What?

755
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:26,221
It's from scamming you.

756
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:33,687
You got cleaned out by JANG.

757
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:37,857
Cut the deck good.

758
00:49:40,026 --> 00:49:41,570
Did you shit your pants?

759
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,905
What happened before the cut?

760
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:49,160
Didn't you learn if a girl shows
her underwear, they'll trick ya?

761
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:50,829
Jjari...

762
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,040
He was watching.

763
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,667
Stupid.

764
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,628
Jjari's the one who changed cards for JANG!

765
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:04,134
Stay low till I call you.

766
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,052
Watch out for JANG.

767
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,775
Call JANG Dong-shik now!

768
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,360
If you call him, you're dead.

769
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:24,446
I don't care.

770
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:26,781
Think I'm a loser

771
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:29,451
Shit! Call him!

772
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:31,620
I don't have a phone! Call him!

773
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,288
Now!!

774
00:50:34,914 --> 00:50:35,999
Is it here?

775
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,584
Where is it

776
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:39,336
Where's the phone!

777
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:42,339
You covering him

778
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,555
Look“.

779
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:54,434
I just saved your life.

780
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,854
Sons of bitches!

781
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:02,442
Bastards!

782
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,533
Don't look for me.

783
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:13,453
If we're meant to meet, we will.

784
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,831
Why are you doing this?

785
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:21,294
Can't let a guy who proposed just die.

786
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:27,092
If this is for saving my life...

787
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:30,637
Then, my life is yours.

788
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:41,189
The hell

789
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:55,662
Son of a bitch!

790
00:51:55,662 --> 00:51:59,582
Think you can pull one on me!

791
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:02,001
What the hell!

792
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,629
Crazy asshole!

793
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,048
Think I'd like the 9 pair

794
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:09,884
Then, he must have an 8 pair.

795
00:52:09,884 --> 00:52:11,803
I knew it! So predictable.

796
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:13,930
You have the 10 pair to clean us out, huh

797
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,890
- Let go!
- Hold still!

798
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,477
Know what happens when
you're caught cheating!

799
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:21,813
I didn't cheat!

800
00:52:21,896 --> 00:52:24,315
Mister. Open his cards.

801
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,567
See his hand

802
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:29,863
With the 10 pair, you'll end up like him!

803
00:52:30,905 --> 00:52:31,823
It's 10 points.

804
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,660
Then, what about yours?

805
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:36,703
Mine

806
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:38,788
Just <i>2</i> points.

807
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:41,332
Let me see your hands!

808
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:42,917
What? This?

809
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:44,961
It can't be.

810
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,629
Please.

811
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:51,718
Us gamblers should
trust each other and play.

812
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:55,597
Too bad about your
cards. This game's a bust.

813
00:52:55,764 --> 00:52:58,808
I'm too scared to play here. Good luck!

814
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:07,484
Mister!

815
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:12,155
Mister!

816
00:53:14,741 --> 00:53:15,700
Me?

817
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,702
Why? What's up?

818
00:53:17,702 --> 00:53:19,120
Why'd you help me?

819
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,873
Helped you No way.

820
00:53:21,873 --> 00:53:23,249
See ya.

821
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,294
You changed my pair.

822
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:27,420
Are you a hustler?

823
00:53:27,462 --> 00:53:32,801
That's crazy! I'm just a factory worker.

824
00:53:32,801 --> 00:53:33,927
Bye.

825
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:35,136
What do you make?

826
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:38,890
Why do I have to tell you?

827
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:44,354
I work at a factory for
ah... zapping batteries!

828
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,231
Now, move!

829
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:48,191
Freeze!

830
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,279
Just as I expected.

831
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,198
Told ya they're fishy.

832
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:55,990
Time to pay!

833
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,160
Guess this can look suspicious.

834
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,954
You deserve a beating!

835
00:54:00,954 --> 00:54:03,832
It's a misunderstanding!

836
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:05,917
Good job.

837
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:07,418
What's this?

838
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:09,170
Get them!

839
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:13,007
- No! I don't know him!
- Come here!

840
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:17,804
Stop running! If I catch you, you're dead!

841
00:54:18,096 --> 00:54:21,474
If you wear my only sweats, what do I wear?

842
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,184
I've been thinking.

843
00:54:23,184 --> 00:54:26,020
Aren't you leaving? You said you'll go.

844
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,564
How about being partners?

845
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,483
Why be partners with a cripple like me?

846
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,735
I have a good feeling.

847
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:34,487
Don't have anywhere to go?

848
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:40,451
Don't worry. I used to
play in Gangnam houses.

849
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:42,745
If you don't believe me, try me.

850
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,293
What's with your hand?

851
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:50,712
It's nothing.

852
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,173
Cut the deck.

853
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,012
Where are you from?

854
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,096
Why?

855
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,390
You remind me of someone.

856
00:55:03,808 --> 00:55:04,642
Who?

857
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,022
Someone with a stormy life.

858
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:12,442
They're always at it!

859
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,862
How can they live like that?

860
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:25,413
Open our cards

861
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:28,374
What's the use?

862
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:30,084
You're a hustler all right!

863
00:55:30,585 --> 00:55:31,461
10 pair.

864
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:32,837
Accept your loss?

865
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,010
Try switching to your left hand.

866
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,346
Kids can sneak bottom cards better.

867
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:42,680
You saw?

868
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,267
Don't have to. I could hear it.

869
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:49,354
Anyway, you lost. We're partners.

870
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,272
Open my cards.

871
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:57,236
My hand was cut with the 9 pair.

872
00:55:58,404 --> 00:56:01,908
But my partner saved
my life on just 3 points.

873
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:05,828
Sometimes 1 point can win a 10 pair.

874
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,667
It's been 3 days.

875
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:13,628
I've been thinking.

876
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:15,254
What's to think about!

877
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,965
Please be my teacher.

878
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,717
Not partners, okay?

879
00:56:19,717 --> 00:56:21,552
You always talk so much

880
00:56:22,136 --> 00:56:23,554
You'll be my secret master.

881
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:26,975
They always die cuz of their disciples.

882
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:29,018
If you die, I'll get revenge.

883
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:33,690
I'll drop you off at the
bus terminal up ahead.

884
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,024
Hey!

885
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:37,360
Why you!

886
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,655
Just practicing hand tricks won't work!

887
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:43,074
Watch it!

888
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:45,576
You said to use my left.

889
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:46,452
Why you!

890
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:50,289
You always get crushed cuz you play
with your hands!

891
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:53,209
- Then, play with my feet
- With your heart!

892
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:58,089
Read the people, not the cards.
Read their minds.

893
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:01,384
Hustlers can predict...

894
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,392
My horoscope warned of someone jumping
into my life.

895
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:13,980
Bad news. Gotta change all four tires.

896
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,690
Or else you'll die!

897
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,151
If they think they found a sucker...

898
00:57:18,443 --> 00:57:20,570
their lips curl up.

899
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,654
It's an old car...

900
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:26,701
When they're eyebrows curl...
they're testing you out.

901
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:28,786
It'll cost $5000.

902
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:30,705
If they avoid eye contact?

903
00:57:31,164 --> 00:57:31,873
It's a lie!

904
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:34,167
I'll do it for $4000 cash with free waxing.

905
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,878
Enough with the basics, give me more!

906
00:57:36,878 --> 00:57:38,463
Could you look at my tires

907
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:40,506
- Coming...
- More Sure!

908
00:57:40,923 --> 00:57:43,676
The pupils. The eyes can't lie.

909
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:45,928
They get bigger when excited.

910
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,180
You played cards again!

911
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,725
And shrivel up at what they hate,
like your dick.

912
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:55,146
Then, why do you get scammed,
knowing he's lying

913
00:57:55,146 --> 00:57:57,023
I never get scammed.

914
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,484
Shit.

915
00:57:59,817 --> 00:58:01,736
Why hello!

916
00:58:02,361 --> 00:58:04,322
Just the waxing left, sir.

917
00:58:04,822 --> 00:58:06,616
Take your time.

918
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:08,785
Playing cards

919
00:58:10,578 --> 00:58:12,080
Can you play cards?

920
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,083
Wait! You can't leave yet!

921
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:16,959
I have to get going. Why?

922
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,587
The game's over. You want more tip

923
00:58:19,587 --> 00:58:21,923
Who plays cards for tips?

924
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,051
How about raising the
stakes for another game

925
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:27,428
I'm no gambler. No way!

926
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:31,891
Man!

927
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,393
You lost a lot today.

928
00:58:34,393 --> 00:58:37,980
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

929
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,650
Your nephew is really good.

930
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,485
Just luck.

931
00:58:51,536 --> 00:58:53,246
Lend me the DuPont.

932
00:58:56,624 --> 00:58:58,042
"Dull

933
00:58:58,042 --> 00:58:59,127
Du

934
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:03,131
- Like in Adieu!
- Funny.

935
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:06,384
What?

936
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,844
There's a card missing!

937
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,721
Someone must've hid one!

938
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:13,891
This is not good!

939
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:15,643
Everyone, hands up!

940
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:18,146
Flip them! No card?

941
00:59:18,146 --> 00:59:20,898
Then, shake them! No?

942
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:25,611
Then, look on the floor! Not there?

943
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:29,073
Then, buy new cards.

944
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:31,367
Go buy a new pack.

945
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:32,952
"CLOSED TODAY"

946
00:59:32,952 --> 00:59:35,663
I didn't win much. Why call me again?

947
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:36,873
Have a seat.

948
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,916
We sit here?

949
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,172
It's as if we've been
set up to sit here, huh?

950
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,970
Just kidding!

951
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,973
It's not where you sit,
but how you play, right

952
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,726
Oh, the car out front is getting towed.

953
00:59:56,726 --> 01:00:00,521
- Number 6784. Go after it!
- Damn!

954
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:02,356
Run!

955
01:00:02,773 --> 01:00:05,109
Uncle. Can I sit there?

956
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:08,029
Sure! It's not like there's
a surveillance cam.

957
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:11,824
Camera 1 is out.

958
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:14,577
Not my day today!

959
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,291
It's dry in here. Can I
turn on a humidifier?

960
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:24,587
I have a sore throat. I need this thing.

961
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,130
It's a humidifier.

962
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:33,179
Why are you all like this?

963
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:42,647
US$1,000

964
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:46,192
I'll see that and raise you $2000.

965
01:00:46,317 --> 01:00:47,276
Raise you $4000.

966
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:48,778
US$8,000

967
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:50,363
All in.

968
01:00:51,697 --> 01:00:52,490
Okay-

969
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:53,532
Check!

970
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:55,409
Eight pair.

971
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,623
Wait!

972
01:01:01,499 --> 01:01:02,375
Nine pair.

973
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,637
Bring lots of money.

974
01:01:16,597 --> 01:01:17,682
Hello everyone!

975
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:20,476
Where'd you get all that money?

976
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:24,438
Have a seat anywhere.
Want us to move seats?

977
01:01:25,273 --> 01:01:27,149
A new table?

978
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:30,152
Before we start, I'll charge my phone

979
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:32,029
- Should've done it before.
- Sorry.

980
01:01:32,113 --> 01:01:36,033
Dae-gil! Pull that out
and plug in my phone.

981
01:01:37,118 --> 01:01:40,705
You got one kidney, that's good for you.

982
01:01:40,705 --> 01:01:42,999
Gotta keep healthy to gamble.

983
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,042
Enough ﬂagging-

984
01:01:45,793 --> 01:01:47,420
And quit smoking!

985
01:01:50,423 --> 01:01:52,925
Isn't it time we play in bigger pools

986
01:01:53,092 --> 01:01:56,053
Think you're good cuz
you beat a few suckers

987
01:01:56,053 --> 01:01:57,722
Didn't you see me crush a hustler?

988
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:58,806
What hustler?

989
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:03,352
The one with small
eyes. Looks just like you.

990
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,981
Hustlers with big eyes
can be read by others.

991
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:09,817
When I started out, I
had big eyes like you.

992
01:02:09,817 --> 01:02:12,862
You look exactly like me back then.

993
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:13,904
Totally!

994
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,157
Shit!

995
01:02:16,657 --> 01:02:18,159
Why is that shit!

996
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,536
My eyes have evolved.

997
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,746
They've deteriorated!

998
01:02:21,746 --> 01:02:24,373
No way! I can see everything fine!

999
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:35,634
What?

1000
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:38,471
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:41,182
Nice acting.

1002
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:43,851
Your partner's good.

1003
01:02:43,851 --> 01:02:45,227
He's my disciple.

1004
01:02:45,227 --> 01:02:47,188
It's an honor, sir.

1005
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:51,609
I'm Dark Knight from Ansan.

1006
01:02:51,984 --> 01:02:54,653
I'm Mr. GO. See you around.

1007
01:02:54,653 --> 01:02:55,988
Yes, sir.

1008
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:59,950
Watch your wrist and
may the kings be with you.

1009
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,994
- The kings be with you.
- Bye.

1010
01:03:12,296 --> 01:03:16,926
At times, enemies can be friends
and friends enemies.

1011
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,052
Get it

1012
01:03:18,302 --> 01:03:19,512
- Sir
- What

1013
01:03:20,346 --> 01:03:21,263
I respect you.

1014
01:03:21,263 --> 01:03:22,556
Why you.

1015
01:03:23,265 --> 01:03:25,643
There are two types in gambling.

1016
01:03:25,643 --> 01:03:28,312
The loser and the winner.

1017
01:03:28,813 --> 01:03:31,023
No need for words.

1018
01:03:31,232 --> 01:03:34,902
I know! Cuz the money and cards talk.

1019
01:03:34,902 --> 01:03:36,028
What's a sucker?

1020
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:37,988
- The king!
- Good!

1021
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:40,658
What a nice day.

1022
01:03:40,658 --> 01:03:42,743
Pack up! Let's go play with flowers!

1023
01:03:42,743 --> 01:03:44,412
Where to, sir?

1024
01:03:44,412 --> 01:03:47,873
- Wherever the cards lead us!
- After you!

1025
01:03:48,165 --> 01:03:49,291
Stop!

1026
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,251
Let's see.

1027
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:53,045
Double on 8 points.

1028
01:03:54,547 --> 01:03:56,924
And I called 'Go' 3 times.

1029
01:03:56,924 --> 01:04:01,512
No, 5 times with all 5 kings!
You'll need more cash.

1030
01:04:01,512 --> 01:04:04,181
The young man cleaned us out!

1031
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,644
Who cares!

1032
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,062
I bet everything!

1033
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:12,356
Open!

1034
01:04:12,356 --> 01:04:17,111
Open the cards!

1035
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,577
I have a question.

1036
01:04:24,577 --> 01:04:25,244
What?

1037
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:27,288
Let's say you have to play naked.

1038
01:04:27,705 --> 01:04:30,958
But you have to hide a card.

1039
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,334
What do you do?

1040
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:33,961
Eat it.

1041
01:04:34,378 --> 01:04:36,964
It's plastic. How can you eat it

1042
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:38,757
There's nothing a hustler can't eat!

1043
01:04:38,757 --> 01:04:40,342
A hustler ain't no dog!

1044
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:41,760
Did you ever eat it?

1045
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:43,888
I'm no dog. Why would I?

1046
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:51,604
What's going on?

1047
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:57,902
Jjari!

1048
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,405
Dae-gil...

1049
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:02,364
Long time no see.

1050
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:03,491
What's up?

1051
01:05:04,492 --> 01:05:05,326
How have you been?

1052
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:08,120
Good. I'm late for something.

1053
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,122
<i>- I'll</i> go with you!
- It's okay!

1054
01:05:14,502 --> 01:05:17,296
Bastard! Leave me alone!

1055
01:05:17,379 --> 01:05:18,255
Why'd you do that to me?

1056
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:19,632
Shit! What!

1057
01:05:19,632 --> 01:05:22,510
You sold me off to JANG! Bastard!

1058
01:05:22,676 --> 01:05:23,886
So What if I did.

1059
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,804
Why'd you do it!

1060
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:28,182
Hustler, my ass.

1061
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:31,393
You cheated and crushed countless people!

1062
01:05:31,393 --> 01:05:36,065
Where's the thanks for getting you the job!

1063
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:40,361
Cuz you can play, boss
only looked after you!

1064
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:41,237
Son of a bitch.

1065
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:42,738
That's the reason?

1066
01:05:43,656 --> 01:05:46,909
You ungrateful bastard!

1067
01:05:52,414 --> 01:05:56,043
If you sold me off,
why aren't you living it up?

1068
01:05:56,502 --> 01:05:58,087
Why'd you end up like this?

1069
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,422
I got done in by SEO, too!

1070
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:01,340
What?

1071
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:05,511
It was SEO who set up the boss
to lose everything!

1072
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:06,554
What do you mean!

1073
01:06:06,554 --> 01:06:11,600
It wasn't a set up for WOO but the boss!

1074
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,270
Lose $400 grand more.

1075
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,604
Let's set her up.

1076
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,773
If this job fails, we'll go under.

1077
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:18,691
Dae-gil?

1078
01:06:19,525 --> 01:06:20,484
Chief SEO?

1079
01:06:20,568 --> 01:06:21,569
Pass me the lighter.

1080
01:06:22,987 --> 01:06:24,405
What about Ms. WOO?

1081
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:28,492
What else? She's the hustler!

1082
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,413
Do you love me?

1083
01:06:42,256 --> 01:06:43,424
Dae-gil.

1084
01:06:44,425 --> 01:06:45,718
I'm sorry.

1085
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:50,806
That girl, Mina...

1086
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,017
She got sold cuz of you.

1087
01:06:56,437 --> 01:06:59,356
This is my fight, sir.

1088
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:05,237
I'll come back, if I'm lucky.

1089
01:07:27,926 --> 01:07:29,386
Asshole! That's mine!

1090
01:07:31,972 --> 01:07:33,057
Who are you?

1091
01:07:40,564 --> 01:07:41,732
Shit!

1092
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,659
Son of a bitch!

1093
01:07:53,952 --> 01:07:55,704
Hey, Stop!

1094
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:03,962
Who's this?

1095
01:08:04,338 --> 01:08:05,297
Chinese delivery?

1096
01:08:06,548 --> 01:08:07,883
You the boss here?

1097
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:10,844
Where's the respect, kid?

1098
01:08:10,844 --> 01:08:12,805
How old are ya. Let go.

1099
01:08:17,351 --> 01:08:18,268
Where's Mina?

1100
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,563
HUH Mina?

1101
01:08:22,523 --> 01:08:23,857
Gwang-sook?

1102
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:25,192
No idea where she is...

1103
01:08:25,192 --> 01:08:26,819
Where is she!

1104
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,195
Shut up or else!

1105
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:33,951
Where's Mina?

1106
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,626
Sell her to me.

1107
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,350
My dear Gwang-sook!

1108
01:08:58,642 --> 01:09:00,936
Your knight has come to rescue you.

1109
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:03,731
Hey, move!

1110
01:09:03,731 --> 01:09:06,567
Take a break folks and watch the big game.

1111
01:09:11,864 --> 01:09:15,159
Move! Now!

1112
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,587
Listen carefully to the rules.

1113
01:09:26,587 --> 01:09:28,630
Just one game.

1114
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:32,843
Winner gets to cut the wrist.

1115
01:09:33,177 --> 01:09:36,930
A gambler's hand raises the stakes, huh?

1116
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:41,643
If you win, leave the
money and take the girl.

1117
01:09:41,643 --> 01:09:45,731
But you get to cut the wrist. Too bad.

1118
01:09:46,774 --> 01:09:48,066
But if you lose

1119
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:53,238
The girl stays along with her hand.
And I'll lessen her debt.

1120
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:55,741
Damn! It's hard to explain.

1121
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:59,077
If I win, burn that.

1122
01:09:59,077 --> 01:10:00,454
Cut the wrist first.

1123
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:04,374
Stupid. I told you not to come here.

1124
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,460
My life is yours, remember?

1125
01:10:06,627 --> 01:10:08,086
You'll lose no matter what.

1126
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,048
I'll just watch your eyes.

1127
01:10:11,632 --> 01:10:12,549
I promise...

1128
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:14,009
Let's get out together.

1129
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:20,182
Playing lovebirds here. That's cute.

1130
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,267
Here. I'll deal.

1131
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,614
The crowd's curious. Open your cards.

1132
01:11:17,614 --> 01:11:18,866
Lady first.

1133
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,541
9 Pair!

1134
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:29,376
That's my girl!

1135
01:11:29,543 --> 01:11:33,213
A girl with one hand ain't
gonna be pretty, right?

1136
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,882
You're screwed kid.

1137
01:11:35,173 --> 01:11:36,216
Open it.

1138
01:11:41,305 --> 01:11:44,808
The dickhead picked a stupid card!

1139
01:11:52,733 --> 01:11:56,028
Nasty fool! You won to save your hand!

1140
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:57,279
Shut up!

1141
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:58,906
Give me the IOU.

1142
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:01,450
Cut the hand first.

1143
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,333
Back off you bastards!

1144
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:34,399
What the hell?

1145
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:36,276
You said the winner gets to cut.

1146
01:12:36,568 --> 01:12:38,445
It's up to me to choose whose hand!

1147
01:12:38,445 --> 01:12:40,906
You fucking son of a bitch!

1148
01:12:40,906 --> 01:12:41,990
Why?

1149
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:45,369
It's not enough to make me a cripple

1150
01:13:05,931 --> 01:13:06,890
Give me a smoke

1151
01:13:18,902 --> 01:13:21,697
Damn bastards! There's no smoking here...

1152
01:13:38,338 --> 01:13:39,548
Game over.

1153
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,764
Hey! Take your lighter!

1154
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:53,437
Pretty cool, bastard.

1155
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:57,274
You can take her, but pay off her interest.

1156
01:13:57,274 --> 01:13:58,525
Bastard! What interest!

1157
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:00,360
Calm down.

1158
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:04,698
You paid off JANG, but you still owe me.

1159
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:10,412
Interest and compensation
for breaking my heart.

1160
01:14:10,912 --> 01:14:13,623
Just pay me $500,000.

1161
01:14:13,832 --> 01:14:14,708
What if we can't?

1162
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,251
Then, work here.

1163
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:19,588
But what good would a cripple be?

1164
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,049
Mina will have to sell her body.

1165
01:14:22,174 --> 01:14:23,300
Here's the money.

1166
01:14:30,974 --> 01:14:33,310
Take that and let them go.

1167
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:36,021
If it isn't Mr. GO!

1168
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:39,191
I heard you play in small pools.

1169
01:14:39,733 --> 01:14:41,610
If you show up, my uncle said

1170
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,739
you'd lose your remaining hand.

1171
01:14:45,739 --> 01:14:47,157
Didn't you hear?

1172
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:49,993
This isn't enough.

1173
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:54,164
With this it'll be over $500,000.

1174
01:14:54,998 --> 01:14:55,957
Let them go!

1175
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,753
No way.

1176
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:06,176
The owner here doesn't keep his word.

1177
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:10,013
Who'd come if you can't leave
with your winnings?

1178
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:20,482
Secret code

1179
01:15:20,565 --> 01:15:23,360
Nice and easy. 1234.

1180
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:28,907
Let's go.

1181
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:43,463
She slept straight for two days.

1182
01:15:43,922 --> 01:15:47,008
She's not suited for this world either.

1183
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:51,680
You're not one to get
rich on gambling either.

1184
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:54,641
What riches for a gambler?

1185
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,561
Then, Why'd you gamble all your life?

1186
01:15:57,561 --> 01:16:01,439
It's because I couldn't walk away.

1187
01:16:04,818 --> 01:16:06,486
Let me help.

1188
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,825
In the past...

1189
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:17,080
there were 3 legendary
gamblers in the country.

1190
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,458
PYUNG, Jjak-gwi,

1191
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,502
and Agwi.

1192
01:16:22,794 --> 01:16:25,755
PYUNG fell off a running train.

1193
01:16:26,006 --> 01:16:28,300
Jjak-gwi lost an ear to Agwi

1194
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:32,220
and ended up in a nursing home.

1195
01:16:33,054 --> 01:16:34,598
And Agwi...

1196
01:16:34,598 --> 01:16:36,600
He)', GO Gwang-ryeol!

1197
01:16:43,023 --> 01:16:44,566
Never cross paths with Agwi.

1198
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:48,778
He's the devil of gambling.

1199
01:16:49,821 --> 01:16:55,368
He ended up getting his hand
cut by PYUNG's disciple.

1200
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,372
Gamblers have one fate.

1201
01:16:59,831 --> 01:17:02,667
If you don't quit, you'll face misfortune.

1202
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:08,340
What happened to the disciple?

1203
01:17:11,635 --> 01:17:13,345
He became the Hands of God

1204
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:17,015
The ultimate for a hustler.

1205
01:17:17,474 --> 01:17:21,686
When he had the
ultimate, unbeatable cards...

1206
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:25,690
he got up and walked away
from gambling forever.

1207
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:30,487
If you think she's worth it,

1208
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:32,113
then try being the Hands of God.

1209
01:17:47,087 --> 01:17:48,296
This place is good.

1210
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:50,382
Have some more.

1211
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:53,218
How's your hand?

1212
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:54,886
How's Gwang-chul?

1213
01:17:57,389 --> 01:17:58,598
He's in prison.

1214
01:18:00,892 --> 01:18:02,394
He killed a man cuz of me.

1215
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:05,897
Wanna hear the dark story?

1216
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:11,236
Tell me whenever.
We'll be together from now on.

1217
01:18:11,236 --> 01:18:12,612
Says who?

1218
01:18:12,612 --> 01:18:13,905
HUH Mina of course.

1219
01:18:14,531 --> 01:18:15,657
You said you loved me.

1220
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:17,033
When?

1221
01:18:17,033 --> 01:18:18,493
When you pulled the knife out...

1222
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:20,495
your eyes said so.

1223
01:18:21,454 --> 01:18:22,747
The eyes can't lie.

1224
01:18:24,874 --> 01:18:26,835
Just hear the story.

1225
01:18:28,086 --> 01:18:30,088
Know my brother's friend Wang

1226
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,717
He introduced him to Ghost.

1227
01:18:35,552 --> 01:18:37,637
This is my friend, sir.

1228
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:39,556
I'm HUH Gwang-chul, sir!

1229
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,100
Where's HUH Gwang-chul?

1230
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,311
Come out now! Why work in a shithole!

1231
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:49,983
I went in to get my brother
and caught JANG's eye.

1232
01:18:49,983 --> 01:18:52,402
Get out!

1233
01:18:54,237 --> 01:19:00,285
He sent my brother on a job to Dr. HWANG.

1234
01:19:00,744 --> 01:19:02,662
Have a drink before you go.

1235
01:19:03,163 --> 01:19:05,373
The bastards set him up.

1236
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:07,876
Thank you, sir.

1237
01:19:09,753 --> 01:19:10,962
Thank you.

1238
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,300
My naive brother...

1239
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:20,555
got drugged up and used.

1240
01:19:22,682 --> 01:19:28,855
Made him owe Ghost, then came to me.

1241
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,484
Said I could pay off his debt.

1242
01:19:36,029 --> 01:19:37,781
JANG said...

1243
01:19:38,323 --> 01:19:44,454
Just dress up and play cards with some men.

1244
01:19:45,705 --> 01:19:47,665
And drink coffee.

1245
01:19:52,462 --> 01:19:54,506
I got drugged UP...

1246
01:19:56,257 --> 01:20:00,428
and dragged around dozens of times.

1247
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,142
My brother didn't mean to kill Wang...

1248
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:09,521
but he lost it.

1249
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,486
I'm a filthy bitch.

1250
01:20:18,655 --> 01:20:19,906
Meet someone better.

1251
01:20:21,825 --> 01:20:24,285
Who's better than the
girl who saved my life?

1252
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,749
I'm not a great man yet.

1253
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:33,545
But if a gambler quits
gambling, isn't that great?

1254
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:37,799
Live a new life from now on.

1255
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,179
With me.

1256
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:47,725
Wanna kiss?

1257
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:02,323
Why'd you sell her?

1258
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:03,825
What?

1259
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,454
I told you not to sell her to anyone else.

1260
01:21:08,913 --> 01:21:09,998
She's mine.

1261
01:21:12,876 --> 01:21:16,629
I'll find another useful gal for you.

1262
01:21:16,629 --> 01:21:22,135
If you're dumb, you should at least listen.

1263
01:21:23,803 --> 01:21:26,264
When your uncle is so great...

1264
01:21:28,558 --> 01:21:32,353
Close your house down and work under me.

1265
01:21:32,937 --> 01:21:33,897
Like a dog.

1266
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:40,904
You have pretty eyes.

1267
01:21:42,155 --> 01:21:43,031
KIM

1268
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:45,283
Yes, boss.

1269
01:21:45,742 --> 01:21:49,370
Call Dr. HWANG and
ask if he needs two eyes.

1270
01:21:49,662 --> 01:21:50,622
Yes, sir.

1271
01:22:02,383 --> 01:22:05,678
Find her and text me
before brunch tomorrow.

1272
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:08,723
Yes, sir.

1273
01:22:10,391 --> 01:22:14,229
Go back to your hometown or move out.

1274
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:17,565
How can I made you
lose all your retirement money.

1275
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:20,026
I'll support you for life.

1276
01:22:20,026 --> 01:22:22,362
How? You quit gambling.

1277
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:24,739
- Chinese restaurants suck here.
- So

1278
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,866
- Let's run one.
- What?

1279
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:30,620
Mina and I'll cook, you can deliver.

1280
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,456
What! Me, deliver

1281
01:22:40,713 --> 01:22:43,216
My boss wants to see you.

1282
01:22:43,341 --> 01:22:44,884
For what. The deal's done.

1283
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,053
I'm not sure.

1284
01:22:47,053 --> 01:22:48,972
But my boss wants me to bring you two.

1285
01:22:49,305 --> 01:22:50,139
Who's he?

1286
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:51,099
Take Mina and run.

1287
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:53,643
My boss says to bring you right now.

1288
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:55,103
Come here.

1289
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,604
Like chicken?

1290
01:23:04,362 --> 01:23:05,238
Dae-gil!

1291
01:23:06,155 --> 01:23:07,991
Hurry!

1292
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:10,868
Hurry UP!

1293
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:12,161
You can't come in here.

1294
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:14,789
Help us, please

1295
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:17,000
Some bastard is...

1296
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:18,293
There! See

1297
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,544
Wait.

1298
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,381
You can't come in here.

1299
01:23:24,716 --> 01:23:25,842
See that

1300
01:24:43,836 --> 01:24:45,046
Dae-gil...

1301
01:24:45,088 --> 01:24:48,299
I'm dying. How'd this happen...

1302
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:49,592
Sir...

1303
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:52,387
Dae-gil...

1304
01:24:56,182 --> 01:24:58,226
No revenge.

1305
01:25:00,186 --> 01:25:01,270
Okay?

1306
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:02,814
Got it?

1307
01:25:02,814 --> 01:25:05,566
Bastards!

1308
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:12,198
Oh no! Please! No!

1309
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:13,908
Help me!

1310
01:25:16,452 --> 01:25:17,245
Sir...

1311
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:20,998
Love hard. Passionately...

1312
01:25:21,624 --> 01:25:23,209
What are you saying?

1313
01:25:27,463 --> 01:25:29,006
Sir!

1314
01:25:58,202 --> 01:26:00,246
It's been six months.

1315
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:01,956
I've been busy.

1316
01:26:02,206 --> 01:26:06,210
I heard Ghost lost everything
and went in under JANG.

1317
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:07,795
Damn fly went to shit.

1318
01:26:08,379 --> 01:26:09,589
Are you behind it?

1319
01:26:09,589 --> 01:26:10,882
Found your friend?

1320
01:26:11,382 --> 01:26:12,967
Don't do anything dangerous.

1321
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,094
Leaving them be is more dangerous.

1322
01:26:20,391 --> 01:26:21,893
I'll send you his number.

1323
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,188
His name's CHO Hwa-baek.

1324
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:29,358
Two months left, right?

1325
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:33,821
Sorry for being a big brother like this...

1326
01:26:35,448 --> 01:26:37,492
When you get out, let's live normally.

1327
01:26:38,242 --> 01:26:40,912
Get married and eat out on salaries.

1328
01:26:40,912 --> 01:26:42,747
Save up and buy homes.

1329
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:47,960
And play cards just on Thanksgiving
and New Year's.

1330
01:26:50,671 --> 01:26:52,757
Be careful you!

1331
01:26:54,759 --> 01:26:58,596
Don't worry, I'm a hustler.

1332
01:26:58,805 --> 01:27:00,264
Why you.

1333
01:27:02,141 --> 01:27:03,559
How's Dae-gil?

1334
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:13,444
Says CHO Hwa-baek is a pro
at setting people up.

1335
01:27:13,486 --> 01:27:18,032
And his friend Plier is good
at picking locks and stuff.

1336
01:27:24,413 --> 01:27:28,167
Feel bad going against his will not
to get revenge

1337
01:27:28,626 --> 01:27:30,920
I'm not getting revenge for him.

1338
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:33,840
Don't worry.

1339
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:38,553
It's for the chicken that got dropped.

1340
01:27:45,309 --> 01:27:47,812
I'm originally from a different field.

1341
01:27:47,812 --> 01:27:50,773
I used to be a theatrical actor.

1342
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,609
Know Hamlet Shakespeare?

1343
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:56,571
"Frailty, thy name is woman."

1344
01:27:56,946 --> 01:27:59,782
Hey, Plier. Why isn't this working?

1345
01:28:03,369 --> 01:28:06,372
I owe Gwang-chul from prison together.

1346
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:08,541
He saved you from being raped.

1347
01:28:11,669 --> 01:28:13,754
Almost from being raped.

1348
01:28:14,297 --> 01:28:16,299
What's our schedule like this month?

1349
01:28:19,218 --> 01:28:21,679
The job is to get $5 million.

1350
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,348
After investor's interest and so on,

1351
01:28:24,348 --> 01:28:26,183
we'll still give you $1 million each.

1352
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,352
If we get more, we'll divide it.

1353
01:28:30,563 --> 01:28:33,316
I heard you work for
the thrill, not the money.

1354
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:35,359
Why didn't you say so?

1355
01:28:37,153 --> 01:28:40,781
Who, when, where, how
do you want us to set up?

1356
01:28:42,074 --> 01:28:44,035
I win!

1357
01:28:44,327 --> 01:28:47,538
Like you said, the bitch is gambling crazy.

1358
01:28:47,788 --> 01:28:51,000
She owes rent and workers' pay,
but has money to gamble.

1359
01:28:51,542 --> 01:28:54,837
Get her with this rigged set.

1360
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:58,591
See! All five kings!

1361
01:28:59,008 --> 01:29:00,635
Stop! I'm done!

1362
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:02,887
Now what?

1363
01:29:02,887 --> 01:29:04,889
Take the spoon from the hungry.

1364
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:06,015
Plier

1365
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:11,145
Wait one week. I got robbed.

1366
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:15,024
I guess for you, Mrs. SONG. I'll wait.

1367
01:29:15,191 --> 01:29:17,777
Thanks! I'll pay you lots of interest!

1368
01:29:17,777 --> 01:29:20,154
Enter Mina.

1369
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:23,115
Mr. CHO! How've you been?

1370
01:29:23,115 --> 01:29:25,868
Madam! What brings you here?

1371
01:29:25,868 --> 01:29:28,329
What else? To spend money.

1372
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:29,789
How's business?

1373
01:29:29,789 --> 01:29:32,083
- Same old...
- Who's she?

1374
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:36,545
A rich old man's girl
who sucks at gambling.

1375
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:37,421
3 pair.

1376
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:39,340
4 pair.

1377
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:42,218
Dang it!

1378
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:49,934
- She keeps winning. There must be cameras.
- Bye!

1379
01:30:04,615 --> 01:30:07,076
Okay. 6 pair.

1380
01:30:11,622 --> 01:30:14,250
- $'lo grand.
- I raise $20,000 more!

1381
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,459
I raise $30,000 more!

1382
01:30:15,626 --> 01:30:17,628
I raise $50,000 more!

1383
01:30:17,628 --> 01:30:19,630
I raise $100,000 more!

1384
01:30:19,922 --> 01:30:25,094
I'll see that and raise $300,000 more.

1385
01:30:28,806 --> 01:30:29,974
Take collateral?

1386
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:34,145
Not your body.

1387
01:30:34,979 --> 01:30:35,980
Is it higher than 9 pair?

1388
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:39,483
Shit! I have 8 pair.

1389
01:30:46,532 --> 01:30:47,324
What is it?

1390
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,702
See for yourself.

1391
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:51,829
What the hell!

1392
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,048
Here's a tip.

1393
01:31:08,137 --> 01:31:10,806
To be or not to be! Money is the question!

1394
01:31:10,806 --> 01:31:12,516
Ophelia, where art thou?

1395
01:31:12,725 --> 01:31:15,019
Stop! You base fellow!

1396
01:31:15,019 --> 01:31:17,730
Money!

1397
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:20,232
Let's go on to the next act!

1398
01:31:23,027 --> 01:31:26,906
I'll end up in the
streets thanks to you, sir.

1399
01:31:26,906 --> 01:31:31,285
Sorry. I promise to lose big, next week.

1400
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:34,163
How can I win off a pro like you, sir

1401
01:31:34,163 --> 01:31:35,498
Why you.

1402
01:31:35,498 --> 01:31:38,375
- You were great today.
- Thanks.

1403
01:31:39,418 --> 01:31:42,713
Pay the rest when you move in next month.

1404
01:31:42,713 --> 01:31:45,341
You bought it at a good price.

1405
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,969
You can learn a few things from me.

1406
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:51,972
I'll teach you after my golf game.

1407
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,683
Don't be late.

1408
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:01,190
I'm from Interpol.

1409
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:04,902
Know this man?

1410
01:32:04,902 --> 01:32:06,570
Yes, sir. Bye.

1411
01:32:06,779 --> 01:32:08,447
Why did he cancel everything?

1412
01:32:08,447 --> 01:32:09,490
I think he caught on.

1413
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:13,744
After all the bait money!
What about our house?

1414
01:32:15,871 --> 01:32:16,622
Hello

1415
01:32:16,872 --> 01:32:18,791
Hi, Chief SEO.

1416
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:22,086
Yes, I saw your text.

1417
01:32:22,878 --> 01:32:25,131
Then, I'll see you there.

1418
01:32:25,422 --> 01:32:26,590
Bye.

1419
01:32:27,383 --> 01:32:28,801
We got them!

1420
01:32:29,593 --> 01:32:30,886
Plier!

1421
01:32:40,229 --> 01:32:42,314
What the hell!

1422
01:32:42,314 --> 01:32:44,942
- Honey! A towel! Sorry.
- Damn.

1423
01:32:44,942 --> 01:32:46,610
Pass the lighter.

1424
01:32:47,236 --> 01:32:48,696
What did you spill?

1425
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:52,992
Oh no, your pants... Here's a towel.

1426
01:32:55,202 --> 01:32:56,537
I'm sorry.

1427
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:58,164
Why drink coffee during a game?

1428
01:32:58,164 --> 01:33:00,791
Why'd you put it here?

1429
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:05,379
Blue Stripes for grabs.

1430
01:33:07,089 --> 01:33:08,757
Red Stripes for grabs.

1431
01:33:08,757 --> 01:33:09,466
Three of a kind.

1432
01:33:09,592 --> 01:33:11,260
Quadruple points.

1433
01:33:14,638 --> 01:33:16,432
Got the 3 points for Blue Stripes!

1434
01:33:16,473 --> 01:33:17,474
You could win big!

1435
01:33:19,435 --> 01:33:20,227
One Go.

1436
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:23,689
I'm screwed.

1437
01:33:26,984 --> 01:33:29,278
Godori up for grabs!

1438
01:33:35,826 --> 01:33:37,703
Quadruple points if I win over you.

1439
01:33:39,788 --> 01:33:40,539
One Go.

1440
01:33:47,129 --> 01:33:49,340
Red Stripes, huh?

1441
01:33:50,216 --> 01:33:52,551
I'm out. It's up to you two.

1442
01:33:53,177 --> 01:33:55,638
Damn!

1443
01:33:55,888 --> 01:33:57,181
I'm sorry.

1444
01:34:00,893 --> 01:34:02,144
This is terrible.

1445
01:34:10,653 --> 01:34:11,987
A whammy!

1446
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:23,123
One card each, please.

1447
01:34:25,876 --> 01:34:26,669
Shit.

1448
01:34:26,669 --> 01:34:28,003
I have no choice.

1449
01:34:31,006 --> 01:34:31,799
Two Go.

1450
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:41,934
This one's mine.

1451
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,645
Three Go.

1452
01:35:00,369 --> 01:35:02,037
How many points?

1453
01:35:02,037 --> 01:35:03,831
4 kings, 5 birds,

1454
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:07,084
3 animals, 1 stripe, 12 pawns...

1455
01:35:07,084 --> 01:35:09,962
and Three Go totals 28 points.

1456
01:35:09,962 --> 01:35:12,256
Quadruple for winning over you, 224 points.

1457
01:35:12,256 --> 01:35:16,260
Triple for no kings and tens. 1792 points.

1458
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:18,804
Double for Three Go. 3584

1459
01:35:18,804 --> 01:35:23,017
You have to pay for Mr. CHO. 3584
plus 1792 points...

1460
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:26,562
5376 points times $50G...

1461
01:35:29,148 --> 01:35:33,068
You owe $2,688,000. Any questions

1462
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:41,702
Looks like around $200 grand.
What about the $2.5 mill?

1463
01:35:42,202 --> 01:35:44,663
I heard you're rich. Please...

1464
01:35:44,663 --> 01:35:47,666
But I'm playing with my uncle's money.

1465
01:35:51,211 --> 01:35:52,463
Uncle

1466
01:35:53,339 --> 01:35:55,382
Could you come up?

1467
01:35:56,842 --> 01:35:58,552
This is a lot too...

1468
01:35:58,844 --> 01:35:59,720
Mr. CHO

1469
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:01,055
The door, please.

1470
01:36:22,785 --> 01:36:24,828
Been a long time, SEO.

1471
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:26,747
SONG? Did you lose weight?

1472
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:27,998
Thank you.

1473
01:36:28,374 --> 01:36:29,208
How much?

1474
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:30,334
Minus the small change?

1475
01:36:30,459 --> 01:36:31,627
Of course not.

1476
01:36:31,627 --> 01:36:33,796
It's exactly $2,688,000.

1477
01:36:35,547 --> 01:36:37,299
Those not involved may go.

1478
01:36:41,136 --> 01:36:42,304
Thank you.

1479
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,108
An eye for an eye.

1480
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:57,528
That's what you said, right?

1481
01:37:02,658 --> 01:37:05,619
Dr. HWANG. They're all yours.

1482
01:37:05,702 --> 01:37:09,289
The woman would be worth more
after having the baby.

1483
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:11,208
Sir!

1484
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:13,085
Do I know you?

1485
01:37:13,085 --> 01:37:15,587
Sir! Please!

1486
01:37:15,587 --> 01:37:18,841
Please! No!

1487
01:37:25,013 --> 01:37:28,225
Good job. Not bad in acting.

1488
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,145
Really?

1489
01:37:33,355 --> 01:37:37,276
Be good or else you'll meet me again.

1490
01:37:46,118 --> 01:37:50,581
Please, I don't need this.

1491
01:37:51,248 --> 01:37:54,293
That's no respect for your pretty hand.

1492
01:37:59,965 --> 01:38:00,966
Hold on.

1493
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:05,596
Hello

1494
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:23,655
Sounds easy.

1495
01:38:24,823 --> 01:38:25,782
But why me?

1496
01:38:25,824 --> 01:38:27,493
It can't fail.

1497
01:38:28,994 --> 01:38:30,746
No man can resist you.

1498
01:38:33,165 --> 01:38:36,084
But I'm working on something these days.

1499
01:38:36,084 --> 01:38:39,171
The diamond's too small.

1500
01:38:40,297 --> 01:38:41,965
That's no respect for your hand.

1501
01:38:45,511 --> 01:38:47,012
What percentage will I get?

1502
01:38:48,305 --> 01:38:49,306
The norm.

1503
01:38:50,432 --> 01:38:52,351
You've changed so much.

1504
01:38:52,643 --> 01:38:54,311
So, you're in?

1505
01:39:00,776 --> 01:39:02,444
How about truth or dare?

1506
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:04,780
Did you love me?

1507
01:39:06,615 --> 01:39:07,616
With all my heart.

1508
01:39:07,616 --> 01:39:09,243
Do you still love me?

1509
01:39:27,844 --> 01:39:29,263
I don't get it.

1510
01:39:29,555 --> 01:39:30,597
What?

1511
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:33,225
Take the gold mine yourself.

1512
01:39:33,225 --> 01:39:36,228
Why would you share it with me?

1513
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:42,109
It's a large sum and I'm kinda scared.

1514
01:39:42,484 --> 01:39:47,364
I want someone to help,
but I've nowhere to turn to.

1515
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:51,118
I need a talented pro like you.

1516
01:39:53,495 --> 01:39:55,539
- Ghost
- Yes

1517
01:39:55,539 --> 01:39:56,999
Eat outside.

1518
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,293
Yes, sir.

1519
01:40:08,176 --> 01:40:10,512
How about going out for a drink?

1520
01:40:10,762 --> 01:40:12,306
Enough business talk.

1521
01:40:12,764 --> 01:40:14,057
Who's behind you?

1522
01:40:14,391 --> 01:40:15,601
What?

1523
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:20,188
Behind me

1524
01:40:21,023 --> 01:40:22,566
Must be HAM Dae-gil.

1525
01:40:23,442 --> 01:40:28,655
I heard he cleaned out SONG and SEO.

1526
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:31,700
Probably did that to get money ready.

1527
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:34,578
Let me guess what he asked you.

1528
01:40:34,703 --> 01:40:39,958
Approach JANG Dong-shik
and find out where his money is.

1529
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:41,752
Or have him sit in a game.

1530
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:46,048
Or lure me to hand all my money to you.

1531
01:40:46,048 --> 01:40:48,258
You should become a writer.

1532
01:40:51,762 --> 01:40:54,640
I don't trust women in short skirts.

1533
01:41:02,397 --> 01:41:04,358
See yourself out.

1534
01:41:08,278 --> 01:41:11,031
You must be a eunuch!

1535
01:42:05,502 --> 01:42:06,837
Just take half.

1536
01:42:07,546 --> 01:42:08,505
Millions in gambling money...

1537
01:42:08,505 --> 01:42:09,339
"MONEY FOUND IN WAREHOUSE"

1538
01:42:09,339 --> 01:42:10,590
"5 MILLION SEIZED"

1539
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:11,717
JANG Dong-shik's millions found.

1540
01:42:11,717 --> 01:42:12,718
"LEDGER OF BRIBES FOUND"

1541
01:42:12,718 --> 01:42:13,635
"APOLOGY FROM BRIBED POLICE"

1542
01:42:13,635 --> 01:42:14,761
We are deeply sorry.

1543
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:15,721
Officers' names in the ledger...

1544
01:42:15,721 --> 01:42:16,888
There is a reward on JANG.

1545
01:42:16,888 --> 01:42:18,265
"WANTED: JANG DONG-SHIK"

1546
01:42:33,864 --> 01:42:35,365
She's pretty.

1547
01:42:36,324 --> 01:42:37,325
How old?

1548
01:42:38,577 --> 01:42:39,870
Count it, ma'am.

1549
01:42:39,995 --> 01:42:41,913
Call me babe like you used to

1550
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:45,417
I'm leaving the country.

1551
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,418
Dae-gil

1552
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:49,379
Let's go together.

1553
01:43:16,615 --> 01:43:20,285
I got the money.
Get me a passport and a ship out.

1554
01:43:20,702 --> 01:43:23,872
If you can't get Dae-gil, get at least WOO!

1555
01:43:23,872 --> 01:43:25,332
I'm wanted so...

1556
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:28,418
I'll call back later.

1557
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:38,720
Why aren't they picking up?

1558
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:39,596
"Hay que casarse"

1559
01:43:39,596 --> 01:43:40,680
"INCHEON AIRPORT"

1560
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:42,724
What's that?

1561
01:43:44,476 --> 01:43:46,520
I'll tell you in Barcelona.

1562
01:43:47,646 --> 01:43:49,731
"WILL YOU MARRY ME?"

1563
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:52,859
Why didn't you pick up?

1564
01:43:52,943 --> 01:43:55,487
Oh, I wonder why.

1565
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:59,324
Bring the money or they're dead.

1566
01:44:20,679 --> 01:44:23,181
So loyal.

1567
01:44:23,181 --> 01:44:25,308
Shut up. Where are they?

1568
01:44:26,685 --> 01:44:27,978
Come here!

1569
01:44:30,438 --> 01:44:31,189
Money!

1570
01:44:35,485 --> 01:44:36,152
Go check.

1571
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:52,002
People first.

1572
01:45:15,233 --> 01:45:16,484
Money first.

1573
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:20,488
Let's meet half way.

1574
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:32,626
Are you all right?

1575
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:47,933
Hey!

1576
01:45:49,267 --> 01:45:49,893
Shit!

1577
01:45:56,816 --> 01:45:57,943
No!

1578
01:45:58,526 --> 01:46:01,488
Bring water! Now!

1579
01:47:07,178 --> 01:47:08,304
Hope this works.

1580
01:47:08,304 --> 01:47:10,473
Now what? No!

1581
01:47:28,658 --> 01:47:32,662
Shit! I almost died!

1582
01:47:32,662 --> 01:47:35,290
What? He could talk?

1583
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:37,917
He's from Mongolia. Says he almost died.

1584
01:47:37,917 --> 01:47:39,377
- You okay
- You all right?

1585
01:47:39,377 --> 01:47:40,795
What if I'm not?

1586
01:47:40,795 --> 01:47:42,839
When did you get your license?

1587
01:47:43,089 --> 01:47:44,632
I didn't.

1588
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:28,343
Mina...

1589
01:48:59,332 --> 01:49:00,834
Thanks.

1590
01:49:01,084 --> 01:49:03,545
For destroying those bastards.

1591
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:19,102
Here's your passport.

1592
01:49:21,729 --> 01:49:22,856
Good work.

1593
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:25,316
Which ship do I go on

1594
01:49:26,276 --> 01:49:27,986
Got him!

1595
01:49:29,779 --> 01:49:30,905
Shit!

1596
01:49:31,239 --> 01:49:33,741
That's enough.

1597
01:49:35,618 --> 01:49:37,370
You'll kill him.

1598
01:49:40,248 --> 01:49:41,374
Get rid of him.

1599
01:49:47,422 --> 01:49:48,965
Hold on.

1600
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:53,052
This won't be enough.

1601
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:55,013
I don't understand.

1602
01:50:08,735 --> 01:50:13,281
What did you just say?

1603
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:16,951
Sure your uncle will do it?

1604
01:50:16,993 --> 01:50:18,620
Let's go to him now.

1605
01:50:18,661 --> 01:50:22,916
We should drink to celebrate.

1606
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:24,042
I guess next time.

1607
01:50:24,042 --> 01:50:26,377
We can drink in Hawaii.

1608
01:50:26,502 --> 01:50:28,588
I'm sick of this country.

1609
01:50:29,464 --> 01:50:32,467
Then, a toast with this

1610
01:50:33,176 --> 01:50:34,344
Cheers.

1611
01:51:03,998 --> 01:51:05,625
She had a miscarriage.

1612
01:52:25,413 --> 01:52:26,664
Open it.

1613
01:52:35,089 --> 01:52:35,798
Sir

1614
01:52:35,965 --> 01:52:36,841
I'll be going.

1615
01:52:37,467 --> 01:52:40,136
Throw the trash out, you rubbish!

1616
01:52:40,553 --> 01:52:43,056
- Who's that
- My disciple.

1617
01:52:43,389 --> 01:52:45,308
He's good at sneaking bottom cards out.

1618
01:52:45,683 --> 01:52:47,060
Remember him.

1619
01:52:47,310 --> 01:52:50,229
He'll rule the gambling world some day.

1620
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:53,983
This looks like poison.

1621
01:52:54,859 --> 01:52:57,070
I won it in gambling. It's clean.

1622
01:52:57,070 --> 01:53:00,239
Let's see if touching
it will kill me or not.

1623
01:53:14,003 --> 01:53:16,005
I expect some company.

1624
01:53:16,464 --> 01:53:18,800
Sir Some guests have come.

1625
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:33,940
Ghost?

1626
01:53:34,774 --> 01:53:35,775
What are you doing here?

1627
01:53:35,775 --> 01:53:39,195
Gwang-chul! What the
hell are you doing here?

1628
01:53:39,195 --> 01:53:41,739
Shut up and tell me where JANG is.

1629
01:53:44,242 --> 01:53:47,912
How can they talk to me like that?

1630
01:53:47,912 --> 01:53:50,623
The young man just
said what I wanted to say.

1631
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,959
Just shut up for now.

1632
01:53:53,251 --> 01:53:55,420
You came a long way. Come in.

1633
01:53:55,962 --> 01:53:57,380
Looks like we need to talk.

1634
01:53:57,588 --> 01:53:59,298
Make yourselves at home.

1635
01:54:13,604 --> 01:54:15,148
What brings you here

1636
01:54:15,231 --> 01:54:18,234
I came to kill JANG Dong-shik.

1637
01:54:18,484 --> 01:54:19,986
JANG Dong-shik

1638
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:22,363
From the outskirts

1639
01:54:23,781 --> 01:54:26,742
One out of 10 gamblers want revenge on him.

1640
01:54:26,742 --> 01:54:29,704
But why look for him here?

1641
01:54:34,792 --> 01:54:38,129
You said you won it.

1642
01:54:39,839 --> 01:54:41,757
You worthless shit!

1643
01:54:42,758 --> 01:54:44,302
Where's JANG?

1644
01:54:44,302 --> 01:54:45,553
Probably dead.

1645
01:54:47,013 --> 01:54:49,682
He's not one to die to you.

1646
01:54:50,433 --> 01:54:54,187
I think he'll come through that door today.

1647
01:54:54,937 --> 01:54:56,564
What timing!

1648
01:54:59,108 --> 01:55:00,902
You son of a bitch!

1649
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:19,962
I'm JANG Dong-shik, sir.

1650
01:55:19,962 --> 01:55:21,297
Please excuse my manners.

1651
01:55:25,343 --> 01:55:26,385
Mr. Agwi, sir.

1652
01:55:27,678 --> 01:55:29,263
Welcome, Mr. JANG.

1653
01:55:29,805 --> 01:55:32,975
We met over 10 years ago in Yeosu, right?

1654
01:55:33,059 --> 01:55:35,603
You remember me? It's an honor, sir.

1655
01:55:35,728 --> 01:55:37,104
What brings you here?

1656
01:55:37,104 --> 01:55:39,690
Your nephew took my bag by mistake.

1657
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:41,400
Like hell I did!

1658
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,736
I won it off you! You damn pig!

1659
01:55:48,157 --> 01:55:51,077
If you give me my bag, I'll go quietly.

1660
01:55:51,077 --> 01:55:52,703
Who Says!

1661
01:55:52,703 --> 01:55:54,330
Your nephew's neck is on the line.

1662
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:58,042
You bastard! Think you can threaten me!

1663
01:55:58,376 --> 01:56:00,044
Take off your shoes, asshole!

1664
01:56:11,389 --> 01:56:14,475
Call back in 5 minutes.
If I don't answer, come up.

1665
01:56:17,687 --> 01:56:18,437
Look.

1666
01:56:19,146 --> 01:56:21,399
You want JANG's head, right

1667
01:56:22,441 --> 01:56:23,234
And you?

1668
01:56:23,901 --> 01:56:28,155
My money and that fool's organs.

1669
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:29,699
So scary.

1670
01:56:30,616 --> 01:56:33,536
And you need that in U.S. dollars
to leave the country

1671
01:56:33,536 --> 01:56:34,745
I'll give you some, Uncle.

1672
01:56:34,954 --> 01:56:38,165
Forget it. Don't need it.

1673
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:39,834
Let's do this.

1674
01:56:41,085 --> 01:56:43,379
Resolve gambling problems by gambling.

1675
01:56:43,754 --> 01:56:44,880
In one game.

1676
01:56:45,798 --> 01:56:48,801
Winner takes all that money.

1677
01:56:48,968 --> 01:56:50,886
But it's mine to begin with.

1678
01:56:50,886 --> 01:56:52,930
You lost it! It's mine!

1679
01:56:52,930 --> 01:56:54,432
Forget the money.

1680
01:56:54,432 --> 01:56:55,933
I just want JANG's head.

1681
01:56:55,933 --> 01:56:59,937
Who says we bet just money.
We bet our heads, too.

1682
01:57:01,105 --> 01:57:03,274
Play till you run out.

1683
01:57:03,274 --> 01:57:08,029
The winner can kill the loser
if he wants or not.

1684
01:57:08,029 --> 01:57:09,530
Why should we play?

1685
01:57:12,825 --> 01:57:15,036
Don't you want one last game?

1686
01:57:16,329 --> 01:57:20,082
Looks like you all want
to end your damn ties.

1687
01:57:20,875 --> 01:57:22,877
How can we trust you?

1688
01:57:22,877 --> 01:57:24,629
I'll play for my nephew.

1689
01:57:24,629 --> 01:57:28,382
If I lose, you can kill us both.

1690
01:57:28,633 --> 01:57:32,011
JANG will need more incentive, right?

1691
01:57:32,011 --> 01:57:34,180
How about $1 million each to play?

1692
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:38,225
Too little for your lives $2 million then?

1693
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:42,438
If you don't have enough, bring a player.

1694
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:46,025
Winner gets all, loser goes to hell.

1695
01:57:46,275 --> 01:57:48,694
Doesn't it sound fun?

1696
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:10,549
Pick the time and place.

1697
01:58:14,011 --> 01:58:15,930
Did you all eat?

1698
01:58:22,395 --> 01:58:25,606
Never thought you'd borrow money from me.

1699
01:58:26,607 --> 01:58:30,528
Pay me back. Don't
make me get it out of you.

1700
01:58:31,487 --> 01:58:33,948
Whatever. Thanks.

1701
01:58:33,948 --> 01:58:35,366
Come back alive.

1702
01:58:35,366 --> 01:58:37,326
If you don't, she'll die tragically.

1703
01:58:37,326 --> 01:58:38,452
Wait! Hold on!

1704
01:58:38,703 --> 01:58:41,122
I'll get Dae-gil! I can beat him!

1705
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:45,418
Think he'll come alone? You need my help!

1706
01:58:45,418 --> 01:58:48,170
If I lose, kill me then!

1707
01:58:50,297 --> 01:58:53,050
Sorry, I wasn't there when you got out.

1708
01:58:55,553 --> 01:58:57,847
Don't ever go back in there.

1709
01:58:59,056 --> 01:59:00,933
Don't worry, I won't.

1710
01:59:01,642 --> 01:59:02,560
Bro

1711
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,563
Stay out of this one.

1712
01:59:07,773 --> 01:59:09,984
Let me be a big brother for once.

1713
01:59:15,322 --> 01:59:17,491
What did you and Dae-gil talk about?

1714
01:59:19,994 --> 01:59:23,080
Just guys' talk.

1715
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:39,930
You can lose it all. Just come back alive.

1716
01:59:40,222 --> 01:59:41,307
Thank you, sir.

1717
01:59:42,391 --> 01:59:45,352
Want me to read your palm?

1718
01:59:50,316 --> 01:59:52,026
You'll live a long life.

1719
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:54,069
If you quit gambling.

1720
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:34,837
A fine day to gamble, isn't it?

1721
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:40,885
Did the ladies hear
what'll happen if you lose?

1722
02:01:41,093 --> 02:01:42,052
What?

1723
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:43,846
I wonder what?

1724
02:01:43,846 --> 02:01:46,640
He likes to cut and he likes to crush.

1725
02:01:46,974 --> 02:01:48,309
You choose.

1726
02:01:48,392 --> 02:01:50,936
Just don't freak out when you lose.

1727
02:01:50,936 --> 02:01:52,771
Can't you tell I'm crazy?

1728
02:01:54,106 --> 02:01:55,774
She's a feisty one.

1729
02:01:55,858 --> 02:01:58,110
She's Crazy. Who are you?

1730
02:01:58,193 --> 02:02:01,030
Must we exchange names?

1731
02:02:01,739 --> 02:02:03,991
Used to be called Ace.

1732
02:02:03,991 --> 02:02:06,577
Now, I'm just a bitch. Happy?

1733
02:02:07,661 --> 02:02:09,914
You brought Crazy and Bitch as helpers

1734
02:02:09,997 --> 02:02:13,083
Any last words before we start

1735
02:02:15,961 --> 02:02:17,630
- Let's play naked.
- What?

1736
02:02:18,505 --> 02:02:21,175
How can I beat hustlers who use tricks?

1737
02:02:21,258 --> 02:02:24,595
Strip so you can't hide cards
under your clothes.

1738
02:02:25,888 --> 02:02:29,058
I'd love it, but are you up for it?

1739
02:02:29,224 --> 02:02:30,684
Just don't get too excited.

1740
02:02:34,271 --> 02:02:35,481
Can't get your dick up, right?

1741
02:02:42,279 --> 02:02:43,781
I have a condition, too.

1742
02:02:45,824 --> 02:02:48,577
Let's play with these.
New cards every 10 games.

1743
02:02:48,953 --> 02:02:51,538
You'll mark them with your nails.

1744
02:02:51,538 --> 02:02:54,124
- Trust you old lady
- How old are you?

1745
02:02:54,124 --> 02:02:56,961
Obviously younger than you.

1746
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:02,424
Here's the store receipt.

1747
02:03:02,424 --> 02:03:04,843
Open any pack and check.

1748
02:03:05,219 --> 02:03:10,182
Or send someone to buy them
if you don't trust me.

1749
02:03:11,475 --> 02:03:13,268
It's hot in here.

1750
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:16,814
Just play with these.

1751
02:03:17,314 --> 02:03:19,233
Where would we buy some now?

1752
02:03:19,483 --> 02:03:22,152
Anything else?

1753
02:03:22,152 --> 02:03:23,195
Let's play with one hand.

1754
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:26,156
Make sure there's no cheating.

1755
02:03:26,448 --> 02:03:28,200
Let's just play with our left hands.

1756
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:31,996
Play with one hand or both.

1757
02:03:32,246 --> 02:03:34,123
I don't care.

1758
02:03:34,248 --> 02:03:35,708
Anything you'd like to add?

1759
02:03:37,376 --> 02:03:38,669
Just beer, please.

1760
02:03:38,836 --> 02:03:40,045
Get it for him.

1761
02:03:40,421 --> 02:03:46,719
Now, let's play a clean,
honest game, shall we?

1762
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:48,721
But what if you're caught cheating

1763
02:03:50,014 --> 02:03:53,058
Let's cut off the elbow not the wrist.

1764
02:03:53,267 --> 02:03:54,768
Elbow for people...

1765
02:03:55,019 --> 02:03:56,770
and the neck for the pig.

1766
02:03:56,854 --> 02:03:57,938
Think that'll do?

1767
02:04:00,524 --> 02:04:02,359
Smith & Wesson 38.

1768
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:05,404
This made my hand like this.

1769
02:04:07,406 --> 02:04:08,532
No spectators.

1770
02:04:08,657 --> 02:04:09,908
Everyone out.

1771
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,368
Yes, sir.

1772
02:04:22,421 --> 02:04:24,048
What's going on?

1773
02:04:26,717 --> 02:04:27,926
Take them off.

1774
02:04:39,313 --> 02:04:40,314
Bitch.

1775
02:04:40,314 --> 02:04:42,191
Of all things in a game...

1776
02:04:43,734 --> 02:04:45,069
Take this off, too?

1777
02:04:48,947 --> 02:04:49,782
Let's roll.

1778
02:04:59,249 --> 02:04:59,917
<i>7</i> points.

1779
02:05:00,501 --> 02:05:01,210
8 points.

1780
02:05:01,376 --> 02:05:02,169
8 points.

1781
02:05:02,836 --> 02:05:05,005
8 pair.

1782
02:05:05,005 --> 02:05:06,840
Shit!

1783
02:05:15,432 --> 02:05:16,058
US$5,000

1784
02:05:16,058 --> 02:05:17,059
Raise you $5,000.

1785
02:05:17,059 --> 02:05:17,893
Raise you $10,000.

1786
02:05:17,935 --> 02:05:19,937
-$20,000
-$30,000 more.

1787
02:05:19,937 --> 02:05:20,854
$100,000 total.

1788
02:05:31,115 --> 02:05:32,282
Check.

1789
02:05:33,951 --> 02:05:34,952
9 points.

1790
02:05:35,369 --> 02:05:36,912
3 pair.

1791
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,294
I fold.

1792
02:05:45,295 --> 02:05:46,588
Just us two left.

1793
02:05:48,298 --> 02:05:49,633
I bet $10,000.

1794
02:05:50,926 --> 02:05:51,969
Raise you $10,000 more.

1795
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:53,512
$50,000 more.

1796
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:54,972
US$100,000

1797
02:05:55,514 --> 02:05:56,557
US$400,000

1798
02:06:00,352 --> 02:06:02,771
How much will it take to see your cards?

1799
02:06:02,855 --> 02:06:04,898
Put in $400,000 more.

1800
02:06:08,152 --> 02:06:09,069
Take it.

1801
02:06:11,321 --> 02:06:12,114
6 points.

1802
02:06:12,114 --> 02:06:13,323
<i>7</i> points.

1803
02:06:13,824 --> 02:06:15,033
- 2 pair.
- 3 pair.

1804
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:16,910
- 1 pair.
- 10 pair.

1805
02:06:18,245 --> 02:06:21,415
That pig eats well.
Must be seeing the cards.

1806
02:06:24,042 --> 02:06:25,335
Change cards.

1807
02:06:25,752 --> 02:06:27,171
Open a new pack.

1808
02:06:29,506 --> 02:06:33,135
Stop smoking, my head kills.

1809
02:06:50,027 --> 02:06:51,987
What's a hustler?

1810
02:06:52,446 --> 02:06:58,243
He has eyes on hands, ears on eyes,
and a nose on ears!

1811
02:06:58,243 --> 02:07:00,829
I don't see anything. What markings?

1812
02:07:00,829 --> 02:07:05,000
A hustler's eyes are special.

1813
02:07:05,167 --> 02:07:08,629
Focus and you will see.

1814
02:07:20,474 --> 02:07:21,808
I'm out.

1815
02:07:28,523 --> 02:07:29,524
US$10,000

1816
02:07:30,692 --> 02:07:31,610
Agwi...

1817
02:07:31,735 --> 02:07:33,612
- 1 and 4 for 5 points.
- $20,000 more.

1818
02:07:34,154 --> 02:07:35,197
I'll see that.

1819
02:07:35,197 --> 02:07:37,199
JANG has a 3 pair.

1820
02:07:37,783 --> 02:07:38,492
And $100,000.

1821
02:07:39,409 --> 02:07:41,662
- $100,000 more.
- JANG wins.

1822
02:07:42,287 --> 02:07:43,038
$200,000 more.

1823
02:07:43,455 --> 02:07:44,289
$200,000 more.

1824
02:07:44,414 --> 02:07:46,208
$300,000 on top.

1825
02:07:46,959 --> 02:07:48,543
Pay it to see my cards.

1826
02:07:55,259 --> 02:07:56,343
Check.

1827
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:57,177
3 pair.

1828
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:02,891
4 pair.

1829
02:08:08,647 --> 02:08:09,690
Why?

1830
02:08:10,023 --> 02:08:11,316
Think I cheated?

1831
02:08:11,817 --> 02:08:12,776
No, sir.

1832
02:08:12,776 --> 02:08:14,653
Yeah, right.

1833
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:17,531
There's a price for cheating.

1834
02:08:33,046 --> 02:08:34,339
Watch carefully.

1835
02:08:34,506 --> 02:08:37,009
I'll show you a magic trick.

1836
02:08:38,552 --> 02:08:42,055
Crazy girl folded with 9 points, right?

1837
02:08:43,223 --> 02:08:46,059
You had 7 points.

1838
02:08:46,977 --> 02:08:49,229
It's like these cards are transparent.

1839
02:08:49,730 --> 02:08:51,815
And the self-called Bitch

1840
02:08:52,649 --> 02:08:53,734
5, 6 loser cards.

1841
02:08:55,986 --> 02:08:58,739
You brought some amusing cards.

1842
02:08:59,531 --> 02:09:00,782
Go out and wait.

1843
02:09:01,158 --> 02:09:02,826
It won't take long.

1844
02:09:04,953 --> 02:09:06,163
I didn't do it!

1845
02:09:06,330 --> 02:09:07,956
JANG gave them to me!

1846
02:09:07,956 --> 02:09:10,292
Bastard! You gave them to me!

1847
02:09:10,334 --> 02:09:12,836
Dae-gil! This! This!

1848
02:09:12,919 --> 02:09:14,296
You bastard!

1849
02:09:14,379 --> 02:09:17,424
You bastards! I'll kill you all!

1850
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:20,510
Son of a bitch!

1851
02:09:27,017 --> 02:09:28,810
Let's see your glasses.

1852
02:09:29,019 --> 02:09:31,730
If you wanna see, place a bet.

1853
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:33,940
What'll it take to see?

1854
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:40,322
An eye from you and Dae-gil each, sir.

1855
02:09:40,697 --> 02:09:42,949
Bastard! Dare make threats!

1856
02:09:50,999 --> 02:09:52,292
If I lose everything...

1857
02:09:52,793 --> 02:09:56,546
then cut my throat and
see. Not before then.

1858
02:09:57,381 --> 02:09:59,633
Looks like you know how to play.

1859
02:10:00,175 --> 02:10:02,719
Fine. We'll gamble it out.

1860
02:10:03,428 --> 02:10:04,971
If you're a true gambler...

1861
02:10:05,305 --> 02:10:07,391
cut his throat with your cards.

1862
02:10:11,019 --> 02:10:13,021
Turn up the boiler.

1863
02:10:14,314 --> 02:10:15,649
I'll chip in for gas.

1864
02:10:19,277 --> 02:10:21,029
Get rid of these cards.

1865
02:10:22,030 --> 02:10:24,658
Go bring the cards you boys play with.

1866
02:10:24,908 --> 02:10:25,992
And turn the boiler up.

1867
02:10:32,791 --> 02:10:33,792
6 points.

1868
02:10:33,792 --> 02:10:35,043
8 points.

1869
02:10:35,293 --> 02:10:36,336
5 pair.

1870
02:10:36,336 --> 02:10:37,629
9 pair.

1871
02:10:39,423 --> 02:10:40,757
- I fold.
- I fold.

1872
02:10:46,638 --> 02:10:47,806
US$5,000

1873
02:10:48,223 --> 02:10:49,182
I fold.

1874
02:10:49,307 --> 02:10:50,350
US$100

1875
02:10:50,767 --> 02:10:51,476
Take it.

1876
02:10:58,859 --> 02:10:59,484
1,000

1877
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:03,321
You followed GO

1878
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:04,614
SQ?

1879
02:11:05,782 --> 02:11:10,704
Did he say he shit his pants
when I cut off his hand?

1880
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:13,123
Huh!

1881
02:11:14,374 --> 02:11:15,709
Say that again?

1882
02:11:15,834 --> 02:11:18,628
Looks like a tiger followed around a mouse.

1883
02:11:19,087 --> 02:11:21,465
Wanna learn from a real pro?

1884
02:11:23,216 --> 02:11:25,218
Shut up and place your bet.

1885
02:11:27,053 --> 02:11:29,806
Sorry, not interested.

1886
02:11:30,682 --> 02:11:32,058
I fold.

1887
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:31,326
Light, please.

1888
02:12:36,456 --> 02:12:37,874
Aren't you betting?

1889
02:12:40,001 --> 02:12:42,671
Just saw the mouse's ass following him

1890
02:12:42,796 --> 02:12:43,421
What?

1891
02:12:43,421 --> 02:12:45,006
Filming porn here?

1892
02:12:45,298 --> 02:12:47,592
Why put your hand in her underwear?

1893
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:49,511
No, he didn't.

1894
02:12:49,511 --> 02:12:51,096
Stop!

1895
02:12:51,096 --> 02:12:51,930
You'll lose your hand!

1896
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:53,807
Shut up eunuch!

1897
02:12:53,807 --> 02:12:55,725
I heard you sneak the bottom card.

1898
02:12:56,309 --> 02:12:57,519
Open your hands.

1899
02:12:57,519 --> 02:12:58,770
Why should I listen to you?

1900
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:01,022
We can cut off his hand and see.

1901
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:03,775
See?

1902
02:13:04,526 --> 02:13:05,360
There.

1903
02:13:05,944 --> 02:13:06,778
Happy?

1904
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:08,405
Like hell!

1905
02:13:10,699 --> 02:13:12,951
Don't move or you'll lose your hands.

1906
02:13:14,744 --> 02:13:17,080
You probably gave me a 9 pair.

1907
02:13:18,123 --> 02:13:19,666
JANG?

1908
02:13:20,333 --> 02:13:21,418
An 8 pair.

1909
02:13:21,418 --> 02:13:23,587
You were going to win with a 10 pair?

1910
02:13:24,045 --> 02:13:25,964
Think you can play me for a fool?

1911
02:13:25,964 --> 02:13:28,216
You must be drunk.

1912
02:13:29,718 --> 02:13:30,885
Place your bets.

1913
02:13:30,885 --> 02:13:32,762
$1,000 to start.

1914
02:13:32,929 --> 02:13:34,055
I'll raise that.

1915
02:13:34,347 --> 02:13:37,809
I bet my head and money
that you have a 10 pair.

1916
02:13:38,685 --> 02:13:42,647
I bet my head and money
there's a card in her panty.

1917
02:13:44,608 --> 02:13:47,819
Show your ass and take it all if you can.

1918
02:13:48,236 --> 02:13:49,738
What will you bet?

1919
02:13:49,738 --> 02:13:51,072
What if I won't?

1920
02:13:52,991 --> 02:13:55,660
Then die, fool!

1921
02:13:57,787 --> 02:14:00,206
You'll regret this!

1922
02:14:27,984 --> 02:14:28,693
Open it.

1923
02:14:30,070 --> 02:14:30,862
Wait!

1924
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:34,658
My mentor told me something.

1925
02:14:34,699 --> 02:14:35,575
What?

1926
02:14:35,825 --> 02:14:38,953
That you lost your hand
to PYUNG's disciple.

1927
02:14:52,175 --> 02:14:54,511
How do you know Goni?

1928
02:14:56,721 --> 02:14:58,431
You know my uncle?

1929
02:15:03,812 --> 02:15:04,729
Open it.

1930
02:15:14,614 --> 02:15:15,657
It's 1 point.

1931
02:15:18,702 --> 02:15:21,329
Sometimes 1 point can beat a 10 pair.

1932
02:15:21,663 --> 02:15:23,707
The old man is dead.

1933
02:15:24,874 --> 02:15:27,252
Know what'll happen if you make her strip?

1934
02:15:31,589 --> 02:15:32,799
Strip.

1935
02:15:43,393 --> 02:15:45,228
A $10 million strip show, huh

1936
02:15:47,856 --> 02:15:49,607
My backside is a killer.

1937
02:16:08,543 --> 02:16:10,211
The pig is dead, too.

1938
02:16:13,006 --> 02:16:13,965
Game over.

1939
02:16:14,382 --> 02:16:16,217
Pack up the money.

1940
02:16:36,571 --> 02:16:37,530
Ghost.

1941
02:16:37,947 --> 02:16:38,948
Yes

1942
02:16:39,115 --> 02:16:40,074
The hell

1943
02:16:40,283 --> 02:16:42,827
I'll give you all my money, if you shoot!

1944
02:16:43,119 --> 02:16:45,705
Crazy pig! Don't give me orders!

1945
02:16:45,914 --> 02:16:48,958
I'll do it! You bastard!

1946
02:16:50,502 --> 02:16:51,461
What now, Uncle?

1947
02:16:51,461 --> 02:16:52,712
Don't. They won.

1948
02:16:53,254 --> 02:16:54,839
Take all the money.

1949
02:16:55,131 --> 02:16:57,842
But your uncle owes me.

1950
02:16:58,176 --> 02:17:00,595
His nephew will have to pay.

1951
02:17:00,678 --> 02:17:01,596
Blow his hand.

1952
02:17:02,305 --> 02:17:04,349
Agwi has lost his taste.

1953
02:17:04,432 --> 02:17:05,183
<i>Shoot!</i>

1954
02:17:17,570 --> 02:17:19,697
Son of a bitch!

1955
02:17:41,469 --> 02:17:42,804
Gwang-chul...

1956
02:18:13,918 --> 02:18:15,420
Asshole.

1957
02:18:17,672 --> 02:18:19,632
You're not worth it.

1958
02:18:24,512 --> 02:18:28,474
You can't kill me, bastards!

1959
02:19:12,143 --> 02:19:13,853
Shit!

1960
02:19:14,395 --> 02:19:16,773
You bastards!

1961
02:19:36,876 --> 02:19:38,002
Bro!

1962
02:19:42,882 --> 02:19:43,675
Gwang-chul!

1963
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:51,099
What are you doing?

1964
02:19:51,557 --> 02:19:54,352
This is mine! I'm taking it all!

1965
02:19:54,519 --> 02:19:56,229
Stay back!

1966
02:20:15,498 --> 02:20:16,749
Bro!

1967
02:20:24,132 --> 02:20:25,258
Gwang-chul!

1968
02:20:38,229 --> 02:20:39,439
The body of a man

1969
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:40,940
"32 YEAR OLD MAN'S BODY FOUND"

1970
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:42,692
who flung millions 10
days ago has been found.

1971
02:20:42,692 --> 02:20:45,570
Found in the remote mountains...

1972
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:48,406
police identified the
man as HUH Gwang-chul.

1973
02:20:48,406 --> 02:20:51,325
He died of a gunshot wound.

1974
02:20:57,415 --> 02:20:58,750
Have some soup.

1975
02:21:02,503 --> 02:21:03,671
Back then...

1976
02:21:04,464 --> 02:21:05,173
What?

1977
02:21:05,673 --> 02:21:06,924
That extra card...

1978
02:21:10,887 --> 02:21:12,597
Where'd you hide it?

1979
02:21:17,977 --> 02:21:19,228
I ate it.

1980
02:21:25,193 --> 02:21:26,402
Here.

1981
02:21:31,616 --> 02:21:34,577
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

1982
02:21:42,752 --> 02:21:44,754
My dear sister, Mina.

1983
02:21:44,754 --> 02:21:48,341
A letter Gwang-chul
wrote before he died came.

1984
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:51,260
I'm sorry for leaving you like this.

1985
02:21:52,345 --> 02:21:57,350
Here's a map to a small gift for you.

1986
02:21:59,644 --> 02:22:05,817
It should be enough for you two
to make a fresh start.

1987
02:22:07,902 --> 02:22:15,326
He wrote how he did
everything to protect us.

1988
02:22:18,871 --> 02:22:21,207
It explained how he died.

1989
02:22:49,402 --> 02:22:55,992
As I left home for Seoul,
I suddenly had a thought...

1990
02:22:58,327 --> 02:23:00,454
Could I ever give up gambling?

1991
02:23:04,625 --> 02:23:06,419
Ever heard of the Hands of God?
