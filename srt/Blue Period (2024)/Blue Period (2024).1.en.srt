1
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,987
We are about to arrive at Shibuya.
The last stop.

2
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:33,534
Transfer here for the JR Line,
Tokyu Line, and subway lines.

3
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,229
Sorry!

4
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,648
We'll miss the game.

5
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,192
Where are you?

6
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,110
Near the escalator.

7
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,571
He's here?
For real?

8
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,491
Where?

9
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,909
There! There!

10
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,660
Yatora! Yatora!

11
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,456
Hey, hurry!

12
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,458
You're late! Run!

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,628
- We'll be late!
- 'Cause of Yatora!

14
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,882
Move! Move!

15
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,615
Cut it out.

16
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,034
I can't eat it.

17
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,539
You're going to school?

18
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,416
I need to up my attendance.

19
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:05,668
You're tireless.

20
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,211
I admire you, man.

21
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,674
Ramen's best to finish off the night.

22
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,092
So true.

23
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,095
He's eating it.

24
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,431
See ya.

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,933
Later.

26
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,434
Thank you!

27
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,539
Next. Equation 2.

28
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,166
When descent is constant,

29
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,043
what is V as velocity?

30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,547
Yatora.

31
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,843
Terminal velocity?

32
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,744
Correct.

33
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,747
"Student report card:
4th out of 183"

34
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,747
That's your rank?

35
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,206
Some friend you are.

36
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,334
You have time to study?!

37
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,586
A lock for Keio and Waseda.

38
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,339
Nah, no private university for me.

39
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,092
What about you, Koi?

40
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,386
No plans at all. You?

41
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,015
I'll... go to
whatever school accepts me.

42
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,645
Smooch smooch!

43
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,901
Knock it off.

44
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:06,372
Getting good grades
is just like hanging with friends.

45
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,124
I do what I have to do.

46
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,670
I do that,
and get results.

47
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,299
But why does it feel so unsatisfying?

48
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,929
Off to Shibuya again?

49
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,098
Another all-nighter.

50
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,641
Ramen, then home.

51
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,601
Not home. No way.

52
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,103
Why?

53
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,562
Come on...

54
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,480
Not home.

55
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,481
Lay off!

56
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,983
Ayukawa, stop!

57
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:34,942
Move!

58
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,617
Enough of that.
Look at yourself!

59
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,036
Obey school rules!

60
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,377
I obey my own rules.

61
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,839
Teacher's room. Come later.

62
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,346
You never stop, dude.

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,348
You never stop...

64
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,935
...trying to please everybody.

65
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,359
Yuka!

66
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,322
You okay?

67
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,534
Yeah. I'm okay.

68
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:30,539
Ryuji, a skirt today?
You look so cute!

69
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,498
I know.

70
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,168
Why "Yuka"?

71
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,003
Last name's A-yuka-wa.

72
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,088
He been that way long?

73
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:39,715
Beats me.

74
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,508
He's weird.

75
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,594
He sure is.

76
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,354
Stayed at a friend's again?

77
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,689
Yeah.

78
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,694
Your father and I have to work,
so stay home.

79
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,324
Thanks.

80
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,162
Here. Take care.

81
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,997
Thanks. I'm off.

82
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,665
Take care.

83
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,923
Night shift again?

84
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,926
He says it pays better.

85
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,513
I keep telling him,

86
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:33,477
"Cleaning work's fine, but switch jobs
before it ruins you."

87
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,898
After all,
he used to run a company.

88
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,903
Thanks.

89
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,284
Yatora.

90
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,247
Yatora.

91
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,167
Having fun's fine,

92
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,255
but we can only afford
a public university.

93
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,590
Trust me already.

94
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,760
Don't worry.
I'm on it.

95
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,660
"My favorite sights"

96
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,539
"My favorite sights"?
What are we, little kids?

97
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:41,044
Students who take elective art
are slackers or nerds.

98
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,462
So true.

99
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,180
Well, Saeki gives good grades.

100
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,851
Yatora! Gimme a cig!

101
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,991
My favorite sight's
my girl's tits on my face!

102
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,662
If you paint that,
Saeki'll die of shock!

103
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,957
What a great idea.

104
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,254
Does your girlfriend
have a large chest?

105
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,552
Largeness,

106
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,723
and softness would be
wonderful to depict.

107
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,975
It sure would.

108
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,483
Holy shit!

109
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,200
Saeki sure is out of her mind.

110
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,409
Sure is.

111
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,745
Damn, I need a smoke.

112
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,664
Let's go smoke.

113
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,382
"Japanese-style painting"

114
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,522
Mind not touching it?

115
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,154
Want to join art club?

116
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,407
Didn't think so.

117
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,330
Is this...

118
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,832
...what you came for?

119
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,634
You only smoke because
your friends do.

120
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,055
It's crumpled,
but still full.

121
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,350
Stop trying to be like them.

122
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,436
Watching you is upsetting.

123
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,608
Watching you is upsetting.

124
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,318
That getup.

125
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,530
Anyway, why "Yuka"?
Your name's Ryuji.

126
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,995
Scared that I know you so well?

127
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,754
Club's about to start.
Get out.

128
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,549
Club, huh.

129
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,759
Who's that?

130
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,469
What is it?

131
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,890
You want to go to art college?

132
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,601
A pointless waste of time?

133
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,854
How dare you.

134
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,067
- Look here...
- Now now.

135
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,365
Yatora, you're very knowledgeable.

136
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,370
Even so,
art college is pointless?

137
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,205
Is that...

138
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,834
...your own opinion?

139
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,211
Or perhaps...

140
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,466
...someone else's opinion?

141
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,223
Rather than what most people think,

142
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,269
I want to know what you think
is worthwhile.

143
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,983
Art is fascinating.

144
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:18,196
Being true to yourself
makes it all the more powerful.

145
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,408
A non-verbal language.

146
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,998
Hey, about your assignment.

147
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:32,043
"My favorite sights."
You haven't started yet.

148
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,090
Show me the sights
that move you, Yatora.

149
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,733
What a load of bull.

150
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,528
What I think is worthwhile?

151
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,531
What moves me?

152
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,831
Is this...

153
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,626
...what moves me?

154
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,013
Oh crap! Oh crap!

155
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,022
Disgusting!

156
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,483
Water, water!

157
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,302
This painting...

158
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,600
Yeah, I'm still working on it.

159
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,270
It's for my art college exam.

160
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,231
Gotta finish it by autumn.

161
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,066
You're a senior?

162
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,153
I am.

163
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,864
You were with Ryuji, so...

164
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,326
We're both in art club.

165
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,500
When I look at this,

166
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,545
it kinda puts me at ease.

167
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,633
Oh. Glad to hear it.

168
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,554
Know how art began?

169
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,099
One of many theories says
it was a prayer.

170
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,143
What I think is,

171
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,606
I want people who see my artworks
to be happy,

172
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,233
so I pray as I make them.

173
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,237
You're really something.

174
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,782
I envy your talent.

175
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,533
I've got no talent.

176
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:54,037
I just think more about art
than others do.

177
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,998
Also, I appreciate your praise,

178
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,378
but art requires study too,
so talent's not everything.

179
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,463
Sorry.

180
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,423
You're right.

181
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,134
Sorry. I got worked up.

182
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,971
Nah, nah. Why's this angel
on the left green?

183
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,350
You're perceptive.

184
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,980
A classical technique,
using "green earth" paint,

185
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,693
with vermillion red
and silver-white on top,

186
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,696
which make beautiful-looking skin.

187
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,951
Sorry.

188
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,412
You wouldn't get it.

189
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,290
Well...

190
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,133
Early morning Shibuya streets...

191
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,844
...are...

192
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,763
...peaceful,

193
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,515
and blue.

194
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,229
Forget it.

195
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,897
That sounded weird.

196
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,574
You must love that blue world.

197
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,829
Huh?

198
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,541
Ms. Saeki said this to me once.

199
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:27,505
"If it looks blue to you,
apples and rabbits can be blue too."

200
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,609
I gotta paint something.

201
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,278
For the assignment.

202
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,909
Then let's paint together.

203
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,695
How can I paint that...

204
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,875
The air seemingly sleepy...

205
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,673
The light somewhat bright...

206
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,806
Yet peaceful...

207
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,978
Unlike the real Shibuya...

208
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,112
Like the beginning of a new day...

209
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,325
Like the beginning of a new dream...

210
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,369
A world of blue.

211
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,250
Yatora, yours is so blue.

212
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,710
So blue.

213
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,172
What is it? Ice?

214
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,965
Not the sky?

215
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,842
Oh, ice?

216
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,264
This is pretty.

217
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,099
Yeah, it is.

218
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,103
Not just blue,
other colors too.

219
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,689
Whose is it?

220
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,487
Wish I hadn't praised it.

221
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,239
Yatora! You got praised!

222
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,824
That's so cool!

223
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,493
Oh.

224
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,955
Could that painting be of Shibuya?

225
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,878
The morning!

226
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,172
After an all-nighter!

227
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,300
That's how it looks to you, Yatora?

228
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,636
It's so cool!

229
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,184
This part here.
Shibuya buildings.

230
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,394
Really pretty.

231
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,396
I know that. The new...

232
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,064
The new building!

233
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,567
Totally different colors.
Each one.

234
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,488
So cool...

235
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,365
Hey Yatora.

236
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,662
What's with that look?

237
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,415
What?!

238
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,042
What?! Are you crying?!

239
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,794
Right then,

240
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,213
for the first time ever,

241
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,466
I felt like I was communicating.

242
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:46,305
Marking the direction of gravity
on this chart

243
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:51,894
will show you that
the direction of force is different.

244
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,313
You see, don't you?

245
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,149
You follow me?

246
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,317
So, Exercise 1.

247
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,613
Shirai, try to solve it.

248
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,155
Yatora.

249
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,368
What've you been doing in class?

250
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,790
I saw you scribbling something.

251
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,416
Oh, well...

252
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,295
Lately...

253
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,883
I like... drawing...

254
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,469
No slacking till exams are over.

255
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,515
Drawing should stay a hobby.

256
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:31,077
He's right.
It should stay a hobby.

257
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,455
It'd be different if I had talent.

258
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:41,546
But if art really isn't
only about talent...

259
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,118
"art college fees expensive"

260
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,748
"6-8 million yen for 4 years,
more than regular colleges"

261
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,508
Yatora.

262
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,385
Ms. Saeki.

263
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,765
Hey...

264
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,063
If art might not pay the bills,

265
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,775
what's good about art college?

266
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:52,241
It's true that art
rarely pays your bills.

267
00:24:54,493 --> 00:25:00,541
But at art college, your work will
have more chances to be seen,

268
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,337
and you'll see the
work and creative processes

269
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,672
of people your own age.

270
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:14,764
There are plenty of resources
and equipment there,

271
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,184
and many techniques to learn.

272
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,562
But, I could always study art
as a hobby...

273
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,067
"Keep what you love as a hobby."

274
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,195
It's an adult way of looking at it.

275
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,074
If you love something,

276
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,911
you give it the most priority
in your life.

277
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:41,249
Wouldn't you say that makes sense?

278
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,134
Should what you love,

279
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,972
or enjoy,
be your life's focus?

280
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,975
Also,

281
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,853
my family can't afford art college...

282
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:09,735
There are public art colleges too.

283
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,363
Tokyo University of the Arts.

284
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,491
TUA's yearly fees

285
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,453
are the same as
other public universities.

286
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,708
Incidentally,
TUA's painting department

287
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,919
is the hardest one to get into
in Japan.

288
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,464
200 times more applicants than places.

289
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,092
Only five get in per year.

290
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,720
Many try three or four times.

291
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,516
In a way,
it's more elite than Tokyo University.

292
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,810
I guess that's right.

293
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,066
Do you think...

294
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,195
...it's still not too late?

295
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,491
I don't know.

296
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,078
Then again,

297
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,081
of all the students I've seen,

298
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:08,878
those who couldn't stick it out
didn't love doing it.

299
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,339
In other words,

300
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,925
hard workers who love what they do...

301
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,553
...have the best chance.

302
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,768
Until now,
I'd never felt truly alive.

303
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,687
Until that blue painting.

304
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,567
My heart...

305
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,153
...is finally beating.

306
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:41,202
Days until TUA entrance exam: 620

307
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:09,647
Form. Space.

308
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,899
Texture. Grasp it all.

309
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,194
Sensing the direction of light,

310
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,988
and adding shadow.

311
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,744
Summer assignment's taking forever.

312
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,747
Our art club's so hardcore.

313
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,836
What a shock...

314
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,004
He's for real.

315
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,498
"Yatora Yaguchi"

316
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,717
Yatora, hurry!

317
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,178
Yatora, doughnuts!

318
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,889
Oh wow! Which one?

319
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,349
Here goes.

320
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,352
First is rock!
Rock paper scissors!

321
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,230
One more round!

322
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,941
One more round!

323
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,359
I win!

324
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,222
I got in.

325
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,058
Way to go!

326
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:23,405
Days until TUA entrance exam: 320

327
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:33,040
"Tokyo Art Prep School guide"

328
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,797
Hey Dad.

329
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,507
Hey, you're early.

330
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,884
Can we have a talk?

331
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,221
Don't let Mom know though.

332
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,267
Sure, okay.

333
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,158
Yatora?

334
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,868
Mori.

335
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,752
I came for my things.

336
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,797
You're graduating.

337
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,466
You'll be missed.

338
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,803
Still, I'm a little excited.

339
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:33,350
When I'm a university student,
I'll only have to think about art.

340
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,436
You'll go to Musabi?

341
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,646
That's really impressive.

342
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,615
Hey Yatora.

343
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,744
I'd like to ask a favor.

344
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,710
This is so nice.

345
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,838
A cute junior's graduation gift.

346
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,299
Don't pressure me.

347
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,846
I really liked...

348
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,931
...your painting.

349
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:19,897
Well, I probably wouldn't have
done it without you.

350
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:21,565
Wow.

351
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,485
That's so nice.

352
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,407
You know,

353
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,577
I can only paint what I want to,

354
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,289
so for my exam,
I brought in a painting.

355
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,167
In other words,

356
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,671
I doubted I'd get in
via a regular exam.

357
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,048
But you,

358
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,177
you work unbelievably hard, so...

359
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,518
You might have a chance.

360
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,128
I'll do my best.
To get in.

361
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,682
Wanna go?

362
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,438
Oh, Sumida.
I bought that game.

363
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,732
For real? That game?

364
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,276
- My place then?
- Yeah!

365
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,987
Koi?

366
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,072
- Coming?
- Yeah.

367
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,034
Koi, he bought it!
Cool, huh?

368
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,578
Let's all play it.

369
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,431
Going alone would be lonely.

370
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,141
Japanese painting starts?

371
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:19,892
Yeah.

372
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,686
Look. How's my outfit?

373
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,354
You made it?

374
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,151
Oh, Sasaki...

375
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:45,292
You're going for it.
So you do have passion.

376
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,128
2nd floor for me. Bye!

377
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,473
"Tokyo Art Prep School"

378
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:13,612
Oil painting course

379
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,824
Over here.
This seat's free.

380
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,631
You weren't at the winter session.

381
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,517
Hey there!

382
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,856
I'm in charge of night classes
in oil painting.

383
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,359
I'm your teacher, Ooba.
Nice to meet ya.

384
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,655
This is a place to
really hone your abilities.

385
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:01,451
Let's think about
necessary technical skills and talent,

386
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,539
and the kind of artworks
art colleges rate highly.

387
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,084
Okay, let me see what you can do.

388
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,753
Try sketching a plaster bust.

389
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,189
Assessment's on Thursday.

390
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,692
Any questions?
Ask away.

391
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,948
Um...

392
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,202
So I should sketch what I see?

393
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:45,579
That's right.

394
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,082
Yotasuke...

395
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,211
From my high school.

396
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:57,090
Top class results
in his academic year,

397
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,051
but aims for art college

398
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,428
without knowing sketching?

399
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,232
Hey, feel free to use this.

400
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,819
Who the hell are you?

401
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,865
Let's see...

402
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,325
Takahashi?

403
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,663
If you need tools,
use the loaner ones.

404
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,331
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

405
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,615
I couldn't capture the form well.

406
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,966
That one's damn good.

407
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,471
The younger Kuwana sister?

408
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:31,226
Her older sister was TUA's
top entrant last year.

409
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,079
It's so good...

410
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,456
Takahashi?

411
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,042
Accurate form and shadow.

412
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,794
No further comment necessary.

413
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,840
Sketched many plaster busts?

414
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,633
It's my first time.

415
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,511
First time? Whoa...

416
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,543
He deserves to be called a genius.

417
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,045
Huh?

418
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:48,553
I... thought I'd gotten pretty good,

419
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,973
but I'm just mediocre.

420
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,852
No comparison to him.

421
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:05,654
Humans don't compare themselves
to unreachable gods, do they?

422
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:08,990
Huh?

423
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,160
From your perspective,
Mori is

424
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,287
a goddess, isn't she?

425
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:18,333
So, you only think of praising her.

426
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,212
On the other hand,

427
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,923
when it comes to Takahashi...

428
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,805
If you feel inferior,
you can keep fighting.

429
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,533
He's probably a genius.

430
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,413
I'm definitely a mediocrity.

431
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,207
Genius is beyond me.

432
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,877
I only improve through work.

433
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,715
So I need to work
till I'm genius level.

434
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,984
As you are now,
no TUA for you.

435
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,862
Your art is,

436
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:33,575
put harshly, only depicting
what's in front of you.

437
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:37,871
TUA values vision,
individuality, and outlook

438
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,332
more than any other college.

439
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,627
You won't get in on skill alone.

440
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:47,088
The most important attribute is

441
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,174
creating your own art.

442
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,178
Find your own answer.

443
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,767
Seeing many paintings might help.

444
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:33,093
"Keeping the human eye's
unstable physicality in mind,

445
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,763
I used oils to depict
unstable scenery."

446
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,656
My own art...

447
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,870
My own answer...

448
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,886
You only skimmed the surface.

449
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,104
Inspired by Tamana Moteki's work?

450
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,773
You imitated it superficially.

451
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,902
You're blind to its essence.

452
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,906
Hey,

453
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,534
that's kinda uncalled for.

454
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,745
I'm doing my best here.

455
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:16,571
Days until TUA entrance exam: 290

456
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,876
- Hey, wait.
- Leave me.

457
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,629
- Why're you mad?
- Leave me.

458
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,758
Just go away!

459
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:44,099
What?

460
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,103
It's you who's abnormal.

461
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,692
I hate you!

462
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:03,618
See ya.

463
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,704
I wish it had rained today.

464
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,418
Breaking up on a sunny day

465
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,171
is more painful than anything.

466
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,301
Nothing's going right.

467
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,481
Am I so abnormal?

468
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:23,907
If I want to be...

469
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,661
...cute, and pretty, and...

470
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,915
If I...

471
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,085
...have feelings for a man...

472
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,422
...what's abnormal about that?

473
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,973
If I have to conform to
what's "normal,"

474
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,602
I'd rather die.

475
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,113
Only what I love...

476
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,327
...will protect me, won't it?

477
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,757
For what it's worth...

478
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,973
...I really admire you.

479
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:38,106
I don't even know what I love, at all.

480
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:19,188
Man, it's so hot!
AC temperature okay?

481
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:20,398
Yeah!

482
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:25,695
During summer break,
you'll do various assignments.

483
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,697
Hand these out.

484
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:32,327
Your final freeform artworks
will be ranked.

485
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,122
"Theme: connections"

486
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,790
"Connections"...

487
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,835
A conceptual theme.

488
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,963
Well, that's art college for you.

489
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:47,175
We base it on our imagination?

490
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:51,763
I've only ever depicted
what I can see.

491
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:03,066
Okay, next is Yatora's painting.

492
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,611
Connections equal threads.

493
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,780
A little clichéd.

494
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,912
In your mind, are connections
really shaped like threads?

495
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,793
Okay, next is Ando's painting.

496
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,780
"Oil Painting Department"

497
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,044
That class is for repeat students?

498
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,838
It's pretty extreme.

499
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:12,176
Slashing canvases? That's nuts.
More than I imagined.

500
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,936
Still, that's a
kind of innovation, no?

501
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,273
Paints and oils aren't everything.

502
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:33,114
You're blind to its essence.

503
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,715
Hey, Yatora.

504
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,969
All you do is work on art lately,

505
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:57,472
but are you studying?

506
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,392
I'll be fine.

507
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,815
Having a hobby's good, but...

508
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,401
How about after your exams?

509
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,907
Thanks. I'm going.

510
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,451
Take care!

511
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,920
Musabi is further than I thought.

512
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,006
Why ask me to join you?

513
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,549
The other day,

514
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,554
Mori came to the club
with flyers for her exhibition.

515
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,683
You haven't shown up
at the club at all lately.

516
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,521
She was disappointed
you weren't there.

517
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,107
Oh...

518
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,780
Her exhibition,

519
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,159
it's in building 4,
classroom 203.

520
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:01,786
Go by yourself.

521
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:03,996
You're not coming?

522
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:09,710
I just didn't want to stay at home.

523
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,630
I fought with my parents.

524
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,342
What'd they say?

525
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,887
Never mind.
Go on.

526
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,287
It's not an angel.

527
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,831
Even so,

528
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:32,001
I know for sure it's Mori's.

529
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,633
What I think is,

530
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:42,970
I want people who see my artworks
to be happy,

531
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,723
so I pray as I make them.

532
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:51,228
This is another of Mori's prayers.

533
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:06,202
With a different touch,
but still a prayer.

534
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,084
Its essence hasn't changed at all.

535
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:43,406
"As always,
I love your art. Yatora"

536
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,161
What if I reconsidered...

537
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,957
...the essence of "connections"?

538
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:04,301
In your mind, are connections
really shaped like threads?

539
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,406
In my mind, connections

540
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,867
take many forms.

541
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,935
Some are delicate like threads...

542
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,857
...and some can cut me like blades.

543
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,286
Different connections...

544
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,998
...bring change to my form.

545
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:22,171
Strengthening me with each blow.

546
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,761
In my mind, connections...

547
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:33,432
...might be something akin to metal.

548
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:49,175
Yatora got... fifth place!

549
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,513
You're higher than me.

550
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,933
Sakuraba, you?

551
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,018
Second.

552
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,399
Wow! This is so cool!

553
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,903
And in first place...

554
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:14,408
Yatora.

555
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,161
This is your score.

556
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,746
Thanks.

557
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,999
Low, but your technique's improving,

558
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:26,587
it's creative, and most of all,
thought-provoking.

559
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,005
Thank you.

560
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:31,091
Seems you found your answer.

561
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,100
Yotasuke is 19th?

562
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:46,482
His work's so unique,
it must've been hard to grade.

563
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,342
You're leaving?

564
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:17,638
I'll... never come here again.

565
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:21,100
All these stupid assignments...

566
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:25,312
Wait up! Wait!

567
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:27,356
Let go of me!

568
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:30,192
You're only good at adapting.

569
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,361
Energy and strategy, huh?!

570
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,447
You're good at quantity,
not quality.

571
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:46,375
I can't stand you, Yatora.

572
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:50,170
There's nothing you need here.

573
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,007
You didn't have to choose art.

574
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,682
What the hell?

575
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:09,356
I didn't have to choose art?

576
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:14,278
I'm risking everything!
It's all I've got!

577
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,906
My art'll blow everybody else away.

578
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,326
I'll get into college.

579
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,911
For damn sure I will!

580
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,250
But...

581
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,137
Will I really get in?

582
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,060
"Admission application"

583
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:49,772
"Painting department,
oil painting major"

584
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:59,490
Days until TUA entrance exam: 183

585
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,158
Yatora?

586
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,786
I'm coming in.

587
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:29,186
What are you doing?

588
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,773
Applying to art college?

589
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,319
TUA.

590
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,655
TUA?!

591
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,494
It's public, so fees are...

592
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:49,665
Why do you want to go?

593
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,793
And will you get in?

594
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,464
Listen.

595
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,718
You'd have to give up on
other public universities.

596
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,596
What about your future?

597
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,474
You won't make a living.

598
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,313
Please, Yatora.

599
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,108
I want you to

600
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,194
go somewhere more useful.

601
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,073
So you won't face hardship.

602
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,203
Understand?

603
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,884
I just...
wanted to fill in the form.

604
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,304
I'll apply somewhere useful.

605
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:36,188
Yatora.

606
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,326
Come hang with me.

607
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,454
Sorry, not today...

608
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,998
Yeah you can. Come on.

609
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:06,885
Here it is.
Your tropical fruit tart.

610
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,221
Your seasonal fruit tart.

611
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,431
Enjoy.

612
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,936
The tarts here are great.

613
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:19,982
Sorry I'm too busy lately.

614
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,401
Studying art must be tough.

615
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,945
Well, kinda.

616
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,615
Maybe art college isn't for me.

617
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,910
Don't laugh.

618
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,372
When you laugh like that,

619
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:39,209
it's like building a wall,
to block me out.

620
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:46,800
You work so hard
out of lack of confidence?

621
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,060
You see right through me.

622
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,984
I want to do what I love,

623
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:07,279
so I chose art college.

624
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,116
But...

625
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:22,794
I wonder, am I up to it?

626
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:29,051
So, when my mom said no,
I said nothing.

627
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:33,722
I'll...

628
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:38,644
...go to a school for pastry chefs.

629
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,941
Me making desserts.
Funny, right?

630
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,282
But hey,

631
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,619
because you...

632
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,706
...chose what you want to do,

633
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:04,127
it made me want to do the same.

634
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,300
You always partied till morning,

635
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:14,680
and I thought you'd keep cruising
just above average.

636
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,643
When you chose to pursue art,

637
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:21,311
I got chills.

638
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,148
You chose out of determination.

639
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,449
I want to see your art again.

640
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:00,851
It's damn good!

641
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,106
Damn good.

642
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:05,707
Hey.

643
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,959
You came home.

644
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,053
Is that me?

645
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,488
Your hands.

646
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:42,410
Chapped from washing dishes.

647
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,999
Maybe carrying heavy groceries

648
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,419
made your arms so wiry.

649
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:58,009
Your clothes.

650
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,973
You've been wearing them for years.

651
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,142
They're so frayed.

652
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:21,366
My art made me realize that.

653
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,333
Mom...

654
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:36,256
Sorry I'm not your ideal son.

655
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:48,226
But I still want to go to TUA.

656
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,188
Maybe I'm talentless.

657
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,360
Even so, I...

658
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,032
...love making art.

659
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,330
I can lose myself in it.

660
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,542
I want to get so much better.

661
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,003
I want to see so much more.

662
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,675
So I really need to go to TUA.

663
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,633
Thanks for this.

664
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,475
Have your dinner.

665
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:29,869
Days until TUA entrance exam: 52

666
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,046
Sorry I'm late!

667
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,798
Hey, Yatora.

668
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,508
What's that?!

669
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,801
Stuff I painted.

670
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,804
All of it, over the break?

671
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:49,431
So much?

672
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,891
You really mean business.

673
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:55,270
How'd you create that rough texture?

674
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:57,689
Mom's dressmaker's pencils.

675
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,567
New materials broaden expression.

676
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:03,653
I was limiting my own art myself.

677
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,657
Only prolific artists figure that out.

678
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:12,579
A month and a half.
For better or worse, this all ends.

679
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,581
Make the most of it.

680
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:16,708
I will.

681
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,763
It burns! It burns!

682
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:32,474
It burns?

683
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,773
Perfect.

684
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:43,818
The primary entrance exam takes a day.

685
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:46,029
Secondary exam, three days.

686
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:49,074
Build your stamina,
or you won't last.

687
01:12:56,998 --> 01:13:01,419
Better rough sketches
make better oil paintings, okay?

688
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:19,896
Shading skills can be learned,

689
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,524
but your lines are your emotions.

690
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,915
Don't try to come in first.

691
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,168
Try to make the best art you can!

692
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:59,144
In these few months,

693
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:03,648
you've confronted
your own strengths and weaknesses,

694
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,234
and continued to create.

695
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,071
I guarantee you'll benefit from that.

696
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:14,242
Tomorrow, enjoy the hell out of it!

697
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,543
Here. A good luck charm.

698
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,382
I've been thinking.

699
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:15,720
I don't know how hard it is
to make art,

700
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:19,307
but I'm sure today will be tough.

701
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:22,727
So...

702
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,605
This might annoy you, but...

703
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,899
Have fun!

704
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:29,275
Yatora!

705
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:35,281
"Tokyo University of the Arts"

706
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,797
Ryuji.

707
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,670
Long time no see.

708
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,297
Long time.

709
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,092
So many people.

710
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:40,346
Thinking about the pass rate
drives me crazy.

711
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,726
Whatever.
I'm going to pass.

712
01:16:53,818 --> 01:17:01,117
Oil painting major: primary exam

713
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:43,910
Okay. TUA oil painting major
applicants,

714
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:47,455
this is the theme for
your primary exam.

715
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,967
The allowed time is five hours.

716
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:03,471
Starting at 9 a.m.,
ending at 3 p.m.

717
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,557
Lunch break from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.

718
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:12,313
Japanese painting major: primary exam

719
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:20,571
Now, please begin.

720
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,993
"Theme: self-portrait"

721
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:35,169
A simple theme,
making it all the more difficult.

722
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,465
Got to stand out to survive.

723
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,553
So I need a strategy.

724
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,605
Myself inside the mirror,

725
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:57,024
and myself outside it.

726
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:02,155
Right now,
there are two sides to me.

727
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,076
A delinquent and a whiz kid.

728
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:11,414
An achiever and a coward.

729
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:16,002
A romanticist and a realist.

730
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,673
To convey that duality...

731
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,552
Crappy idea.
Too played out.

732
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,563
I'm sorry!

733
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:42,987
No way...

734
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,116
I'll bring another one.

735
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,327
Careful. Don't touch it.

736
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,162
You can go back.

737
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,372
I'm sorry...

738
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,426
Not duality...

739
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,637
Multiplicity.

740
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,521
Depicting multiple sides of me.

741
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,315
But how can I?

742
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,560
He passed! He passed!

743
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:22,104
Congratulations, Yatora!

744
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,439
Okay!

745
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:29,945
I won't take the exam again.

746
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,243
Thank you so much for everything.

747
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,537
Thank you.

748
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:55,221
Wow. That's a great idea.

749
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:58,891
Front to back,
you've used exaggerated depth.

750
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:02,520
The simple composition
emphasizes that.

751
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:08,734
Only us three passed the primary exam.

752
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,280
Oh, I hear Yotasuke passed too.

753
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:16,575
Why that look?

754
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,829
I mean,
I'm impressed, but...

755
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:22,498
By the way,

756
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:26,460
what about your friend?
Japanese painting.

757
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,713
Oh, Ryuji?

758
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:32,717
When the exam began,
he drew a cross and left.

759
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:57,032
"Yatora Yaguchi"

760
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:12,506
"Yatora Yaguchi"

761
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:25,561
What? Why keep calling?

762
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,775
Ryuji. Where are you now?

763
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,487
Gee, where could I be?

764
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,949
I heard about you.

765
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,160
What about me?

766
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,829
Your TUA primary exam.

767
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:51,837
I won't go to art college.

768
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:54,131
Huh?

769
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,553
If that's all,
I'll hang up.

770
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,432
Ryuji.

771
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:08,854
Remember you took me
to Mori's college?

772
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,023
For my sake.

773
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:13,484
I didn't do it for you.

774
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,361
Can I help somehow?

775
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,542
Can you come now?

776
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,295
To the seaside in Odawara.

777
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,299
Now...?

778
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:42,847
My secondary exam's in two days.

779
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:44,932
Of course it is.

780
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:47,017
If you

781
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:51,856
saw someone drowning,
you might bring rescue gear,

782
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:54,775
but you'd never jump in yourself.

783
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,363
You're cool-headed, you are.

784
01:25:59,572 --> 01:26:01,657
You're always right.

785
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,743
Even so...

786
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,876
If you always have to be right,

787
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:16,672
we've got
nothing more to talk about.

788
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:24,365
Ryuji!

789
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:42,216
You'll drown.

790
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,593
No I won't.

791
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:47,930
I won't. I'll swim.

792
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,208
You'll even draw here?

793
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,961
I'll get anxious if I don't.

794
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:01,795
You get undressed too.

795
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,635
Your good-boy clothes

796
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:12,097
seem thick and heavy though.

797
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,275
Have you ever...

798
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:26,862
...pictured yourself naked,

799
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,823
and drawn it?

800
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:45,339
Secondary exam: day 1

801
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:14,785
Yatora.

802
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:22,084
Sorry.

803
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:26,880
Yatora, you smell like the sea.

804
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:31,552
I went... with a friend...

805
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:33,137
Huh?!

806
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:36,723
How could you before the exam?
Unbelievable.

807
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,851
I totally agree.

808
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,897
Hey, what's wrong?
You okay?

809
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:45,858
Let's all go up.

810
01:30:46,108 --> 01:30:46,900
Give me that.

811
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,110
Thanks...

812
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,204
See a nurse if you gotta.

813
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,248
Sorry. Thanks.

814
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:08,547
"Oil painting
Yatora Yaguchi"

815
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,804
TUA oil painting major applicants,

816
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,724
this is your secondary exam.

817
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,768
Please begin.

818
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:11,318
"Theme: freely depict
the atelier and model together."

819
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:01,576
"Nakedness ="

820
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:12,379
Hey Ryuji.

821
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,758
Won't you tell me what happened?

822
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,687
Everything in my room

823
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,107
was thrown out by my father.

824
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:37,362
My clothes.
My accessories.

825
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:43,493
My makeup tools.
All of my favorite things.

826
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,253
He can never accept me.

827
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:58,717
Someone like me who doesn't fit in.

828
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:06,266
Ultimately, the things I love
couldn't protect me.

829
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,978
I don't even know what I love.

830
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,147
I lose track sometimes.

831
01:34:14,191 --> 01:34:16,693
But you love to make art.

832
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,322
Then try for TUA again...

833
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:22,240
A place like TUA

834
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:25,243
is only for people

835
01:34:25,619 --> 01:34:29,456
determined to give their all,
like you.

836
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,505
I figured that out too late.

837
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:40,050
Pathetic, isn't it?

838
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:46,348
I'm pathetic too.

839
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:52,312
All I do is compare myself to others.

840
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:56,942
No confidence,

841
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,529
so the smallest things hurt me.

842
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,118
When my artworks

843
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:10,747
are criticized,
I totally lose my footing.

844
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,301
My nakedness...

845
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:29,349
...is flimsy and pathetic.

846
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:35,730
Just like me.

847
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,317
But nakedness,

848
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:44,573
and the freedom of people
to decorate their nakedness,

849
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,992
and their ugliness,

850
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:49,911
all deserve to be loved.

851
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,752
Yeah.

852
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:09,514
"Nakedness = truth"

853
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,559
At the seaside,
Ryuji taught me.

854
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:16,605
I'm flimsy,
and pathetic.

855
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,858
Even so, that's me.

856
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:25,780
Tools down please.

857
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:53,141
Secondary exam: day 2

858
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:57,103
The time I have left is two days.

859
01:36:57,812 --> 01:36:59,356
Another 12 hours.

860
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:03,944
How do I depict

861
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:05,862
my true self?

862
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:39,998
You okay?

863
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:42,000
I'm not okay.

864
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:44,669
I've only done my sketchbook.

865
01:38:44,878 --> 01:38:47,505
You're sick.
Can't help that.

866
01:38:48,465 --> 01:38:50,258
But it's not enough...

867
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:53,178
You'll never make it.

868
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:58,308
One day left,
so go all out tomorrow.

869
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:12,697
Secondary exam: final day

870
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:28,546
Please begin.

871
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:41,476
Painting around the silhouette,

872
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:44,187
to depict the naked truth.

873
01:39:47,774 --> 01:39:49,609
The truth about me is,

874
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:51,778
I'm pathetic and weak.

875
01:39:53,822 --> 01:39:58,201
This painting, as seen through me,
is my world.

876
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:08,420
I use the nude model
to depict detail and solidity,

877
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:12,757
and the wall behind as a flat surface.

878
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,238
But...

879
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:38,408
...is this right?

880
01:40:57,427 --> 01:41:01,139
"Cood luck"

881
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,465
Yatora.

882
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:38,718
You used blank canvas for the nude.

883
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:42,889
Is that to make it seem truly naked?

884
01:41:43,223 --> 01:41:46,226
You used paint to depict the students.

885
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,145
Yeah.

886
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:57,737
Dammit. While I wasn't around,
you got better.

887
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:02,450
I thought energy and strategy
wouldn't help you.

888
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:11,209
Takahashi!

889
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:15,547
Thanks.

890
01:42:18,258 --> 01:42:20,009
Let's go for it.

891
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:42,156
The secondary exam.

892
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,868
Two hours left.

893
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:53,001
I've got to finish this.

894
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:18,234
Till I got into art,

895
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:23,531
I was always see-through.

896
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:28,036
Not even pathetically naked.

897
01:43:35,043 --> 01:43:36,085
But,

898
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:38,713
by creating...

899
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:42,425
...and creating...

900
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,011
Creating, and creating...

901
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:51,601
...and creating...

902
01:43:54,187 --> 01:43:55,647
...and creating...

903
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:58,775
...and creating...

904
01:44:03,488 --> 01:44:05,531
I abandoned my petty pride,

905
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,451
stopped pretending...

906
01:44:10,411 --> 01:44:13,122
...and finally found my true self.

907
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:40,316
Many are more talented than me.

908
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:43,820
But...

909
01:44:45,822 --> 01:44:48,074
They can't create what I can.

910
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:51,703
A world all my own.

911
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:16,329
Not yet.

912
01:46:36,808 --> 01:46:38,142
Yatora.

913
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:40,686
- Hey.
- Hey.

914
01:46:43,648 --> 01:46:44,482
Hey.

915
01:46:44,607 --> 01:46:45,608
Hey.

916
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:52,240
I'll go home and sleep all I want.

917
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,659
High school party for me.

918
01:46:54,784 --> 01:46:56,661
I'm going to a gig.

919
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:57,995
Lucky you.

920
01:47:03,543 --> 01:47:05,419
You got in?

921
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:07,338
Whoa.

922
01:47:07,964 --> 01:47:09,215
Congratulations.

923
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,552
I knew I'd get in.

924
01:47:13,678 --> 01:47:14,846
Bye.

925
01:47:38,703 --> 01:47:40,454
Can't see mine...

926
01:47:42,999 --> 01:47:44,750
It's not there.

927
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,753
Neither is mine.

928
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:11,402
"Yatora"

929
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:20,578
Hello?

930
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:22,121
Mom.

931
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:28,294
I got in.

932
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:34,967
