1
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:18,122
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:44,282
(Do you wonder)

3
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,842
(why I let you join the team?)

4
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:50,682
(Because I want you to learn.)

5
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,682
(Think of it as if)

6
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:54,386
(I'm still your mentor.)

7
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,619
I just won't be standing there to guide you. That's all.

8
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:57,962
(I want you)

9
00:01:58,114 --> 00:01:59,722
(to make a decision for me.)

10
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:01,922
I'll be in your care, Shoan.

11
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:07,804
Professor Win told me

12
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,602
if this was his surgery,

13
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:11,402
he would continue.

14
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:16,402
I believe that he can endure this surgery.

15
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:25,482
EKG to PEA.

16
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:27,344
Professor Chompoo, please analyze 5H5T.

17
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:29,362
I can't touch him now since it's PEA.

18
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,082
Keep compressing. Both lungs are balanced.

19
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:34,082
We'll now drop the...

20
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:37,362
Give him one milligram of adrenaline every four minutes.

21
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:38,801
Is there any change?

22
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,274
EKG to PEA. Keep compressing.

23
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:43,722
What's going on? I don't see anything wrong with the intraoperative.

24
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:57,202
Professor!

25
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:13,162
(Episode 20: Good Doctor)

26
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:28,442
Win has

27
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,597
a massive pulmonary

28
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:32,162
embolism.

29
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:36,482
I've done CPR and called for Professor San to give him ECMO,

30
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:39,002
but he still hasn't woken up.

31
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:42,402
I think he might have brain death.

32
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:46,842
We'll have to continue to examine his condition again.

33
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:49,962
But

34
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:52,562
I want his parents and Miss Maysa

35
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:54,842
to prepare for the worst.

36
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,642
May...

37
00:03:58,314 --> 00:03:59,602
May...

38
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,282
(Pavilion)

39
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,042
Professor.

40
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:34,042
What should we do? Shoan wouldn't talk to anyone.

41
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,482
The only one who can answer that question is Shoan.

42
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,882
Professor, if Shoan doesn't get a hold of himself soon,

43
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,482
it'll become a big problem.

44
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,962
That's right, Professor.

45
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:12,922
Professor has taught me...

46
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,562
The answer is massive PE.

47
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:19,762
I was wrong.

48
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:22,842
I was wrong...

49
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,922
I was wrong...

50
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:28,042
Professor has taught me...

51
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:31,714
The answer is massive PE.

52
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:35,362
- What happened? - Go find out what you miss.

53
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:39,042
The answer is massive PE.

54
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:43,922
Do you remember? Soft tissue sarcoma that causes PEA cardiac arrest.

55
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,922
The answer is massive PE.

56
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:49,762
I was wrong...

57
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,362
I was wrong...

58
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,962
I was wrong...

59
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,202
I was wrong...

60
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,762
I was wrong...

61
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,482
I was wrong...

62
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,842
I was wrong...

63
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:19,784
Professor has taught me...

64
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:23,402
The answer is massive PE.

65
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:33,882
I was wrong...

66
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,402
I was wrong...

67
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,082
I was wrong...

68
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:39,962
Professor has taught me...

69
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,802
The answer is massive PE.

70
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,802
Everyone has done their best.

71
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,762
No one has blamed you at all, Shoan.

72
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,322
The answer is massive PE.

73
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,202
I can't help anyone.

74
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,735
I can't help anyone.

75
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,722
I can't help anyone...

76
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,362
I was wrong...

77
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:21,042
I was wrong...

78
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,642
I was wrong...

79
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,402
Professor has taught me...

80
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:29,002
The answer is massive PE.

81
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:34,522
I was wrong...

82
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:41,002
Professor has taught me...

83
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:43,362
The answer is massive PE.

84
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,442
Will Shoan ever be back to normal?

85
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,114
I think he will be back.

86
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,047
The board would like to evaluate

87
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:18,282
if Shoan is truly suitable to be a doctor once again.

88
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,359
I see.

89
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:30,897
I understand

90
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:33,602
that Shoan is grieving.

91
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,162
But if this continues to go on,

92
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:40,722
it'll turn into negligence of duty, Pas.

93
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:45,602
I want to help,

94
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,642
but I really can't.

95
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:04,442
I don't want any more bunnies to die.

96
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:07,922
Death isn't scary.

97
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,442
If you still love them,

98
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:12,282
they're not really going away.

99
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:15,402
They'll be here.

100
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,962
- What's going on? - The bed!

101
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,442
It's an emergency!

102
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,522
We have to move him.

103
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:21,602
Let's go.

104
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,962
There's a lot of blood!

105
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:51,642
Pek's condition has gotten worse.

106
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:54,842
His heart doesn't really contract.

107
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:58,442
So I couldn't perform a normal kidney dialysis.

108
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,562
I had to use hemodialysis continuously.

109
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,682
There's also esophageal varices bleeding.

110
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,962
- The best treatment right now... - I know.

111
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,962
Pek needs to get a kidney transplant.

112
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,602
I'm afraid

113
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,002
a kidney transplant might not be enough this time.

114
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:27,322
He might have to change his kidney, liver,

115
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,362
and heart.

116
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,362
It's fine if you're not ready to say anything.

117
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:57,362
You can just listen to me.

118
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,882
I also want to blame it on someone.

119
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:06,722
I also want to criticize someone.

120
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,866
I also want to be mad at someone.

121
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:10,642
Because if I'm angry,

122
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:15,402
I won't have to think about Win.

123
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:24,162
But the reality isn't like that.

124
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:36,522
Why does it have to be me?

125
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,802
Is it because I don't have feelings?

126
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:41,802
No, Shoan.

127
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:45,402
It's the opposite.

128
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:50,682
I think Win knew his condition the best.

129
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:53,027
He also worried about you the most.

130
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:57,402
- He wanted you to go further. - He didn't have to worry about me!

131
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:58,998
I don't want to know!

132
00:16:59,122 --> 00:17:00,402
I don't want to know any more!

133
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,962
I want to be back to normal!

134
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:03,762
I want to be back to normal!

135
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,482
I don't want to know any more!

136
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:06,943
I don't want to know!

137
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,042
I know it's difficult, Shoan!

138
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:12,682
But we have to accept it so that we can go through it.

139
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,762
Do you understand, Shoan?

140
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,459
Dr. Prim.

141
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,322
The ER nurses

142
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:37,482
said Shoan didn't have the motivation to do anything.

143
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:39,202
Even with just closing the wound,

144
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:40,682
he didn't want to do it.

145
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:42,842
He just sat around and did nothing.

146
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:47,562
Isn't this going to get worse?

147
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,762
What if he gets suspended?

148
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:53,225
What if he gets fired?

149
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:59,322
I don't want to lose another good doctor.

150
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,682
It's done.

151
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:06,402
Dr. Prim.

152
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,002
There was a package for you this morning.

153
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,722
Thank you.

154
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:20,271
Em, No. 8 and 20 patients have changed their medication. Please watch them.

155
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:21,802
Yes.

156
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,278
I didn't get to hear an answer from her.

157
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,682
Everyone, thank you for coming

158
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:57,153
to the GMM Solid Organ Transplant Committee's meeting today.

159
00:19:57,275 --> 00:20:01,002
We have a patient who requires an organ transplant urgently.

160
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,722
I...

161
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:08,082
I'll let Dr. Primlada, the chief resident, present the case for you.

162
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:09,442
Prim.

163
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,482
The patient is a 15-year-old male with type O blood.

164
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:19,459
Rh positive PRA class I 0%, Class II 51%. Underlying

165
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:22,482
ESRD from autoimmune nephropathy.

166
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:25,922
On regular hemodialysis three times per week.

167
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,602
Recently,

168
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:30,739
there's been intradialytic hypotension

169
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,162
so we couldn't pull out UF.

170
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,962
He also has LV global hypokinesia

171
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,849
with pulmonary hypertension.

172
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:41,322
He's now in ICU with an upper GI bleed with aspiration pneumonia.

173
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,402
He's on ECMO and runs CRRT in the ICU.

174
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,002
The latest lab result is on the screen as you can see.

175
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:52,522
Combined organ transplant for kidney, liver, and heart at the same time

176
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,842
is the best treatment for this.

177
00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:02,242
Professors, do you have any questions

178
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:04,162
about this case?

179
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:05,722
Feel free to ask.

180
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,602
For dilated cardiomyopathy, have you done coronary artery angiography?

181
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:15,122
The CAG result is normal coronary.

182
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,522
What about upper GI bleeds?

183
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,682
How's the EDG result?

184
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:23,242
The EDG result is that there's EV bleeding.

185
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:25,338
We've done rubber band ligation.

186
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,722
There's no re-bleed anymore.

187
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,842
What about the infection?

188
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:32,682
Has his aspiration pneumonia gotten any better?

189
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,962
It's gotten better, Professor.

190
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,242
Has the patient received heart surgery before?

191
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:44,442
Never.

192
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:49,544
I agree with combined organ transplants for three organs.

193
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:50,896
Prim, I'll leave you

194
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,882
to do an additional workup and CT scan for his chest and whole abdomen.

195
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,482
Also, look at the aortic in his stomach.

196
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,842
- Yes. - Does anyone have anything else to add?

197
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:03,598
If not, I'll consider that we're now on the same page.

198
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:05,802
This is considered now our plan of action.

199
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:09,562
I'd like to appoint Professor San to be the leader of the surgery.

200
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:13,442
If we get a donor who's compatible with this patient,

201
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:16,282
we'll call for another meeting to plan for surgery.

202
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:22,122
When we plan for surgery, I'll invite

203
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:26,083
Professor Pranya to the meeting. He has done three organ transplants

204
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:29,802
successfully for the first time in Asia six years ago.

205
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,842
I'll invite him to ask for his opinion.

206
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:33,322
That's great.

207
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,922
I'd like to end the meeting now. Thank you, everyone.

208
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:39,562
- Thank you. - Thank you.

209
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:49,368
I was thinking of Shoan when we talked about organ harvest.

210
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:53,002
Yeah. I still think of his cold container.

211
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:55,602
Nick.

212
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,562
If I punch him again, will he get a hold of himself?

213
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:03,882
You can try.

214
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:14,562
(Exit)

215
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:25,602
Shoan's wounds

216
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:28,962
are really deep.

217
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:38,962
Can't we do anything at all?

218
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:46,842
Do we have to wait

219
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:49,282
and do nothing like this?

220
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:01,482
I think deeply in his heart,

221
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,362
he still has the spirit of being a doctor.

222
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:09,762
I believe he'll realize that

223
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,614
there are a lot of people who worry about him

224
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:14,202
and they are ready to help him

225
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:15,922
get it back.

226
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:37,802
Shin...

227
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,162
Please help your brother.

228
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:29,002
(See? You got this as soon as you made a wish.)

229
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:33,015
If you don't want any more bunnies to die,

230
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:35,115
you have to be a doctor

231
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:36,722
like Dr. Prapas

232
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:39,842
(so that you can save everyone from dying.)

233
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:43,916
I will never allow a doctor in your condition to operate on a patient.

234
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:45,522
You don't like me

235
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,010
- because I am different? - You're well aware of that.

236
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:49,577
You should reconsider yourself.

237
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:51,682
You're not suitable as a surgeon.

238
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,642
Your hands

239
00:26:56,842 --> 00:26:58,442
and your brain

240
00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:00,612
can still save a lot of people.

241
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,802
I believe

242
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,522
that these hands

243
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:16,042
will save a lot of people.

244
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:18,482
I believe

245
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:22,642
that you can become more than a surgeon.

246
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:27,082
(I'll be in your care, Shoan.)

247
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,322
Good evening, Professor.

248
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:36,722
(Reception)

249
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:58,522
(Appointment)

250
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:04,882
(Diaphragm.)

251
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:06,202
(Spleen.)

252
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,541
Gallbladder, pancreas,

253
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:11,202
small intestines,

254
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:12,962
large intestines.

255
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:14,282
Okay. What about this?

256
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,482
That's inferior vena cava.

257
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:20,882
And aorta.

258
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,402
Good job.

259
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:51,082
Good evening. Please get out of the car.

260
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,065
Where are you taking these to?

261
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,282
To the city.

262
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:57,282
I'd like to see your driver's license.

263
00:30:57,364 --> 00:31:00,842
- Please let me get it first. - Of course.

264
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,282
- Tell me when you get it. - Yes.

265
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:08,882
What is inside?

266
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:10,882
Fruits?

267
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,162
Hey, follow him!

268
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,442
Captain.

269
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:23,122
He's running away. What should we do?

270
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,922
He can't run far. Don't worry.

271
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,882
- Let's take a look at what's inside. - Yes.

272
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:28,702
Headquarters,

273
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:31,242
there's a suspect running away from Ratchada's checkpoint.

274
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,842
He's a 45-year-old male wearing a gray shirt.

275
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:37,962
Help.

276
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:42,202
Help.

277
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,282
What should we do, Captain?

278
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:48,750
- That's a human's voice. - What?

279
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,882
- Help. - Can you hear it?

280
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:52,882
I can hear a voice.

281
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,282
- From inside? - Yes.

282
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:55,422
Yes.

283
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:57,442
What should we do?

284
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:59,402
- That's a human voice. - Yes.

285
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:02,242
Let's take a look at one of these boxes. Get it out.

286
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:03,762
Yes.

287
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:06,322
Be careful.

288
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,962
- Help... - Help...

289
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:12,922
Help...

290
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:16,442
Watch out.

291
00:32:18,482 --> 00:32:20,602
- Slowly. - Help...

292
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,842
Help...

293
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,202
Help...

294
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,482
- Help... - Help...

295
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,722
Help...

296
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:36,882
Help...

297
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,025
Help...

298
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,562
Since there are a lot of people inside, they probably have asphyxiation.

299
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:47,962
A lot of them have weak pulses. Need to perform CPR immediately.

300
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,781
We only have these many ambulances?

301
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:54,642
Yes. There are two ambulances for now. I already asked for more.

302
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,166
More are coming. There's pretty bad traffic.

303
00:32:57,281 --> 00:33:01,442
- It's fine. Let's help them for now. - Can you handle that side?

304
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,682
No...

305
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:09,722
Help...

306
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:12,002
Help...

307
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,064
Can anyone do CPR here?

308
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:27,642
Can anyone do CPR here?

309
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:29,697
No ambulances have come yet.

310
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:32,402
- Yeah. - Can anyone do it?

311
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:34,082
Can anyone do it?

312
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,802
Me.

313
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,731
- I've learned about it. - Okay.

314
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,962
- Sergeant, go get him here. - Yes.

315
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:49,122
- You can begin. - Please start with this one.

316
00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:00,802
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

317
00:34:00,962 --> 00:34:03,922
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

318
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:06,602
12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

319
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:08,882
17, 18, 19, 20,

320
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:12,122
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,

321
00:34:12,273 --> 00:34:15,076
27, 28, 29, 30.

322
00:34:24,922 --> 00:34:28,122
(6, 7, 8, 9, 10.)

323
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,882
(11, 12, 13)

324
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:33,011
(14, 15.)

325
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:39,642
Shin. Shin, wake up.

326
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:43,693
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

327
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:47,642
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

328
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:51,202
11, 12, 13,

329
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:53,442
- 14, 15. - Doctor.

330
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:56,082
My kid is fine now. Thank you so much.

331
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,682
Thank you for the robot.

332
00:34:57,794 --> 00:35:00,642
- He really likes it. - I'll probably miss you, Doctor.

333
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:03,762
(You're so funny, Sea Lion Doctor.)

334
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:05,642
- Doctor... - Thank you

335
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:08,318
- for saving my wife. - A doctor's job is to save lives.

336
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,042
Thank you, doctors.

337
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:12,146
It's a doctor's job, sir.

338
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:14,162
(I want to take this opportunity)

339
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,762
(to give dying lives a chance to survive.)

340
00:35:19,192 --> 00:35:20,922
That's why I want to be a doctor.

341
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:24,202
Let me do this myself.

342
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:25,722
I'm a doctor.

343
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:44,202
Doctor, there's one injured person here!

344
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:46,362
His breathing seems weird. Please take a look.

345
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,882
What you've done earlier was already good.

346
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:51,402
Can you do that for me?

347
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:52,922
Yes.

348
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:07,522
It might be tension pneumothorax. We have to do ICD.

349
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:09,282
- Do you have equipment? - Yes.

350
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:10,922
- Please bring it here. - Yes.

351
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:13,042
Doctor, please take a look here.

352
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:14,762
Yes.

353
00:36:25,178 --> 00:36:26,722
His pulse is still there.

354
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,362
He's considered a yellow patient.

355
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,802
(At Ratchada Road, )

356
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:58,882
(the police have found the truck smuggling aliens.)

357
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:00,482
(With the narrow space)

358
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:01,922
(and hot weather, )

359
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,842
(those factors cause them to suffocate.)

360
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:08,402
(The rescue workers and police are trying to help them.)

361
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:10,202
(But with a lot of injured people, )

362
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:13,882
(they have to ask for help from people in the area.)

363
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:15,362
(From this incident, )

364
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:18,562
(there's someone who records a video of an upstanding citizen.)

365
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:21,482
(He stepped in to perform CPR to save the victim's life.)

366
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:24,882
(We've learned later that he's only 15 years old.)

367
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,402
(Hello, Doctor.)

368
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,122
(I'm a daughter of Mr. Prathip Thepphotha, )

369
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,962
(who you treated two years ago.)

370
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:34,082
(My dad has already passed away.)

371
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:36,762
(He insisted that I send this Buddha amulet to you.)

372
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:38,882
(When you see this, )

373
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:41,562
(I hope you can be proud of it.)

374
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:45,002
(He said he got a lot more from you than just a treatment.)

375
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:46,962
(As for me, )

376
00:37:47,122 --> 00:37:49,282
(I'd like to thank you as his daughter)

377
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:52,762
(as you gave me some more time to be with my dad.)

378
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:54,842
(Why)

379
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:56,642
(do you want to be a doctor?)

380
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:00,529
(So I think what's important)

381
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:02,362
(is what we do)

382
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:05,722
to not forget your answer to this

383
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:09,482
throughout your whole career as a doctor.

384
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:46,642
(#TheAnswerToTheBeginning)

385
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:03,522
You're back, Doctor?

386
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:08,242
Yes.

387
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:12,658
I've heard about you from the nurses.

388
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:16,522
I thought you might not be back again.

389
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,322
I was a coward.

390
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:26,882
I was afraid I would make another mistake.

391
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:35,082
I understand that.

392
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:38,402
I'm also afraid of that.

393
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,642
My parents died because of me.

394
00:39:45,074 --> 00:39:46,314
On that day,

395
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:50,882
a drunkard drove his car and crashed into us.

396
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,282
But I was the driver.

397
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:58,322
Sometimes, I think

398
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:03,002
that if I had died instead,

399
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:05,722
everything might have been better.

400
00:40:14,282 --> 00:40:16,162
It's because when you survive

401
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:21,002
while seeing your loved ones die,

402
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:23,082
it's devastating.

403
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:29,562
Pek was the one who said that.

404
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,802
I just want Pek to get a chance to become an adult.

405
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:08,122
I want him to live normally like other people.

406
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:45,441
We've now had a donor who's compatible with the patient.

407
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:49,162
Today, I've invited Professor Pranya from Sirirat

408
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:53,242
to be our adviser. He'll also help with the planning.

409
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:55,842
- Thank you so much. - You're welcome.

410
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:58,842
- Good morning. - Dr. Prim, you can begin.

411
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:01,609
Well then...

412
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:05,562
From the latest lab result this morning, CBC hematocrit

413
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:07,757
is around the same at 22%.

414
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:10,402
There are 220,000 platelets.

415
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:13,362
The coagulogram is a little prolonged. PT 17.

416
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:15,042
PTT 35.

417
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:16,882
BUN and creatinine have decreased.

418
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,722
BUN is now at 37.6. Creatinine is now at 5.8.

419
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:24,162
Electrolyte is normal. Liver function is still the same.

420
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:28,602
When is the estimated time for cross-clamp time?

421
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:32,722
We have to go to Phetchabun Hospital.

422
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:36,242
We have to land at Phitsanulok and get a car to Phetchabun.

423
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:38,522
It'll take around four hours.

424
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:42,842
We can do cross-clamp time around noon.

425
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,417
No, that's too long.

426
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:55,322
Excuse me.

427
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:59,682
For three organ transplants on one single person,

428
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:01,962
if it takes more than four hours to transport organs,

429
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:04,662
it can affect the function of the new heart.

430
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,362
I agree with him.

431
00:43:12,482 --> 00:43:15,882
He's right. For three organ transplants,

432
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:19,682
if it takes too long, it can affect the function of the new heart

433
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:21,442
which might be about off-pump.

434
00:43:21,562 --> 00:43:24,522
It can affect the cold ischemic time of other organs.

435
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:26,602
What he said was exactly right.

436
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,962
Yes, Professor.

437
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:31,882
Professor San, Professor Benz, what do you think?

438
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:34,522
I agree with Professor Pranya and Shoan,

439
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:39,042
but I don't think it's easy to find another compatible donor.

440
00:43:43,802 --> 00:43:44,802
Yes?

441
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:46,682
Okay. Yes.

442
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,962
Everyone,

443
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:52,362
a coordinator told me that we just got a new donor

444
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:55,122
who is compatible with our patient.

445
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:57,402
He's in Bangkok.

446
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:59,082
In Bangkok?

447
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:01,002
- Yes. - This is so lucky.

448
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,402
It really is.

449
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:04,402
Can we still change the plan?

450
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,682
I don't think there'll be any problems.

451
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:11,017
Nick, Pleum, you'll go to harvest the organs.

452
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,535
Prim, help Professor San with the heart.

453
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:16,122
I'll get the liver ready with Mummim

454
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:18,442
and Shoan. Can you do it?

455
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:20,162
I can.

456
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,642
Do you have anything to add, Professor Chompoo?

457
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:29,202
Since this is three organ transplantations,

458
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:32,640
at which step should we give immunosuppressant to him?

459
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,562
And how many doses should we use?

460
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:37,122
You can follow the protocol of a heart transplant.

461
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:39,882
Use 20 mg of basiliximab per IV before the incision.

462
00:44:40,002 --> 00:44:42,401
Use 500 mg of methylprednisolone for bypass

463
00:44:42,482 --> 00:44:45,202
and 500 mg before removing the heart clamp.

464
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:52,802
Everything he said was exactly right.

465
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:54,522
Professor Prapas,

466
00:44:54,627 --> 00:44:57,882
he's really a gem just like everyone says.

467
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,442
- He's really good. - Yes.

468
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:29,082
I'm glad that we get to operate together again, Doctor.

469
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,642
Yes.

470
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:38,942
Okay.

471
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:43,922
(Shoan.)

472
00:45:54,683 --> 00:45:56,002
(Are you okay?)

473
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:19,362
Pleum, perform a suction.

474
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:20,802
Good.

475
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:22,242
Metzenbaum scissors.

476
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:24,762
Right angle.

477
00:46:37,178 --> 00:46:38,583
Pleum, perform a suction here.

478
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:40,187
- Yes. - Okay.

479
00:46:40,646 --> 00:46:42,602
- Good. - Just a bit more around this.

480
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:44,322
Metzenbaum scissors, please.

481
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:47,362
Get ready for SVC and IVC.

482
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:56,322
- Right angle. - Will the heart be here soon?

483
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:57,552
Yes.

484
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:00,242
I'll do an aortic cross-clamp in half an hour.

485
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:01,714
Yes.

486
00:47:25,282 --> 00:47:26,882
- Is the heart ready? - Yes.

487
00:47:26,986 --> 00:47:28,402
Please give it to me.

488
00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:34,322
Open it. Good job.

489
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:36,722
I think we can transplant the heart in time.

490
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:37,922
Okay.

491
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:42,082
(It's another achievement for Thai doctors. They have performed)

492
00:47:42,379 --> 00:47:44,154
(three organ transplants on a single patient.)

493
00:47:44,178 --> 00:47:46,962
(This operation took around 13 hours.)

494
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:49,202
(It's another achievement for Thai doctors, )

495
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:51,802
(after the first successful three organ transplants in Asia)

496
00:47:51,962 --> 00:47:53,642
(in 2017.)

497
00:48:15,824 --> 00:48:17,442
- Are you going? - Yes.

498
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:20,041
This is Professor Prapas' lunch box.

499
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,562
Let me see.

500
00:48:27,682 --> 00:48:29,402
You're ready.

501
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,082
I'll leave after I finish organizing your fridge.

502
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:40,922
You don't have to come every week. I can do it myself.

503
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:44,002
You won't have time for it.

504
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,602
I want to do it for you.

505
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:52,722
Okay.

506
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:54,882
I'll get going then.

507
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:56,762
- Sure. - Goodbye.

508
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,082
I'll go wait over there.

509
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:20,162
Take your time.

510
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:39,162
- Hello. - Hello.

511
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:42,842
He is finally here to see his brother?

512
00:51:06,202 --> 00:51:08,161
- Hello, Doctor. - Hello.

513
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,302
- Hello, Doctor. - How are you?

514
00:51:10,532 --> 00:51:12,090
The pain has lessened, hasn't it?

515
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:14,282
Overall, his condition is better.

516
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:16,858
His body hasn't shown a sign of rejection for the new organs.

517
00:51:16,882 --> 00:51:20,682
With some rest, I think he will get to go home in a few days.

518
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:22,322
Thank you so much.

519
00:51:22,403 --> 00:51:24,355
Thank you so much.

520
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:27,922
If you have any questions, you can ask our residents or nurses.

521
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:29,601
- They'll report it to me. - Okay.

522
00:51:29,682 --> 00:51:31,817
- I'll excuse myself then. - Yes.

523
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:32,898
Goodbye.

524
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,162
- I'll leave him to you. - Yes, Professor.

525
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,682
- Miss Paan. - Yes?

526
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:43,922
Thank you so much.

527
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:45,962
For what?

528
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,482
Pek asked me a question that I couldn't answer the other day.

529
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:53,042
But I got the answer from you.

530
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,442
What did I ask you, Doctor?

531
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:00,602
You asked me,

532
00:52:02,056 --> 00:52:05,502
"Why would a doctor save anyone if everyone has to die anyway?"

533
00:52:06,762 --> 00:52:09,162
I got the answer from two good doctors,

534
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,002
and from you, Miss Paan.

535
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,522
With those three answers, I can conclude that

536
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,962
everyone will die. Doctors will die as well.

537
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:20,967
It's natural for humans.

538
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:24,442
But saving people

539
00:52:24,866 --> 00:52:26,922
is also natural for doctors.

540
00:52:27,122 --> 00:52:28,442
Therefore,

541
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,402
we should do our best to do our duties. That should be enough.

542
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:43,082
We'll take our leave then.

543
00:52:43,242 --> 00:52:44,962
- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Doctor.

544
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:46,922
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

545
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,362
Goodbye.

546
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:51,562
Have a lot of rest.

547
00:52:52,258 --> 00:52:53,882
You don't have to be stressed.

548
00:53:06,078 --> 00:53:08,522
Congratulations.

549
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:19,329
My bro! That's my bro!

550
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,442
Congratulations.

551
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:31,722
For most of us here,

552
00:53:31,963 --> 00:53:35,842
I don't think this year has been easy.

553
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:39,034
During this whole year,

554
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:41,002
in our hospital,

555
00:53:41,816 --> 00:53:44,402
a lot of things have happened.

556
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,562
Good things,

557
00:53:47,855 --> 00:53:49,082
bad things,

558
00:53:50,457 --> 00:53:52,098
and new things.

559
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:53,882
And also

560
00:53:55,544 --> 00:53:56,962
we suffer some loss.

561
00:53:58,002 --> 00:53:59,882
But what I want to say is that

562
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:04,762
this is once again a reminder of a philosophy that says

563
00:54:05,516 --> 00:54:06,802
life

564
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:09,522
is uncertain.

565
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:15,362
And the people who can teach us

566
00:54:15,473 --> 00:54:18,642
about the treatment and the way of life

567
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:20,842
aren't anyone else.

568
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:25,162
They're the people who we're trying to save.

569
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,602
That's right. It's our patients.

570
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:30,802
You have to accept

571
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:34,282
that we, doctors,

572
00:54:35,763 --> 00:54:38,002
are just humans.

573
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:40,402
We're not perfect.

574
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:42,842
If one day

575
00:54:43,526 --> 00:54:44,827
in the future,

576
00:54:45,372 --> 00:54:47,402
when you have

577
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,042
doubt,

578
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:52,762
when you feel hopeless,

579
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,602
when you question what you're going to do

580
00:54:57,538 --> 00:54:59,002
and can't find an answer

581
00:54:59,226 --> 00:55:00,682
when that time comes,

582
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:01,962
go back

583
00:55:02,122 --> 00:55:05,442
to the first day you wanted to be a doctor.

584
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:08,122
Think of

585
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:11,163
the reason

586
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:13,162
why you wanted to be a doctor.

587
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:24,835
I hope

588
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:27,402
that these questions and answers

589
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,562
will take us

590
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:34,802
to the path where we can be ourselves the most.

591
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,855
I'd like to express my congratulations

592
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:48,682
to every doctor here.

593
00:55:49,427 --> 00:55:51,602
I wish you good luck.

594
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:54,642
I hope you'll be a good doctor

595
00:55:56,404 --> 00:55:57,922
in your own way.

596
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:01,242
Thank you.

597
00:56:33,442 --> 00:56:35,882
(My brother told me)

598
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:38,602
(that I was still a little different from other people.)

599
00:56:39,057 --> 00:56:41,842
(I still like to do things in an organized manner.)

600
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:44,482
(I can be too direct and catch people off guard.)

601
00:56:44,963 --> 00:56:48,442
(I still look like a robot for most people.)

602
00:56:49,457 --> 00:56:50,722
(But inside, )

603
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:53,242
(I know I've changed so much.)

604
00:56:53,402 --> 00:56:57,282
First, we'll perform a vertical incision on the abdomen.

605
00:56:57,394 --> 00:57:00,476
Then, we'll go into the cutaneous...

606
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,962
Please stop, Doctor.

607
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,722
I don't understand what you're saying.

608
00:57:03,843 --> 00:57:06,202
- Can you say... - Please calm down.

609
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:07,922
Let me think.

610
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:09,437
(I'm happy)

611
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:11,442
(that I get to do what I really like.)

612
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,283
(And that is treating people and operating.)

613
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:17,082
(I'm still trying to find out what it is to be a good doctor.)

614
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:24,082
(I once wanted to be what people called normal.)

615
00:57:24,343 --> 00:57:27,762
(I thought they should have understood what I was.)

616
00:57:27,962 --> 00:57:29,282
(But when I think like that, )

617
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:30,722
(I found that)

618
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:33,962
(I was hurt by people's expectations.)

619
00:57:34,562 --> 00:57:36,802
(In the end, I understand now)

620
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:40,082
(that what I want is so basic and normal.)

621
00:57:40,882 --> 00:57:43,362
(I just want someone to believe)

622
00:57:43,635 --> 00:57:45,962
(and see my own specialness.)

623
00:57:46,745 --> 00:57:48,745
(Just a few people who can say)

624
00:57:49,088 --> 00:57:50,602
(that they believe in me.)

625
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:52,882
Dr. Prim, hello.

626
00:57:53,082 --> 00:57:55,562
There are a lot of patients every day.

627
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:57,802
But it's still okay.

628
00:57:59,832 --> 00:58:02,362
(Have you stopped drinking extra sweet lattes?)

629
00:58:03,836 --> 00:58:07,122
Yeah, but I drink extra sweet black coffee instead.

630
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,802
(You can't. You have to stop drinking that, or you'd become a hippo.)

631
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,602
(Don't forget to eat vegetables.)

632
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:14,042
I know that.

633
00:58:14,256 --> 00:58:17,002
You should go. You'll get annoyed if you're late again.

634
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:18,642
- Okay. - (Goodbye.)

635
00:58:18,812 --> 00:58:20,122
Bye-bye.

636
00:58:24,657 --> 00:58:26,522
You haven't gone home, Doctor?

637
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:30,122
Come on, Doctor. There are a lot of patients waiting now.

638
00:58:34,603 --> 00:58:35,722
Let's go.

639
00:58:41,497 --> 00:58:42,802
Hello.

640
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:55,002
Yeah!

641
00:58:57,082 --> 00:59:00,202
(Welcome back, Professor!)

642
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:10,283
Hello, Mummim, a second-year resident.

643
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,602
Nick.

644
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:14,802
Where are the others?

645
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,682
Pleum is picking up the first-year resident.

646
00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:20,922
By the way, what is a fellow like you doing in a resident's break room?

647
00:59:21,546 --> 00:59:23,082
If I have to say it politely,

648
00:59:23,249 --> 00:59:25,922
I'll say it's because I'm lonely. But for real though,

649
00:59:26,202 --> 00:59:27,642
I'm just not really busy.

650
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,482
You're so annoying.

651
00:59:29,642 --> 00:59:31,282
What's this?

652
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:33,082
I heard you guys from the outside.

653
00:59:34,344 --> 00:59:36,682
Pleum, where is the new girl?

654
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,402
She's in the toilet. She's probably nervous.

655
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:41,722
Nick.

656
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,562
Has Prim contacted you at all?

657
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:45,482
- Prim? - Yeah.

658
00:59:45,642 --> 00:59:46,882
It's like she's disappeared.

659
00:59:47,002 --> 00:59:50,122
We're probably not important enough for her to call us.

660
00:59:51,122 --> 00:59:52,722
Are you sulking or what?

661
00:59:54,472 --> 00:59:55,842
Come in.

662
00:59:58,718 --> 01:00:01,362
Good morning, I'm Bua, a first-year resident.

663
01:00:02,313 --> 01:00:03,842
Let me introduce myself again.

664
01:00:04,082 --> 01:00:07,682
I'm Pleum, a fourth-year resident. She's Mummim, a second-year resident.

665
01:00:07,922 --> 01:00:09,242
As for me,

666
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:12,162
I'm Nick, a fellow in plastic surgery.

667
01:00:12,562 --> 01:00:14,922
- He already has a girlfriend. - That's enough.

668
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:17,242
And that's all of us?

669
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:19,522
There's another one.

670
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,882
He's just arrived.

671
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:31,930
Good morning. I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, 27 years old.

672
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:33,362
I'm a second-year resident.

673
01:00:33,522 --> 01:00:36,522
I have high-functioning autism.

674
01:00:36,682 --> 01:00:40,102
I like bunnies. I like to look at the moon, and I like drawing.

675
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:42,682
I can watch TV for hours.

676
01:00:42,779 --> 01:00:44,442
Nice to meet you.
