(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:37,002
(Samut Songkhram - 2003)

3
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:43,922
How is it? Do the headphones work?

4
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:47,962
The uncle from the scrap store was kind enough to give me that.

5
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,682
Shin.

6
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:55,322
- Yes? - Please help me carry this ice cream tank.

7
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,682
Of course.

8
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,402
Don't go anywhere, alright?

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,522
After I'm done, I'll take you to return the book.

10
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,402
Okay?

11
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,362
Okay.

12
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,402
I'll be back.

13
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:16,762
Shin, come on.

14
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:36,482
Shin!

15
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,522
Shoan.

16
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,602
Shoan!

17
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:23,722
Yes?

18
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:27,162
It's already six. Let's go for our morning round.

19
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:39,161
You haven't entered our group chat, right?

20
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,242
I'll invite you to it.

21
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:46,762
Our group chat is called "We're Never Free on Any Day."

22
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,562
Just a moment.

23
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,842
Okay.

24
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,398
(Hi, Shoan.) (Can you please tell us first before inviting him?)

25
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:58,262
(Dr. Mummim deleted Dr. Shoan from the group.) (Yeah, that's too fast.)

26
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,402
I don't see any invitation.

27
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:04,042
This area probably doesn't have signals.

28
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:07,122
The Wi-Fi signal might not reach here.

29
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:11,238
It's like a blind spot in the hospital.

30
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,402
I'll take care of this tomorrow.

31
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,137
Are you sure you're never free?

32
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,082
We have to be at least free for one day.

33
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:25,082
It's not like that's actually happening.

34
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:28,642
It's just a fun and sarcastic way to name our group chat.

35
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:31,362
I have one sarcastic joke to tell you.

36
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:33,842
You have one?

37
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,195
This sentence doesn't have eight words.

38
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,602
(Are you at the hospital, Win?)

39
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:05,082
I'm still driving. I didn't have my morning round, so I got out late.

40
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:07,162
What's wrong, May?

41
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,888
(It's nothing much.)

42
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:12,217
(I just want to remind you about our dinner with my dad.)

43
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:14,566
(When are you free next week?)

44
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:19,184
(So that we can talk about when you're going to work in my dad's hospital.)

45
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:21,224
May...

46
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:23,922
I haven't promised I'd work there.

47
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:29,562
(You said you wanted time to think. It's already been a year.)

48
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:33,722
(Or do you not want to work with my dad?)

49
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,802
That's not what I said.

50
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:41,178
Okay, May.

51
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,442
I have to hang up. My mom is calling.

52
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:46,642
Yes, Mom?

53
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:48,282
(Hello, Win.)

54
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:51,242
(Next week is Wee's death anniversary.)

55
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:54,002
(Please come to see your brother.)

56
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,882
Can I think about it first?

57
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:08,082
If you want to go with Dad, you can go there without me.

58
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,682
(I want you to go with us.)

59
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:13,402
(He probably misses you as well.)

60
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:47,522
Gender, age, symptom, latest treatment.

61
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:52,242
After the operation,

62
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:54,962
you can go home after

63
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,002
two or three days of resting.

64
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,482
Thank you, Doctor.

65
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:01,642
We'll excuse ourselves.

66
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:04,842
Wait, Doctor.

67
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,562
If my symptoms are back, I have to get another operation, right?

68
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,122
There is more than a 60 percent chance that the cancer will return.

69
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,106
We'll treat you with medicine first

70
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,761
to decrease male hormones called ADT that could cause

71
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:24,722
a five-percent chance of heart disease death within five years.

72
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,855
Even if I get treatment,

73
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:32,251
I'll still have a chance to die?

74
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,842
Let's say that

75
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,002
it's possible

76
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:40,442
that there'll be side effects from ADT

77
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:42,442
that are also possible

78
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:45,402
to create cataracts in some cases.

79
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:47,473
That's true.

80
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:49,642
But please don't worry.

81
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:53,202
What he just said was a medical hypothesis.

82
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,042
In reality,

83
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:57,362
we have to conduct further diagnosis

84
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:00,202
with the doctor of the case.

85
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:01,762
Please have a rest.

86
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,962
- Thank you. - We'll take our leave now. Goodbye.

87
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:05,162
Goodbye.

88
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:15,042
(Episode Four: Eyes Don't Lie)

89
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:18,482
How could you say that to a patient?

90
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,162
You're going to shock them.

91
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:25,955
Do you not know

92
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,881
how they would feel

93
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,002
when you talk about death?

94
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,722
The word "death" will distress patients.

95
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:39,722
And do you know what kind of face they would make?

96
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:52,802
Is this an angry face?

97
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,722
What about a sad face?

98
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,482
That still looks like an angry face.

99
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:02,722
Look at me.

100
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,162
When I do this...

101
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,002
Like...

102
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,402
- That's angry. - No, that's an annoyed face.

103
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,562
What if I do this?

104
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:21,562
- That's also angry. - No! That was a doubting face!

105
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:25,482
See? That's your problem, understand?

106
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,233
You don't know

107
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:32,042
how people feel and what their facial expression means.

108
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,042
What about this?

109
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:40,562
Smiling.

110
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,282
How do they feel?

111
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,122
Smiling

112
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,241
equals happiness.

113
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,282
Yeah! Just like that.

114
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,642
From now on, please try

115
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:57,394
to pay attention to about 10-20 people every day to discern

116
00:09:57,482 --> 00:09:59,562
how they feel with their faces.

117
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,362
We'll have a test later.

118
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,482
Don't you like tests and challenges?

119
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,362
Yesterday we just...

120
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:25,602
How do you feel right now?

121
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:28,242
Yesterday, Kamon from ER

122
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:31,682
fell through sewer gates. It's so funny.

123
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,882
Look at her.

124
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,482
Somrak, how do you feel right now?

125
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,362
I put in the wrong data again.

126
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:57,082
How do you feel right now?

127
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,042
Annoyed, Doctor.

128
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,802
Doctor.

129
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:05,082
Can you go away for now?

130
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,202
Darn it.

131
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:11,242
When will I finish this?

132
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,922
And is it good?

133
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:38,842
It's really good.

134
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,802
Dad can use it to count his steps when he takes a walk.

135
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:45,522
It also warned that Dad's heart was beating too fast.

136
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,402
I want that.

137
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,202
Do you want a smartwatch?

138
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:52,962
No way. You're still a child. You should use a normal watch.

139
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,522
I'll buy it for you.

140
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:55,762
Which color do you want?

141
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,082
Pink.

142
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,402
Pink? And what else?

143
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:00,682
- And glitter. - And glitter too?

144
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:04,562
How is your dad?

145
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:07,642
Dad likes to sleep. He also laughs when he sleeps.

146
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,802
Why is he laughing while sleeping?

147
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:14,562
Dad was watching a comedy show. He laughed while watching it.

148
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,628
How did he laugh?

149
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:17,882
Ha-ha-ha.

150
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,442
Dad's condition has gotten a lot worse?

151
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:05,820
From the echo report, the systole doesn't look good.

152
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:08,202
Your heart is rather weak.

153
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,762
As I said earlier,

154
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:14,522
the best treatment method right now is a heart transplant,

155
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,842
but it'll take some time until we can get a donated heart.

156
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,362
A heart transplant? How much does that cost?

157
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,804
And I think I also heard about

158
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:29,512
heart transplant incompatibility before.

159
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:32,562
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

160
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:36,962
Your heart transplant fee is included in your fundamental right.

161
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:40,201
And before transplantation, we have to check to see if that heart

162
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,002
is compatible with you.

163
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:45,042
It just might take some time until we can get it.

164
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll just do what you say, Dr. Prim.

165
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:54,322
If I have to wait, I'll have to wait.

166
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:57,122
Since I have to get the treatment,

167
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,382
it'll be nice if my symptoms are fully gone.

168
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:02,522
My daughter is going to be an adult soon.

169
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:04,962
If there's a man hitting on her,

170
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:08,802
I'll be able to teach him some lessons when I feel better.

171
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,842
Dad, you're still joking around in this state?

172
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,642
I'm glad that you're still smiling.

173
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:20,522
But I really recommend you stay in the hospital for now,

174
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,002
so it'll be easier when a donated heart arrives.

175
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,889
With this wardroom,

176
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,882
my daughters can't stay with me, right?

177
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,162
Then,

178
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,362
I don't think I'll stay here,

179
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:36,922
because

180
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,202
there'll be no one who stays with them at our house.

181
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:44,322
My house isn't that far from the hospital anyway.

182
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:46,402
When you call for me,

183
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,322
I can run here immediately.

184
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:52,682
I can be with you within 10 minutes.

185
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:55,322
You're the best runner in the world, Dad.

186
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:56,602
Yes.

187
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,122
I'm a good runner, my daughter.

188
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:13,515
(Reception)

189
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:32,202
- Are you on shift today? - Prim.

190
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,122
No. I'll go home after I finish my meal.

191
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
Okay.

192
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:38,922
Is this for Pleum?

193
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,322
No.

194
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:42,962
It's for that guy,

195
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:44,762
the one you saw before.

196
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,242
I'm so tired of this.

197
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,122
You should have a boyfriend too.

198
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,282
Stop your nonsense.

199
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,082
Why did you buy a lot of food?

200
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,642
Is it for the monk's offering?

201
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:59,146
Who would do that in the evening?

202
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,275
I'm going to visit my relatives.

203
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,042
See you later.

204
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:05,762
- Bye. - Enjoy your meal.

205
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:07,753
- Take care. - Sure.

206
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,242
Bye-bye.

207
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:16,322
Hello, Arm. Are you coming down soon?

208
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:21,242
There's an emergency case? It's fine. I can eat by myself.

209
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:24,362
(Mim.)

210
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:25,802
Yes?

211
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:29,562
(I'm really sorry.)

212
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:55,632
Shoan!

213
00:16:58,793 --> 00:16:59,802
Yes?

214
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:01,162
Do you want to get in?

215
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,282
Just get in!

216
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:05,602
Quick!

217
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:08,442
Yes, of course, Dr. Prim.

218
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:09,681
Watch out.

219
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,042
Your car smells like a cafeteria.

220
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:21,138
That's right.

221
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:22,682
Look.

222
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,794
Do you have any errands to do?

223
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,122
- I have to read two research papers. - So you're not busy.

224
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:36,322
Please accompany me

225
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:38,082
on my errand.

226
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,282
Where are we going?

227
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:47,922
Chat, you can stay in the special room in the hospital tomorrow.

228
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:50,001
- It's here. - Our hospital

229
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:51,561
has a special program

230
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:54,282
to cover the cost that I have applied for.

231
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:56,362
And you got a private room.

232
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:58,762
Your daughters can all stay in the room.

233
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:00,922
Is that true?

234
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,882
- Yes. - Wow.

235
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:05,722
Heart Surgery Research Program,

236
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,834
Medical Device Donation Program,

237
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:10,176
Treatment for Patients from Border Provinces Program.

238
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:11,842
That's all.

239
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:13,722
There's not a program for cost...

240
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,162
Why did you hit me?

241
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,324
He's a new doctor. There's a lot he still doesn't know.

242
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,802
This program really exists.

243
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,562
You don't have to worry.

244
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,882
Thank you so much, Dr. Prim.

245
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:27,202
You should have dinner with us.

246
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:29,042
It's already evening.

247
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:33,381
That's good. You don't have to cook anything. I've already bought them.

248
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:36,242
- There's a lot of them. - We have everything.

249
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:41,082
- You can have them for several days. - Thank you.

250
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:43,602
Take them, girls.

251
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:47,842
- Can you do that? - Stinky, don't bother the doctor.

252
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:51,802
Dad, its name is Konmek.

253
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:53,202
It's Stinky for me.

254
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:55,448
It hasn't even taken a bath.

255
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,042
But there's one good thing about it.

256
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:01,202
When Mali and I go out to work,

257
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:03,962
it can still accompany my youngest daughter.

258
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,882
They might be best friends.

259
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,562
I think she doesn't know my name anymore.

260
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,682
She can only call its name.

261
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,282
Why?

262
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,722
Why are you like that?

263
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:18,794
Is this a joke?

264
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:27,562
Well, he doesn't really have any humor.

265
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:30,242
He rarely laughs.

266
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:37,482
Don't you know how to play along?

267
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:42,042
Does our hospital have a special program to cover costs for patients?

268
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:43,642
Lower your voice.

269
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,922
I haven't heard about it before.

270
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,682
Where did you learn about this?

271
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:52,002
It doesn't exist.

272
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,959
I'm the one who's covering that cost.

273
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,042
You have to keep this a secret. Don't tell anyone, got it?

274
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:00,242
You're lying to him?

275
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,002
Well...

276
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,042
Yeah.

277
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:10,042
I want to help him. Just look at them.

278
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:14,482
How would those girls live if Chat is gone?

279
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:18,402
I know it isn't

280
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:23,122
my duty, but I still want to help them, even if I weren't a doctor.

281
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:29,622
Because they don't have enough money?

282
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:53,362
Sometimes, money can buy happiness.

283
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,842
Alright?

284
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:04,642
Keep this a secret. Don't let the hospital know, or I'll get killed.

285
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,842
I beg you.

286
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:07,928
Please.

287
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:10,042
Please.

288
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,882
Dad!

289
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:19,562
Chat!

290
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:27,602
Mr. Suchat, you fall unconscious because your heart is extremely weak.

291
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:32,042
Your condition isn't that different from when we talked in the afternoon.

292
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:34,323
Thank you so much, Doctor.

293
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:40,322
I was a little too surprised because I was too happy.

294
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:41,922
Happy about what?

295
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:44,842
I got accepted to the special program

296
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,762
that is going to cover the cost

297
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,762
of my treatment.

298
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:53,202
Dr. Prim recommended that program to me.

299
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,482
She told me to

300
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:02,002
stay in a special room in the hospital.

301
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:04,282
That's why

302
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,553
I don't have to worry about them anymore.

303
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:09,642
A special program?

304
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,042
Yes.

305
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:19,642
You paid for his special room, right?

306
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:24,442
Yes.

307
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,162
Prim.

308
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,082
If that is spread around,

309
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,762
and they realize that the program doesn't exist,

310
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:37,082
they'll think we give special treatment.

311
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:41,282
I haven't thought that far. I'm sorry.

312
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:42,962
Forget it. It's already done.

313
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:47,015
But next time,

314
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,562
if you want to use your money to help patients, talk to me first.

315
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:53,242
You don't have to get yourself in trouble.

316
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:55,162
Okay.

317
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,282
It's good that you want to help patients.

318
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:04,122
- But being too close to... - Dr. Prim.

319
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:05,602
Excuse me, Professor.

320
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:08,959
- Mr. Chat will receive a donated heart soon. - Really?

321
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,082
There's a website for online organ donation.

322
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:15,642
A lot of people have used this. That's why we got it a lot faster.

323
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,979
Okay.

324
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,642
We have to get Mr. Chat's heart from Suraphaet Chonburi University Hospital

325
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:24,305
within 24 hours, Professor.

326
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,536
Prim.

327
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:28,242
- Call an urgent meeting. - Okay.

328
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:34,162
There's an operation I have to do.

329
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:36,162
I don't think I can harvest the heart myself.

330
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:37,722
I talked to Professor Athit,

331
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:41,482
a cardiac surgeon from Suraphaet Hospital.

332
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:44,522
Pleum, I'll leave you to divide the work among yourselves.

333
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:48,362
Prim and I will stay with you to prepare for the operation. Nick,

334
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:49,722
Mummim,

335
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:52,242
and Shoan,

336
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,962
you'll go get the heart.

337
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,722
For the harvesting team,

338
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,482
you have to be punctual.

339
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:07,202
The operation can't take more than four hours. Remember that.

340
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:08,602
Yes.

341
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,002
Will we be alright?

342
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:16,962
We still have to take the heart to the hospital first.

343
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:18,202
Let's go.

344
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,522
Shoan!

345
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:20,762
Let's go.

346
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Yes.

347
00:24:25,802 --> 00:24:26,802
Shoan.

348
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:29,442
Do your best.

349
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,442
Do your best too.

350
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:56,242
Prim, prepare the operating room and check on the patient.

351
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:58,122
- Yes. - (Fourth floor.)

352
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:02,002
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

353
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:06,242
- Hello, Professor. - Hello.

354
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,002
(The doors are closing.)

355
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:20,882
I heard that you're using Shoan for work.

356
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:25,074
Those kids split their work among themselves.

357
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:28,122
That's also an important job.

358
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:31,522
If you didn't trust someone, you wouldn't let them go.

359
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:39,242
I know that you want him to be a doctor,

360
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:42,842
but aren't you afraid that someone else will use this to attack you?

361
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,042
I'm an old man, Win.

362
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:50,762
My future

363
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:54,402
isn't as important as the future of children who are growing up.

364
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,166
Later, Win.

365
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:22,842
Mim, are you alright? Is there something wrong?

366
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:28,322
Nothing. It's my first harvest, so I'm a little nervous.

367
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:33,042
Come on. After we're done, you can go on a date with your boyfriend.

368
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:34,322
Okay.

369
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,962
But your face doesn't seem like you're happy.

370
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:45,722
What are you so nosy for?

371
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,762
Calm down!

372
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,922
Shoan didn't mean it. Why would you have to be so mad?

373
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:54,122
Sure.

374
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:06,562
We're flying to get your donated heart.

375
00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:10,522
You'll get an operation within four hours.

376
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:12,042
Are you ready?

377
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:14,762
I'm ready.

378
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,882
Please save your strength.

379
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,088
It's already raining.

380
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,642
It's already raining.

381
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,602
Mali.

382
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,322
Why do you make that kind of face?

383
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:33,882
I'll be cured after I get the treatment. We'll get to go home soon.

384
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:36,962
Ta.

385
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:39,882
Don't worry about Konmek.

386
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:41,842
We'll get to go home soon.

387
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:44,202
Mali.

388
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:47,682
Take your sister out for dinner.

389
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,042
But, Dad...

390
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:53,222
Just go. She's probably hungry now.

391
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:56,282
Doctor.

392
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:02,242
Please take my daughters out for a meal.

393
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,163
I'll be back soon, Dad.

394
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:12,522
Don't worry. The doctor is always by my side.

395
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:15,482
You should go.

396
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:25,682
Dr. Prim.

397
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:29,032
All I ask you is this.

398
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:37,442
(Suraphaet Chonburi University Hospital)

399
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:50,928
- Where? - This way, please.

400
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,002
Dr. Pleum, have you seen Mata?

401
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:58,842
She isn't in the special room?

402
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:01,762
She's not there. I only left her for a bit to get water.

403
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:04,082
What's wrong?

404
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,082
Mata is gone. I still haven't found her.

405
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,002
Chat has to go to the OR soon.

406
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,522
- Pleum, go find her. - Sure.

407
00:29:21,162 --> 00:29:22,922
Aortic cross clamp.

408
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,922
Cross clamp on.

409
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:35,562
Cardioplegia.

410
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:37,522
Ice, please.

411
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:41,362
Cardioplegia is running out.

412
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:43,362
Metzenbaum, please.

413
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,024
Prepare the bag.

414
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:05,802
Tie it up.

415
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:20,842
Stay safe.

416
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:36,122
Dad.

417
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:40,802
Mali.

418
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,522
Where is Mata?

419
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:45,842
Oh...

420
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,362
She's probably with Dr. Pleum.

421
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:50,882
They're probably buying food downstairs.

422
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:52,682
When you get out,

423
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,602
she and I will be waiting for you here.

424
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,562
It's raining heavily.

425
00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:25,442
I don't think we can fly anymore.

426
00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:27,065
We have to do an emergency landing.

427
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:29,802
I'll tell them to provide you with an ambulance.

428
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:45,242
- This way, Doctor. - Yes.

429
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:47,715
- The police will be waiting at the halfway point. - Yes.

430
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,876
We're going to perform an open-heart surgery. Blade, please.

431
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:46,082
We have a problem!

432
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:49,242
There's a hole in the container. It can't keep the temperature.

433
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:52,602
When will we arrive? There's a problem with the container.

434
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,322
In half an hour if these cars make way.

435
00:32:57,426 --> 00:33:00,642
- Shoan, Mummim, stay in the car and look after the container. - Yes.

436
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:11,002
Can you please move your car out of the way?

437
00:33:11,194 --> 00:33:13,754
We have to take a heart to the hospital as soon as we can.

438
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:16,882
Do you think you're the only one in a hurry?

439
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:20,527
Sir, I'm being nice to you.

440
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:22,162
That's not my business.

441
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:25,042
Go away. This is so annoying.

442
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,002
Hey, Shoan!

443
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:36,802
Where are you going?

444
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:39,762
Where are you going? Shoan!

445
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:41,242
Shoan!

446
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:42,562
Shoan!

447
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,602
Good evening, I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, 26 years old.

448
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,482
I'm a first-year resident at GMC Medical Center.

449
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,652
It's necessary for me to use this ice cream tank

450
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,065
right now.

451
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:09,162
Sir, please move your car out of the ambulance's way.

452
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:11,722
Quick!

453
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:13,902
So annoying!

454
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:15,362
Thank you.

455
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,402
Mummim, where's Shoan?

456
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,250
I don't know where he is.

457
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:31,562
We can go now. Shall we go?

458
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:36,082
- Wait! Shoan is coming! - Don't go yet.

459
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,122
Wait!

460
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:44,682
I got a new container.

461
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:46,762
You can go now! Go!

462
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,642
Come with me!

463
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,562
I think it's fine now.

464
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:01,442
Removing the old heart.

(Son Thong Ice Cream)

466
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:37,922
You guys

467
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:40,497
did really well.

468
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:44,922
Go.

469
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:48,522
Shoan.

470
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,082
Have you seen Mata here at all?

471
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:54,065
I don't know where she is. I'm worried she's not in the hospital.

472
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:05,242
I'd like to go outside.

473
00:37:05,404 --> 00:37:06,404
Where are you going?

474
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:10,642
Shoan!

475
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,002
Shoan!

476
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:25,002
The new heart is in place.

477
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,522
Okay. Prepare for anastomosis.

478
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:07,362
Mata.

479
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:08,882
Mata.

480
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,242
Mata.

481
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,322
Mata.

482
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:30,522
Mata.

483
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:33,402
Doctor, Konmek is afraid of thunder.

484
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:35,506
I'm afraid it might disappear.

485
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:39,202
I want to go see Dad, but I don't know how to go there.

486
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:41,882
You can follow me.

487
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:44,482
I'll take you to the hospital to see your dad.

488
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,882
Will my dad get better soon?

489
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,642
Your dad had his heart changed.

490
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,402
Your dad will get better.

491
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,842
Follow me.

492
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,722
Stitch it.

493
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,322
We'll start with the left atrium.

494
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:26,842
Followed by the inferior vena cava.

495
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:29,842
Then, the superior vena cava.

496
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:35,585
Mali!

497
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:43,710
I'm sorry. I was worried about Konmek.

498
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,600
It's fine, Mata.

499
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:48,762
Where's Dad? I want to see Dad.

500
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:54,682
We'll wait for him here.

501
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:57,962
He just went in to strengthen his heart.

502
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:02,002
Do you remember what our dad is good at?

503
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:03,378
He's good at running.

504
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:05,082
Yes.

505
00:40:06,305 --> 00:40:07,602
When he comes out,

506
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,082
the three of us will run back to our home.

507
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,682
Do you want to run with Dad?

508
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:15,522
I want to. I'm the best runner!

509
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:19,242
The best in the world.

510
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:38,162
We'll perform de-airing

511
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,282
to remove air out of all the heart chambers.

512
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,842
Here is the thing you asked me to help find.

513
00:40:58,602 --> 00:40:59,602
Thank you.

514
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,042
You did great today

515
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:10,042
to resolve that situation.

516
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,762
If there were only me,

517
00:41:14,955 --> 00:41:16,962
I wouldn't know what to do.

518
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:18,682
Thank you.

519
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:20,802
And

520
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:22,922
I'm sorry.

521
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:28,482
It's not that I don't like you.

522
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:32,242
What you say just always hits a nerve with me.

523
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:34,842
I was actually sad,

524
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:38,282
but I didn't want my co-workers to see that I was sad.

525
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:43,922
That's why I could only smile and say I was alright.

526
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:46,556
Do humans have to do this?

527
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,402
If we didn't do that,

528
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:55,042
we wouldn't look like a professional.

529
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:56,722
I get it now.

530
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,202
What?

531
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:01,847
Patients and their relatives

532
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,762
all like to smile,

533
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:06,275
but their eyes

534
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:08,002
seem really sad.

535
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:10,562
That must mean they're sick,

536
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:13,202
but they tell other people they're fine.

537
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:16,682
That's probably because

538
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,567
curing your mind is a lot harder

539
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,082
than curing your physical body.

540
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:26,729
But I still don't get

541
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:30,602
how lying can make you stop feeling sad.

542
00:42:42,378 --> 00:42:44,378
My anastomosis is done.

543
00:42:44,617 --> 00:42:46,122
Cross clamp off.

544
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:47,642
Prim, you can continue.

545
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:48,882
Yes.

546
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:52,362
Defib at 20 joules.

547
00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:57,842
Twenty joules.

548
00:42:59,122 --> 00:43:01,722
One, two, three.

549
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:03,002
Clear.

550
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:07,555
How is it?

551
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,442
His heart rhythm is still V-fib, Professor.

552
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:11,382
Use 40 joules this time.

553
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,522
Forty joules. One, two, three.

554
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:16,842
Clear.

555
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:28,322
Professor, his new heart still doesn't start beating.

556
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:34,722
How much medicine have we used?

557
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:37,154
Right now, dobutamine is at 10, adrenaline is at 2,

558
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:38,682
and Primacor is at 0.5.

559
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:40,682
Suction.

560
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:52,242
The anastomosis is fine.

561
00:43:52,873 --> 00:43:54,793
Professor, should we use ECMO?

562
00:44:07,454 --> 00:44:08,976
Dr. Prim.

563
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:11,793
All I ask you is this.

564
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,882
If this operation fails...

565
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:17,978
Chat...

566
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:20,482
Please let me go.

567
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:23,202
You don't have to use

568
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:26,922
any machine to try to perform life support for my heart

569
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:29,042
or for my lungs.

570
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:31,042
I beg you.

571
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,442
I don't want to be a bother for my daughters.

572
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:37,162
If I can't go on,

573
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,010
please let me go.

574
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:42,522
Chat...

575
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:46,682
Please promise me.

576
00:44:52,282 --> 00:44:53,442
I promise.

577
00:44:56,482 --> 00:44:58,202
Thank you.

578
00:44:59,955 --> 00:45:01,602
You should have a lot of rest.

579
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:05,762
Please do rest.

580
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:08,522
I'll do my best.

581
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,442
(Refusal of Life-Sustaining Treatment)

582
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,882
(Close Associate: Dr. Primlada Echawalanon)

583
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,042
Prim.

584
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:56,802
Prim.

585
00:45:58,602 --> 00:45:59,602
Dr. Prim!

586
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:02,882
That's enough.

587
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:07,882
He's already gone.

588
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,882
Mr. Suchat Jitdee

589
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:30,202
passed away at 7.05 pm.

590
00:46:45,793 --> 00:46:47,162
Dr. Prim.

591
00:46:47,323 --> 00:46:48,682
Where's Dad?

592
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,442
Where's my dad?

593
00:47:00,162 --> 00:47:01,482
Your dad

594
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:03,282
has passed away.

595
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,682
Where's Dad?

596
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,602
Mali, where's Dad?

597
00:47:19,282 --> 00:47:21,282
Dad has gone to heaven.

598
00:47:21,582 --> 00:47:24,002
I want to go to heaven with him.

599
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:29,961
You can't.

600
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,042
You can't go to heaven right now.

601
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:36,282
Why hasn't Dad come back?

602
00:47:36,505 --> 00:47:39,202
Dr. Shoan said Dad would come back.

603
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,882
Thank you, Prim,

604
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:44,402
for always helping us.

605
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:47,642
You have to look after your sister from now on.

606
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:53,402
Your dad was really proud of you. He also really loved you.

607
00:48:56,722 --> 00:48:57,962
You'll be fine.

608
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:00,842
Let's have dinner together next time, alright?

609
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,042
Professor.

610
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:19,762
I'll take my leave now.

611
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,642
I have to have dinner with my family.

612
00:49:21,723 --> 00:49:23,482
Nick, I'll go with you.

613
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:25,481
- Sure. I'll give you a lift. - See you soon.

614
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,562
Sure.

615
00:49:26,948 --> 00:49:27,948
See you soon.

616
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:29,642
Bye-bye, Shoan.

617
00:49:51,223 --> 00:49:54,282
Doctor, please help me.

618
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,802
How did it get up there?

619
00:50:00,018 --> 00:50:02,018
How did Konmek get up there?

620
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,962
It ran away from another big dog.

621
00:50:04,076 --> 00:50:06,362
I didn't know how it got up there.

622
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:09,842
I need a chair.

623
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:15,362
Come on.

624
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:19,362
What?

625
00:50:21,178 --> 00:50:22,682
Climb on my shoulder.

626
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,202
I can't.

627
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,602
A younger person shouldn't climb on an older person's shoulder.

628
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:31,002
It has to be you.

629
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,442
These kids can't reach it.

630
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:33,842
Quick.

631
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,322
If you don't climb on me,

632
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:39,482
I'll consider that you fail a test.

633
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:44,082
Are you really going to be my chair?

634
00:50:44,163 --> 00:50:45,621
- Are you going to climb? - Yes.

635
00:50:45,702 --> 00:50:47,162
Good. That's it.

636
00:50:50,184 --> 00:50:51,482
Come on.

637
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,082
Excuse me.

638
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:08,322
Have you gotten it?

639
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:11,138
Konmek!

640
00:51:21,997 --> 00:51:24,202
Yeah!

641
00:51:24,402 --> 00:51:25,605
You're so awesome!

642
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,082
Thank you.

643
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,153
Do you like dogs?

644
00:51:37,282 --> 00:51:38,562
It's a frequency wave.

645
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:42,202
It has a single-frequency wave, so it's easy to understand.

646
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:43,707
When it likes something,

647
00:51:43,788 --> 00:51:45,082
it'll express itself.

648
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,962
If it likes something, it'll go close to it.

649
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:48,922
If not, it'll try to threaten it.

650
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:51,810
Is that why you understand animals and children

651
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:53,442
better than your usual people?

652
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,002
Well...

653
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:05,782
It's good that you have kindness and sympathy for patients.

654
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:08,122
However,

655
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:10,332
don't promise anyone that they'll be safe.

656
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:15,642
We don't know what is going to happen during or after the surgery.

657
00:52:18,616 --> 00:52:21,456
If you want to be a good doctor, there's still a lot you need to learn.

658
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:26,322
Got it.

659
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,642
There's a lot I need to learn.

660
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:40,602
We're done now. Should we go?

661
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:49,851
Did you get beat up by someone?

662
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:51,978
- There's a footprint here. - Really?

663
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:53,322
Yeah.

664
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,502
It needs to be sent to the laundry.

665
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:57,802
Just forget it.

666
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:03,442
- Shoan, let's go home. - Yes.

667
00:53:05,184 --> 00:53:06,184
Wait...

668
00:53:06,506 --> 00:53:07,762
Are you living together?

669
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,282
What are you saying?

670
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:11,882
Why did you say it like that? That's creepy.

671
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:14,475
Shoan is living in Professor Prapas' room.

672
00:53:14,586 --> 00:53:16,282
He's in the opposite room of mine.

673
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:17,882
- That's right. - Yeah.

674
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,842
Don't say that to anyone else. It's creepy.

675
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:25,362
We're leaving. Goodbye.

676
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:48,802
(Hello, Win.)

677
00:53:49,804 --> 00:53:51,482
I'll go there with you, Mom.

678
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,082
Let's meet up at that place.

679
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:58,042
Yes.

680
00:54:13,242 --> 00:54:15,242
Are you a professional, Dr. Prim?

681
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:18,842
What?

682
00:54:18,962 --> 00:54:20,762
If you're a professional,

683
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:22,642
you'll say you're fine,

684
00:54:22,723 --> 00:54:24,482
although you're not fine.

685
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,402
I...

686
00:54:29,908 --> 00:54:32,122
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me, though.

687
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,422
You look like Dr. Mummim.

688
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,482
Your eyes and face seem sad,

689
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:49,418
but you said you're not sad.

690
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:50,682
Why did you have to lie?

691
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:52,482
I'm not lying, Shoan.

692
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,042
Why does everyone have to be like this? Why?

693
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:57,921
- Why do they think of other people's feelings more... - Shoan.

694
00:54:58,009 --> 00:54:59,354
Why? Is it because

695
00:54:59,435 --> 00:55:02,162
curing your mind is a lot harder than curing your physical body?

696
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:04,442
Shoan, can you stop talking about this?

697
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:18,036
Shoan, don't ask anything now, please.

698
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,802
I don't want to lie to others. I don't want to lie to myself either.

699
00:55:28,018 --> 00:55:31,162
But can you please try to understand that I don't know what to do?

700
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:38,162
If I didn't ask Chat to get the operation, he'd still be alive now.

701
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:45,215
If I could turn back time, I wouldn't do that. I feel like

702
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,642
I'm the one who caused his death, got it?

703
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,722
If you get that,

704
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,842
please be quiet for now.

705
00:56:35,486 --> 00:56:38,402
(Dr. Prim...)

706
00:56:46,624 --> 00:56:50,882
(Dr. Prim is unwell. She needs to be cured.)

707
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:59,703
(Things that can make Dr. Prim feel better: First, playing a joke.)

708
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:26,039
(Second, Dr. Prim likes physical touch. Third, Dr. Prim likes latte.)

709
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:40,802
Shoan.

710
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:43,322
Shoan.

711
00:57:44,282 --> 00:57:45,402
Shoan.

712
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:50,122
Why didn't you sleep on the sofa?

713
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:07,402
Do you want to go grab a bite?

714
00:58:09,891 --> 00:58:12,731
There are a lot of patients in the ward. It's going to be a long night.

715
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,139
(Shoan is going to buy some food. Does anyone want something?)

716
00:58:27,163 --> 00:58:29,401
(I want phat kaphrao with crispy pork belly.)

717
00:58:29,482 --> 00:58:32,242
(I want cold green tea with pork phat kaphrao.)

718
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,472
Are you going with me, Dr. Prim?

719
00:58:37,576 --> 00:58:39,865
Yeah, I'm already starving.

720
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:45,161
Dr. Prim.

721
00:58:48,682 --> 00:58:50,242
Are you okay now?

722
00:58:55,913 --> 00:58:57,122
I'm okay.

723
00:58:58,978 --> 00:59:00,762
You're a professional.

724
00:59:02,842 --> 00:59:05,322
A doctor who can do her best to save patients

725
00:59:05,522 --> 00:59:06,762
is a professional.

726
00:59:06,892 --> 00:59:08,202
Therefore, today,

727
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:11,409
I allow you to drink a latte with an added sweetness

728
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,842
to cure your mind.

729
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:18,482
I was going to drink it anyway.

730
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:29,562
When was the first time you got into the OR, Dr. Prim?

731
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,282
When I was a first-year resident.

732
00:59:32,442 --> 00:59:35,562
But it was quite a while until I actually got to operate.

733
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:38,122
When will Professor Archawin let me go into the OR?

734
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:41,242
That's a difficult question, you know.

735
01:00:08,322 --> 01:00:09,522
Is something the matter?

736
01:00:09,682 --> 01:00:10,930
Why do you all look so stressed?

737
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:12,468
Hello, Mr. Aof.

738
01:00:12,586 --> 01:00:13,642
You look nice today.

739
01:00:13,723 --> 01:00:15,642
Have you been to a cosplay event?

740
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:17,842
Or are you actually a transgender?

741
01:00:22,729 --> 01:00:25,842
You're so funny, Sea Lion Doctor.

742
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,409
I want to be a fish.

743
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,042
I don't want anything from you.

744
01:00:30,178 --> 01:00:31,482
Don't donate anything to me.

745
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,042
I was born this way.

746
01:00:33,124 --> 01:00:34,554
I can't be cured of it, Professor.

747
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:36,042
I'll prove to you

748
01:00:36,123 --> 01:00:37,603
that I can do everything like others.
