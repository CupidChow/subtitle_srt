(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,082
Another glass of beer, please. Miss Maysa.

3
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:33,322
I'm really sorry.

4
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:34,858
- Has she drunk a lot? - Easy.

5
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,220
- If I take her up... - Can I address you by your name?

6
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,002
I think we're already close.

7
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:40,442
- Are you okay? - Sure.

8
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:41,762
- I... - Here. Right here.

9
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:43,602
Whether Shoan misunderstood or not,

10
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,802
- you have to find out on your own. - Sit down.

11
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,122
Very good.

12
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,002
You told me you liked me.

13
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:51,362
- I didn't know what to do. - Prim.

14
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:55,802
Did you drink too much last night?

15
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,059
Are you alright, Prim?

16
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:02,714
Everyone, good morning.

17
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:08,282
Dr. Prim, good morning.

18
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:13,905
I'm sorry

19
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,402
for raising my voice against you.

20
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,402
Actually,

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,442
it's not your fault that you

22
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:28,682
said you like me, you know?

23
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:31,922
I just don't know what to do.

24
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:35,602
Can we be normal like before?

25
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:39,642
Yes, we can.

26
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:49,482
Does anyone want coffee?

27
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,059
- I'm going to the cafe. - The usual.

28
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,122
- Me too. - The usual.

29
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,602
Dr. Prim, extra sweet latte, right?

30
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:08,882
That film...

31
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:10,642
Did you find it?

32
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:12,962
It's not here, honey.

33
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:14,722
It is here.

34
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:17,482
Did a cleaner throw it away?

35
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:21,082
That's not it. The cleaners won't touch a patient's stuff.

36
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,722
What is this bag? Did someone forget it?

37
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,522
Whose is that?

38
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:29,203
This is inside.

39
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:34,802
Shoan.

40
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,802
Honey, look. Your son printed this for you.

41
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:05,522
I miss Shin too.

42
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,962
Closer together. Ready!

43
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,762
Say cheese! One, two, three!

44
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,282
Very nice.

45
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,522
- Here. - Thank you.

46
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:31,171
Shoan.

47
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:33,522
That lady gave me this.

48
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:36,442
It's broken.

49
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:40,442
It's just a little damaged. I can fix it.

50
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:49,722
Play with others sometimes.

51
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,202
You need friends.

52
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:53,850
I have one.

53
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,882
Stay here. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back.

54
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,402
Okay?

55
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,602
O.

56
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,242
Let me join.

57
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:16,842
Bas, let my brother join.

58
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,402
No. Your brother is a freak.

59
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:24,962
He's not a freak. He's smart.

60
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,362
He's good at drawing too.

61
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,762
Then, he can draw on his own.

62
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:29,042
Bas, let's play.

63
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,123
My mom told me to stay away from the retarded.

64
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,762
Bo, watch your mouth.

65
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:37,066
It's the truth. Who would want to play with your bro?

66
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:41,522
Then prove to us that your brother isn't retarded.

67
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,762
Fine. How?

68
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:56,882
Last week, Joke kicked the ball in there.

69
00:06:57,162 --> 00:07:01,082
If you can get it out, I'll play with your little bro. Do you dare?

70
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,602
This is nothing. If I get you your ball,

71
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,002
- promise to let my bro in. - Yeah.

72
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:56,802
(Shinnawut Jatemeechai)

73
00:07:58,106 --> 00:07:59,722
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:02,362
Thanks.

75
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:04,002
There's a photo of Shin in this.

76
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:06,362
He would want you to have it.

77
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:12,082
Please be strong.

78
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:14,677
Okay.

79
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,306
Thank you so much.

80
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:25,802
They told Shin to go in, and he died.

81
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:49,642
Shet!

82
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:51,362
Nurse!

83
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,522
Nurse, please!

84
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:56,482
Help him. Shet?

85
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,202
Shet.

86
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,162
His cancer spreads very fast.

87
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,642
I would like you to prepare for the worst.

88
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,122
In his condition,

89
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,402
he would probably last two months.

90
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,042
(When Dad dies, )

91
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:47,362
(will he go to heaven?)

92
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,962
(I don't want him to go to heaven.)

93
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:52,762
(I don't want him to meet Shin there.)

94
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:04,682
(Episode 13: Rewind #1)

95
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,202
The kid fell from a high place. He has a pulmonary contusion.

96
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,456
- Shoan. - He's received his initial treatment.

97
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:20,902
He's breathing normally.

98
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:24,162
His Ox-sat and MRI results are normal,

99
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,162
but he still hasn't woken up.

100
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:32,122
If it's DAI, we can only give him palliative care

101
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,682
as he still has a chance to wake up, but we don't know how long it takes.

102
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,082
What we can do is to try to prevent complications.

103
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,722
He probably needs a long time.

104
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:44,682
The problem is not the fees, Prapas.

105
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:50,242
His father can pay. I recommended GMC because you have great professors.

106
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:51,962
Please take care of him.

107
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:54,042
We do our best for every case, Int.

108
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:59,602
Prim, tell the nurse to prepare ICP monitoring. Watch for brain swelling.

109
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,362
Shoan.

110
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:09,002
Shoan.

111
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,535
Shoan.

112
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,802
Yes?

113
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,762
Consult Professor Irin. Ask her to look at this case.

114
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,875
We'll meet tonight after our shift

115
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,257
- in the meeting room. - Yes.

116
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:22,362
Okay. Excuse us.

117
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:29,962
Shoan.

118
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,042
Come on.

119
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:37,282
- I'll leave him with you. - Okay.

120
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,578
What's wrong?

121
00:11:57,882 --> 00:11:59,082
It's Shin.

122
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,002
I miss Shin.

123
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:06,522
Are you worried about the patient just now?

124
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,282
The other day when...

125
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,082
When I was drunk,

126
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:24,562
you were the one

127
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:28,202
who took me upstairs, right?

128
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,642
I did. That was Professor Archawin's order.

129
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:36,082
I didn't do anything weird, did I?

130
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:38,722
You didn't.

131
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,917
You apologized three times.

132
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:42,882
- The first time is for... - That's okay.

133
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:46,002
You're not angry at me, right? Then that's good.

134
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:48,842
I'm not.

135
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,522
You made me promise that

136
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,482
I'd act normal.

137
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,162
Good.

138
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:07,802
It felt weird not talking to you.

139
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,682
Let me sleep on it.

140
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,962
There should be no problem.

141
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:25,482
Can I ask you something, Director?

142
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:27,151
In the next board meeting,

143
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,802
please update me on our security system.

144
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:31,442
Yes.

145
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:32,922
Goodbye.

146
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:41,802
Hello?

147
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,282
(Hello, Dr. Prapas.)

148
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,682
I'm Inspector Theeradej from the Samut Songkhram Police Department.

149
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:49,802
Yes, Dr. Prapas speaking.

150
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:52,081
(I would like you to look at a photo.)

151
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:54,042
I sent it to you. Please take a look.

152
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,242
(Yes, sir.)

153
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,482
(When we found the kid, )

154
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:40,442
(we also found a murdered body on the scene.)

155
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,522
Let's go.

156
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,122
Does it mean

157
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:56,842
there's a chance he might have seen the culprit's face?

158
00:14:57,202 --> 00:15:00,962
Does the culprit know our patient is still alive?

159
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,362
(Judging by the attempt to cover it up, )

160
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,322
(the suspect probably fled in a hurry.)

161
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,882
He probably thought the kid was dead.

162
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:12,162
Okay. We will do our best on our part.

163
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,922
Will there be police protection for the patient?

164
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,042
(We're considering that possibility.)

165
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,122
(If he wakes up, please let us know.)

166
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,322
Yes, sir.

167
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:25,002
Goodbye.

168
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,042
Excuse me. I'm the father of the kid in Room 3.

169
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:24,042
- Yes? - May I come in?

170
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:27,042
Wait a second, sir.

171
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,362
Okay.

172
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:35,202
On the scene of our patient's accident,

173
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:38,362
the police said a body was dumped there.

174
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,402
There was an attempt to cover up a murder.

175
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:43,802
It is possible that our patient

176
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,946
is a witness in the murder case.

177
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,602
Whether he is a witness or not,

178
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,002
I would like you all

179
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:53,562
to do your best for this case, focusing on our starting point.

180
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:57,082
Why does the patient not wake up? Prim.

181
00:16:57,826 --> 00:17:00,642
The patient is a ten-year-old male. He fell from a height.

182
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:03,322
We found pulmonary contusion.

183
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:05,885
He had epilepsy at the age of four.

184
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,502
He took antiepileptics

185
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:11,642
for two years and never had epilepsy again.

186
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:17,322
Come in.

187
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:19,482
I'm sorry I'm late.

188
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:21,122
Come on. Sit down.

189
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,962
We're trying to figure out why the patient isn't waking up.

190
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,562
- Prim, continue. - Yes.

191
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,922
This is his MRI scan.

192
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:33,562
There's no intracranial bleeding.

193
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,882
There's no brain swelling, either.

194
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:41,802
Is it possible that this is a metabolic cause?

195
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,282
Seeing as

196
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:45,602
his serum sodium is quite low.

197
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,682
His serum sodium is still at 130 millimoles per liter.

198
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,842
That doesn't explain why he's not waking up.

199
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:01,082
By the looks of this,

200
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:04,162
this is definitely a case of DAI.

201
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:07,281
I wanted you here because

202
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:10,402
I would like to explore other possible causes.

203
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,082
What is it, Shoan? What have you found?

204
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:19,882
No. Your brother is a freak. I'll play with your little bro.

205
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:39,842
Shoan.

206
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:42,162
Shoan.

207
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,682
Yes, Professor.

208
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,602
What's wrong? You seem spaced out.

209
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:53,202
You don't look focused. What's wrong?

210
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:55,442
I don't know.

211
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:02,802
I'm here to tell you that the next simulation will be delayed a bit.

212
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:06,562
But you have homework to research.

213
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,162
Do you remember?

214
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,722
Soft tissue sarcoma that causes PEA cardiac arrest.

215
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:15,522
Have you done that?

216
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:19,802
I remember the task,

217
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:24,769
but I haven't researched it yet. I'm sorry.

218
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:30,882
It's fine.

219
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,642
Just don't forget. By the way,

220
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,082
have you talked it out with Prim?

221
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,729
Don't be too harsh on her.

222
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,362
If you have time, visit the south with me.

223
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:55,562
Honestly, you have to make time for a trip with me.

224
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,802
I'll give you a tour. Oh my!

225
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,922
The beach has sea, sand, and sun.

226
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:01,682
Southern food? Do you like it spicy?

227
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,562
Not too much.

228
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,082
- Hello, Professors. - I'll...

229
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,402
- Hi. - Professor Phruek, hi.

230
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,942
- Yeah. - When did you come back?

231
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,122
I just got here today. I'm on shift.

232
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:13,203
It's my first shift back. Please go easy on me.

233
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,962
Go easy?

234
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:18,562
The ER just received an influx due to a riot during an ordination.

235
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:21,602
The monk-to-be and his family are all here.

236
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:24,122
And today is the end of the month.

237
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,002
Are you serious?

238
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:27,642
Not really.

239
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,842
It's good you're back, though. The young doctors miss you.

240
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:33,590
Good. I'll give them a long lecture.

241
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,441
By the way, we get serious cases often. Do the young doctors complain?

242
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:39,202
Professor.

243
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:42,002
Our guys' morale is really high.

244
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:45,642
I think it's not right, though. High morale can be burnt out without care.

245
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:46,922
You're right.

246
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,242
By the way, what did the board say about our security budget?

247
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,442
I think we're getting approved this time.

248
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:57,042
What we're definitely getting is a hemodialysis machine.

249
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:00,202
We might also get an ECMO machine soon.

250
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:03,082
- Awesome. - The director said this.

251
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:07,402
All we have to focus on is treating the patients and nothing else.

252
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,642
- Whoa! - That's all we ask.

253
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:11,979
It looks like you're having fun conversing.

254
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,140
What are you talking about?

255
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,642
Us doctors' quality of life.

256
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,042
Then let me join in.

257
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:24,162
Do you have time, Professors? This conversation will be pretty long.

258
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,681
Yes. They have time.

259
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,922
- They have all the time for you. - Yeah.

260
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,202
Two minutes. I have to go to OPD next.

261
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:32,402
Go on. I'm starting the timer.

262
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:33,962
- You put on a timer? - Yeah.

263
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,402
I don't like it.

264
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:37,642
I don't like a certain co-worker.

265
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:41,900
They're making me feel like I don't belong here.

266
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:45,020
Maybe I should move to a private hospital.

267
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:50,282
If she wanted to go, she would have left by now. People asked her out.

268
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:51,832
I can't help it. I'm good-looking.

269
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,082
Asked her out of here.

270
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:55,962
You're one to talk. People asked you out too.

271
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:57,707
I can't help it. I'm good-looking.

272
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:59,522
Asked you out of here.

273
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:02,642
(Nurse Counter)

274
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:12,682
Post-op, day seven.

275
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:17,002
You're recovering well. You should be able to go home in a few days.

276
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:30,219
I want you to be there for tomorrow's meeting with Director Sirin.

277
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:32,082
- Okay. - Clear your schedule.

278
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,610
And... Int?

279
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,642
- Good morning. - Good morning.

280
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:39,028
Are you here to see the patient?

281
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:41,002
- I am. - Why did you come that way?

282
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,682
I need exercise. It's a good walk, Prapas.

283
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:47,602
I prefer stairs. I would sit around all day otherwise.

284
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:52,842
Win, this is Professor Inthira. She's Gamer's doctor who referred him.

285
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:55,082
This is Archawin.

286
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,082
He's one of our best surgeons.

287
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:03,402
Professor Inthira, you do care about your patients.

288
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:06,002
Doctors don't usually visit their referred cases.

289
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:07,865
I have been his doctor since he was a baby.

290
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,602
I want to stay with him all the way.

291
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:13,802
If you need his record or anything, let me know. I'll prepare it for you.

292
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,242
Prapas, I need to talk to you privately.

293
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,098
Please feel free. I have to go to OPD.

294
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:23,482
- Excuse me, Professor. - Goodbye.

295
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:32,642
I'm afraid you'd think I made another mistake.

296
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,402
I looked thoroughly. There was really no sign.

297
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,762
A human's body is complicated,

298
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,722
especially the brain.

299
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,962
We see what we see, but there is probably something hidden,

300
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:49,202
even if it's someone you treated for decades.

301
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:52,602
You're right.

302
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,122
It's because of you that I realized

303
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,002
what really matters most.

304
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:03,442
Shoan is really lucky that you gave him a chance.

305
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:09,402
I think it's safe to say that

306
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:12,185
Shoan never wastes his opportunity.

307
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:14,282
That's a better way to put it.

308
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,202
I'll leave him in your care.

309
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:45,722
- Of course. - Sir.

310
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:47,842
- Hello. - Dr. Int, hi.

311
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,317
Are you going home already?

312
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,145
Yes, I'm actually leaving.

313
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,402
And...

314
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:59,802
Thank you so much for your transfer and follow-up.

315
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:01,282
It's okay.

316
00:25:01,522 --> 00:25:04,162
I've been treating him since he was a baby.

317
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,546
I moved to a private hospital,

318
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:08,681
but I know a lot of doctors here.

319
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:10,722
I also want to check on him myself.

320
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:15,002
When he had epilepsy as a child,

321
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,722
without you, he would have been worse.

322
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:19,442
It's alright, sir.

323
00:25:19,547 --> 00:25:24,082
You should take care of yourself. Get some rest. You need to watch him.

324
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,042
Of course.

325
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:27,522
I'll be on my way.

326
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:30,202
Okay. See you later. Goodbye.

327
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,802
Dr. Shoan.

328
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:35,442
- Hello. - Hi.

329
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,122
You're the kid with...

330
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:45,082
You're the kid under Professor Prapas' care in Samut Sakhon, right?

331
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:48,642
If you mean the kid with autism, that's me.

332
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:52,402
Yes.

333
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:55,762
You're amazing. Professor Prapas is a great judge of people.

334
00:25:56,002 --> 00:25:59,362
It's unbelievable you really became a doctor.

335
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:02,122
That's what most people think.

336
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:06,482
- Right. - The patient is epileptic.

337
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:09,231
He had an epilepsy at four years old.

338
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:12,170
He had an epilepsy at four years old.

339
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:24,482
Dr. Shoan.

340
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,840
If you mean the kid with autism, that's me.

341
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:54,082
You were childhood friends with my brother.

342
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,162
How do you feel?

343
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:57,642
What did you say?

344
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,962
I wonder how you feel.

345
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:05,842
About what?

346
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,122
You were childhood friends with Shin, my brother.

347
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,642
How do you feel seeing me again after all this time?

348
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,562
I'm not good at reading people's feelings.

349
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:19,522
I have to ask you directly.

350
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,602
Doctor.

351
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,202
The patient in ICU 3 has increased ICP.

352
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,722
Should I call Dr. Prim?

353
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:35,162
- Call her here. - Right.

354
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:38,297
Doctor.

355
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:44,842
I need to treat the patient.

356
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,122
Dr. Prim, come in.

357
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:02,922
This is not normal. His ICP is unusually high.

358
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:05,002
Okay. Give me 30 mcg of Fentanyl.

359
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,922
Release CSF too.

360
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:18,082
(When he had epilepsy as a child, without you, he would have been worse.)

361
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,442
Nystagmus,

362
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:23,622
tachycardia,

363
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,082
increased ICP.

364
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:28,506
We have a problem, Dr. Prim! Call Professor Prapas.

365
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:35,962
The patient fell from a height with a lung contusion.

366
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:38,244
His MRI shows DAI.

367
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:39,962
No other metabolic causes.

368
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:42,402
- (Yes, Prim?) - Professor, it's ICU 3.

369
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:44,522
Nystagmus with a sympathetic response.

370
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,812
- Shoan, go on. - It's status epilepticus, Professor.

371
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:48,122
The patient had epilepsy before.

372
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,642
He probably had epilepsy during the accident.

373
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:52,002
He was unconscious,

374
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:55,082
so there was no visible symptom of epilepsy.

375
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:57,299
He has been epileptic for 36 hours.

376
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,292
If we don't hurry up, we could lose him.

377
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,162
(Okay, Shoan, Prim.)

378
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:04,842
(Give him diazepam, 0.3 milligrams per kilo of body weight.)

379
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:07,042
(Through the IV. I'm on my way.)

380
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,402
(Consult Professor Noon, our neuropediatrician.)

381
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:10,842
- Okay. - Yes.

382
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,922
Give him diazepam, 0.3 milligrams per kilo, through IV.

383
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:24,682
Professor, how is my son doing?

384
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:28,722
Dr. Shoan found the cause. It's status epilepticus.

385
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:31,128
We gave him antiepileptics.

386
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:34,282
We're also consulting our neuropediatrician.

387
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:36,362
He probably needs a brain wave test

388
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,242
to see if there is epilepsy.

389
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,590
If there is, he will continue to take antiepileptics until the wave stops.

390
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,162
There is a good chance the patient will wake up.

391
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:48,242
He doesn't need surgery, right?

392
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:51,122
No. We can treat him with drugs for now.

393
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:53,362
Thank you, Professor.

394
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:54,962
Thank you too.

395
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:09,937
I thought this case would make you feel uncomfortable.

396
00:30:15,657 --> 00:30:16,802
It did.

397
00:30:18,537 --> 00:30:20,442
Whenever I see this patient,

398
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,754
he reminds me of Shin.

399
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,282
And

400
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,802
the patient's father

401
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:33,562
was the one who told Shin and me to go into that abandoned house

402
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:35,522
where it happened.

403
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,002
You mean,

404
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,642
you're more concerned with the patient's father.

405
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:47,562
No. A doctor can't choose his patient.

406
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:49,962
But

407
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:52,682
I'm just wondering.

408
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,562
At first, I was worried.

409
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,242
His MRI results

410
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:07,682
only show DAI, with no other causes for not waking up.

411
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:11,082
His EEG found an epileptic wave.

412
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:14,922
We gave him antiepileptics, and we're monitoring his condition.

413
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:17,826
I should have stayed a bit longer.

414
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,762
Anyway, I'll leave him in your care because

415
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,722
I won't be able to visit him for a couple of days.

416
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:28,322
Int, you did your best. Don't blame yourself.

417
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:30,482
- Right. - (Okay?)

418
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:32,162
Yes. Thank you.

419
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:37,321
All right. Please continue, Officer.

420
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:39,242
At the time of the accident,

421
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,682
you had already finished your shift. Is that correct?

422
00:31:42,474 --> 00:31:44,057
I'd already finished.

423
00:31:44,138 --> 00:31:46,602
I headed straight home because I had plans.

424
00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:49,682
Doctor.

425
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,442
Have you seen this woman?

426
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,802
I've never seen her. I can't recognize her at all.

427
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:01,482
Who is this woman?

428
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,882
We found her body

429
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:06,162
at the scene of the boy's accident.

430
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:08,202
She was a pharmaceutical dealer

431
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:10,321
who was possibly involved with

432
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:11,962
illegal drug import.

433
00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:13,842
Oh gosh.

434
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:15,196
That's scary.

435
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:18,522
Also, have you seen this vehicle before?

436
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,002
I've never seen it.

437
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:31,082
To me, every vehicle looks the same.

438
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:33,402
I'm really sorry.

439
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:37,842
You came all the way here, but I couldn't help at all. I'm really sorry.

440
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:39,762
It was actually a big help.

441
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,202
If you find anything,

442
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:44,602
- please let me know. - Of course.

443
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:47,522
- I'll take my leave. - Right. Thank you.

444
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,602
Is it yummy?

445
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,002
Yes.

446
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,802
Why are you having lunch already?

447
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,402
It's not early. It's already lunch break.

448
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:28,802
Right now, I'm so full.

449
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,962
Both my workload and stomach.

450
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:32,802
Do you have many cases?

451
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:36,002
Why didn't you guys wait for me?

452
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:37,482
I'm hungry.

453
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,379
This one is for you.

454
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:43,082
I've already had one in the morning.

455
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,602
Thanks, Shoan. You're the best.

456
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,350
What's wrong?

457
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,442
You don't like green tea, do you?

458
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:03,849
No, I don't.

459
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:34,922
Prim.

460
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,642
- What? - Are you okay?

461
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:38,962
On period?

462
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,522
What period?

463
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:42,202
Look at you.

464
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:45,762
You look like you're ready to start a fight.

465
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:47,322
Don't exaggerate.

466
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,522
"The day Gio begins his journey,

467
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,346
he said..."

468
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:12,282
He likes to learn about viruses and germs and the like.

469
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,949
Sometimes, he learns the wrong thing.

470
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,682
"Gio, we have something to say."

471
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,562
My boy is strong.

472
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,522
(I'm just wondering)

473
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:55,762
if he forgot Shin.

474
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:06,162
You mean after that incident,

475
00:36:07,824 --> 00:36:09,812
you still think of Shin all the time.

476
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,642
And you're curious

477
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,643
if he, the one responsible for it,

478
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:17,322
still remembers Shin or not,

479
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:20,242
if he remembers the guilt or not.

480
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:25,322
Try to think this way.

481
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,122
Think about this.

482
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,738
After that incident,

483
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:35,025
how has he been living?

484
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,082
Has he been happy?

485
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,002
You see how much he is suffering with his son's illness.

486
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,602
I think that his guilt

487
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,482
is still there somewhere

488
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,522
in his heart.

489
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:29,071
The patient is alright now, isn't he?

490
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,922
Why are you still down?

491
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,842
I'm curious about something.

492
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,362
I'm trying to figure out an answer.

493
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:44,162
If there's something on your mind, you can tell me.

494
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Didn't we agree?

495
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:51,762
That we would talk normally.

496
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:53,882
If it's normal,

497
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
you'd wait until I say it first.

498
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:04,522
This is an emergency.

499
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:07,602
It's an emergency trouble, you know?

500
00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:10,882
What's wrong? You don't want to tell me anything now, huh?

501
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:20,682
Is it about Gamer?

502
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:25,442
Emergency or not,

503
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:28,162
you'll find out about it either way, Dr. Prim.

504
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:31,962
So,

505
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:35,602
do you want me to ask for permission before every meal?

506
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,402
Are you being sarcastic?

507
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,322
Next time, just let me know.

508
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:06,882
Win.

509
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:10,802
I have a meeting with our interior designer this Saturday. Want to join?

510
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,962
Do you have any specific request?

511
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:16,402
Request?

512
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,882
I would like three rooms for the kids.

513
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:40,442
Rin told me Shoan did something extraordinary today.

514
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,602
I'm not needed at all.

515
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:46,722
Come on, Professor Win.

516
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:49,322
Do you realize that since you started training Shoan,

517
00:39:49,498 --> 00:39:51,802
you have started to look more like a professor?

518
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:53,322
- Really? - Yeah.

519
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,722
I like teaching him too.

520
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:03,482
He makes me realize that I actually like teaching.

521
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:14,242
What's wrong, Win?

522
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,162
My back hurts.

523
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:20,602
I don't know what's wrong. Maybe I sit still too long.

524
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:22,962
Let me massage your back then.

525
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,642
Yeah. That's good.

526
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,042
Come on.

527
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:28,722
Where's the spot? Here?

528
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:30,802
That's it. Right there.

529
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:32,522
What about here?

530
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:34,762
- That too. - Here?

531
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,866
Yeah, a bit further up.

532
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:39,682
- Where is it? - Yes. Right there.

533
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:44,122
- Am I hitting the spot? - Ouch! Stop.

534
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:46,282
You can stop now.

535
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:48,362
I'm as good as new.

536
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,122
(Fourth floor.)

537
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:12,962
Excuse me.

538
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:14,522
Morning, Professor.

539
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:16,122
So it's you.

540
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:18,362
I was about to teach you manners.

541
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:21,202
I couldn't raise my hands. I'm holding these.

542
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,882
I had to do a little like...

543
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:26,482
You're too manly.

544
00:41:26,674 --> 00:41:28,162
Who would fall for you?

545
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:32,089
- Shoan may be the only one... - Wait!

546
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:34,630
What's wrong? It's nothing. We're in an elevator. Nobody can hear.

547
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:36,122
No. Don't make fun of me.

548
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:41,802
How is the referred kid doing?

549
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:44,202
He's okay now.

550
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:50,162
When Shoan scans with his eyes, he's awesome.

551
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,138
He never misses. I don't know how he does that.

552
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:55,522
Your eyes light up when you talk about Shoan.

553
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:57,922
They didn't light up.

554
00:41:58,011 --> 00:41:59,722
- My eyes were normal. - Oh?

555
00:41:59,805 --> 00:42:01,682
- I was talking normally. - I saw them.

556
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,962
- But... - The camera is on!

557
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:06,722
- Professor, morning. - Hi, Rin.

558
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,202
How's the kid in ICU doing?

559
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:15,027
He's getting better.

560
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:18,642
He's responding really well to drugs.

561
00:42:19,906 --> 00:42:21,842
Don't you want to talk about Shoan?

562
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:25,922
Good thing I ran into you. I have something to tell you.

563
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:28,242
Our branch in Chiang Mai

564
00:42:28,386 --> 00:42:30,643
is giving out a scholarship program for pediatric surgeons.

565
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,362
I heard you're interested, right?

566
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:35,139
- The application form is in my office. - Okay.

567
00:42:36,202 --> 00:42:37,482
Thank you.

568
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:01,282
Is it that bad?

569
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:04,442
Look at him.

570
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:08,842
He looks sad, like I'll die today or tomorrow.

571
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:12,162
Honey, can't you say something nice?

572
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:13,722
No, Dad.

573
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:17,002
Not today, nor tomorrow.

574
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,042
Shoan.

575
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,642
Can we bring our own food?

576
00:43:26,162 --> 00:43:28,402
Your dad is tired of the hospital food.

577
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,362
Maybe he can eat more.

578
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:36,242
You can, but it has to be bland. No seasoning.

579
00:43:36,636 --> 00:43:39,442
Okay. I'll make something bland.

580
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:42,882
- What about you? Would you... - I have a meeting with Professor Prapas.

581
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,962
- Excuse me. - Okay.

582
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:54,562
Just look at him.

583
00:44:09,402 --> 00:44:11,682
The patient is getting better. His epilepsy has stopped.

584
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:14,002
His ICP has returned to normal.

585
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,042
Shoan.

586
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:18,362
Would you like to inform his parent?

587
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,202
Yes.

588
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:39,882
I'm here to report the patient's condition.

589
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:53,362
After we found his status epilepticus,

590
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,882
we gave him drugs and re-tested his brain wave.

591
00:44:58,202 --> 00:44:59,482
Right now,

592
00:45:00,842 --> 00:45:02,562
we're only waiting for him to wake up.

593
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,002
What did you just say?

594
00:45:08,784 --> 00:45:10,784
We're only waiting for him to wake up.

595
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:12,562
So

596
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:14,922
My son is waking up, right?

597
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:19,362
His last brain wave test showed

598
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:21,322
that he's responding very well to treatment.

599
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:23,042
That's a good sign.

600
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,002
Do you have any questions?

601
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:45,475
I'll be honest with you, Doctor.

602
00:45:46,521 --> 00:45:47,762
Okay.

603
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,202
I really don't trust you.

604
00:46:01,482 --> 00:46:03,642
Why did you save my son?

605
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,442
You should hate me, right?

606
00:46:16,882 --> 00:46:18,722
Maybe you want to feel sorry for me

607
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:26,122
when my son took the fall for my karma?

608
00:46:33,722 --> 00:46:35,162
First question.

609
00:46:36,842 --> 00:46:38,722
The reason I saved your son is

610
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,324
because I'm a doctor.

611
00:46:40,822 --> 00:46:42,202
Second question.

612
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,802
You said I should hate you.

613
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:51,059
Yes, I did hate you,

614
00:46:51,236 --> 00:46:52,842
but not anymore.

615
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,562
Third question.

616
00:46:55,825 --> 00:46:58,562
Epilepsy is a brain problem, not karma.

617
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:09,187
Even though Shin died because of me?

618
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:16,122
I caused your brother's death.

619
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,322
I caused Shin's death.

620
00:47:22,353 --> 00:47:23,722
Aren't you going to hate me?

621
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,799
When I hated you,

622
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:39,162
the good memory of Shin in here, in my head,

623
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,979
it's all gone. I don't want it to be gone.

624
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:55,722
What is your memory of Shin?

625
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,722
What is it?

626
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,642
It's my son.

627
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,882
I see him every day.

628
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:30,442
How can I possibly forget

629
00:48:33,146 --> 00:48:34,642
that Shin died because of me?

630
00:48:39,986 --> 00:48:41,842
It's been 20 years, Doctor.

631
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,522
I'm not a bad guy, Doctor,

632
00:48:48,657 --> 00:48:50,682
but I sent someone to his death.

633
00:48:58,538 --> 00:48:59,842
(Shoan, listen to me.)

634
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:05,282
Even though he told you and Shin to go in,

635
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,922
believe me,

636
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:11,162
he didn't plan for the accident to happen.

637
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,602
Remember this.

638
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:16,242
Shin is still here.

639
00:49:18,682 --> 00:49:20,042
He's in your heart.

640
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,922
He's in your thoughts.

641
00:49:25,082 --> 00:49:28,042
If you become a doctor,

642
00:49:29,306 --> 00:49:31,306
if you save a lot of people...

643
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:33,962
Imagine this.

644
00:49:35,063 --> 00:49:36,762
The Shin in here,

645
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,402
how would he feel?

646
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:45,042
(Shinnawut Jatemeechai)

647
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:50,562
Thank you so much

648
00:49:51,642 --> 00:49:55,162
for never forgetting Shin in all of these 20 years.

649
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,242
Excuse me.

650
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,705
(You should keep your good memory of Shin.)

651
00:50:23,264 --> 00:50:25,362
(He would prefer that.)

652
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:44,633
Oh my god!

653
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:51,562
It's a quarter past midnight.

654
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,161
You're not allowed to take pictures and videos

655
00:51:00,242 --> 00:51:01,762
without permission.

656
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:05,882
Then I'm asking for your permission now.

657
00:51:08,393 --> 00:51:10,762
Can I take a selfie with you?

658
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:13,349
It's a quarter past midnight.

659
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,962
You should be resting in your ward.

660
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:17,882
Please.

661
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:21,642
Fine.

662
00:51:23,762 --> 00:51:26,362
- Please? - No, you can't.

663
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:01,162
- Prim. - Professor?

664
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,162
Why are you still here?

665
00:52:03,441 --> 00:52:04,522
I'm just leaving.

666
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:05,918
Are you alone on this shift?

667
00:52:06,064 --> 00:52:07,602
No, I'm with Shoan.

668
00:52:08,488 --> 00:52:10,842
- ICU 3, right? - Yes.

669
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:12,882
I'm counting on you.

670
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,562
- Of course. - Goodbye.

671
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:15,962
Goodbye.

672
00:52:58,181 --> 00:52:59,522
Who are you?

673
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:18,602
Help!

674
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:19,922
We have a cardiac arrest!

675
00:53:20,058 --> 00:53:22,193
We need a support team, emergency vehicle,

676
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:24,562
defibrillator, and cardiac board!

677
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:28,761
What's with you?

678
00:53:33,282 --> 00:53:34,962
I have to help him this time!

679
00:53:38,364 --> 00:53:39,682
(I have to save him!)

680
00:53:39,856 --> 00:53:43,562
One, two, three, four, five...

681
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,622
Seven, eight, nine...

682
00:53:46,743 --> 00:53:48,362
I have to save him!

683
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,050
One, two, three.

684
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,482
It's PEA. Continue pressing.

685
00:54:07,682 --> 00:54:10,162
Adrenaline 0.3 milligrams through IV.

686
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:13,282
Here's 0.3 milligrams of adrenaline.

687
00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:15,418
- Get Professor Win. He can come faster. - Five Hs.

688
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:19,011
Air, cold, low water, salt, sour. Air, hypoxia.

689
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,721
The patient is tubed.

690
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:23,362
His chest is moving regularly. Cold, hypothermia.

691
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:25,550
His temp is normal. Low water, hypovolemia.

692
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:27,661
There's no blood loss or dehydration.

693
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:29,482
Salt, hypokalemia.

694
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,362
Abnormal level of sodium? Sour, hyperacidemia.

695
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:34,539
Acidic blood? There's no evidence for the last two.

696
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:36,282
We can't rule them out, though.

697
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:40,422
I need 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. Thirty cc's through IV.

698
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,052
- Here's 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. - Five Ts. Clogged heart.

699
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:46,162
Coronary thrombus? The patient is not likely to have that. Clogged lungs?

700
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:48,841
Pulmonary thrombus? He's not likely to have that. Heart compression.

701
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:52,322
Cardiac tamponade. There's no cardiac injury. Lung compression.

702
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:54,202
Tension pneumothorax.

703
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,853
Both sides of his chest are moving evenly.

704
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:58,402
There's no trachea shift. No neck vein engorgement.

705
00:54:58,707 --> 00:54:59,722
Drugs?

706
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:01,322
Toxin...

707
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:03,562
Who are you?

708
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,642
Toxic. The patient was poisoned.

709
00:55:13,264 --> 00:55:14,882
Two minutes up.

710
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:22,162
Clear. Continue pressing.

711
00:55:22,395 --> 00:55:24,562
Professor Archawin is on his way.

712
00:55:25,282 --> 00:55:26,602
He has hyperkalemia.

713
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:30,242
He has high blood potassium. We need to stabilize his heart rate.

714
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:32,369
Give me ten percent calcium gluconate.

715
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,002
Ten cc's IV stat, 25% glucose.

716
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,562
Sixty ml. Three units of RI.

717
00:55:37,778 --> 00:55:39,162
IV him now.

718
00:55:39,362 --> 00:55:42,042
Here are ten cc's of ten percent calcium gluconate.

719
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:46,402
Sixty ml of 25% glucose and three units of RI.

720
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:53,762
Two minutes up.

721
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,522
I feel his pulse. It's ROSC.

722
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:11,642
This is bad. I saw a bad person.

723
00:56:50,988 --> 00:56:52,102
Sir?

724
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:59,322
You're not allowed outside at this time.

725
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:03,482
Please return to your ward.

726
00:57:04,736 --> 00:57:05,841
Sir?

727
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:14,802
- Professor! - Shoan!

728
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:16,282
Shoan, be careful.

729
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:23,122
The suspect, Shoan.

730
00:57:23,216 --> 00:57:24,442
Suspect? Bad person?

731
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:26,562
- Bad person! - Shoan!

732
00:57:27,056 --> 00:57:28,682
Bad person!

733
00:57:29,234 --> 00:57:31,082
Bad person...

734
00:57:32,145 --> 00:57:33,522
Bad...

735
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:51,802
If you don't like to use violence,

736
00:57:52,265 --> 00:57:53,962
(you need to be agile.)

737
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,202
You have to know how to dodge.

738
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:36,682
- Shoan! - Professor.

739
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,490
- Shoan, are you alright? - Professor, you're hurt.

740
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,641
Watch out for his head, neck, and spine.

741
00:58:41,745 --> 00:58:43,445
Put him on the block and rush him to the ER.

742
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:45,122
He needs to wear a hard collar.

743
00:58:45,338 --> 00:58:48,282
We will deal with his C-spine injury post-op.

744
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:49,987
We need to take your statement at the station.

745
00:58:50,011 --> 00:58:52,962
- Officer, don't. - We're a hospital.

746
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:54,762
Someone has to take responsibility.

747
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:59,162
The hospital let a criminal in to assault a doctor with a weapon.

748
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:01,082
We finally meet.

749
00:59:01,344 --> 00:59:03,708
Do you remember I had an autistic brother?

750
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:05,282
Do you want to know how he died?

751
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,442
It was because of me.
