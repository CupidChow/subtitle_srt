1
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:18,151
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:59,122
Please don't tell Shoan about me.

3
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,602
(Dr. Shoan)

4
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,722
Thank you for getting Copter into school.

5
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,241
Without your good word,

6
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,202
we wouldn't know where he would be.

7
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,922
We think he's too young to be sent abroad.

8
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:36,602
That's nothing.

9
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:40,042
The school's Director is my close friend.

10
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,762
It's good he goes to the same school as Tonkla.

11
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:47,042
I'll ask the teachers to take special care of him.

12
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,162
Don't worry.

13
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,762
Phruek.

14
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:55,842
- Yes?   - What about the work for which I need your help?

15
00:03:56,505 --> 00:04:00,162
If it's too hard, I'll handle it myself.

16
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:02,002
Thank you.

17
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:04,645
Our family is really lucky.

18
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,642
Both our son and our work are in good hands.

19
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,522
Without you, Nat,

20
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,322
I don't know what we would do.

21
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:16,042
Honey, whatever he asks of you, do your best.

22
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:17,962
I will.

23
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,273
Found you.

24
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:36,882
You're the one who brought Shoan the lunch box.

25
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:40,762
By the way, why is Shoan the only one getting it? What about me?

26
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,051
Next time, I'll make a lot of meals.

27
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,122
For you all to share, okay?

28
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,323
That's not it, Aunty.

29
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,522
If you make it for Shoan to share, we won't get some.

30
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,402
Shoan is possessive of his things, you know.

31
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:57,162
Then, write a menu of what you both would like.

32
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,442
I'll make it for you.

33
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,202
- Thank you.   - Thank you.

34
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:04,242
I'm on shift tomorrow. Please give me a lot of meat.

35
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:05,522
Okay.

36
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,990
- Hey, let me write something too.   - What should I have?

37
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:11,402
Fried pork with garlic.

38
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,762
There he is! Your favorite doctor.

39
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,722
Aunt Yen, good morning.

40
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,122
Good morning.

41
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:25,482
Dr. Shoan.

42
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,642
Lunch box from Aunt Yen.

43
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,442
Thank you.

44
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:33,042
I'm taking my leave.

45
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,202
Aunt Yen, here's our menu.

46
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:43,602
Shoan, please give this to Aunt Yen.

47
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:58,342
(Episode 7: Reaction)

48
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,122
Aunt Yen.

49
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,482
Dr. Pleum told me to give this to you.

50
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:17,082
Thank you, Dr. Shoan.

51
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:20,882
Are you making lunch boxes for Dr. Pleum and Dr. Mummim too?

52
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:24,682
I thought you were only doing this for me.

53
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,002
Those two saw me make you a lunch box,

54
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,842
so they want some too.

55
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:32,962
It's because of you, Dr. Shoan.

56
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,482
You ate it all by yourself and didn't share.

57
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:42,562
Your lunch box is too good for me to share.

58
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,162
For example, your stir-fried lotus stems with shrimp

59
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,990
and your egg tofu and ground pork soup.

60
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:49,642
They taste just like what I had when I was young.

61
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,162
You remember?

62
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:58,282
I do.

63
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,700
Stir-fried lotus stems with shrimp.

64
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,642
It had the flavor of garlic.

65
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,842
Egg tofu soup with pork.

66
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,682
The tofu was light yellow.

67
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,602
The ivy gourd leaves were green.

68
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,842
What are you thinking of?

69
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,762
I can't remember where I had them.

70
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,202
Good morning.

71
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,642
Good morning, Professor.

72
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:31,242
Shoan, let's see some patients. Come on.

73
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,882
- I have to go, Aunt Yen.   - Okay.

74
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,602
(Ward 3)

75
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,642
After my son comes home from a camp,

76
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,914
he keeps talking to himself.

77
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,029
He hallucinates and screams.

78
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,562
When he comes to his senses, he doesn't remember.

79
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:02,882
You have a lot of holy threads.

80
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:05,801
His friends at school said at the camp,

81
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:09,002
Earth messes with ghosts by kicking down a shrine.

82
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:10,722
When he came back,

83
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:13,122
he went crazy and pushed his friend down the stairs.

84
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:14,602
The teacher said

85
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:17,042
it's like Earth is possessed by a ghost.

86
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,962
Mr. Earth, do you remember?

87
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,339
Before you lose consciousness,

88
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,882
did you feel anything strange in your body?

89
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:28,002
Did you hear things? Did your head hurt?

90
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,528
Did your eye sockets hurt?

91
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,002
Anything of the sort?

92
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,362
I think

93
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,362
I heard someone scream.

94
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:41,002
It sounded close.

95
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,122
That's why I splashed some holy water on him,

96
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,602
but he didn't get better at all.

97
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,522
- He has a wound there!   - What wound?

98
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,602
Did you have an accident,

99
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,896
or were you hit by a blunt object there?

100
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:12,482
No, I...

101
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,330
I scratched it.

102
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,882
Are you sure about that?

103
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,242
Yes.

104
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,642
You're not telling the truth, are you?

105
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:22,922
Hey, Doc!

106
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:25,002
- Are you accusing my son of lying?   - Wait, sir.

107
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,402
Calm down.

108
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:30,762
We'll let the doctors

109
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:34,779
gather more information, and we'll give a diagnosis.

110
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,642
Prim, please take the patient through MRI.

111
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:39,002
Yes, Professor.

112
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,282
There's a lump and blood in the left occipital lobe.

113
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:59,322
Someone really wasn't telling the truth.

114
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:03,042
Measure the size of that lump.

115
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:13,602
Psychiatric symptom

116
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,396
from a frontal lobe tumor.

117
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,722
That can result in a change of behavior.

118
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,642
Change of behavior?

119
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:23,602
Yes, a tumor can cause it.

120
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:26,442
But the wounds on his body and head,

121
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,042
that's probably a different matter.

122
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:47,162
That's against the doctor's oath.

123
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:49,682
I have a contract with my clients in Spain.

124
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:52,362
The deadline is approaching.

125
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,042
That's why I want to speed things up.

126
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:58,762
Well...

127
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:04,042
In a few years, Copter will go abroad, right?

128
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:06,802
Your son is still young.

129
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,562
He's going far away.

130
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:10,722
If his mom goes with him,

131
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,762
won't that be better?

132
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:14,282
Come on.

133
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:18,986
I won't let this affect you.

134
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,082
(You said Shoan wouldn't get to be a doctor there anyway.)

135
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,099
He wants to be a surgeon, May.

136
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:38,562
But you would never let him go into an operating room?

137
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,282
Good.

138
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,282
Win, let's go home.

139
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,042
Keep it down.

140
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,322
Don't you think that

141
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:52,882
this is another opportunity

142
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,082
to make it different from what happened 10 years ago?

143
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:01,242
I think you're on the right path.

144
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,546
You should study this case and gather more information.

145
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:04,842
I will.

146
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,602
Come in.

147
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,042
Win?

148
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:12,762
- Come on in.   - I'll take my leave, then.

149
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,402
It's okay.

150
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:15,802
You can stay.

151
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,642
I want to talk to both of you.

152
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,642
Shoot.

153
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:28,882
I would like access to the medical simulation room.

154
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:33,442
Of course. How many sessions? What's the workshop about?

155
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,642
Initially, I would like once a week.

156
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:37,962
I would like to work on the basics of operation.

157
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,593
Good. I'll schedule it for you.

158
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:42,816
How many doctors will attend this?

159
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:46,402
Just one.

160
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:53,802
Me?

161
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:58,802
Okay. I'll arrange that.

162
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:02,762
I just want to make up for his lost time. He missed a lot of operations.

163
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:06,935
If he really wants to be a surgeon...

164
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,682
Yay!

165
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,082
Thank you, both of you.

166
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,722
Thank you, Win.

167
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:18,881
During the pre-op,

168
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:21,121
he should stay in this room.

169
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:22,482
It's for his own safety.

170
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:25,386
In case he has a seizure when he's alone,

171
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,482
we have staff on hand around the clock.

172
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:30,294
Also, about the doors.

173
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,776
We have to inform you that they lock automatically.

174
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,288
They can only be opened from the outside.

175
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:38,557
It might be a bit inconvenient,

176
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,002
but you can use something to block the door when you're here.

177
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,083
When you leave, just remove it,

178
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:47,402
and the doors will lock automatically as usual.

179
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:48,802
Close the doors.

180
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:50,562
Close the windows.

181
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,682
Turn down the lights.

182
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,162
This will allow the patient to rest properly.

183
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:01,322
Noise can be a catalyst for his symptoms.

184
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,762
Please don't forget.

185
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:06,282
Close the doors. Close the windows. Turn down the lights.

186
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:09,802
As the doctor said.

187
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:11,482
Yes.

188
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,762
What should we do, honey?

189
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,282
About the piece of land in Chumphon?

190
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,642
Earth's grandmother said the deed

191
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:20,042
has to be signed in front of both you and me.

192
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,922
Can't we wait til after his surgery?

193
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,122
They won't wait for us.

194
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:27,882
You know what?

195
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,722
We can leave him with the doctors for a night.

196
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:34,922
They said he's well protected.

197
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:38,162
That's fine.

198
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:41,202
I can't help but worry.

199
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,673
He also has a wound on his head.

200
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,842
Please take care of him, Doctor.

201
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,122
We will.

202
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,042
Please excuse us for now.

203
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,122
Thank you, Doctors.

204
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,235
This button is here.

205
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,042
You have to press this button,

206
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,642
and the doors won't lock automatically.

207
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:04,962
Yes, Doctor.

208
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,322
Sir.

209
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,882
J.J.? Are you here to visit Earth?

210
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,682
I'm just here to check on him.

211
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:22,402
I need to apologize on Earth's behalf.

212
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,082
He broke your arm.

213
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:27,962
The doctor said I can remove the cast in two weeks.

214
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:31,082
Let me ask you something.

215
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,522
Was Earth bullied at school?

216
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,282
Please tell me.

217
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,282
He was.

218
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,602
That day at the camp,

219
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,442
Earth

220
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,442
had a seizure like he was possessed.

221
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:51,962
The bullies said they were performing exorcism.

222
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,882
When I came back,

223
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:55,762
Earth was busted open.

224
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,122
There was blood everywhere.

225
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:59,227
The bullies said if I told the teacher,

226
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:00,882
they would beat me up too.

227
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:03,922
And Earth would be beat up even more.

228
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:13,162
What's wrong, Earth?

229
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,734
- Son!   - Help!

230
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,722
- Easy. Take it easy.   - Let me go!

231
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,344
- Let me go!   - Mr. Earth!

232
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,075
One amp of Valium, please!

233
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,481
- Quick!   - Mr. Earth!

234
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,242
Stay away!

235
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:28,802
- Do it.   - Doctor?

236
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,758
(Ward 3 )

237
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,442
Does he have a chance to recover, Doctor?

238
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,762
I'll do my best.

239
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:49,122
You were afraid of the bullies, right?

240
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:51,578
Sorry?

241
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,722
You were afraid of getting bullied like him.

242
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,322
- That's why you did nothing, right?  -  Shoan.

243
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,122
Earth told me to stay quiet, and I did.

244
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,398
His condition is probably making him confused.

245
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,497
And he got physically assaulted.

246
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,562
Have you ever thought of a way to help him?

247
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,242
Or have you never?

248
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:15,402
I...

249
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:20,162
I just thought I would bear with it until we graduate.

250
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,282
So we

251
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,522
won't be in trouble.

252
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,602
I think you're in trouble,

253
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,322
and you won't graduate.

254
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,642
Don't take it the wrong way. He means that...

255
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:35,922
He means that

256
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:38,322
bearing with it doesn't solve problems.

257
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,722
That's correct.

258
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,192
It's good that you speak up now.

259
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,442
Telling adults to handle it is the right thing to do.

260
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,002
It's fine. You did well.

261
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:53,562
The patient is stable now.

262
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,698
He probably would sleep for a while.

263
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,702
You can come in and visit him now.

264
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,442
Please come in.

265
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,623
Thank you.

266
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:01,842
You're welcome.

267
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:05,562
You should go.

268
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:07,322
You should.

269
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,002
I was bullied.

270
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:20,242
Just like that boy.

271
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:23,522
In primary school,

272
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,362
there was a group of kids...

273
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,109
Shoan.

274
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,722
Your brother called you.

275
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:01,450
If you and your brother tell the teachers, you're going to get it worse.

276
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:02,762
Let's go, guys!

277
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:12,762
They did that to me every day.

278
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,682
They threatened that if I told the teachers,

279
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:19,322
they would keep doing it to me.

280
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,442
So, did you tell the teachers?

281
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,722
I did.

282
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:28,082
Weren't you afraid of getting bullied more if you tell on them?

283
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,202
I was bullied before I told the teachers.

284
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:35,042
Therefore, telling the teachers had nothing to do with getting bullied.

285
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,934
What did those kids do after you reported them?

286
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,202
They all got punished by the teachers.

287
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,402
I didn't understand it, Dr. Prim. Why did they bully me?

288
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:48,982
It's normal for humans to

289
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:51,689
act like a wild animal.

290
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,922
They pick on the weak.

291
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:57,762
They pick on those they consider outsiders.

292
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,322
That doesn't make sense.

293
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:03,041
Wild animals hurt each other for a reason.

294
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:06,762
For example, for the position of alpha or to claim territories.

295
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:09,202
They don't hurt each other for fun.

296
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,002
Only humans

297
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:13,042
hurt each other for fun.

298
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,002
Yes, sir.

299
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:20,442
Copy that, sir.

300
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:26,382
It's time for my appointment with Professor Archawin.

301
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,362
What are you guys doing?

302
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,602
Excuse me.

303
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,762
You're on time.

304
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,642
I'm ready, Professor.

305
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:56,162
Okay.

306
00:20:56,747 --> 00:21:00,042
The patient has a frontal lobe tumor. What would you do?

307
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,882
Frontal lobe?

308
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,242
I'll check his vital signs first.

309
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,346
After that,

310
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:08,441
I'll check the conditions of the tumor.

311
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:10,442
See how it's linked to the structure nearby.

312
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,042
Check his anterior cerebral artery and cortical vein.

313
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:16,522
See how close they are to the tumor.

314
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,061
A surgery can damage this structure,

315
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,002
which could cause difficulty in walking.

316
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:28,889
Correct. Now, let's start.

317
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:30,722
Right.

318
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:48,602
Let me try again.

319
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:13,202
You still don't find it.

320
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,082
You're puncturing

321
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,203
holes all over the patient's skull.

322
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,562
Listen carefully.

323
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,522
You have to evaluate.

324
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:29,442
Look at similar skull structures.

325
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:33,082
Check the veins crossing through the area too.

326
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,162
(You have to evaluate.)

327
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:41,042
(Look at similar skull structures.)

328
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,642
(Check the veins crossing through the area too.)

329
00:22:58,522 --> 00:22:59,882
Slowly.

330
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:02,561
Okay. Take it easy. Good job.

331
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,962
Good job.

332
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,362
I did it, Professor.

333
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:11,882
I did it, Professor.

334
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,522
But you punctured holes all over his skull.

335
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,642
This session is still a failure.

336
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:19,762
You need a lot of practice.

337
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:22,042
Yes.

338
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:24,802
This is only your first time, right?

339
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,242
I never said we'd do only one session.

340
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:30,522
Really, Professor?

341
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,842
But

342
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,842
if you keep making the same mistake,

343
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,962
I'll really stop teaching you.

344
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:37,451
Is that okay?

345
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:39,722
O.

346
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:41,762
What's that?

347
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:43,602
You asked,

348
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:45,682
"Is that okay?"

349
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:47,522
So I said "O."

350
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:50,802
It would be better if you did this too.

351
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,162
Try it, Professor.

352
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,682
No. Why would I?

353
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:12,122
Shoan.

354
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,042
Hop on. I'll give you a ride.

355
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:20,522
Come on. You live in the same building as Prim, right?

356
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:24,338
It's on my route. Come on.

357
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:27,962
Professor Archawin's car is a vehicle.

358
00:24:28,362 --> 00:24:30,162
It can deliver me all the same.

359
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:33,402
Yes.

360
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:01,462
That's Dr. Prim!

361
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,522
What are you guys celebrating?

362
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:09,682
It's just a regular dinner.

363
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,962
I was about to text Shoan, but I ran into him downstairs.

364
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:14,665
Would you eat with us?

365
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,442
You're here anyway.

366
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,202
- Okay.   - Wait a second.

367
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:22,002
Come on.

368
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:26,682
Surprise!

369
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:32,873
Professor, I'm sorry.

370
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:34,762
Pleum, cheers!

371
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:36,282
- Already?   - Yeah, already.

372
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,202
Take a shower and brush your teeth. I miss you.

373
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,042
It's a little tight, but it's fine.

374
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,442
I'll wash it and give it back.

375
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:53,562
Bye-bye, my shirt.

376
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:57,362
The professor's going to give it back.

377
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,562
It won't be the same.

378
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:01,482
You mean the smell, right?

379
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,146
I'll buy a new one for you then.

380
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,682
Same brand and color, okay?

381
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:09,082
Okay.

382
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,882
How did you know Shoan is sensitive to smells?

383
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:20,931
He said he was a bunny, didn't he?

384
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:22,682
Try this fried duck beak.

385
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,122
- It's good.   - You're right.

386
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:30,577
Are you letting Shoan in the OR?

387
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:44,082
I can't stop him, can I?

388
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:47,282
That's more like it!

389
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:48,962
I'll drink to that.

390
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:54,642
That's awesome, Professor.

391
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,616
- Goodbye, Professor.   - See you.

392
00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:15,994
- Bye-bye.   - Bye-bye. See you.

393
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:17,402
- Goodbye, Prim.   - Bye-bye.

394
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,642
Move. Watch out for the car.

395
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:23,882
- Get your juniors home!   - Yeah.

396
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:33,042
- This way, please.   - You don't have to walk with me.

397
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,036
(Nurse Counter)

398
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,882
Your parents...

399
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,922
Oh yeah. They have a business trip.

400
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:01,762
Before they go to Chumphon, they will come by.

401
00:28:02,205 --> 00:28:03,402
So...

402
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,762
Tomorrow after breakfast,

403
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:07,801
you have to stop eating food.

404
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:09,482
You can only drink water.

405
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,962
If you need help,

406
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,002
press the red button right here.

407
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,482
A nurse will come.

408
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,002
You sound like a steward on a plane.

409
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:21,682
Is that a compliment?

410
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:23,282
Yeah.

411
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,322
If it is, thank you.

412
00:28:26,842 --> 00:28:28,162
I have to take my leave now.

413
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:29,282
Doc.

414
00:28:30,122 --> 00:28:31,122
Yes?

415
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,242
Do you think I'm a lunatic?

416
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:35,465
No, I don't.

417
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:40,402
Before I got sick, I

418
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:43,722
felt like I was a freak.

419
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:45,602
And now, when I'm this way,

420
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:47,362
they bully me more.

421
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:49,962
Why, Doctor?

422
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,602
Why did it have to be me?

423
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,742
What did I do wrong?

424
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,962
You didn't do anything wrong.

425
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:58,369
Perhaps those who bullied you

426
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,442
just wanted to bully you.

427
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:03,094
There's probably no reason for that.

428
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,042
So...

429
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:10,602
Will I be back to normal?

430
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:15,442
A doctor can't 100% guarantee the outcome of a treatment.

431
00:29:15,562 --> 00:29:17,282
Anything can happen.

432
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,362
I will do my best, though.

433
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:22,762
That is the only fact

434
00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:24,802
that a doctor can tell you.

435
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:28,522
I'll take my leave now.

436
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:31,202
Don't forget the red button if you need a nurse.

437
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:32,962
Yes, sir.

438
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:37,922
(Mr. Anat)

439
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:52,602
Traumatic brain injury?

440
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:54,962
TBI?

441
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:02,042
Do you have training today, Shoan?

442
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:07,562
It's hard, right?

443
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:16,882
Should I let Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai in the OR tomorrow?

444
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:23,322
Yes, you should.

445
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:27,329
Good morning.

446
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,502
- Good morning.   - Good morning, Doctor.

447
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,034
- Hi.   - Good morning.

448
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:31,562
Good morning, sir.

449
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:32,922
How are you?

450
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:36,962
Mr. Earth, when did you last hear things?

451
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,682
About two days ago.

452
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:42,363
Yes.

453
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,722
Professor, I need to talk to you.

454
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:01,881
I'm counting on you, Professor.

455
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:05,482
I think I can come back before my son goes into operation.

456
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:07,522
But...

457
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:11,401
Are you letting that

458
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:15,208
doctor attend my son's surgery?

459
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,002
I am.

460
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:22,362
I noticed he kept checking on my son very often.

461
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,121
I'm not sure if something's wrong.

462
00:31:24,202 --> 00:31:28,202
It's a regular check. We always do that.

463
00:31:29,747 --> 00:31:31,122
Regular?

464
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,722
Are you sure, Professor?

465
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:36,562
Yes.

466
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,562
Hey, bro! You're covering for Nui tonight, right?

467
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:15,802
What are you doing to me, Dr. Prim?

468
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:17,602
What would I do?

469
00:32:22,144 --> 00:32:23,682
What time is it?

470
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,122
Nine o'clock.

471
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:29,162
I need to check on the patient.

472
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:32,322
You just went in there. Are you going again?

473
00:32:32,544 --> 00:32:34,144
I need to check on him every two hours.

474
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,640
I have to go.

475
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,482
Who are you?

476
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:53,282
I'm here to give him medicine.

477
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:55,562
This patient requires no medicine.

478
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:58,442
I'm responsible for this case. I didn't prescribe anything.

479
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:00,142
Sorry.

480
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,042
I'm covering for someone else.

481
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:04,002
I didn't carefully check.

482
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,162
Sorry, Doctor.

483
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:08,162
Okay.

484
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,642
Doctor!

485
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,235
Would you like coffee? I'll make some.

486
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,162
I don't drink coffee. Thank you.

487
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:44,442
He looks spaced out tonight.

488
00:34:55,216 --> 00:34:59,402
(Nurse Counter)

489
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:20,923
Shoan.

490
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,682
Have you slept?

491
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:24,882
I haven't finished studying.

492
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:29,442
Gosh. You can skip the morning round.

493
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:30,962
Go to bed.

494
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:32,482
I'm fine.

495
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,042
If he's fine, I'll sleep.

496
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:38,002
Nick! Come on!

497
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,602
Do you see the papers? There!

498
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,402
Finish them.

499
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,722
Doctor! The patient called Earth has left his room!

500
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:40,442
No! Stop!

501
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:44,722
Calm down!

502
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:47,162
- Calm down!   - Easy!

503
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:49,082
Stay back!

504
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:52,882
Stay back!

505
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,082
Excuse me.

506
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,482
Get down from there!

507
00:38:02,395 --> 00:38:04,482
Calm down, please!

508
00:38:04,754 --> 00:38:08,442
(Mumbling)

509
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:11,978
Mr. Earth!

510
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:14,282
- Mr. Earth.   - Stay back!

511
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:15,962
Calm down, Mr. Earth.

512
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:18,362
Mr. Earth, it's dangerous.

513
00:38:19,378 --> 00:38:20,922
Calm down, please.

514
00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:22,922
It's dangerous.

515
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,802
Calm down.

516
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:26,522
Excuse me.

517
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:27,962
- Whoa!   - It's dangerous.

518
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,002
Earth, it's me, your mom!

519
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,762
- Easy.   - Earth, get down, sweetie!

520
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,442
Get over here, son.

521
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:35,562
I need to calm him down.

522
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:37,162
Earth!

523
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:39,441
Mr. Earth, please calm down!

524
00:38:39,522 --> 00:38:40,722
Stay back!

525
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,082
Go! Stay back!

526
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,282
Stay back!

527
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,362
- Hey!   - No!

528
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,527
- Earth!   - Ma'am, stay back.

529
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:03,094
- Earth, calm down, sweetie!   - Let me go!

530
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,562
What's going on, Doctor?

531
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:06,474
How could you let him out?

532
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:07,882
Sir, please calm down.

533
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:09,762
How could I? It's my son!

534
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:11,682
- Calm down.   - Doctor!

535
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:13,362
- (Shoan!)   - If you...

536
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:14,602
(Why didn't you answer me?)

537
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:17,322
Please calm down. Let's talk...

538
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:20,242
- Doc!   - Shoan!

539
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,442
- Shoan!   - Doctor!

540
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,082
- Em!   - We need a stretcher!

541
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:26,962
Hurry. Take him away.

542
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,282
Security footage shows that

543
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:46,682
Dr. Shoan was the last one to check on the patient.

544
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:50,122
Are you sure you locked the doors properly?

545
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:51,682
I am.

546
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,890
The doors lock automatically.

547
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:58,362
This requires further evidence.

548
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:01,162
We haven't found out what happened 100%.

549
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:03,122
The other two cameras were not working.

550
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:05,042
That was also a blind spot.

551
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:08,842
If we don't take action, that means we

552
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:11,202
show a lack of responsibility towards the patient.

553
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:14,179
I don't think Dr. Shoan can escape this responsibility.

554
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,002
He is directly responsible for this case.

555
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,562
But if we take action too soon

556
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:21,562
without sufficient evidence,

557
00:40:22,058 --> 00:40:24,722
that's more selfish than responsible.

558
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:27,802
You're doctors. Your job is to take care of patients.

559
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:30,642
My job is to take care of the hospital's image.

560
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,442
How is what we're doing selfish?

561
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:35,202
What do you mean by that?

562
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:39,442
Excuse me. I think we should all calm down here.

563
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,183
Give Shoan some time. I think

564
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:45,122
he's not ready to explain things yet.

565
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:48,842
I don't think I can stall for you, Professor.

566
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:50,955
It has become news.

567
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,042
Videos have been shared.

568
00:40:53,273 --> 00:40:55,402
Also, the board

569
00:40:55,562 --> 00:41:00,282
has requested that Dr. Shoan be removed as a resident.

570
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:03,682
We have to base this on the evidence we have.

571
00:41:03,842 --> 00:41:07,282
Shoan was the last one in that room.

572
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:11,522
I think we can't make up an excuse to save him at this point.

573
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:12,802
But I didn't do it.

574
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:15,122
I didn't open the doors and let the patient out.

575
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:16,602
- I didn't...   - Okay, Shoan.

576
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:18,922
So...

577
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:21,922
This is my decision.

578
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,722
It's me alone.

579
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:27,562
I assigned him this case.

580
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,882
I have to take responsibility for what happened.

581
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,602
My responsibility is to

582
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:35,202
resign as the Head of Surgery.

583
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:36,922
Shoan will stay

584
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,882
until we can prove that he's guilty.

585
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,322
That's final.

586
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,361
This is not right, Professor.

587
00:41:42,442 --> 00:41:43,522
Shoan.

588
00:41:44,106 --> 00:41:46,522
Then I have no other choice.

589
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:49,362
Mr. Khomsan.

590
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:52,842
Please inform the management

591
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:56,802
Professor Prapas has been suspended as the Head of Surgery.

592
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,075
Professor Phruek

593
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:00,602
will serve as the acting

594
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:02,722
Head of Surgery in his place

595
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:05,602
- until we conclude this matter.   - This is not supposed to happen.

596
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:07,642
This is not supposed to happen.

597
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:08,922
This is not supposed to happen.

598
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:10,762
This is not supposed to happen. This is not right.

599
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:13,882
Professor Prapas shouldn't take the blame. I didn't do anything wrong.

600
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,082
I didn't do anything wrong.

601
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:18,042
This is not right. Directors, you can't agree with that.

602
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,322
Professor, this is not supposed to happen. It's not right.

603
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:23,602
The directors shouldn't punish you like this.

604
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:25,002
Shoan.

605
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:28,522
What's done is done. We can't change the past.

606
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:30,322
But I didn't do it.

607
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:34,082
That nurse was new. He could have done something to the doors.

608
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:36,682
Shoan, why would he have done that?

609
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:40,202
You know what, Shoan?

610
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:43,082
I believe that you didn't do it.

611
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:45,122
But right now,

612
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:47,522
you need to calm down.

613
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:49,802
We will figure this out together.

614
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,362
Calm down for now.

615
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,722
Yes. I will go back to work.

616
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,404
You're almost completely recovered.

617
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:31,203
You should be able to go home in a couple of days.

618
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:32,562
Thanks.

619
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,162
I wonder how Dr. Shoan is doing.

620
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:38,362
Yeah, me too.

621
00:43:44,962 --> 00:43:46,602
That's the strange doctor

622
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:48,322
who fainted this morning.

623
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:50,002
Yeah, that's him.

624
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,642
I wonder what he did to make that patient's dad that angry.

625
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:55,602
I've finished checking on Zone B patients.

626
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:57,362
Everything is fine.

627
00:43:58,547 --> 00:43:59,802
Dr. Shoan.

628
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,562
I think you should get some rest.

629
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:06,642
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

630
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:16,602
You should.

631
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:20,682
Nick and I are done too.

632
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:22,482
We'll cover your zones.

633
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:32,058
Just go.

634
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:45,861
Right now, the patient is in stable condition.

635
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,922
He's undergoing fasting

636
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:49,522
until he goes into operation.

637
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,282
For the post-op, I think

638
00:44:52,638 --> 00:44:55,002
I think he needs a 7 to 10-day stay to be sure.

639
00:44:57,482 --> 00:44:59,242
After the operation,

640
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,942
if I would like a transfer...

641
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,922
I'll be honest. I'm not really okay with this place.

642
00:45:06,922 --> 00:45:12,082
Yes. That's your right and decision to make,

643
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:17,609
but if you want to move him, we need to see if he's stable enough.

644
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:20,362
My advice is

645
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:24,322
to stay here on schedule. That would be the safest.

646
00:45:24,984 --> 00:45:26,482
What about that doctor?

647
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:28,056
Is he still in charge of my son?

648
00:45:28,148 --> 00:45:31,282
I won't leave him in your care any longer.

649
00:45:32,712 --> 00:45:36,322
Dr. Shoan is a doctor under my supervision.

650
00:45:36,522 --> 00:45:39,482
If you have complaints, you can tell me.

651
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:43,802
But for your comfort,

652
00:45:44,986 --> 00:45:47,562
we will assign another resident

653
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:49,242
to this case.

654
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,202
Let's skip the session today, Shoan.

655
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:04,442
Why?

656
00:46:06,202 --> 00:46:07,522
You're not ready.

657
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,562
I'm always ready.

658
00:46:09,722 --> 00:46:12,082
I'm ready to learn surgery. I want to learn surgery.

659
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,722
- I'm ready to learn surgery, Professor.   - Shoan.

660
00:46:16,937 --> 00:46:18,482
This is not a good time for that.

661
00:46:18,587 --> 00:46:20,002
You have to wait.

662
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:22,042
But I didn't do anything wrong.

663
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:23,722
Why didn't anyone believe me?

664
00:46:23,842 --> 00:46:25,362
- Why did you come to this conclusion?   - Calm down, Shoan.

665
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:26,562
- No one believed me.   - Shoan.

666
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,848
- I don't understand.   - Shoan, calm down.

667
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:45,482
Shoan.

668
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:48,202
Nobody lets me do anything.

669
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,042
Can I attend this operation?

670
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:52,722
We'll talk about that later, okay?

671
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:55,482
Can I attend this operation?

672
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:58,848
- Well...   - Answer me.

673
00:46:58,962 --> 00:47:01,923
I'll answer that later. I need time. I have something to do.

674
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,402
I need an answer. Answer me.

675
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,802
- I need an answer now.   - Shoan, listen.

676
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:07,522
- Uncle Prapas, answer me.   - Shoan, stop.

677
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:09,442
- Answer me.   - Shoan, stop!

678
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,962
Enough! Stop!

679
00:47:11,067 --> 00:47:12,802
- Answer me!   - Enough!

680
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:21,762
How can you be a doctor like this?

681
00:47:22,658 --> 00:47:25,682
You can't be a resident anywhere, not even here.

682
00:47:28,785 --> 00:47:30,082
This is not okay.

683
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:31,562
- Sho...  - This is not okay.

684
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:33,242
This is not okay.

685
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,459
- This is not okay.   - Shoan, calm down. Take a deep breath.

686
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,242
- This is not okay!   - Shoan!

687
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,602
- Listen, Shoan.   - This is not okay!

688
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:44,362
- This is not okay.   - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

689
00:47:45,202 --> 00:47:47,362
- Shoan, calm down.   - This is not...

690
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:49,202
This is not good.

691
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:51,442
This is not good.

692
00:47:55,722 --> 00:47:57,282
(How can you be a doctor like this?)

693
00:47:57,443 --> 00:48:00,042
(You can't be a resident anywhere, not even here.)

694
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:04,242
(Why didn't anyone believe me?)

695
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:05,842
(Why did you come to this conclusion?)

696
00:48:05,923 --> 00:48:07,051
(No one believed me.)

697
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:09,482
(I don't understand.)

698
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:19,202
I believe that these hands

699
00:48:19,424 --> 00:48:21,642
will save a lot of people.

700
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,050
- Believe me.   - (How can you be a doctor like this?)

701
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:26,682
(You can't be a resident anywhere, not even here.)

702
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:56,922
That night, he was sent to cover for someone else who was on leave.

703
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,567
I reminded everyone not to enter Mr. Earth's room,

704
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:02,138
and he still went in.

705
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,402
It was probably just a misunderstanding.

706
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:09,722
After that night,

707
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:11,722
I asked for his contact number,

708
00:49:11,835 --> 00:49:13,682
but nobody has heard from him ever again.

709
00:49:13,906 --> 00:49:15,066
Not even today.

710
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:16,922
He never showed up to work after that.

711
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:23,562
Okay. I'll follow up on this.

712
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:25,202
Thank you, Somrak.

713
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:26,882
Yes, Professor. You're welcome.

714
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,582
Doctor.

715
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:43,482
Is something wrong with me again?

716
00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:47,122
Keep it down.

717
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:50,562
Yes, it is.

718
00:49:52,737 --> 00:49:54,162
What do you like?

719
00:49:56,529 --> 00:49:58,082
I mean...

720
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:00,842
What do you see that makes you feel good?

721
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,002
Feel good?

722
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:07,882
Pie, my girlfriend.

723
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:09,962
What color is Pie?

724
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:15,322
She's

725
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:16,842
cream, I guess.

726
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:19,121
She's cream. Okay.

727
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,722
When you feel bad,

728
00:50:22,962 --> 00:50:24,962
think about the color cream.

729
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:28,526
It will make you feel better.

730
00:50:33,712 --> 00:50:34,962
Yes.

731
00:50:38,617 --> 00:50:39,962
Doctor.

732
00:50:43,962 --> 00:50:45,282
Thank you.

733
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:10,842
Dr. Shoan.

734
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:12,522
Dr. Shoan.

735
00:51:13,264 --> 00:51:15,402
Why are you going home so early tonight?

736
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:31,242
I heard about it.

737
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:36,562
- The staff...   - Everyone thinks I did it.

738
00:51:37,373 --> 00:51:39,242
I didn't do it.

739
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,282
I believe

740
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,682
that you didn't do it.

741
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:47,602
You're the most careful person.

742
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:50,122
Thank you.

743
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:13,242
No.

744
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:15,322
Hit me.

745
00:52:18,217 --> 00:52:19,482
Why would I hit you?

746
00:52:19,572 --> 00:52:21,162
I can't finish my meal,

747
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:23,682
but I can't eat anymore.

748
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:25,362
I need to be punished.

749
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,962
You can't finish it?

750
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:37,962
It's really okay.

751
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:40,482
Let me take your lunch box.

752
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:41,842
No.

753
00:52:41,964 --> 00:52:43,362
I have to wash it myself.

754
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,082
What's wrong?

755
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:15,402
Is that your lucky charm?

756
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:24,642
I'd say it makes me feel good.

757
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:27,322
This item.

758
00:53:27,953 --> 00:53:29,602
Shin, my brother,

759
00:53:29,762 --> 00:53:32,562
bought it for me on my 8th birthday.

760
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:35,242
Shin said I would become a doctor.

761
00:53:48,802 --> 00:53:50,602
Happy birthday, Shoan.

762
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:57,602
Wait.

763
00:53:57,762 --> 00:54:00,002
Make a wish before you blow it.

764
00:54:00,763 --> 00:54:02,602
Make a wish?

765
00:54:03,093 --> 00:54:04,842
What do you want?

766
00:54:14,722 --> 00:54:17,842
See? You got this as soon as you made a wish.

767
00:54:17,994 --> 00:54:19,202
Do you like it?

768
00:54:22,731 --> 00:54:24,562
If you want to be a doctor,

769
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,362
you have to start practicing now.

770
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:35,964
Really?

771
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:38,402
So,

772
00:54:38,674 --> 00:54:40,962
I think it should be called

773
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,482
a navigator, right?

774
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:47,442
Every time you look at it,

775
00:54:49,738 --> 00:54:51,738
you think of your brother, right?

776
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,562
I do,

777
00:54:57,064 --> 00:55:00,242
but Shin and my bunny are on the moon.

778
00:55:01,017 --> 00:55:02,702
I have nobody now.

779
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:07,882
You have someone.

780
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:14,522
You have me.

781
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:18,002
You have Dr. Prapas.

782
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,715
You have your friends at work.

783
00:55:28,474 --> 00:55:29,802
I need to get home.

784
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:33,402
Thank you for your stir-fried lotus stems and tofu soup with pork.

785
00:55:33,552 --> 00:55:34,842
They're delicious.

786
00:55:41,266 --> 00:55:42,602
Dr. Shoan.

787
00:55:48,202 --> 00:55:49,742
Get home safe.

788
00:55:55,322 --> 00:55:56,602
You too.

789
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,362
Shoan is missing?

790
00:56:23,658 --> 00:56:24,722
Yes, Professor.

791
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:26,034
Usually,

792
00:56:26,122 --> 00:56:27,882
if you have a night shift,

793
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:32,049
they don't allow you outside, but it's almost time for operation.

794
00:56:36,604 --> 00:56:38,162
Let's operate on Earth first.

795
00:56:38,243 --> 00:56:39,722
After this, I'll help you find him.

796
00:56:39,915 --> 00:56:41,162
Yes, Professor.

797
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,802
Give me Penfield No.1.

798
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:33,402
- All right, Prim.   - Suction.

799
00:57:38,482 --> 00:57:39,802
Bipolar.

800
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:41,362
Suction.

801
00:58:25,907 --> 00:58:26,907
Okay.

802
00:58:27,011 --> 00:58:30,122
There's no bleeding. I think we're done.

803
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:54,082
Surgical operation...

804
00:58:55,914 --> 00:58:57,202
Hey, Prim!

805
00:58:58,609 --> 00:58:59,762
Why are you in a rush?

806
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,602
Call me if it's urgent!

807
00:59:16,322 --> 00:59:17,322
Shoan.

808
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,442
Shoan.

809
01:00:28,827 --> 01:00:31,762
You should thank me

810
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,456
for saving you from being a loser

811
01:00:34,537 --> 01:00:36,282
before you retire.

812
01:00:36,562 --> 01:00:40,122
- Mr. Kob, Pangpond is...   - He's like you.

813
01:00:41,122 --> 01:00:42,242
I found him.

814
01:00:42,323 --> 01:00:43,562
Did he come back with you?

815
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,682
No, and I don't know when he will.

816
01:00:45,818 --> 01:00:48,482
At worst, he could be fired.

817
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:51,722
The patient is male, hit by a car, left pelvic...

818
01:00:51,835 --> 01:00:53,002
Shoan?
