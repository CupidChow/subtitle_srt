00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:41,923
Shoan!

3
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:44,842
Shoan!

4
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,042
Shoan...

5
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:25,642
Did Shoan really run away?

6
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,642
Don't be sad. Shoan will be back.

7
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,051
I know he'll be back.

8
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:38,442
I was just thinking.

9
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:41,602
If I

10
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:44,602
had let Shoan work, he might not have run away.

11
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,962
Even if you didn't stop him,

12
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:50,882
other people would.

13
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:54,282
If they thought that the patient had run away because of his mistake,

14
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,882
it's a big deal.

15
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,242
What if he's not wrong?

16
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,522
Like...

17
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,282
Shoan has the right to do his job.

18
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:02,722
Do you get me?

19
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,042
That's true. But that's because we know Shoan.

20
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,962
It's just impossible for people who didn't know him

21
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,402
to understand him like us.

22
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:13,082
I don't know anymore.

Prim, look at this.

30
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,162
What's this Sawangpanya?

31
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,122
You should try calling Professor Prapas.

32
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,722
Sawangpanya?

34
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,682
(We're sorry. The number you have dialed...)

35
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,322
He wouldn't pick up.

36
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,002
Phruek?

37
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:03,642
What happened to your face?

38
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,722
I know how the patient has gotten out of the room.

39
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,682
I am sure.

40
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,722
The doors lock automatically.

41
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:19,562
Shoan was the last one in that room.

42
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,002
I think we can't make up an excuse to save him at this point.

43
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:25,362
But I didn't do it.

44
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,362
I didn't open the doors and let the patient out.

45
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,962
My responsibility is to

46
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:30,162
resign

47
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:31,482
as the Head of Surgery.

48
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,442
Professor Prapas has been suspended.

49
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,202
Professor Phruek

50
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:37,202
will serve as the acting

51
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:39,362
Head of Surgery in his place.

52
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:41,541
This is not right. This is not supposed to happen.

53
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,482
Professor Prapas shouldn't take the blame...

54
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,961
He was sent to cover for someone else who was on leave. I reminded everyone

55
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,682
not to enter Mr. Earth's room,

56
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,082
and he still went in.

57
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,602
I still think it's weird, Professor.

58
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:55,082
How is it weird?

59
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,024
I asked for his contact number,

60
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,522
but nobody has heard from him ever again.

61
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:00,722
Not even today.

62
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,682
He never showed up to work after that.

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,482
Thank you, Somrak.

64
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:08,961
Yes, Professor.

65
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,242
Earth!

66
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,882
- Earth!   - Earth!

67
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,802
Why did you become like this?

68
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,916
With our teamwork,

69
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:50,898
A&R has come this far.

70
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:58,962
The best present for my birthday

71
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,362
is that 70%

72
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:02,802
of our target hospitals

73
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,962
have ordered

74
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:08,762
our Spanish medication.

75
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,602
And there's also another good news.

76
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:17,682
My brother-in-law,

77
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,442
right now,

78
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:23,962
he's the Head of Surgery at one of the best hospitals.

79
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,322
Like I said, we have come this far

80
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:32,242
because of our teamwork.

81
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,882
To A&R.

82
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,442
A&R!

83
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:38,001
A&R!

84
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,665
A&R!

85
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:44,882
This is really nice.

86
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,682
Hey, is something the matter?

87
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,642
You don't look so good.

88
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:57,242
There are a lot of ER patients today, so I'm a little tired.

89
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:00,722
I'm really happy for you though.

90
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:03,202
You've finally become the Head of Surgery.

91
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:07,202
Nat probably thinks of you as his real brother.

92
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:09,082
That's why he has been trying to help you.

93
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,202
Nat is helping me?

94
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:13,842
How?

95
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,174
- Ouch! It hurts!   - What happened? The glass cut his hand?

96
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,288
Are you alright?

97
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:31,642
It's Copter! Copter pushed me.

98
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:35,162
No! I didn't push him, Dad.

99
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,202
Tonkla just pulled the cloth himself.

100
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,707
How could he pull the tablecloth

101
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,202
with enough strength to make it fall over?

102
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:43,962
Copter.

103
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Apologize to Tonkla right now.

104
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:48,442
Copter.

105
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,802
Did you push Tonkla?

106
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,402
No, I really didn't push him.

107
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:56,482
That's not true. He pushed me. That's why the table fell over.

108
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:58,002
It hurts!

109
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:02,842
Your son has to apologize to my son right now.

110
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,642
I'll take you to dress your wound.

111
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:06,642
Copter.

112
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,722
Apologize to him, so that it'll be over.

113
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:11,282
Hey, our son hasn't done anything wrong.

114
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,602
Copter!

115
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:16,462
I told you to apologize to him.

116
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,002
Copter!

117
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:24,642
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,082
That's it.

119
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:30,242
- You should take him to dress his wound.   - Let's go.

120
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:31,922
Everyone,

121
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:35,882
let's continue our party.

122
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:12,042
Have you stopped being mad now?

123
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,362
I'm not mad.

124
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:20,802
Listen to your voice. You're mad.

125
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,402
I believe that you didn't do it.

126
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:29,122
Then...

127
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:32,362
Why did Mom have to tell me to apologize?

128
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,882
She probably doesn't want it to be a big deal.

129
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,482
We're already one family.

130
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:47,642
But Tonkla did something wrong and lied.

131
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,722
Do I have to take the blame instead of him?

132
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,482
If you do something wrong, you have to admit it's your fault.

133
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:06,602
Wow, you're already a grown-up, huh?

134
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:09,722
Good.

135
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,522
That's really good of you

136
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:13,802
to believe in righteousness.

137
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,162
I'm proud of you, son.

138
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:29,482
Of course.

139
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,642
I'll let you take care of the deal.

140
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:34,642
Thank you.

141
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:52,642
Did you send someone to frame Dr. Shoan?

142
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:56,282
How did you know? Do you have any evidence?

143
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,202
It was your person, wasn't it?

144
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:02,002
I don't know what he did to cause our patient to go that crazy,

145
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:04,122
but that could have killed him!

146
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:05,961
Don't worry.

147
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:08,242
No one can link it to us

148
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:11,729
since that hospital's security is so lax.

149
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,162
Did the money really make you try to ruin people's lives?

150
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:22,162
Don't try to pretend like you're innocent here.

151
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,922
You should thank me

152
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:30,802
for saving you from being a loser before you retire.

153
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:35,362
I'll confess to them.

154
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,722
Sure.

155
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,322
You'll be in trouble as well

156
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:40,922
since you told me your patient's history.

157
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:43,802
What case is Dr. Shoan doing?

158
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:46,282
Traumatic brain injury.

159
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:47,882
Go find out for me.

160
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:50,962
- That's against the doctor's oath.   - Listen,

161
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,722
I won't let this affect you.

162
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,722
We'll both be in trouble

163
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:59,042
because we're one family.

164
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,482
Stop using "family" as your excuse.

165
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:06,802
You're just greedy. You did everything for yourself.

166
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,702
Why do other people have to take the blame for you?

167
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,482
If you're this kind of father,

168
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,042
- your son will be like you!   - Phruek!

169
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,722
Stop. That's enough!

170
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:34,682
- Enough! Listen!   - Please listen to me.

171
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:38,202
How can you be a doctor like this?

172
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:40,602
You can't be a resident anywhere,

173
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:42,122
not even here.

174
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,922
Shoan can't control himself

175
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,242
when he sees a dark-skinned man

176
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:51,242
with a large stature and a loud voice.

177
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:53,042
I don't know what the cause is,

178
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,242
so I asked for help from a psychotherapist.

179
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,002
It's probably the trauma that he got from his father.

180
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,722
He was abused by his father when he was a child.

181
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:04,482
But if he doesn't get better,

182
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:06,602
I'm afraid he can't be a doctor.

183
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:15,202
(Why did you come into this room?)

184
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:23,211
Shoan.

185
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:25,322
Shoan, don't be scared.

186
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,242
Close your eyes.

187
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:32,282
Good.

188
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:36,522
Do you remember when you're the happiest?

189
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:40,922
When I passed the doctor's exam.

190
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,642
Who was with you on that day?

191
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:47,842
Dr. Prapas,

192
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:49,882
and Mr. Kob.

193
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,642
Can you tell me how it went?

194
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:55,522
How did you feel happy on that day?

195
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,242
I can't remember it.

196
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:01,202
It's alright.

197
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:03,522
Let's try again.

198
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,082
Aside from when you pass your doctor's exam,

199
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:09,002
when do you feel happy?

200
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,522
Shin.

201
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:20,163
TV, animals...

202
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:22,802
And...

203
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,722
Plants.

204
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:28,962
When I see the color green, I'll feel good.

205
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:30,762
That's nice.

206
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,962
We'll do it like this then.

207
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:36,802
Whenever you don't feel good,

208
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:39,282
you should think of green.

209
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:41,922
Green will protect you.

210
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:49,442
From now on, he will have a tool to control his emotions

211
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,362
when he's stimulated.

212
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:54,842
He's really special, Dr. Prapas.

213
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:59,842
He has to work several times harder than us to reach this point.

214
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,522
We can't forget about his hard work.

215
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,442
Fortunately, he still has someone like you

216
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:09,042
who is always beside him.

217
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,162
That's your room key.

218
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,162
Thank you.

219
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:42,022
We're sorry. We still haven't finished painting the wall yet.

220
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:44,962
Please go wait in the room for now.

221
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,162
I'll ask the maid to give you your towel.

222
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:48,962
Thank you.

223
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,282
He's here again.

224
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,042
What should we do?

225
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:01,482
Why did he come here again?

226
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,122
We should go out to see him.

227
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:15,122
We're really sorry.

228
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:16,442
It's not finished yet.

229
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,042
It's been like this since last week.

230
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,322
The worker probably hasn't come yet.

231
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,602
Once again, we're sorry

232
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,082
this might be bothering you.

233
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,282
Can I continue painting it?

234
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,124
Continue painting it?

235
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:29,562
It's not like the moon we had in mind, but it's a lot better.

236
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,120
That's true.

237
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,464
Did he go to sleep upstairs?

238
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:37,882
I heard he got a ride to Sawangpanya this morning.

239
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,042
Sawangpanya?

240
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:42,882
He's probably going there to teach drawings to the kids.

241
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:46,842
This is pretty.

242
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,362
It's really nice.

243
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:22,642
Hello?

244
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:25,442
(I learned about what happened to Dr. Shoan)

245
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,402
(and Dr. Phruek at GMC from Dad.)

246
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,442
(He asked me to call you to warn you.)

247
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:30,882
Warn me about what?

248
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:33,842
(Are you alone?)

249
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:36,553
Yes.

250
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:38,122
Are you in the mall?

251
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:42,042
What's wrong?

252
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,922
Mr. Anat's A&R imported medicine

253
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,479
was investigated by my dad's people.

254
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:55,002
There are a lot of hospitals that order that medicine.

255
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:58,202
It has not even been approved.

256
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,882
Why would they dare to use that?

257
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,522
It's probably about the money.

258
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:07,802
Prapas said he was offered, but he refused.

259
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,282
Dr. Phruek has been promoted as the Head of Surgery.

260
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,002
It's probably easier for them now.

261
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:16,802
When I heard what happened to Dr. Shoan,

262
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:20,602
I thought something strange was going on.

263
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:23,322
How is it strange?

264
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:29,722
Someone like Shoan wouldn't easily let a psychiatric patient go out.

265
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,217
You have only met Shoan a few times.

266
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:36,362
Do you think you know him that well?

267
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:42,022
I know Kawee.

268
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,202
Kawee and Shoan are the same.

269
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,522
They are really immaculate with their job.

270
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:50,482
You should know better than me.

271
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,242
If you can't take care of Shoan,

272
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,464
he might want to work at our hospital instead.

273
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:02,545
May...

274
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,682
Are you here to pick a fight?

275
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:09,682
I'm being serious.

276
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,041
No one in your hospital understands Shoan,

277
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,122
even you, who should have understood him the most.

278
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,496
You don't really drink that kind of milk.

279
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:38,402
It's yours.

280
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:42,802
I picked it up because of my habit.

281
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,202
Because of your habit?

282
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:54,122
I still have a lot of stuff to buy. I'll take my leave here.

283
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:12,138
Excuse me.

284
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:13,562
Excuse me.

285
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:16,402
Excuse me.

286
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,202
Are you here to visit someone?

287
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:20,562
Good morning.

288
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:22,242
I'm here to see Mr. Kob.

289
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:26,002
Mr. Kob probably went out to the government complex.

290
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,362
He'll probably be back at around noon.

291
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,562
You can wait in our waiting room.

292
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,402
I'll turn on the AC for you.

293
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,842
I prefer that spot.

294
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:40,420
Well, please feel free to wait there.

295
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,442
Come here.

296
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,241
You pushed him.

297
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:51,962
- It's you. I didn't do it. It's you two.   - No, it's you.

298
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:54,562
- It's you!   - No, it's you!

299
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:58,282
- It's you two! It's not me.   - It's not me either.

300
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:02,522
- It's you two!   - No, it's you!

301
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:07,322
Let me see that.

302
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,002
It's just a flesh wound. No bone is broken.

303
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:17,122
I'll dress your wound.

304
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,202
He can't speak?

305
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,322
He can, but he wouldn't.

306
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:27,842
Pangpond. His name is Pangpond.

307
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:46,962
It's done.

308
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:52,922
- Mr. Kob is here.   - Mr. Kob.

309
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:55,042
I just went out for a short while,

310
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:56,842
but you already got another wound?

311
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:00,595
Pangpond, what did you do?

312
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:02,682
Why did you get injured?

313
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:05,722
Hey, are you Shoan?

314
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:11,482
Mr. Kob, good morning.

315
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
How many years have it been?

316
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:17,282
You're a doctor at this place?

317
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:18,562
No.

318
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:20,322
I'm studying as a resident.

319
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:22,682
Good, good.

320
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:23,882
Kids,

321
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:26,602
he had lived here before.

322
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:29,482
Look at him. He has become a doctor.

323
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,802
And don't you have work to do?

324
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:38,122
No. I'm running away.

325
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,122
I want to help you. Do you have anything I can do for you?

326
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:45,642
Sure.

327
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:51,925
(Surgery)

328
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:54,002
He hasn't come here since morning?

329
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:57,762
Em, is Professor Prapas here?

330
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:59,402
He's not here yet.

331
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:00,842
What about Dr. Shoan?

332
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:02,482
Did you find him?

333
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,802
No.

334
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:06,762
If Professor Archawin is here,

335
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:10,042
he will surely ask me. I don't think I can answer him.

336
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:11,682
I don't know what to tell him.

337
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:13,242
Don't know about what?

338
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,082
I don't know if the male lead will end up with the female lead.

339
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,922
We're talking about a drama. It's so fun, Professor.

340
00:26:23,474 --> 00:26:26,402
- The drama is fun?   - Yes.

341
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,002
Where is Shoan?

342
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:39,202
Go get another first-year resident to come here instead of Shoan.

343
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,562
But don't ruin other people's schedules too much.

344
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:42,962
Of course.

345
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:44,322
And you.

346
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:47,282
Don't do anything that will ruin your work.

347
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:48,922
Of course.

348
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,302
I'll leave it to you.

349
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,442
Should I go find him? Or should Tuk go?

350
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:00,842
I don't know.

351
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,482
- Which one should go?   - Good morning, Professor.

352
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,802
I've found him now.

353
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,482
Shoan is really at Sawangpanya.

354
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:09,922
Thank you.

355
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,282
After this case is done, I'll go see him myself.

356
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:14,802
Thank you so much.

357
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:16,962
I've talked to the kids.

358
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,922
We'll clean this room today.

359
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,642
Don't rush it. You don't have to finish it today.

360
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:23,322
I see.

361
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:39,562
Today, we'll separate the items in this room into different colors.

362
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:43,162
Red is for important items. You can't throw them away.

363
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:45,682
Yellow is for your general items.

364
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:48,482
Green is for recycling.

365
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:51,082
As for blue, it's for trash.

366
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,282
Roger that. We're ready.

367
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:54,562
Joi.

368
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:56,802
Don't throw them away.

369
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:01,122
Phai, this is for recycling.

370
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:09,442
Pangpond.

371
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,842
Don't throw any red ones away.

372
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:14,802
Don't throw prayer books away.

373
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:17,842
Don't throw storybooks away.

374
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:30,442
You've cleaned a lot of them.

375
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,242
Doctor, you're too cruel.

376
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:38,162
Let's call it a day now. We'll continue this later.

377
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,882
You've done a lot.

378
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,962
Mr. Kob.

379
00:28:46,522 --> 00:28:48,402
Pangpond is...

380
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,522
Yeah.

381
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:52,602
He's like you.

382
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:55,442
When his parents found out, they were a little shocked.

383
00:28:55,538 --> 00:28:57,762
Fortunately, his grandparents love him,

384
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:00,082
so they take him in.

385
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,922
I don't know what's going to happen to him.

386
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,602
But it's still alright nowadays.

387
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:06,322
Someone would still hire him.

388
00:29:06,602 --> 00:29:08,322
Like, he can bake.

389
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,122
He can craft stuff and sell it.

390
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:12,402
It's not as bad as before.

391
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:21,122
That's a file of your class.

392
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:30,116
Here.

393
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,202
Master Shoan Jatemeechai.

394
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,482
These are

395
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:35,384
your grades and history.

396
00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:36,642
Do you want to keep it?

397
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:39,202
I've graduated from a university.

398
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:40,642
I don't need it anymore.

399
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:41,832
Throw it away.

400
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:43,642
I see.

401
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:49,842
Dr. Shoan.

402
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:51,442
Someone is here to see you.

403
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:58,962
It's not good to run away like this.

404
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:01,722
I don't know what to do.

405
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,522
I don't like it when I can't do anything.

406
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:07,762
I couldn't help a patient

407
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,242
while I was in the hospital.

408
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,562
Go back to the hospital with me.

409
00:30:16,993 --> 00:30:18,402
There's a patient waiting.

410
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:22,722
He doesn't want me to cure him

411
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:24,322
because it's my fault.

412
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,682
I'm a doctor who puts my patients in danger.

413
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:32,402
Well, I think

414
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,202
I have to apologize to you first.

415
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:36,242
As for that matter,

416
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,122
don't worry about it anymore.

417
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,483
Dr. Phruek has found a way to help you.

418
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:47,962
(I don't know what he did to cause our patient to go that crazy,)

419
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,442
(but that could have killed him!)

420
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:52,082
(Don't worry.)

421
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:54,322
(No one can link it to us)

422
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:57,682
(since that hospital's security is so lax.)

423
00:30:58,187 --> 00:30:59,522
(I'll confess to them.)

424
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,922
(Sure.)

425
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:03,122
(You'll be in trouble as well,)

426
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,802
(since you told your patient's history to me.)

427
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,962
(We'll both be in trouble)

428
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:09,322
(because)

429
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:12,042
(we're one family.)

430
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:21,402
Our hospital will suffer a lot of damage if this recording is leaked.

431
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,762
Professor Archawin, what do you think

432
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:26,442
about handling this matter quietly?

433
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:28,282
Director,

434
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:31,042
for this incident,

435
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:34,162
I'll be the only one who takes responsibility.

436
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:36,932
But Shoan has already become the scapegoat.

437
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,442
For the punishment,

438
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:45,362
you and the board can take care of it with your consideration.

439
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:48,682
However, the parents of the patient deserve to know the truth.

440
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:51,562
That's true.

441
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:55,962
We'll call his family to tell the truth to them.

442
00:31:58,178 --> 00:31:59,722
As for you, Professor Phruek,

443
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:02,002
from now on,

444
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,939
we'll conduct an investigation

445
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:07,402
according to our procedure.

446
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:09,802
Of course, Director.

447
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:17,802
I know you're disappointed

448
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,162
because you thought I didn't believe in you.

449
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,802
But honestly,

450
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:25,282
I've always believed in you.

451
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,202
At the same time, however,

452
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,922
I want to explain and let you know that

453
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:34,962
our world

454
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:39,362
isn't just

455
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:42,082
black and white.

456
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:44,802
There isn't just the best or the worst.

457
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,570
There isn't just okay or not okay.

458
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:51,882
Not just black and white?

459
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:53,322
Yes.

460
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:57,442
Sometimes, it can be gray.

461
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:00,602
You don't like black.

462
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,122
You don't like big guys.

463
00:33:05,562 --> 00:33:07,722
You don't like loud voices.

464
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:10,722
But you can't run away from them forever.

465
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:22,162
Whenever you're ready,

466
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:24,122
please come back.

467
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,282
No one has even told me about this.

468
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:32,521
What if something happens to Shoan?

469
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:37,002
I'm afraid you'd criticize Shoan, so I didn't want to tell you.

470
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:41,682
You're afraid I'd criticize him?

471
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,642
What do you think of me?

472
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:46,282
I'm sorry. It's not like I want to do that, but...

473
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:48,882
And have you found him? Have you heard anything about him?

474
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:52,402
Nick and I went out to find him last night, but we didn't find him.

475
00:33:53,352 --> 00:33:56,362
Professor Prapas is going to get Shoan back from Samut Sakhon.

476
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:57,922
He's safe now.

477
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:00,062
- Professor.   - Professor, good evening.

478
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:04,569
I found him. He's actually at the orphanage.

479
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:09,442
Has he come back with you?

480
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:12,979
No, and I don't know when he will.

481
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,602
But it's fine. Please give him some time.

482
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,682
This isn't right. He can't do this. He is already an adult.

483
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:20,762
Are you saying you haven't done this kind of thing?

484
00:34:22,842 --> 00:34:25,882
See? You've always made a lot of people worry by hiding secrets.

485
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,970
He's talking about you.

486
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:33,762
Alright, alright. Don't worry. He's safe now.

487
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:35,282
Go back to work.

488
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:39,082
Professor, can I talk to you?

489
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:45,002
This incident is really connected to A&R's imported medicine.

490
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:48,322
Ronnaphop is trying

491
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:52,322
to gather evidence to submit to the Government Pharmaceutical Organization

492
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:54,002
for another drug examination.

493
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,042
That's why he wants more information from us.

494
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:03,402
Sure. I'll prepare it for him.

495
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:07,402
But there's another matter.

496
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:09,522
If it's proved that Mr. Anat

497
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,602
is truly guilty,

498
00:35:12,784 --> 00:35:15,282
Professor Phruek will be punished.

499
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:18,482
At the very least,

500
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:22,271
he'll be removed from the committee.

501
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:25,362
At worst,

502
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:27,562
he could be fired.

503
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:33,722
Well...

504
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:38,082
He's probably prepared for this.

505
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:39,922
He will accept

506
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:41,962
whatever the outcome is.

507
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,202
This is a good fair.

508
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:25,962
We're going to have fun here. There's a Ferris wheel.

509
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:27,562
Do you know what this is?

510
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,562
It's a Ferris wheel.

511
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,282
There, you should go get the balloon.

512
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:27,722
Let him keep this on his head.

513
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:29,362
He doesn't like loud voices.

514
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:32,202
Of course, Doctor. Thank you.

515
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:33,882
Let's go find Mr. Kob.

516
00:37:34,124 --> 00:37:36,642
Let's go. Where is Mr. Kob?

517
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:38,002
He's over there.

518
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:44,035
I'll go buy some squids for you.

519
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:45,242
Yes.

520
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:48,322
Excuse me, I'd like four squids.

521
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:49,482
Don't ground it, though.

522
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:51,442
Have you tried ground squids before?

523
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:53,842
This one isn't grounded. It's more delicious.

524
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,802
Will four be enough? Phai,

525
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,550
go ask Shoan if he wants squids.

526
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:00,842
Yes.

527
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:04,002
Wait a moment. You kids will get it soon.

528
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:06,962
- How much is this?   - Sixty baht.

529
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:08,202
Sixty baht?

530
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,602
I only have a 100-baht note.

531
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:15,442
You're my first customer today. Where would I get the change?

532
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,042
Gosh...

533
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:21,362
- Where is it?   - They're here to ask us to pay for the fee again.

534
00:38:22,658 --> 00:38:24,882
I haven't even gotten any money yet.

535
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,162
I only have this much. Just take it.

536
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,282
- Hey, that's not enough.   - Get away!

537
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,922
- Hey!   - Back off!

538
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,682
- Hey!   - What happened?

539
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,162
You!

540
00:38:38,578 --> 00:38:40,962
What's going on here?

541
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:42,282
What's wrong with him?

542
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:47,082
Don't pay it any mind. Here, eat your squid.

543
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,002
The squids look really nice.

544
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,642
Do you want some?

545
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:55,402
- What should we do?   - There is fun stuff over there.

546
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,842
So, are you going to go to the hotel tonight?

547
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:00,882
Yes.

548
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,162
I'm glad that you came to see me.

549
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,386
You should come again.

550
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,602
Of course, Mr. Kob.

551
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,562
Doctor, the headphones.

552
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,482
It's fine. I'll give them to him.

553
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:12,802
Wow, thank you so much. You should thank him.

554
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:14,442
Thank you.

555
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:16,882
Well, you should say goodbye to Dr. Shoan.

556
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:19,042
- Goodbye.   - Goodbye.

557
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,562
Mr. Kob, goodbye. Mueang, goodbye.

558
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,602
Bye-bye.

559
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:31,202
Hey! It's a thief! A thief!

560
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,522
A thief! There's a thief!

561
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,042
Pangpond!

562
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,202
Pangpond!

563
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:47,073
Mr. Kob!

564
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:52,002
Mr. Kob! Call the ambulance!

565
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,562
Mr. Kob, you have to stay still!

566
00:39:54,943 --> 00:39:56,442
Can you hear me?

567
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:58,362
Can you still see me?

568
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,682
Where does it hurt?

569
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:05,009
Ouch...

570
00:40:10,122 --> 00:40:13,282
His breath sounds clear. He's breathing a little faster than normal.

571
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:15,282
There's bleeding around his hip.

572
00:40:15,754 --> 00:40:16,922
His body is warm.

573
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:19,402
It's an external rotation pelvic fracture.

574
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:22,282
His legs are shortened. There's a problem with his hip joint.

575
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:25,682
You can't fall asleep, Mr. Kob. The ambulance is coming.

576
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:30,762
The patient is around 60 years old. He got hit by a car.

577
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,322
His left pelvic bones are broken.

578
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:33,722
He can't move.

579
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:35,042
Where is the nearest hospital?

580
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:37,602
(All hospitals in the province are full,)

581
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:39,602
(as there's a fire in buildings.)

582
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:42,255
(It's a mass casualty incident. No hospital here is available.)

583
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,002
(We'll contact other hospitals.)

584
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,904
(Does he have any medical...)

585
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,922
He has retired from his civil service.

586
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,322
He has retired from his civil service.

587
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:53,315
(Civil service? Then, he'll be transferred to GMC.)

588
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:56,442
(Please get on Highway 105. We'll contact them.)

589
00:40:58,332 --> 00:40:59,682
We're going to GMC.

590
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:06,722
(To GMC, this is the paramedics.)

591
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:09,482
- (Doctor, please.)   - (The patient is male, 60 years old.)

592
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:11,602
(He got hit by a car)

593
00:41:11,698 --> 00:41:12,842
(around his left pelvic bones.)

594
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:14,953
(He probably has pelvic fractures.)

595
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:17,562
(His latest BP is 80/60. Ox sat at 94%.)

596
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,242
(On cannula at five liters.)

597
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:21,722
Is that you, Shoan?

598
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:24,442
(Dr. Prim?)

599
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,082
(The patient will be there in 15 minutes.)

600
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:35,682
They're here!

601
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,322
Please help Mr. Kob!

602
00:41:37,403 --> 00:41:38,522
Please help Mr. Kob!

603
00:41:38,618 --> 00:41:40,482
- Calm down, Shoan.   - Please help Mr. Kob!

604
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:41,678
Please help Mr. Kob!

605
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,803
- Please help Mr. Kob!   - Shoan, calm down.

606
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:46,442
We understand. Your teacher is with the professor now.

607
00:41:46,523 --> 00:41:48,342
It's alright. Calm down.

608
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,802
- But Mr. Kob...   - I know.

609
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:53,466
- Mr. Kob... - Calm down.

610
00:41:54,885 --> 00:41:58,802
Calm down, Shoan. There's nothing now.

611
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:00,482
Alright?

612
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,562
Take a deep breath.

613
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:37,042
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

614
00:42:48,677 --> 00:42:51,002
Professor Phruek, his BP is dropping.

615
00:42:51,107 --> 00:42:54,682
Okay. Let's do pelvic packing first. Go get an orthopedist to do an ex-fix.

616
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:56,043
Of course.

617
00:42:58,322 --> 00:42:59,762
Widen the retractors.

618
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:01,762
Swab, please.

619
00:43:02,962 --> 00:43:04,482
More swabs, please.

620
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:07,482
More swabs, please.

621
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:13,522
More anesthetic. There's a lot of bleeding in his stomach.

622
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:15,700
Understood. We ran out of blood.

623
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:17,682
Someone, please get more blood from our blood bank.

624
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:18,882
Yes.

625
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:20,282
Swab, please.

626
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:29,642
Okay. More anesthetic. The vital signs?

627
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,162
We're starting to maintain his BP.

628
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:38,282
His urine is lighter.

629
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,742
Okay. We've stopped the bleeding.

630
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:42,562
Professor Top,

631
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,402
- I'll let you do the ex-fix.   - Of course.

632
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:45,922
Good job, everyone.

633
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:49,322
Get ready for an ex-fix.

634
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,602
Yes.

635
00:44:00,082 --> 00:44:03,322
Pangpond, wake up. The doctor is back.

636
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:06,282
The operation is over.

637
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:07,842
He isn't in danger anymore,

638
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,722
but he has to recuperate for a few days until he can have visitors.

639
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,402
Thank you so much, Professor.

640
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:17,242
That's a relief.

641
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,162
Pangpond, Mr. Kob is alright now.

642
00:44:20,747 --> 00:44:23,722
Right, Shoan. Please come into my room.

643
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,442
Of course, but please give me five minutes.

644
00:44:29,842 --> 00:44:31,042
Sure.

645
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:55,042
Mr. Kob is safe now.

646
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,962
What are you going to do after this?

647
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:20,962
I'll probably use this chance to visit my mom in Surat Thani.

648
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,842
I haven't seen her for a year.

649
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:28,242
Phruek, I'm really sorry about this.

650
00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:30,082
It's fine.

651
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:32,602
It's just two months. I'll be back soon.

652
00:45:33,186 --> 00:45:34,662
What about Copter? Will he go with you?

653
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:36,202
It's already the school break.

654
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:39,042
Oh, he'll be with me for a week.

655
00:45:39,177 --> 00:45:41,177
He's happy that he gets to travel with his dad.

656
00:45:41,663 --> 00:45:43,761
I had only been working in the past.

657
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:44,962
I could only

658
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:46,281
spend a few days with him.

659
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,428
He's confused

660
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:49,162
as to why his dad is free right now.

661
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:57,922
- He's here.   - Come in, Dr. Shoan.

662
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:02,762
Come in.

663
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,802
What business do you have with me?

664
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:18,082
I want to apologize for causing you trouble.

665
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,682
What trouble?

666
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,002
Well...

667
00:46:33,802 --> 00:46:37,802
I told someone with ill intentions that you're the doctor

668
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:40,137
who takes care of Earth's case.

669
00:46:41,057 --> 00:46:43,057
You leaked a patient's history.

670
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:44,762
That's against the doctor's oath.

671
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,242
That's not a quality of a good doctor.

672
00:46:47,922 --> 00:46:49,362
Insisting

673
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:51,402
is not a quality of a good doctor.

674
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:54,842
So in your opinion, qualities of a good doctor,

675
00:46:55,882 --> 00:46:57,242
what are they?

676
00:47:20,016 --> 00:47:21,482
I probably already forgot

677
00:47:22,264 --> 00:47:23,962
what a good doctor is.

678
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:31,722
When you do something wrong,

679
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:34,242
you're black.

680
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:37,242
But now you're saying the truth,

681
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:38,874
that's the right thing to do.

682
00:47:38,978 --> 00:47:40,922
You're now white.

683
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:44,322
You're both black and white.

684
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:47,562
Isn't that right?

685
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:52,762
Thank you.

686
00:47:53,323 --> 00:47:55,682
There's still someone who sees some white in me, at least.

687
00:47:56,464 --> 00:47:57,762
There's a lot of white in you.

688
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,362
Don't give up just yet.

689
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:09,804
You have to become a surgeon, got it?

690
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:12,362
Got it.

691
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:14,362
I'll be waiting for that day.

692
00:48:25,882 --> 00:48:28,162
You got this as soon as you made a wish.

693
00:48:28,357 --> 00:48:30,082
If you want to be a doctor,

694
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,792
you have to start practicing now.

695
00:48:31,873 --> 00:48:33,002
I believe

696
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:36,362
that these hands will save a lot of people.

697
00:49:02,122 --> 00:49:03,682
You're back, Dr. Shoan.

698
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,362
Aunt Yen?

699
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,282
The plant...

700
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:12,042
Dr. Prim said

701
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,962
you were the one who watered it while I wasn't here.

702
00:49:16,842 --> 00:49:18,042
Thank you.

703
00:49:18,746 --> 00:49:20,562
I also like plants.

704
00:49:38,265 --> 00:49:39,705
I'll give this to you.

705
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:45,002
To me?

706
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:48,682
You love plants.

707
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,282
You will probably take better care of it than I will.

708
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:01,442
Thank you.

709
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:05,562
It's already seven. I'll go out for my morning round.

710
00:50:06,842 --> 00:50:08,042
Yes.

711
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:26,602
Hi.

712
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:28,322
How are you?

713
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:29,762
I'm fine.

714
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:32,162
Look, am I not cool?

715
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:40,602
Doctor.

716
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:44,282
I now know that you didn't do anything to my son.

717
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:48,162
I'm really sorry for misunderstanding you.

718
00:50:51,032 --> 00:50:52,482
I forgive you.

719
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:55,042
I'll be more thorough from now on.

720
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:57,322
I'll be a better doctor.

721
00:50:58,442 --> 00:50:59,442
I see.

722
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,162
Someone told me

723
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:06,282
you were framed by others.

724
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:09,282
And everyone believed that.

725
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:11,442
That's right.

726
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:15,121
If you just stay silent,

727
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:16,922
everything will also be fine, right?

728
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:18,642
No.

729
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,322
Someone has to take responsibility for me.

730
00:51:23,128 --> 00:51:26,042
I know that this wasn't right,

731
00:51:26,442 --> 00:51:28,642
so I can't just stay silent.

732
00:51:47,753 --> 00:51:48,753
Shoan.

733
00:51:49,602 --> 00:51:51,042
Do you want to grab a bite?

734
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:57,642
What are you doing?

735
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:00,562
Searching for funds.

736
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:03,082
Hang on...

737
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:05,762
Are you going to study somewhere else?

738
00:52:10,882 --> 00:52:12,002
Dr. Prim.

739
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:14,522
You know a lot of treatment programs.

740
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,282
I have to help Mr. Kob.

741
00:52:17,393 --> 00:52:18,882
Mr. Kob has to wear a prosthesis,

742
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:21,162
but it's too expensive for him.

743
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:26,842
Let me see.

744
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,042
Just a moment.

745
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:33,802
Where is it?

746
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:48,802
Here, I found it.

747
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,962
You should try recommending Mr. Kob for this program.

748
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:58,922
It will be free.

749
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:00,130
There's no cost.

750
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:01,482
- Is this true?   - Yes.

751
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,322
Yay! We found it!

752
00:53:03,442 --> 00:53:05,202
Don't be too loud!

753
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,242
But...

754
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:16,562
You have to recommend him to the head of the program yourself.

755
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:19,522
Who?

756
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,553
Based on the patient's history, condition,

757
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:47,745
and status,

758
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:51,962
he can join the program.

759
00:53:52,169 --> 00:53:54,442
- Yay!   - But I have a condition.

760
00:53:54,618 --> 00:53:55,802
Oh...

761
00:53:58,562 --> 00:54:00,242
If something happens to you

762
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,562
and you run away from the hospital again,

763
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:05,722
the treatment contract for this patient will be null and void.

764
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:09,762
Does that mean

765
00:54:10,129 --> 00:54:12,162
you're mad at me?

766
00:54:12,522 --> 00:54:13,522
Yes.

767
00:54:15,162 --> 00:54:17,282
I'm mad that you're selfish

768
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:19,722
and ran away from the hospital.

769
00:54:19,896 --> 00:54:21,896
Don't forget you're a doctor.

770
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,770
There are hundreds of patients waiting for treatment from you.

771
00:54:35,882 --> 00:54:37,562
If you want to be a good doctor,

772
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:40,442
please think of patients a lot, got it?

773
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:43,402
Yes.

774
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,922
Are you going to let Mr. Kob join the program?

775
00:54:58,513 --> 00:55:00,162
Go check your schedule

776
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:05,306
to find the time for our surgery class.

777
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:09,745
I'll leave this to you.

778
00:56:17,682 --> 00:56:18,842
Hello?

779
00:56:20,156 --> 00:56:22,562
When did you arrive on the island?

780
00:56:23,016 --> 00:56:24,482
(Is something the matter?)

781
00:56:27,256 --> 00:56:29,962
Professor Prapas has come back to be the Head of Surgery.

782
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:32,242
I already know about that.

783
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,082
And when are you going back on land?

784
00:56:37,016 --> 00:56:39,016
(Professor, coffee.)

785
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:41,602
Sorry.

786
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,202
Win, I have something to ask you.

787
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:50,002
What?

788
00:56:51,602 --> 00:56:53,362
Do you like Dr. Prim?

789
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:05,362
May?

790
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,482
We're almost at the diving spot.

791
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:09,242
Let's check our equipment.

792
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:13,442
You can answer me when we meet each other again.

793
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,922
I have to go.

794
00:57:18,792 --> 00:57:22,162
For our first dive, we won't go deeper than 18 meters.

795
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:24,242
We'll continue to dive into the open water afterward.

796
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:25,841
I want everyone to be careful.

797
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:28,122
Be careful of the sand.

798
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:31,162
I think I understand now, Dr. Mim. These rankings

799
00:57:31,306 --> 00:57:33,962
are what people are interested in the most, right?

800
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:38,762
When we want something to get on a trend,

801
00:57:38,842 --> 00:57:42,362
we just have to find some people to share and tag them?

802
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,770
That's true,

803
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:48,433
but if it's not interesting, it won't truly catch on

804
00:57:48,514 --> 00:57:50,242
or get on a ranking.

805
00:57:50,443 --> 00:57:51,682
Like, this one.

806
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,922
(#GMCandShoan is getting popular.)

807
00:57:56,003 --> 00:57:58,402
(#Dontletthisstayquiet is getting popular.)

808
00:57:58,483 --> 00:58:00,021
(#Pleasesupportthepatient is getting popular)

809
00:58:00,328 --> 00:58:01,650
Dr. Mim.

810
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:04,602
- (Go away!)   - (Please calm down, Earth.)

811
00:58:04,802 --> 00:58:06,642
(It's dangerous, Earth!)

812
00:58:06,762 --> 00:58:08,482
Shoan is in trouble again.

813
00:58:08,602 --> 00:58:10,521
(Please calm down.)

814
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:13,242
- (How could I stay calm? That's my son!)   - (Please stop.)

815
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:17,762
Master Nick, please play better.

816
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,482
If you want to trash-talk me that much, just don't call me Master.

817
00:58:24,398 --> 00:58:26,642
Take this!

818
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,962
Nick, where did you learn this? You're a lot better.

819
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,322
This is normal for me.

820
00:58:35,976 --> 00:58:37,976
Hey, invite him.

821
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:46,642
Shoan, do you want to play together?

822
00:58:49,136 --> 00:58:51,442
It's fine. I don't know how to play.

823
00:58:52,665 --> 00:58:54,202
You have to try then.

824
00:58:54,352 --> 00:58:56,922
I'll let you borrow my character. Are you in?

825
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:05,282
Oh, man...

826
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:08,762
This is my first time on Silver Rank.

827
00:59:09,736 --> 00:59:10,922
Wow.

828
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:12,762
Shoan.

829
00:59:13,103 --> 00:59:14,402
You're a genius.

830
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:16,222
You can do anything.

831
00:59:20,546 --> 00:59:22,442
ER needs more help right now!

832
00:59:22,564 --> 00:59:24,402
The patient has decompression sickness.

833
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,833
Did you even come here yourself?

834
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:28,362
Why didn't you call us?

835
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:30,282
I already called, but you wouldn't pick up!

836
00:59:30,544 --> 00:59:31,842
The patient is Miss Maysa.

837
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:33,162
What? Miss Maysa?

838
00:59:33,243 --> 00:59:35,362
- Professor Win's girlfriend?   - Yeah, come on.

839
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,642
Shoan, just stay here. There'll be another patient.

840
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:45,242
How is it?

841
00:59:58,555 --> 00:59:59,602
Here.

842
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:01,482
Master Shoan Jatemeechai.

843
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:03,322
These are your grades and history.

844
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:04,722
Do you want to keep it?

845
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:10,082
Mr. Kob wants you to keep it.

846
01:01:12,018 --> 01:01:13,042
Shoan is right.

847
01:01:13,162 --> 01:01:16,002
The patient lost consciousness while driving due to severe myocarditis,

848
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,121
resulting in an accident.

849
01:01:17,202 --> 01:01:19,282
This way for CPR. Prim...

850
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:22,562
- I'll help.   - I need a heart to be changed for someone.

851
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,962
I don't know how you gained access

852
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,002
to the patient and donor information.

853
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:31,122
Or do you have any better reason for it?

854
01:01:31,242 --> 01:01:32,362
The life of this patient...

855
01:01:32,466 --> 01:01:35,282
- Get him!   - The patient inside is in danger!

856
01:01:35,467 --> 01:01:38,082
It's for the future of your autistic doctor

857
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:39,882
and your professor.

858
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:42,482
Yes, Director?
