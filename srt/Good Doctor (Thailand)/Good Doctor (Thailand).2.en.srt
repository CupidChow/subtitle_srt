(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,992
Hello, everyone. I'm Jojo. Welcome to

3
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,970
Shopping OK once again.

4
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:41,722
Today, I have a special product with a special price for you.

5
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:42,922
Here it is.

6
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:45,282
Namnao tea extract capsule.

7
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,362
The new natural extract

8
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,762
that's currently popular among celebrities in the country.

9
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,202
(We will be healthier together.)

10
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:57,879
(It can be mixed into drinks, applied on the skin, or consumed as pills.)

11
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:00,602
(Over 60% of the users have found...)

12
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:02,136
It can both be applied and consumed?

13
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:03,242
Is this real?

14
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,682
Does he know that it's an exaggeration?

15
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,562
Most elders in my area

16
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:11,442
have already bought them. They spent over 10,000 baht for that.

17
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,882
This annoys me so much.

18
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:21,802
Where's the new guy?

19
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:24,362
It's almost the morning round.

20
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:27,246
- Should we haze him? - No, don't do that.

21
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,561
- Just for fun. - I got fined 50 baht for each minute that I was late.

22
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:31,682
Fifty baht?

23
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,162
Who took it from you?

24
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:37,215
Nick, you...

25
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,402
- You again? - I only fined her 500 baht.

26
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,194
- Don't do it. - Come on.

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,162
- It's now 55, 56. - Mim!

28
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,402
- 57, 58... - Gosh...

29
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,082
59...

30
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,682
Come in. You don't have to knock on this room.

31
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:03,722
Excuse me.

32
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:10,522
Good morning, I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, 26 years old.

33
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,122
You came just right in time. You're almost late.

34
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:16,682
Technically, I should have come 15 minutes before the work time,

35
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,162
but the SkyTrain malfunctioned.

36
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,524
It stayed at a station for three more minutes than usual.

37
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:22,242
I have to go through five stations.

38
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:26,442
You have to track the time of the SkyTrain now?

39
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,882
It's fine. It's good that you come in time.

40
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:33,402
Go put your bag over there.

41
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:37,042
There. After you're done, Pleum will take you to do the morning round.

42
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,122
- Why does it have to be me? - What?

43
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:42,547
You're a chief resident now. Are you not going to work?

44
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:44,282
You should work hard.

45
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:47,202
Light the fire in yourself.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,202
Fine.

47
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:53,722
Let me light the fire in myself first.

48
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:59,002
(Reception)

49
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:03,522
Have you seen the new doctor? He's Dr. Shoan.

50
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,082
I saw him. He seems cool, but I heard he's autistic.

51
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,442
Then, he must be pretty talented.

52
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,801
There are two types of people with autism.

53
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:17,202
If they aren't geniuses, they're probably...

54
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:23,162
Look at him. His face really shines brightly in the dark.

55
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:31,322
Good morning, Em, Tuk, and Nam.

56
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:34,642
- Good morning, Dr. Pleum. - Good morning, Dr. Shoan.

57
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:35,882
Good morning.

58
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:38,519
I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, 26 years old.

59
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:41,762
I'm a first-year resident of the Surgery Department of GMC Medical Center.

60
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,162
Nice to meet you.

61
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,602
- Nice to meet you too. - Nice to meet you too.

62
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:51,162
We'll go take a look at our patients now.

63
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:52,643
- Here's the report. - Thank you.

64
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,682
You girls, calm down!

65
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,802
You don't have to introduce yourself that much.

66
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:02,722
No one wants to know your last name or how old you are.

67
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:10,242
She is 53 years old. She has CA breast metastasis to the cerebellum.

68
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:13,882
She has received a craniotomy with tumor removal.

69
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:17,922
She has rashes all over her body and is allergic to penicillin.

70
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,282
Won't you note it down?

71
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,322
She feels pain around her occiput,

72
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,299
and can't balance herself. Her eyesight is normal.

73
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:34,362
She hasn't vomited. Two weeks later, it's found she has Bell's palsy.

74
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:35,962
That's why she comes to the hospital.

75
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,962
After a CT scan, it's found

76
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:41,322
that she has a tumor around the left cerebellar along with cerebral edema.

77
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,162
I've read the patient's record.

78
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,562
What about this patient?

79
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:54,682
He is 65 years old.

80
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,282
He has legs swelling.

81
00:05:56,402 --> 00:06:00,162
After the examination, his creatinine ratio increases from 1.3 to 2.0.

82
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,882
His glomerular filtration rate decreases from 44 to 29 within four months.

83
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:05,562
That's why he has kidney failure.

84
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,642
He's currently receiving hemodialysis.

85
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,362
She is 40 years old.

86
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:14,242
She has gastrointestinal perforation.

87
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:16,242
She has already received her surgery,

88
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,482
but she's allergic to antibiotics.

89
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:21,163
After she was given medicine, we're waiting to see her condition.

90
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:23,562
You've done your research well.

91
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,105
That's pretty decent of you.

92
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,162
With green vomit, this isn't normal.

93
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,748
But the previous doctor said I could go home today.

94
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,442
With your dark green vomit,

95
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,099
there might be problems with your intestines.

96
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,843
We need to perform additional examinations.

97
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:23,722
What's this?

98
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:27,002
Excuse me. He's a new doctor.

99
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,281
So, can I go home today?

100
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:31,514
Please calm down.

101
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:32,925
From Professor Suthi's examination,

102
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,322
you don't have any further complications.

103
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,962
- But... - Wait, Doctor!

104
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,287
How could you say that to the patient?

105
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:42,002
The professor said he could go home.

106
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:44,659
There's something wrong with him. I have to report...

107
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:46,042
You don't have to talk anymore.

108
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:48,827
I'll just perform the check myself. You should just follow me.

109
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:15,122
(Episode Two - I'm Not A Robot)

110
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:23,042
(Examination Room)

111
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:27,609
Long time no see, Mr. Charoen.

112
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,610
Yes.

113
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,562
From the CT scan,

114
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,329
after you've been gone for four months,

115
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:48,362
it seems like it has spread to nearby tissues.

116
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,002
Since it's at this stage,

117
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,264
I can only recommend you to receive surgery,

118
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,282
or it'll spread further.

119
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,442
Yes.

120
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,682
I'll get surgery.

121
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:02,402
Dad.

122
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,762
I told you to not come back here again.

123
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:08,002
What are you talking about?

124
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,722
Think about it, Dad.

125
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:12,602
It's been four or five months.

126
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,402
The cancer hasn't gone down a bit.

127
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:16,802
It's useless.

128
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:20,002
- Let's go to other hospitals. - Excuse me.

129
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:23,242
He hasn't come back to us for several months.

130
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,562
You can't accuse us like that.

131
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,262
Several months?

132
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,522
Doctor,

133
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,282
please take a look at the app.

134
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:36,002
My dad has always come here.

135
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,122
Please don't say nonsense stuff here.

136
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,762
I can sue the hospital.

137
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,722
There's no need for the app.

138
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:45,122
I'm already here to receive further treatments.

139
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:48,002
Your tumor marker has increased.

140
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,522
It has also enlarged. I recommend that you get surgery.

141
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:55,002
I don't mind if you want to get the surgery here

142
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:58,242
or if you want to get it at other hospitals.

143
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:00,562
What are you saying?

144
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,282
I'll get the surgery here. No need for more trouble.

145
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,602
It's better if we get it done fast.

146
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,202
Dad, it's been several months!

147
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,322
Let's go to other places.

148
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,362
This hospital sucks, Dad.

149
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,681
Ten, I told you

150
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:29,282
to not cause a ruckus!

151
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:33,202
Did you tell them that our factory could do Pantone color?

152
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,922
How could you say that? I got chewed out by them!

153
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,082
You have to take care of that immediately.

154
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:41,562
After Khaning gets diagnosed, I'll take over it from you.

155
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:43,482
I don't know yet.

156
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,328
She hasn't seen the doctor. She said she had a stomach ache.

157
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:49,162
I don't know if she's pretending to be sick.

158
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,282
She might not want to go to school.

159
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:53,922
Okay.

160
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:01,042
Ten, if you're still causing a ruckus, I'll take your toy away.

161
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:03,082
Khaning.

162
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,075
Why are you always wearing your headphones?

163
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:09,642
I asked how you were. Do you still have a stomach ache?

164
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,762
I still do. You can just take Ten back first.

165
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:15,882
Do you want me to go back that much? You just want to play around, right?

166
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,359
You'll feel better after you take some pills. It's just gastritis.

167
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:24,162
Is that the new autistic doctor?

168
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,122
Listen, in the morning,

169
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,202
I saw him during the morning round.

170
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:32,802
I didn't even know what he was saying.

171
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,722
I couldn't even listen to him in time.

172
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,402
I didn't know what the patient had.

173
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:40,122
Really? Thank goodness that my son didn't go to him,

174
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:43,482
or else both the doctor and my son would have no idea what was wrong.

175
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:49,962
This is the information on A&R Medicine Company, Pas.

176
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:54,402
The company is involved directly with factories without suppliers.

177
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,242
That's why the price is rather reasonable.

178
00:11:57,642 --> 00:12:01,162
And from what I saw, the medicine isn't that different from what we have.

179
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,442
I don't think there'll be any problem.

180
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,402
This is an important matter

181
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:12,802
as BIO-C hasn't had any problem either.

182
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:15,082
And from the list you gave me, Phruek,

183
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,281
it's really similar to what we already have.

184
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:22,242
I think we should do more research. We don't need to make a decision now.

185
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:28,896
But I heard that A&R has a deal with a Spanish company

186
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:31,075
about some cancer medicine.

187
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:32,682
So, I believe that

188
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:34,882
if we get our hands on that medicine sooner,

189
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,042
it'll benefit our patients.

190
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,682
But if you're not available,

191
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:42,362
I can be the one to go talk to them instead.

192
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:48,322
Medicine importing has a lot of procedures to it.

193
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,802
You have to wait for the test and research results.

194
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:54,762
Even if you go by yourself, you'll still have to wait for those.

195
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:58,544
Thank you for suggesting this to me. It helps a lot.

196
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,121
You're welcome.

197
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:02,442
But I have to go now. I have to see my patients.

198
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,722
Oh, I also have to see my patients. Let's split up for now.

199
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,810
- I see. - Thank you.

200
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,482
Yes, thank you.

201
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,862
Do you feel pain around here?

202
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,482
Above that, please.

203
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,642
Around here?

204
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,459
You probably have gastritis.

205
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:47,002
She couldn't even stand up just because of gastritis?

206
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,202
We'll watch over her condition after she gets an injection.

207
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:52,002
You'll stay in the hospital for a night.

208
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:54,394
If her condition gets better tomorrow, she can go home.

209
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,322
I see.

210
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,322
What are you doing?

211
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:13,922
Shoan, I told you to not do anything against my order.

212
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,002
But she has ecchymosis.

213
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:20,362
Please stop surprising the patients.

214
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,078
She has gastritis.

215
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:25,602
According to the principle, you need to make a comprehensive hypothesis.

216
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,162
If she doesn't have gastritis,

217
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,642
with a stomach ache and bruises,

218
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:33,082
it can be hypothesized that she has septicemia.

219
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,882
It can lead to death.

220
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:36,101
What?

221
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:37,442
Please calm down.

222
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,522
You're distressing our patient here.

223
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,682
We'll let the nurse take care of you after this.

224
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,522
- Yes. - Sorry for the trouble.

225
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,522
Just go.

226
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,722
Go!

227
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,642
If you don't stop your nonsense,

228
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,642
I'll report this to the professors.

229
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,746
Prim, we'll have to freeze the sentinel lymph nodes tissue later.

230
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:23,386
Have you told the lab that it'll be an hour late?

231
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:30,106
- You have to tell them, right? - Yes.

232
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:31,946
- In case of an emergency. - Okay.

233
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:34,106
- I'll leave it to you. - Of course.

234
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,986
What's wrong?

235
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,666
I forgot to tell them to spare some time for this.

236
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:48,346
It's already noon. No one will pick up my call. I'll get killed for sure.

237
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:52,026
I'll be back. Please take care of this for me.

238
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:03,506
Excuse me.

239
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,506
I called you from the surgery department in the morning.

240
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,716
I'd like to report that we'd submit the tissue late.

241
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:13,386
When?

242
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:15,746
4 pm.

243
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,266
- 4 pm? - Yes.

244
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,146
I have to attend a cremation today.

245
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:23,906
I have to leave at three.

246
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:29,066
Please wait for a while. I promise I'll come here as soon as I can.

247
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:32,866
Hello, Professor.

248
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,626
What's the matter?

249
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:38,146
She would like to postpone the submission of tissues until 4 pm.

250
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,026
You're a surgical resident.

251
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:43,666
Who told you this?

252
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:45,426
Professor Archawin.

253
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:49,466
I knew it.

254
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,346
He's the same as always.

255
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,066
He always tries to rush everyone else.

256
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:59,706
You shouldn't back your professor up that much.

257
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:04,546
You're in your fourth year. If you know it'd be late,

258
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:07,346
why didn't you tell us yesterday?

259
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,408
So that we can prepare our staff.

260
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,826
Professor,

261
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,945
please don't say that much.

262
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,346
It's fine. I'll wait until four.

263
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,689
But if it's later than that, I can't stay anymore.

264
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,906
Thank you so much.

265
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:28,266
When I get it, I promise I'll come here as soon as I can.

266
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:31,129
Thank you. Thank you, Professor.

267
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:33,546
- You're welcome. - Sorry for the trouble.

268
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:40,053
(Reception)

269
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,866
You got shot. Mars Machina, good job.

270
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,866
That's not Mars Machina.

271
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,266
Because its chest isn't orangish red.

272
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,226
This is Venus Machina as its chest is yellow.

273
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:23,346
What are you talking about? There isn't Venus Machina.

274
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:26,346
Mars Machina needs to have a light on its chest.

275
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,986
It has. If you don't believe me, take a look.

276
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:44,386
Mom! The doctor bullied me.

277
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:45,866
Who bullied you?

278
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,626
That man.

279
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,786
What kind of a doctor steals a toy from a child?

280
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,582
Why did the hospital hire this guy?

281
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,482
What kind of a doctor steals a toy from a child?

282
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:57,706
You're already an adult. What are you doing?

283
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,346
Do you even have a mouth?

284
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,189
Do you know how to apologize?

285
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,066
Mom!

286
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:06,426
Please stop. He already feels bad enough.

287
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Does it hurt? Does it hurt that much?

288
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:18,226
We're truly sorry for this.

289
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:21,106
Doctor, please go out for now.

290
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:24,506
Doctor, please go out for now. Please.

291
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:28,578
We're sorry.

292
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,466
We're sorry.

293
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,026
What's wrong with you?

294
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,066
How many problems have you caused before noon?

295
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,026
Three.

296
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:47,866
I can deduce it from the three times that you raised your voice at me.

297
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,306
What's wrong?

298
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:54,946
Prim, please look after him yourself. I'm so tired.

299
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:58,466
What's wrong?

300
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,146
Thalassemia.

301
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,386
The patient has gallstone pancreatitis.

302
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:13,346
From her symptoms, you have to say that she has gastritis.

303
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:18,465
If you want to conduct a further diagnosis, you have to talk to the team

304
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:21,346
before telling the patient, as you might confuse them.

305
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:26,986
Understand?

306
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:36,986
Oh, it's 1 pm?

307
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:43,306
We have surgery at 1 pm. Do you want to go? I'll ask Professor Win.

308
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,545
- I'll go. - Okay.

309
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:54,346
I won't let you go in.

310
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,906
We need manpower here. You have to wait for Su's order.

311
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:02,866
You'll take care of the patients here.

312
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,546
But she's an ER nurse.

313
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:07,902
I'm a resident.

314
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:09,986
I have to listen to your order.

315
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,106
This is my order.

316
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,266
I told you to listen to Su's order here.

317
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,306
I'll leave him to you. Let's go.

318
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:18,826
I understand.

319
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:21,346
But I'm a doctor, not a nurse.

320
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:23,826
I'm a doctor.

321
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:48,466
Non-tooth forceps.

322
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,027
Hello?

323
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:56,497
I don't think we'll have it in time for 4 pm.

324
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:58,466
Can I postpone it for another hour?

325
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:01,746
(We can't do that, Doctor.)

326
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:05,666
(I've been waiting for hours. I can't even go anywhere.)

327
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:10,178
Is it not your duty to wait?

328
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:13,546
Right? I'll be there at five.

329
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:16,158
It won't be later than that. I'll be there as soon as I can.

330
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,946
(You couldn't keep your word.)

331
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:21,426
(What do you want me to do then?)

332
00:22:51,426 --> 00:22:52,866
This place is beautiful.

333
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:58,346
I feel relaxed whenever I sit here.

334
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:02,786
How's today?

335
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:05,706
Professor Archawin asked me to help at the ER.

336
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,626
He said I couldn't talk properly,

337
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,466
so I scared our patients.

338
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:18,306
I understand

339
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,966
that everyone

340
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:22,666
wants our patients to feel better.

341
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,826
But if you're too direct with them,

342
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:29,006
you'll distress them.

343
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:32,256
If you don't want them to be distressed,

344
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:36,746
or if you have to talk about death with them,

345
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:39,946
the first step

346
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:43,746
is to take a deep breath.

347
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,346
The second step

348
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,666
is to tell them, "It's possible that you have..."

349
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:54,666
The third step

350
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:56,697
is to tell them about their condition.

351
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,266
The first step?

352
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,626
Take a deep breath.

353
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:04,346
Yes.

354
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:06,106
The second step?

355
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:09,666
"It's possible that you have..."

356
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:12,506
The third step?

357
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:14,506
Tell them about their condition.

358
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,466
Good job.

359
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:31,666
Make a mistake, apologize, fix it.

360
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:34,442
What does that mean?

361
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:10,066
You're late.

362
00:25:10,171 --> 00:25:11,986
Could you please help us?

363
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:13,946
You told our staff

364
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,554
that their duty is to wait?

365
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:21,426
- That's not right. - I didn't mean it like that.

366
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,546
Have no one told you

367
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,784
to respect other people as well?

368
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,872
If you were able to think,

369
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:31,746
you should have told us sooner than this.

370
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:35,826
You can't just rush other people like this.

371
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:40,426
The lab is already closed.

372
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,666
Everyone has already left.

373
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:45,666
I can't help you.

374
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:02,466
But there's still the outside lab.

375
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,226
There's one lab behind the hospital.

376
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:08,186
- You should take a look. - Thank you, Professor.

377
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:10,786
Thank you so much.

378
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:20,666
Em, isn't the lab already closed?

379
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:40,106
Hello, this is the OR.

380
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,666
Just a moment.

381
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,946
Excuse me. This is the test result from an outside lab.

382
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:51,306
(Hello? H.N. 205450 has four negative nodes.)

383
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:53,106
Yes.

384
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:58,666
Close the wound.

385
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:12,986
Professor, how's the case?

386
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:20,098
Sorry.

387
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:48,626
Are you from the IT department?

388
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,980
(I'd like to know if we can check with the app)

389
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,492
(to see if a patient has really come to the hospital.)

390
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:56,226
(I have to check with the hospital's system to be sure)

391
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:59,320
as they could make an appointment through the app, but didn't come.

392
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:01,786
I'd like you to check one patient for me.

393
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:04,066
I'll send you the H.N.

394
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,586
You haven't come to the hospital at all?

395
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:12,506
My friend sent me a medicine from the internet.

396
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:15,546
He said it could decrease my creatinine ratio.

397
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,426
That's why I ordered ten of them.

398
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,371
It's the Namnao capsule.

399
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:28,432
And...

400
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:32,146
After my dad receives surgery,

401
00:28:33,106 --> 00:28:34,926
will he 100% be fully cured?

402
00:28:36,943 --> 00:28:39,343
It depends on the patient's habit

403
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:42,786
as cancer can always come back.

404
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:48,586
I recommend you to not take any random medicine again.

405
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:50,466
Yes, Doctor.

406
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:59,810
Please avoid drinking or eating six hours before the surgery.

407
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:05,826
Doctor.

408
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,946
I'm sorry.

409
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,586
How did you get the information on this patient?

410
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:28,866
Well, I just feel like there's something wrong with the app.

411
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:31,555
That's why I asked the IT department to check it,

412
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:33,752
and I got that information.

413
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:36,106
Do you have that much free time

414
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:38,586
to find faults with the patient?

415
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,087
Don't close it.

416
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:29,367
Dr. Shoan...

417
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:32,727
I thought you were a ghost when you're sitting in darkness like this.

418
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:36,407
Do I look like a ghost?

419
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,127
It's not like that.

420
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:44,927
What are you doing here? Aren't you going to check in on the patients?

421
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:49,127
Dr. Prapas said

422
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:51,887
I have to fix my flaws one by one.

423
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:54,271
Hold on.

424
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:57,327
Dr. Shoan, let me see that.

425
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:02,967
It's alright. I'll take care of it.

426
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,647
It's easy.

427
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:10,607
By the way, I'm really sorry about the other day,

428
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:14,207
when I misunderstood that you're not the doctor of this place.

429
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:17,615
I'm really impressed

430
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:20,527
when you helped that kid.

431
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:22,367
You're like a robot.

432
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:25,967
Like, you're like an AI.

433
00:31:29,552 --> 00:31:31,552
I must really look like a robot.

434
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:35,367
When I was an elementary student,

435
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:38,975
everyone said I was like a robot.

436
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,798
Everyone thought I didn't have any feelings.

437
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,407
That's why they kicked,

438
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:46,767
punched,

439
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:48,847
and pushed me off the stairs.

440
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:54,047
They thought I wouldn't feel pain.

441
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:57,687
Shoan is a robot.

442
00:31:57,768 --> 00:31:59,967
- You can kick him. It won't hurt him. - Get him!

443
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:06,640
- What did you do to my bro? - That robot's bro is here.

444
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:07,887
Let's run!

445
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:12,967
But I can feel pain.

446
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,767
I can feel pain like anyone else.

447
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:26,287
I must really look like a robot.

448
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,767
Somrak, you're crying?

449
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:54,847
When I said you seemed like an AI,

450
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:57,047
I just thought that you were extremely precise

451
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:58,847
when you helped the kid.

452
00:32:59,487 --> 00:33:01,047
Like an AI?

453
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:03,367
That's a compliment?

454
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,207
Yes.

455
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,367
Thank you.

456
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,487
It's done, Doctor.

457
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:15,687
Here.

458
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:21,407
It's still missing one thing.

459
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,167
What?

460
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:56,727
Prim,

461
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:58,807
take this to the pathology department.

462
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:04,047
Yes.

463
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:09,647
Don't send it to an outside lab again.

464
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:17,967
Do you think you're talented?

465
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,609
Is that why you can make a decision by yourself?

466
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:23,167
No.

467
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,567
I tried to do my best at the time.

468
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:29,927
- I thought... - But that's my patient.

469
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,887
Even if it's a small matter, you have to report it to me.

470
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:38,727
Yes.

471
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:42,287
We're working as a team, Primlada.

472
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,202
I thought that's the best way out...

473
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,599
You've given it a thought?

474
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:06,567
- Nick. - Yes?

475
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:11,127
- Quick! - Yes.

476
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,013
Doctor.

477
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,367
Is something the matter?

478
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:03,847
You're like a rabbit.

479
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:16,607
A rabbit is sensitive to sounds.

480
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:18,447
It doesn't like loud voices.

481
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,007
It likes to listen to what it likes.

482
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:24,687
I also like to listen to what I like.

483
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,607
I think I heard my mom's voice.

484
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,047
You still have a stomach ache.

485
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:42,487
I didn't feel any better after I got an injection from that doctor.

486
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:44,487
You haven't said you felt pain.

487
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,448
My mom wouldn't listen even if I said it.

488
00:36:47,568 --> 00:36:51,652
She already complained enough when I said I wanted to come to the hospital.

489
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:52,733
So...

490
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:54,527
Can I go home now?

491
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:55,767
No.

492
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,687
You still have a stomach ache.

493
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:03,007
Do you have thalassemia?

494
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:06,047
Do I look that obvious?

495
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:08,447
So, you must have Grey Turner's sign.

496
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,887
Can I look at your back?

497
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,287
What are you doing?

498
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:33,447
I told you to not get involved with my daughter.

499
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,567
We have a problem!

500
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:42,047
It's gallstone pancreatitis.

501
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,407
She needs an operation right now!

502
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:49,887
No, we need to do a CT scan first.

503
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,214
Doctor, you're crazy!

504
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:55,527
Nurse, please come into this room.

505
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:00,167
What's going on?

506
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,527
What happened?

507
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:04,779
She has septicemia.

508
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:06,887
She needs an operation right now,

509
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,472
or else she will have necrotizing pancreatitis. Please take her to the OR.

510
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:11,909
- Somrak. - Yes?

511
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:14,687
- Please check her hematocrit. I'll call the professor. - Yes.

512
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,847
What are you doing?

513
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:21,047
I'm saving her life.

514
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:28,047
- Please back off! Please. - What are you doing?

515
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:29,767
We're clear now.

516
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:32,447
Are you ready? Let's go!

517
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,927
Dr. Pleum, move! Please!

518
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:41,207
Turn right! Go!

519
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:57,967
This is the OR.

520
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,607
Dr. Shoan?

521
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:01,887
What do you want me to do?

522
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:03,823
There's a patient with an open incision in the room.

523
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:08,527
We're fortunate enough that there's an outside lab that's still open.

524
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:15,807
He's worried about you, or else he wouldn't ask me to come out with you.

525
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,946
After Professor Win is done with the surgery, you can apologize to him.

526
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:26,087
- Are you listening to me? - Take her inside.

527
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:27,607
We're here.

528
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,207
We're good, Doctor.

529
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,487
Please tell the professor that Dr. Shoan

530
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:36,486
just took a patient to the OR.

531
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,447
You tell him yourself.

532
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:42,807
Measure her blood pressure and pulse.

533
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:46,167
Measure her electrocardiogram. Wash your hands. Take your dress off.

534
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:49,049
You can't just give me all the orders at the same time like that.

535
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,047
What do you want me to start with?

536
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:52,327
Please call the anesthetist.

537
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,127
Call the anesthetist? Roger that!

538
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:58,367
You tell him yourself.

539
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,807
Are you crazy?

540
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,367
Professor!

541
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,487
Shoan just brought a patient to the operating room.

542
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:11,207
Which professor is going to operate?

543
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,607
No one.

544
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,807
Abdominal incision. Thick skin.

545
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,367
Shoan, stop!

546
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:35,007
What are you doing?

547
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:37,527
Professor, please help the patient!

548
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:39,327
She needs surgery. Please help her.

549
00:40:39,408 --> 00:40:41,167
- Shut up! - Please help her!

550
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:45,767
Professor, her BP has dropped. She needs surgery now.

551
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:50,127
We can't contact any professor at all.

552
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:51,727
I'll take care of this.

553
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,727
Perform resuscitation on her. I'll be back.

554
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:55,407
- Okay. - Yes.

555
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:58,687
As for you,

556
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:04,127
get out. Don't do anything until I give you an order, understand?

557
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,647
Normal saline IV with free flow.

558
00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:39,047
Did Shoan get out of that room?

559
00:41:39,284 --> 00:41:41,087
He's probably in front of the room.

560
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:49,047
Her blood pressure isn't rising.

561
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,887
- What is her CVP? - It's four.

562
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:54,567
There must be a bleeding somewhere.

563
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,287
What should we do? Her stomach is bloated.

564
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:01,767
Splenic vessel erosion.

565
00:42:06,447 --> 00:42:08,567
You need to check it right now!

566
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:09,967
Right now!

567
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:11,767
Shoan, stop! Turn off your mic!

568
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:13,879
We'll all be in trouble if Professor Win sees us.

569
00:42:14,003 --> 00:42:16,927
- Please check for splenic vessel erosion. - Shoan, if you don't stop,

570
00:42:17,503 --> 00:42:19,207
I'll call Professor Win.

571
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:25,647
Pleum, call him.

572
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,167
Yes.

573
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:45,087
This is the OR.

574
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:50,447
Professor, Dr. Pleum said the patient has bleeding in her stomach.

575
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:53,967
Tell Prim to make an abdominal incision, and I'll be there.

576
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,447
Nick, please close the wound for me.

577
00:42:57,623 --> 00:42:59,007
Yes, Professor.

578
00:43:13,144 --> 00:43:14,687
How does she have a lot of bleeding?

579
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:19,144
Is it from a splenic vessel erosion?

580
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:34,687
Right angle forceps.

581
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:41,607
Hold it. Another one.

582
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:49,007
Hold this.

583
00:43:49,446 --> 00:43:51,207
Pleum, perform a suction here.

584
00:43:53,384 --> 00:43:54,567
Here.

585
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:57,847
Metzenbaum.

586
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,207
With a rotten pancreas like this,

587
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,040
how did she endure it?

588
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:24,318
Close it with 2-0.

589
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:47,191
Professor, how's the patient?

590
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:54,287
Listen. Listen to me carefully. Listen!

591
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:58,567
If something like this happens again, I won't let you go.

592
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,167
I will never allow a doctor in your condition

593
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,687
to operate on a patient. Do you understand?

594
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:10,327
Nick.

595
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:13,660
Shoan.

596
00:45:20,977 --> 00:45:22,526
Professor!

597
00:45:22,647 --> 00:45:25,394
Wasn't that too much?

598
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:26,630
Too much?

599
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,526
You know that Shoan has his condition.

600
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,206
If he wants to be a doctor,

601
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:33,406
this is the reality that he needs to face.

602
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:41,366
No, I think you have to calm down and slowly give him an explanation.

603
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:43,286
He did that because

604
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:45,086
he was also concerned about the patient.

605
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:46,446
Concerned about the patient?

606
00:45:46,868 --> 00:45:49,566
A person with that kind of condition is no different from an AI.

607
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:52,446
Although he's smart,

608
00:45:52,574 --> 00:45:55,126
he'll only use logic to determine what's right or wrong.

609
00:45:57,246 --> 00:45:58,726
We're doctors.

610
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:01,227
We have to take responsibility for patients' lives.

611
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:03,906
We have to always consider that.

612
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:43,406
The patient is safe now, in case you might want to take a look.

613
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:46,966
And...

614
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,471
When you told us about the vessel erosion,

615
00:46:50,366 --> 00:46:51,726
you were right.

616
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:56,686
Can I ask you something?

617
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:02,686
Why did you decide to do that?

618
00:47:05,446 --> 00:47:08,326
I'm a doctor. I want the patient to be cured of her conditions.

619
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:11,086
I don't want her to die.

620
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:15,086
But surgery requires a lot more procedures.

621
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:21,286
AI...

622
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,366
Somrak praised me by saying I was like an AI.

623
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,206
But I'm not.

624
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:33,006
I just don't like it when I can't control myself when I am shocked.

625
00:47:35,306 --> 00:47:37,166
What kind of AI would feel shocked?

626
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,926
You're worried about the patient.

627
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:43,486
That's why you can feel shocked.

628
00:47:48,108 --> 00:47:51,286
When you're worried about someone, your heart will beat fast.

629
00:47:53,494 --> 00:47:55,706
What kind of AI would have a heart?

630
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:09,286
Are you okay?

631
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:48,806
Please wait, Doctor.

632
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
I just understood what you were trying to say

633
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,606
when I almost lost my daughter.

634
00:49:02,086 --> 00:49:03,846
If I had listened to you,

635
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:06,446
her life wouldn't have been at this much risk.

636
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:14,486
You have to listen to your daughter.

637
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:16,071
Sorry?

638
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,526
She has wanted to tell you several times,

639
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,246
but she was afraid...

640
00:49:24,524 --> 00:49:26,086
She was afraid to tell you.

641
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,886
Please don't raise your voice at her.

642
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:33,126
She doesn't like loud voices.

643
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:37,086
Please wait.

644
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:44,246
Thank you for the robot.

645
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:45,986
He really likes it.

646
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:53,206
(Warning, when you press its chest, you might be surprised by its light.)

647
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:03,446
I see.

648
00:50:12,902 --> 00:50:15,646
As the most senior resident here,

649
00:50:15,926 --> 00:50:18,566
I'll fully take responsibility for it.

650
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:23,326
This isn't something that someone else can take the blame for.

651
00:50:23,715 --> 00:50:27,926
There's an agreement between the doctors and directors.

652
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:30,622
If you make a mistake,

653
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:34,566
you'll be removed from residency.

654
00:50:35,213 --> 00:50:39,246
Your mistake doesn't affect just you alone.

655
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:41,246
If you do something wrong,

656
00:50:41,525 --> 00:50:44,072
Professor Prapas will have to resign from his position

657
00:50:44,152 --> 00:50:46,126
as the Head of Surgery.

658
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,206
The patient should have gotten surgery yesterday.

659
00:50:50,055 --> 00:50:51,486
What do you mean?

660
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:53,966
She wouldn't have required surgery

661
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:56,486
on the day that all professors were busy with surgery

662
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:57,725
if the doctor

663
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,606
hadn't told her that she had gastritis when she came to the hospital.

664
00:51:02,398 --> 00:51:07,286
You're saying the doctor of the case made a wrong diagnosis?

665
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:10,246
So, who's the doctor of the case?

666
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,686
She didn't say all of her conditions in detail.

667
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:25,126
She didn't say where she felt pain aside from her stomach.

668
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:27,726
That's why we were late in giving her treatment.

669
00:51:27,886 --> 00:51:29,286
It's thalassemia.

670
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:32,446
Dr. Pleum didn't see that she has thalassemia's symptoms.

671
00:51:32,646 --> 00:51:35,846
There was hemolysis which became gallstones.

672
00:51:36,053 --> 00:51:38,246
He also didn't see the Grey Turner's sign,

673
00:51:38,614 --> 00:51:41,246
so he didn't think of pancreatitis.

674
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:44,246
Dr. Pleum diagnosed that she only had gastritis.

675
00:51:46,884 --> 00:51:50,166
So, have you really asked about her medical history by yourself?

676
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:53,286
You're already a chief resident.

677
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:57,086
How could you carelessly give her a diagnosis like this?

678
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,926
Can you explain to me

679
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:02,366
what Grey Turner's sign is?

680
00:52:07,396 --> 00:52:08,766
It's a bruise

681
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:14,326
around the navel.

682
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:16,446
That's Cullen's sign.

683
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,046
You're a third-year resident.

684
00:52:19,347 --> 00:52:22,126
You overlooked this obvious sign on the patient,

685
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:24,046
causing her to almost die.

686
00:52:26,006 --> 00:52:28,166
What will you do if something like this happens again?

687
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:29,886
I'll perform checks more thoroughly.

688
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:32,846
That's easy for you to say.

689
00:52:33,511 --> 00:52:35,246
Did you win the lottery to become a doctor?

690
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:43,246
Alright.

691
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:47,966
This means that Dr. Shoan isn't completely in the wrong here.

692
00:52:48,718 --> 00:52:51,366
Since this is his first mistake,

693
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:53,686
I'll let it go for now.

694
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:58,166
But if something like this happens again,

695
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:01,326
I don't think I can let it go.

696
00:53:09,692 --> 00:53:11,692
Do you think you're so smart?

697
00:53:17,966 --> 00:53:19,446
Pleum, stop!

698
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:24,726
If the professors know there's a fight here, we'll all be in trouble.

699
00:53:24,975 --> 00:53:26,366
Look at what he did then!

700
00:53:26,613 --> 00:53:27,886
Take him away for now.

701
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,126
Get out for now.

702
00:53:30,503 --> 00:53:31,726
Shoan, how are you?

703
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:33,406
Sorry.

704
00:53:33,576 --> 00:53:34,846
Does it hurt?

705
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:37,806
Are you alright?

706
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:39,646
Professor, how's the patient?

707
00:53:42,813 --> 00:53:44,086
Listen!

708
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:47,406
You can kick him. It won't hurt him!

709
00:53:47,543 --> 00:53:49,886
I will never allow a doctor in your condition

710
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,486
to operate on a patient. Do you understand?

711
00:54:34,301 --> 00:54:35,846
Turn your face to me.

712
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:40,406
Can you turn your face to me? Let me dress your wound.

713
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:46,446
It hurts.

714
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,166
I know that it hurts. I'm trying to do it gently here.

715
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,166
I'm sorry.

716
00:55:02,654 --> 00:55:04,166
Take a deep breath.

717
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:09,006
And slowly exhale.

718
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:14,686
Okay. Repeat this. It'll help lessen your pain.

719
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:24,903
Thank goodness

720
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,606
that you only got hurt this much.

721
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:34,126
Honestly, what you said was true today.

722
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:35,526
I won't argue with that.

723
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:38,206
But you don't have to say all of it, understand?

724
00:55:40,526 --> 00:55:42,406
Dr. Archawin doesn't like me

725
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:45,886
and Dr. Pleum doesn't like me. Is it because I'm telling the truth?

726
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,366
It might be because

727
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,126
what you said

728
00:55:56,118 --> 00:55:58,286
might hurt them or something like that.

729
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:01,286
That's why they can hurt me?

730
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:07,046
They don't have any right to punch you.

731
00:56:12,157 --> 00:56:13,586
Well...

732
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:19,966
Sometimes, the truth

733
00:56:20,366 --> 00:56:23,006
can't be used to solve every problem.

734
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:28,886
Understand?

735
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:34,686
No one would listen to me.

736
00:56:40,338 --> 00:56:41,638
Turn to me.

737
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:45,006
Turn to me. Yeah.

738
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:48,166
It hurts.

739
00:56:53,006 --> 00:56:54,686
Are you brave enough to touch my hand now?

740
00:56:59,643 --> 00:57:01,110
Sorry.

741
00:57:01,428 --> 00:57:02,766
I'm just kidding.

742
00:57:21,823 --> 00:57:23,526
Today,

743
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:29,366
you've saved that girl's life.

744
00:57:29,478 --> 00:57:30,686
You know that?

745
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,486
Yes.

746
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:42,646
Good job.

747
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:48,366
Thank you.

748
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:18,726
You're friends.

749
00:58:18,854 --> 00:58:21,206
You should love each other.

750
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:25,206
You shouldn't fight with each other like thugs.

751
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:28,166
You have to talk calmly to each other.

752
00:58:29,646 --> 00:58:32,326
If you can't, talk to the teachers,

753
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:35,086
talk to the principal, talk to your class teacher.

754
00:58:35,198 --> 00:58:37,086
You shouldn't use violence.

755
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:39,646
- Understand? - Yes.

756
00:58:55,847 --> 00:58:57,526
(School Bus)

757
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:03,646
When I saw him, he already could breathe by himself.

758
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,446
When I first got there,

759
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:09,806
he had cyanosis. He looked really pale. He is really fortunate here.

760
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:16,206
I also found a boy sitting next to him. I asked what he was doing,

761
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:18,406
but he wouldn't reply at all.

762
01:00:06,456 --> 01:00:10,006
Dr. Shoan has already risked patients' lives twice.

763
01:00:10,126 --> 01:00:12,063
Didn't you take his medical history? Don't you know...

764
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:14,231
You believe you can change autistic people.

765
01:00:14,371 --> 01:00:16,172
I have to take responsibility along with Shoan.

766
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:17,196
Professor!

767
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,502
Isn't this the factory near Professor Archawin's house?

768
01:00:19,526 --> 01:00:21,606
The director said this was a mass casualty incident.

769
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:23,426
Everyone, get into your position.

770
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:28,126
Someone is trapped under the pillars. We need to send more doctors in.
