(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:44,722
There's a retroperitoneal mass in IVC.

3
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,762
It's a lump this big, yet you felt no sign at all, Win?

4
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,402
That's your homework.

5
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:00,402
Professor, what's wrong?

6
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:05,962
It's nothing. Maybe I stood too long in operations these past few days.

7
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:07,522
NSAIDs will do.

8
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:09,642
How could you get into a fight with kids?

9
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:12,402
Shoan was ganged up on, so I had to...

10
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:15,042
See?

11
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:16,562
- Ouch. - What's wrong, Win?

12
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:17,962
I might have sat down too long.

13
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:20,866
I stopped drinking alcohol for now as I'm taking NSAIDS for my back pain.

14
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,003
It's probably a little stiff.

15
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:24,642
- Are you alright? Shouldn't we do a test? - It's alright.

16
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,882
It might be just a tumor.

17
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:36,442
We'll have to wait for the MRI results from a radiologist first.

18
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,882
If you want to be sure,

19
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,682
you should do a biopsy.

20
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:43,522
Please don't tell anyone about this yet.

21
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:46,442
I want to be more certain first.

22
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,682
What about Prapas?

23
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:54,842
Don't.

24
00:02:58,393 --> 00:02:59,562
Fine.

25
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:39,996
(Maysa - Missed Call)

26
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:47,242
(Episode 18: Missed)

27
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,042
Are you ready to go to another room?

28
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:55,362
The dog will go with you.

29
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,962
The dog is going.

30
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:14,722
I have to brush my teeth first.

31
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:21,642
Where are they taking that child patient?

32
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,322
To appendix surgery.

33
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,162
I feel bad for her.

34
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,436
Even we, who are adults, are scared of it.

35
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:34,002
She's a small child. Giving anesthesia to her is probably hard, isn't it?

36
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:37,019
It's difficult.

37
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,144
When a small child has to get surgery,

38
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,242
a doctor will let their parents go in during the anesthesia procedure.

39
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:46,762
An anesthesiologist will give an anesthesia balloon for a child to blow on.

40
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,722
If the parents are with them,

41
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:50,722
they'll be less worried.

42
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,807
And also...

43
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:56,002
The anesthesia will have a sweet smell.

44
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:57,682
That's nice.

45
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:01,002
If you're parents,

46
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,882
you probably don't want your child to be sick or in pain.

47
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,889
I hope

48
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:10,602
you'll be strong and healthy.

49
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,522
Has Win told you?

50
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,202
Yes.

51
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:22,202
Shoan, I have something to ask you.

52
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,642
Yes?

53
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,718
I've read that a child's intelligence

54
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:29,562
will be gained from the mother more than the father. Is that true?

55
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:30,955
It's true.

56
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,185
I'll explain it as simply as possible.

57
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:38,362
From various research, it's found

58
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:40,922
that the mother's genes are mostly kept

59
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,922
around the cerebral cortex

60
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,882
which controls your thought, logic,

61
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:48,482
language, and planning.

62
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:51,042
As for the father's genes, they're mostly kept

63
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,522
around the limbic system.

64
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:57,002
The limbic system controls your sex, eating, and emotions.

65
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,922
So, we can conclude that

66
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,362
a part of a child's intelligence comes from their mother.

67
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:05,762
As for the remaining 40-60 percent, it comes from their environment.

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,042
The more information I have, the more I'm concerned.

69
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:20,202
During the nine months in my belly, I don't know

70
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,242
if I could look after the baby well enough.

71
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,282
I'm worried that I will make a mistake.

72
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:33,642
I hope that when it's time for the baby to come out,

73
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,482
the baby will be strong and healthy.

74
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:57,162
Professor.

75
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:07,322
Goodnight.

76
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,682
Goodnight.

77
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:21,562
Win, do you want our baby to be a boy or a girl?

78
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,242
Anything is fine by me.

79
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,562
But if it's a girl,

80
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:31,042
she'll probably be so cute.

81
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,442
If it's a boy, I'll gladly take him to play around.

82
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,882
We should buy unisex clothes for now.

83
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:44,442
All of those children's clothes are so cute, Win.

84
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,202
I want them all.

85
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:50,018
For now, you have to sleep

86
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:53,202
because your baby is also sleepy.

87
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,882
Okay.

88
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,522
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

89
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,802
Aren't you worried about safety at all?

90
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:03,922
What if this stuff hits people's heads?

91
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:05,562
How could you work like this?

92
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,962
- I'll report to the district office right now. - Please calm down.

93
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,681
The boss is here.

94
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,642
Please wait for a moment.

95
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,922
- What's the matter? - You.

96
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,739
- Is something wrong? - What happened, Em?

97
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,802
Dr. Nick, look at this.

98
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,562
Look at those stones. What if it hit our patients?

99
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,922
I'll be more careful from now on.

100
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:27,168
If something happens, you can call me.

101
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,362
You have to be more careful than this. It's really dangerous.

102
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:34,002
Yes. I'm really sorry about this.

103
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:36,704
Let's go, Em.

104
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,082
Why would you have that safety first sign then? What if it hit my head?

105
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,682
- Clean it. - Yes.

106
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:45,962
Sorry about that.

107
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,442
Please get the divorce paper from Mrs. Aum as soon as possible.

108
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:52,242
I don't want to wait long.

109
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:19,242
Today, the baby is 12 weeks and four days old.

110
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:23,962
From the ultrasound, you can see that it already has arms and legs.

111
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,922
What about the size and completion?

112
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:32,042
It's in accordance with the standard. Don't worry too much.

113
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:34,522
Since this is your first trimester,

114
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,242
we'll look at the nuchal thickening to see if it has Down syndrome.

115
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,042
The nuchal thickening is normal here,

116
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:48,402
but we still have to wait for the blood result from the mother.

117
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,457
Yes, and do we know the gender now?

118
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,043
Yeah. Is it a boy or a girl?

119
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,503
It doesn't show today.

120
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:58,584
Let's wait until the next ultrasound.

121
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,082
Yes.

122
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:17,962
Hello.

123
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:21,722
Win, you still have work to do, right?

124
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:24,682
I can just go back by myself.

125
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,582
I'll drive you home.

126
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:29,002
It's fine. You should go back to work.

127
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,442
Be careful, alright?

128
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,802
Sure. Don't worry.

129
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,090
I'm going.

130
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:38,762
- See you at home. - Yes.

131
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,642
Are you here by yourself?

132
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:53,602
- Yes. - Okay.

133
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:55,327
Well...

134
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,802
From the biopsy of your tissue from your peptic ulcer condition,

135
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,522
it's found that it's cancer.

136
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,082
But from the CT scan,

137
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:09,802
it still hasn't spread to nearby organs such as the lymph nodes

138
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,522
or other further organs.

139
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:16,322
It means that it can still be fully treated.

140
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:20,202
What treatment do you recommend for this?

141
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,242
We'll have to perform surgery to remove your stomach

142
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:25,882
and nearby lymph nodes.

143
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:28,562
We'll wait for the lab results of the big tissues

144
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:32,402
to see if it has spread to other organs.

145
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:35,562
If it has, you'll have to get chemotherapy.

146
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:40,162
It depends on your decision. If you can make a decision quickly,

147
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,162
it can stop the cancer from spreading to other places.

148
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:47,882
Do I have to stay in the hospital for a long time?

149
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:52,442
The surgery process takes around five to seven days.

150
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,642
If there are not any complications, you can go home immediately.

151
00:12:56,042 --> 00:13:00,562
We'll give you chemotherapy after you recover from your surgery.

152
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,595
During chemotherapy, you can go home.

153
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,302
You don't have to stay in the hospital.

154
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,042
What if I want to stay?

155
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,162
Well, our hospital

156
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:16,929
needs to prepare rooms for patients who really require it.

157
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,522
We're sorry.

158
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:22,082
Is it difficult for you to come and go to the hospital?

159
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:25,682
Yes.

160
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:30,662
That's alright. I think...

161
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:33,162
Let's just talk about your surgery for now.

162
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:36,202
As for your chemotherapy, we can talk about that later.

163
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:39,682
- Yes. Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you.

164
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,322
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

165
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,822
- Please wait outside. - Yes.

166
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,496
There's no patient anymore, Professor.

167
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:48,802
Thank you.

168
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,322
Thank you.

169
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:55,882
Shoan.

170
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:59,682
We have to postpone our simulation course for now. I'm a little busy.

171
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:03,202
If you want to practice more, should I ask Professor Prapas for you?

172
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,737
Yes.

173
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:11,642
Okay. For this case, I'll leave it to you and Shoan.

174
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,162
- Yes. - Yes.

175
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,242
The patient earlier...

176
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:43,122
He didn't tell the truth.

177
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,722
Really? There might have been something he didn't want to talk about.

178
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:50,802
Someone like me doesn't understand lying.

179
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:52,882
I can't lie either.

180
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,522
A lot of people say lying isn't good.

181
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,962
But I found that people sometimes lie

182
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:02,802
for good reasons.

183
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,202
And do you understand now it's not easy to tell the truth sometimes?

184
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:12,682
If you're lied to...

185
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:16,571
Should you feel good or feel bad

186
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:19,202
- if you're lied to with good reasons? - Shoan...

187
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:22,402
Why do you always like to ask me difficult questions?

188
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:24,402
I'm having a headache, you know.

189
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,162
A headache, like this.

190
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,082
Hello, Mom.

191
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,882
Yes.

192
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:50,402
Yes.

193
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:54,402
What's the matter?

194
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:08,808
- Good evening. - Good evening.

195
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,802
(Mr. Surashet Jatemeechai)

196
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:37,512
(Mr. Surashet Jatemeechai, Born 8th August 1965, Died 16th September 2024)

197
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,002
Your dad said we should only hold a funeral for a night.

198
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,082
We could hold the cremation tomorrow

199
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,842
so that he wouldn't cause more trouble for us.

200
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,762
Shoan, you can go home now. You don't have to worry.

201
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,962
Shoan, do you want to stay with your mother?

202
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:01,882
Yes.

203
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:09,322
Shoan can stay with you tonight, Aunt Yen.

204
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:13,562
I'll pick him up tomorrow. I already booked a hostel around here.

205
00:17:17,673 --> 00:17:18,882
Alright.

206
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:23,362
- Thank you so much, Dr. Prim. - It's alright. I'll drive you home.

207
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,202
Is it hot?

208
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:36,162
Well, our house is old. We don't have an air conditioner.

209
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,962
Sleeping here isn't that comfortable.

210
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:42,962
Should I call a taxi and get you to a hotel?

211
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:44,602
It's fine.

212
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,031
This is what you're thinking, isn't it?

213
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:01,522
If I stay with you,

214
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,442
I might be uncomfortable.

215
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:05,858
But if I'm with other people,

216
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:08,242
I'll be more comfortable than being with you, right?

217
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,802
I understand

218
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:16,602
that I'm not like others.

219
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:30,082
Yes.

220
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,722
I admit

221
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,562
that it's really difficult for me.

222
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:46,362
I didn't know who I could ask for help back then.

223
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,682
I didn't have money or knowledge.

224
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,642
I could only think of one thing.

225
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:56,662
I had to separate you from your dad.

226
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,442
But the thing I was afraid of the most

227
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,002
was myself.

228
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:16,442
Why are you like this?

229
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:18,327
What are you doing?

230
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,259
- Why are you only causing problems? - Calm down.

231
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:21,562
Mom, don't hurt my brother.

232
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,962
Can you stop causing trouble for me?

233
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:26,402
I'm already tired enough.

234
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:28,882
Do you want me to die sooner?

235
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:33,262
You're causing problems for me every day.

236
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:36,842
- Do you know... - I

237
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,002
would be the one to hurt you.

238
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,547
I don't understand.

239
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:00,122
Why did you have to hurt me?

240
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:04,322
Is it because I'm autistic?

241
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:06,258
Or is it because I'm a bad omen?

242
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:16,802
Yes.

243
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,362
I admit

244
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:25,922
that I thought

245
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:30,921
you were a bad omen.

246
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,442
That's why I left you.

247
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:42,322
It's been 20 years

248
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,162
since you left him at an orphanage,

249
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:47,162
no matter what your reason was.

250
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,282
Doctor,

251
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,642
I took Shoan to stay at Mr. Kob's orphanage for a few days.

252
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:56,723
If it's not too much trouble,

253
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,642
I'd like you to go watch over Shoan.

254
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:02,402
When I find a residence in another district,

255
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,082
I'll secretly take Shoan back with me.

256
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,922
I'm sorry.

257
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,522
I'm sorry, Shoan,

258
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,050
for not protecting you,

259
00:23:25,897 --> 00:23:27,897
and for not staying with you.

260
00:23:30,737 --> 00:23:32,322
I'm sorry.

261
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:34,202
It's my fault.

262
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,442
It's my fault.

263
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,802
It's fine.

264
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,042
Don't cry.

265
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,682
Please don't cry.

266
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,430
(Mr. Surashet Jatemeechai, Born 8th August 1965, Died 16th September 2024)

267
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:46,242
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

268
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,442
Good afternoon.

269
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:57,562
Thank you so much, Doctor.

270
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,082
Goodbye.

271
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:04,842
Thank you.

272
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,442
Goodbye.

273
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:18,322
Thank you so much, Doctor,

274
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:20,922
for everything.

275
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,042
It's fine.

276
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:29,442
And what are you going to do from now on?

277
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,962
I've been thinking.

278
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:35,322
I might do something here to make money for myself.

279
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:37,912
I don't want to trouble Shoan.

280
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:44,922
When we're at this age and look back at what we've done,

281
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:50,082
we will feel regret for the mistakes we've made in the past.

282
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:57,242
Yes.

283
00:25:58,402 --> 00:26:01,002
But we can only think about it

284
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:03,802
as we can't go back to the past.

285
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,562
Yes.

286
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,522
We can't turn back time.

287
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:19,642
But we can choose not to repeat the same mistake.

288
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:51,657
- We'll get going, then. - Thank you.

289
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:52,962
Goodbye, Professor.

290
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,522
Thank you.

291
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,682
I'll go get the car, then.

292
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:04,081
Yes.

293
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:12,402
Shoan.

294
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,242
Have a safe trip.

295
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:24,064
Don't worry about me.

296
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,802
I'll call you later.

297
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:30,042
Yes.

298
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:37,402
Mom, there's something I'm wondering about.

299
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,917
If you were ready back then,

300
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:43,190
you wouldn't leave me, right?

301
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:29,762
Dr. Prim.

302
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:32,096
There's one place I want to go before we go back.

303
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:33,562
Sure.

304
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:35,122
I'll tell you the way.

305
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:02,473
At that abandoned salt storage,

306
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:05,422
Shin, my brother, died there.

307
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:18,482
Do you miss Shin?

308
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,802
I'm starting to understand lying now.

309
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,343
When I look at the moon

310
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:44,442
and think that Shin's over there,

311
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,242
I'm lying to myself.

312
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,225
In scientific theory,

313
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:56,122
it's impossible.

314
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:05,042
But when I think like that, it makes me feel really good.

315
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:08,562
You can forget about science sometimes.

316
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:14,282
You can focus on what makes you feel good.

317
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:27,202
Our lives

318
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,667
are better if we have someone we miss,

319
00:30:33,252 --> 00:30:34,962
rather than not having one at all.

320
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,082
I'm serious.

321
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:45,122
Is it about to end?

322
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:50,442
The fact that I bring bad luck

323
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,586
and that I am the reason for everything that went wrong.

324
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:00,825
Is it really about to end now?

325
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:06,042
Don't think like this again.

326
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:09,882
Because that's not true.

327
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,698
From the test,

328
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,362
it's found that you have stage two sarcoma cancer.

329
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,282
There's a high chance it'll spread,

330
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:05,202
but there's more than 50 percent you can be fully cured of it.

331
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,755
So, if you can

332
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,882
make a decision about your treatment soon, that'll be good for you.

333
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:15,162
Will I be fully cured if I get surgery?

334
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:18,107
We'll do our best to help you.

335
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:21,762
Please cure me, Doctor.

336
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,042
Yes.

337
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:30,602
Although we've removed most of the tumor,

338
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:32,122
his...

339
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:35,082
His nerves have received a lot of damage...

340
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:39,042
From now on,

341
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:43,122
his lower body won't be able to move anymore.

342
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:48,762
I'm scared, Doctor.

343
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:51,802
It'll be fine if I'm cured after surgery.

344
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:54,762
But if I become paralyzed,

345
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:58,282
I'll lose the time I'll get to spend with my family

346
00:32:58,762 --> 00:33:01,922
while I still have enough strength to support my family.

347
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,442
Professor Prapas said

348
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:22,202
a doctor needs to be used to saying goodbye.

349
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,242
When it's my dad,

350
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:30,202
I really feel like that.

351
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:39,322
It's true.

352
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:44,642
When you go through it yourself,

353
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,922
it's difficult.

354
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:11,842
I won't go home for now.

355
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,242
You have to settle the divorce soon.

356
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,522
I don't want to wait long.

357
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:24,962
- Thank you. - Em.

358
00:34:25,122 --> 00:34:27,202
This is the morning patient.

359
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,202
Be careful.

360
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:49,447
Can you hear me?

361
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:52,762
- Doctor... - The patient is still conscious.

362
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,558
His BP is fine, but his pulse is rapid.

363
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:59,002
Pleum, set up the OR and perform a resuscitation on him.

364
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:02,202
Get someone to get Professor Win. Wait...

365
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:17,682
I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, a first-year surgical resident.

366
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:19,682
I would like to start a team briefing.

367
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,919
The surgical team, please introduce yourself.

368
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,643
I'm Professor Archawin, the main surgeon.

369
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,042
I'm Dr. Primlada, a fourth-year surgical resident.

370
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:27,702
I'm Dr. Panthep Chokeswate,

371
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,682
a fourth-year surgical resident.

372
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:30,882
I'm Dr. Thanaphat,

373
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:33,242
a third-year surgical resident,

374
00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:36,026
- assistant three. - I'm Professor Chanida, the anesthesiologist.

375
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,387
I'm Nisara, the nurse anesthetist.

376
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:39,962
Kanchana Chanadda, the scrub nurse.

377
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,050
The patient is Phumiphat Viriyaacha,

378
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:46,682
43 years old. Known case CA stomach. He's waiting for surgery.

379
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:50,762
The diagnosis is penetrating abdominal injury with hemorrhagic shock.

380
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:53,322
We're about to explore laparotomy

381
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:57,562
to remove the steel rod and fix damaged internal organs.

382
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:00,402
Are the monitor and anesthesiologist's tools ready?

383
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:03,382
- Yes. - Is the pulse oximeter ready?

384
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:06,962
- Yes. - Does he have any problem with his airway or aspiration?

385
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,522
We're ready for rapid sequence induction.

386
00:36:09,673 --> 00:36:12,242
Is there a chance he'll lose more than 500 cc of blood?

387
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:14,322
- Yes. - How will we handle it?

388
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:16,437
We've prepared a large bore IV

389
00:36:16,562 --> 00:36:20,042
and we've activated a massive transfusion protocol.

390
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:22,738
The patient takes antibiotics before coming into the OR.

391
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:24,202
Ceftriaxone two grams,

392
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:27,322
and Metronidazole 500 mg. Both are two doses.

393
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,617
Two grams of ceftriaxone were already gone 10 minutes ago.

394
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,322
As for 500 mg of Metronidazole, it's still dripping.

395
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,562
Head Surgeon,

396
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:37,602
do you have anything to inform your team?

397
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,402
You can tell them for me.

398
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:42,002
Yes.

399
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:44,762
The patient was stabbed by a steel rod

400
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:46,922
from the left abdomen to the right back.

401
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:50,882
It's possible that he might have vascular injury, especially with IVC.

402
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,042
We might have to do IVC clamps.

403
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,210
Please prepare for that, Anesthesiologist.

404
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:58,562
Scrub nurse, prepare the tools for vessel repair.

405
00:36:58,723 --> 00:37:01,122
The tools are clean and ready to be used.

406
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,962
As for the stomach cancer,

407
00:37:03,122 --> 00:37:04,722
don't do anything with it for now.

408
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:07,099
Is there anything you have to tell the team, Anesthesiologist?

409
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:09,123
This is a high-risk patient.

410
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:13,042
There's a chance for intraoperative cardiac arrest and DOT.

411
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:16,402
Has the surgical team talked about risks with his family?

412
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:19,402
The hospital still can't contact his family.

413
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:21,082
If there's an emergency,

414
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:23,211
we'll do our best to help the patient first.

415
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:24,722
Roger that.

416
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:28,082
If there are not any more questions,

417
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:30,322
I'd like to end the team briefing.

418
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:42,002
Excuse me, is there a patient from an accident called

419
00:37:42,242 --> 00:37:44,522
Phumiphat Viriyaacha?

420
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:47,078
Phumiphat Viriyaacha...

421
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:49,122
Are you his family?

422
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,762
Yes.

423
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:54,642
The patient didn't say that he had a family.

424
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,242
Please take a look at the document and sign it.

425
00:37:58,426 --> 00:37:59,842
If there's an emergency,

426
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,562
doctors have to save the patient's life before asking for permission.

427
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:11,122
At this spot?

428
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:15,442
From the data, he has to get surgery for his cancer.

429
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:17,242
Please take a look.

430
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:19,922
Cancer?

431
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:21,322
Yes.

432
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,562
We have to go from the xiphoid process and go around the right navel,

433
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,642
to the pubis.

434
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:49,122
After that, we have to finish four-quadrant packing soon.

435
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,482
But the steel rod has to be as still as possible.

436
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:55,642
Then, we'll see how many organs have been injured.

437
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,802
Pleum, grab the rod.

438
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:23,562
Nick, Richardson retractor.

439
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:24,682
Yes.

440
00:39:42,106 --> 00:39:43,466
He's so lucky.

441
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:47,977
The luckiest guy in the world.

442
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:49,482
Yeah.

443
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:51,802
There's only a small bowel injury

444
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,282
and

445
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,162
tear mesentery.

446
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,922
The steel rod got really close to the IVC.

447
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:04,682
His stomach cancer also hasn't spread. He's really lucky.

448
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:09,202
Stop getting excited about his fortune. Come on, Nick.

449
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:14,242
Let's cut some of his intestines and remove the rod.

450
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:26,802
Professor Win, you're also lucky.

451
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,522
I really thought we might have to perform resuscitation.

452
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:32,842
If the angle changed only a little bit and the rod hit IVC,

453
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:36,442
I think the patient might have had cardiac arrest in the ER.

454
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:37,962
That's true.

455
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:42,842
And about your back pain in the OR the other day...

456
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:44,522
Has it gotten better?

457
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:47,842
All scrub nurses from that OR are extremely worried.

458
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:50,882
I'm still alright.

459
00:40:51,106 --> 00:40:54,322
Well, I'm in my forties now. When I have to stand for a long time,

460
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:56,682
it can be pretty bad for my body.

461
00:40:57,984 --> 00:40:59,162
Okay.

462
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:01,102
Prim, tie it here.

463
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:02,442
Yes.

464
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:09,802
Well...

465
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:14,322
It's almost done. We'll connect his intestines and do gastric lavage.

466
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:18,602
Nick and Pleum, you two will slowly get the rod out.

467
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:21,882
But the rod is really close to IVC.

468
00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:23,802
If it cuts IVC,

469
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,122
it can lead to stomach bleeding.

470
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,762
That's right. Good job, Shoan.

471
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:33,082
Well then, I'd like to proximal-distal control IVC.

472
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:35,163
I'll have to ask for vascular slings.

473
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:38,322
I also might have to clamp IVC.

474
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:39,642
Yes.

475
00:41:41,074 --> 00:41:43,322
DeBakey forceps and Satinsky clamps, please.

476
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:50,398
Okay.

477
00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:01,282
Okay.

478
00:42:05,842 --> 00:42:07,282
Nick, Pleum.

479
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:10,042
- Remove the rod slowly. - Yes.

480
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,122
Taking the specimen.

481
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:31,322
Thank goodness for Shoan. If it really cuts IVC, we'll be in trouble.

482
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:46,682
The patient is stable now.

483
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:50,962
He'll be able to move into a normal ward soon.

484
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:52,676
Yes.

485
00:42:54,442 --> 00:42:55,962
As for his cancer,

486
00:42:56,808 --> 00:43:01,122
we'll wait for his condition to recover first.

487
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:04,802
I really...

488
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:11,042
Thank you so much for helping my husband.

489
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:14,922
- Will Dad wake up soon, Doctor? - Hm?

490
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:17,602
He'll wake up tomorrow.

491
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,122
What is on your neck?

492
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:24,802
It's from Taekwondo.

493
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:28,682
I got second place. I want to show the medal to my dad quickly.

494
00:43:28,803 --> 00:43:31,482
I like it when Dad plays with me.

495
00:43:32,787 --> 00:43:36,602
When he wakes up, he'll probably be really happy.

496
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:39,882
When Dad wakes up, do you have to divorce him?

497
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:48,602
Dad, wake up soon.

498
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:15,702
It's probably because he has cancer.

499
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:18,482
That's why he asked for a divorce.

500
00:44:20,522 --> 00:44:22,802
He's afraid he might become a burden.

501
00:44:24,602 --> 00:44:28,562
Do I have to try to understand that, Doctor?

502
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:30,162
I...

503
00:44:32,978 --> 00:44:34,978
For him, I think...

504
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:41,562
I don't think it's an easy decision.

505
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:48,202
It's done. I'll give it to you.

506
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:51,802
- Wow. - But don't throw it in the hospital.

507
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:54,562
This paper plane is really powerful.

508
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:56,882
It won't be good if it hits other patients.

509
00:44:56,996 --> 00:44:58,242
Yes.

510
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:00,162
No.

511
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:03,122
I'm just kidding.

512
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:08,402
For example, Doctor...

513
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:13,722
What if something happens,

514
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:15,842
my son and I...

515
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,242
Will we have to live and pretend like we know nothing?

516
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,562
Why...

517
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:28,762
Why can't we let a father stay with his son for a little longer?

518
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:32,522
Let them

519
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:38,522
say goodbye to each other.

520
00:45:46,442 --> 00:45:47,962
Dad, wake up.

521
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:50,082
Dad, wake up.

522
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:56,362
You're such a tease.

523
00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:59,602
Your dad will get better soon since he has this great support from you.

524
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:01,936
He'll wake up tomorrow. Are you happy?

525
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:06,122
Yes, I'm happy, but Mom isn't.

526
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,162
Why do you think like that?

527
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:11,122
When we drove here, Mom was crying.

528
00:46:14,922 --> 00:46:17,122
She might have cried because she was happy

529
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:18,722
that your dad was getting better.

530
00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:24,002
The doctor made this for me.

531
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:25,664
Have you thanked him?

532
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:27,322
- Thank you. - Thank her as well.

533
00:46:27,403 --> 00:46:29,082
- Thank you. - Sure.

534
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:36,342
- Thank you once again. - Goodbye.

535
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:39,042
- Let's go. - Bye-bye.

536
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:41,723
Don't throw it in the hospital.

537
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:53,482
What?

538
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,082
You act like...

539
00:46:57,882 --> 00:47:00,242
- Like what? - Excuse me.

540
00:47:02,882 --> 00:47:04,282
Hello, Mom.

541
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,762
I'm at the hospital.

542
00:47:13,322 --> 00:47:14,522
Hello, Mom.

543
00:47:14,722 --> 00:47:15,922
Hello, son.

544
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:17,362
Have a seat.

545
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:24,706
I came here to visit my friends I used to share rooms with.

546
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,562
I also brought some food for them, so

547
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:32,162
I also cooked some for you.

548
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:34,802
Thank you.

549
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:42,682
Wow, lotus stem?

550
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:46,042
With shrimp.

551
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,642
There's khai phalo at the bottom.

552
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:51,362
Thank you.

553
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:54,642
It's your favorite, isn't it?

554
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,282
Yes.

555
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,122
Are you only here to visit your friends?

556
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:09,202
Well, I'm also here to apply for a job.

557
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:12,795
I'm going to work here in this hospital.

558
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,722
But if you find it uncomfortable,

559
00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:18,962
if you don't like it, it's fine...

560
00:48:19,098 --> 00:48:21,402
I'm not uncomfortable with it at all.

561
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:29,962
Thanks.

562
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:38,122
Mom.

563
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:42,842
I got to join a special surgical team.

564
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:44,562
Do you want to hear more about it?

565
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,522
Do you want to tell me about it?

566
00:48:51,816 --> 00:48:53,202
I want to hear it.

567
00:48:53,482 --> 00:48:55,122
I really want to hear it.

568
00:48:58,312 --> 00:48:59,682
I'll start then.

569
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:03,602
There's a patient who has stomach cancer.

570
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:06,602
However, he's unlucky as he was stabbed by a steel rod

571
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,682
from a construction site.

572
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,916
It goes from his right abdomen to his back.

573
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:15,189
I had to join the OR. The rod was really close to IVC.

574
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:18,122
The surgery has become difficult. I...

575
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:20,407
I saw it and I told Professor Archawin.

576
00:49:20,634 --> 00:49:23,482
Professor Archawin praised me as well. If I...

577
00:49:45,268 --> 00:49:47,642
Oh, good morning, Miss May.

578
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:48,962
Good morning.

579
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,000
- Are you here to see Professor Win? - Yes.

580
00:49:52,246 --> 00:49:54,682
He's inside the No.7 examination room.

581
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:57,482
Does he have a patient with him?

582
00:49:58,123 --> 00:49:59,442
I don't think so.

583
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:00,722
You can go in.

584
00:50:00,843 --> 00:50:02,122
Thank you.

585
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,742
You seem so refreshed recently.

586
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:20,642
Retroperitoneal sarcoma?

587
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:23,602
Yes.

588
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,042
It looks pretty big from the MRI results.

589
00:50:28,522 --> 00:50:30,122
It's next to the duodenum,

590
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:33,162
head of the pancreas, and right kidney.

591
00:50:33,773 --> 00:50:36,682
There's also a tumor thrombus in IVC.

592
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:45,802
Listen, if we want to do an en-bloc surgery to remove all of them,

593
00:50:47,122 --> 00:50:49,362
we have to remove a lot of organs.

594
00:50:50,899 --> 00:50:52,002
Yes.

595
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:00,922
Well...

596
00:51:01,193 --> 00:51:04,202
I'll go call Professor Benz. He's also from your class.

597
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,333
He's an expert on sarcoma cancer.

598
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:08,202
I'll ask him to join the surgery.

599
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:11,442
We have to start planning your surgery as soon as possible.

600
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:13,090
Win, nowadays,

601
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:17,762
the standard for equipment and talent is a lot better than in the past.

602
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:22,362
The safety and success percentages are also a lot higher, Win.

603
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:31,762
I understand.

604
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:34,882
For the tumor IVC thrombus,

605
00:51:35,035 --> 00:51:36,882
if it's too close to the heart,

606
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:40,602
the chance to remove the entire tumor is almost impossible.

607
00:51:40,956 --> 00:51:44,602
You might have to open my chest to clamp suprahepatic IVC.

608
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,482
And...

609
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:56,362
Have you told your family?

610
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:58,082
- No. - What?

611
00:51:59,306 --> 00:52:00,742
I...

612
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,742
I want to be more certain first.

613
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:08,042
And May...

614
00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:10,879
May is pregnant. I don't know how I should tell her.

615
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:13,002
Win?

616
00:52:17,906 --> 00:52:20,362
What are you talking about?

617
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:42,602
Win, do you think I didn't care

618
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,882
about what I said at our wedding?

619
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:50,242
You might think it's useless to tell me

620
00:52:50,402 --> 00:52:52,402
as I can't help you anyway.

621
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:57,082
But please don't ruin the chance of me being beside you.

622
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:19,962
I'm so afraid.

623
00:53:33,522 --> 00:53:34,922
I'm also afraid.

624
00:53:37,185 --> 00:53:39,762
I'm afraid if something really happens,

625
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,282
I'll miss the chance to be with you.

626
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:47,282
(My son and I...)

627
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:51,042
Will we have to live and pretend like we know nothing?

628
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:54,202
(Why...)

629
00:53:55,245 --> 00:53:58,562
Why can't we let a father stay with his son for a little longer?

630
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,202
You still have me and your baby.

631
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,035
We'll fight against it together.

632
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:03,482
(Conference Room)

633
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:15,122
Thank you for attending this meeting today.

634
00:55:15,352 --> 00:55:19,282
I'm really sorry for the sudden notice,

635
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,322
but there's really an emergency.

636
00:55:23,977 --> 00:55:26,202
Professor Archawin, I'll leave it to you.

637
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,242
Thank you, everyone.

638
00:55:28,355 --> 00:55:30,562
I'd like to start then.

639
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:35,882
This is an extremely rare cancer case.

640
00:55:36,203 --> 00:55:37,882
The patient is a 41-year-old male.

641
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,602
He has had right back pain for two months

642
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:44,402
with flatulence around his xiphoid process after meals.

643
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:47,882
After taking NSAIDs and PPI, his condition hasn't improved.

644
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,042
Recently, the patient has fallen unconscious.

645
00:55:51,337 --> 00:55:53,002
We suspect it might be from hypovolemia.

646
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:55,162
These are the MRI results.

647
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:56,842
From the nature

648
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:00,762
of the tumor, I think it's retroperitoneal sarcoma.

649
00:56:00,946 --> 00:56:03,962
The best treatment for this patient

650
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:06,402
is an en-bloc surgery removing the tumor

651
00:56:06,882 --> 00:56:10,522
along with the nearby organs.

652
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:16,402
There's a chance we can remove all of them.

653
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,642
Excuse me.

654
00:56:21,225 --> 00:56:25,802
There's the IVC close to the tumor.

655
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:29,082
Which method are we going to use for this surgery?

656
00:56:31,602 --> 00:56:33,962
If we have to remove the IVC tumor thrombus,

657
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:36,842
we'll have to rely on Professor Kan from CVT

658
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:39,442
to open up ICV to get the tumor out.

659
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:41,762
However, if we do that,

660
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,322
there's a high chance of complications.

661
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:48,184
We'll have to give him anticoagulants

662
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,162
and wear equipment for PC protection.

663
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,575
I'd like to say something to the doctor who will perform the incision.

664
00:56:56,656 --> 00:56:59,722
This is an extremely dangerous case.

665
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:03,482
I'd like to prepare an emergency team, in case the plan falls through,

666
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:06,522
to be on standby from the beginning of surgery.

667
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:08,643
Yes, Professor.

668
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:10,802
Everyone,

669
00:57:11,156 --> 00:57:14,882
for this surgery, there'll be a first-year resident

670
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:16,802
joining the surgical team.

671
00:57:17,064 --> 00:57:18,442
It's Dr. Shoan.

672
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:23,442
Yes.

673
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,002
Let me clarify.

674
00:57:28,122 --> 00:57:29,742
The first reason is

675
00:57:29,972 --> 00:57:33,442
that he's a highly capable first-year resident.

676
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:38,042
His track record in the OR

677
00:57:38,279 --> 00:57:40,042
is extremely good.

678
00:57:41,442 --> 00:57:43,362
I've heard about him.

679
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:47,682
It'll be good for him to get a chance to see a difficult

680
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,922
and complex surgery.

681
00:57:51,905 --> 00:57:53,122
Yes.

682
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:56,122
And the second reason

683
00:57:56,546 --> 00:58:00,202
is that I'd like to authorize him to make a decision for me

684
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,682
during surgery.

685
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:06,962
Excuse me.

686
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:08,242
Normally,

687
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:11,402
the authority to make a decision is for a surgeon.

688
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,562
That's true.

689
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:20,282
But for this case,

690
00:58:24,932 --> 00:58:26,622
I want you

691
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,714
to make a decision for me

692
00:58:33,049 --> 00:58:34,522
who will be a patient

693
00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:36,922
during this surgery.

694
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:46,082
Are you saying

695
00:58:46,922 --> 00:58:48,802
you're the patient?

696
00:58:56,562 --> 00:58:57,922
I'll be in your care, Shoan.

697
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:39,122
I can't do this.

698
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:40,962
Why can't I do this?

699
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,842
- What do I have to do? - Don't keep it to yourself.

700
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:48,342
Do you know that everyone's here

701
00:59:48,643 --> 00:59:50,643
to share their feelings with you?

702
00:59:50,851 --> 00:59:52,562
I believe that you

703
00:59:52,865 --> 00:59:54,562
can become more than a surgeon.

704
00:59:54,698 --> 00:59:56,922
The lump invades the IVC more than we thought.

705
00:59:57,058 --> 00:59:58,482
I don't know if he can endure this.

706
00:59:58,618 --> 01:00:00,578
Professor Win would want to continue the surgery.

707
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:03,442
I believe that he can endure this surgery.
