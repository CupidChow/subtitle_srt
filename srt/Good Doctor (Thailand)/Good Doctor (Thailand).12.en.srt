1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,962
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,032
(Dr. Prim makes me uncomfortable.)

3
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,776
(Sometimes I don't like it. I can't focus.)

4
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:46,642
Is something the matter, Prim?

5
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,682
Right now...

6
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:54,162
Suddenly, Shoan starts avoiding me.

7
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,002
Today, I...

8
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,042
I saw his note.

9
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,762
He doesn't like me.

10
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:03,016
I'm confused

11
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,642
as to when I make him uncomfortable.

12
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,832
Did I say something bad to him?

13
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,722
I really don't know what to do now.

14
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,522
In my opinion,

15
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:18,482
I think Shoan has a lot of stuff to think about right now,

16
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:22,082
whether it's about his family or his job.

17
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:29,082
I want you to understand that Shoan is someone who really values stability.

18
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:33,882
When things change, whether it's his environment or the people in his life,

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,882
it affects him deeply.

20
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:38,562
Sometimes, it even overwhelms him.

21
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,322
But right now,

22
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:43,082
(I think Shoan is trying to understand)

23
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:45,482
(and find a way to deal with it.)

24
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:06,378
Professor Sicha said

25
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:09,242
I had to accept that it truly happened.

26
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,242
I had to fix it.

27
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,242
I had to accept and fix it.

28
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,202
(Either way, )

29
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:20,842
you need to use this.

30
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,522
Not this.

31
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:30,882
Dr. Prim.

32
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,802
My heart beats fast whenever I'm with you.

33
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,402
I like to be close to you.

34
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,903
I like it when you praise me.

35
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:42,562
I like it when you pat my head.

36
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,922
I like to see you smile,

37
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:48,322
but I don't like when you smile with Dr. Nick.

38
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,562
My condition can be concluded as...

39
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:36,482
Can we talk?

40
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:41,962
I'll say it anyway.

41
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,842
I like you, Dr. Prim.

42
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,402
Wait.

43
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:25,602
I think we should clear this up first.

44
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,642
I think

45
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,762
you're misunderstanding something.

46
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:31,473
It's not a misunderstanding.

47
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:33,522
I've already calculated everything.

48
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,962
No, like...

49
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:37,882
You might have been stressed recently.

50
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,402
A lot of stuff happened.

51
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:42,802
That made you overloaded, and I've also been nice to you.

52
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,321
That's why you think you like me, but it might not be like that.

53
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:47,462
Alright?

54
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:51,282
This is a sensitive matter. We have to talk a lot about that.

55
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,440
It might not really be like that, you know.

56
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:57,762
Well...

57
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:03,722
Don't just tell anyone about this for now, as I'm uncomfortable with it,

58
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:07,042
and I don't really like this kind of thing.

59
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,722
(I like you, Dr. Prim.)

60
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,882
(I've already calculated everything.)

61
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,802
Lek, who is looking after your store today?

62
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,522
I closed my store for a day.

63
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,362
I don't get to make money again.

64
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,402
It won't be too bad.

65
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,642
I saw there were a lot of customers in your store.

66
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,802
I really hope it's like that.

67
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,242
It's done.

68
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,842
I'll help you.

69
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:37,617
You've gotten ready pretty quickly.

70
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:40,316
Hey, I've been doing this kidney dialysis for five years.

71
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,842
I think I can even do this instead of you.

72
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:47,722
Right, you'll get thyroid surgery tomorrow.

73
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,882
Have you stopped taking antiplatelets for seven days?

74
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,962
That's not a problem.

75
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,562
Good job. How will you get home? Will Uan pick you up?

76
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,922
I rode my bike here myself. My house isn't that far.

77
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:01,522
Later.

78
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,642
What a tough woman.

79
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:05,742
- Have a safe ride. - Thanks.

80
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:18,803
(You have a new message.)

81
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:21,442
(On this day, 10 years ago.)

82
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:22,907
Good morning.

83
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,242
(Reception, Appointment)

84
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,242
Good morning, Professor.

85
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,242
- Please enter this into the system. - Sure, Dr. Prim.

86
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:35,682
Thank you.

87
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,402
Good morning, Professor.

88
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,242
Did you do something to upset her?

89
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,802
She doesn't want me to tell anyone.

90
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:03,449
Could you enter this into the system?

91
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:05,162
- Of course, Dr. Shoan. - Thank you.

92
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:06,722
I can't tell you.

93
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,602
(Episode 12: Key Messages)

94
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,842
It's noon. Let's go to the noodle store behind the hospital.

95
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,442
- No. - I'm going.

96
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,882
I've already made our orders. Let's go.

97
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:50,282
Prim, are you not going to come with us?

98
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:51,562
It's your favorite store.

99
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,762
No, I have to go to OPD in the afternoon.

100
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,322
You guys can go.

101
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,602
Shoan, let's go.

102
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,282
I'm going.

103
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:00,802
Let's go.

104
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,402
Here. Come on.

105
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,242
She's probably fine now.

106
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:18,442
- I hope so. - Yeah.

107
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,242
- Excuse me. - Yes?

108
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:23,346
What happened to her?

109
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:26,722
She rode her motorcycle into the pole.

110
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,322
Is she alright?

111
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,202
I think she's fine.

112
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:34,842
She even got someone to help her lift her motorcycle up herself.

113
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,082
I see. Thank you. Well, let's go.

114
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,002
Shoan.

115
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,322
Let's just go.

116
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:03,642
Should I laugh or feel bad for you?

117
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,442
After you confessed to her,

118
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:08,202
you shut the door in her face?

119
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:10,122
Did I do something wrong, Dr. Pleum?

120
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,522
Can you tell me?

121
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,002
So that I can fix it.

122
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,442
Prim was probably just shocked.

123
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:18,135
Just let it go for now.

124
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:20,442
Don't try to bring this up for now.

125
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:22,202
And what about you?

126
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,082
Are you sad it turned out this way?

127
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,402
I have two main questions right now.

128
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,362
First,

129
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,954
why did Dr. Prim say

130
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,362
I didn't like her?

131
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,162
Hey, don't just stop. What about your second question?

132
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:51,482
When you brought that up,

133
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:54,121
I was wondering

134
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,642
if I should be sad.

135
00:11:58,322 --> 00:12:00,002
I was thinking about it when I went quiet.

136
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:03,802
And what do you think?

137
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,402
I'm sad.

138
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,282
It'll be weird if you're not.

139
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:20,482
The more I think about it,

140
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:24,362
the sadder I feel.

141
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:42,042
How's the motorcycle?

142
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:44,802
Should I get my kid to take you to the hospital tomorrow?

143
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:47,202
No way. It's not a big deal.

144
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:48,722
My motorcycle is still fine.

145
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:50,522
I'm still fine.

146
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,802
Should we postpone the surgery?

147
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:54,162
Don't be like that.

148
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,482
Do you know

149
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,482
we have to wait for months to see doctors?

150
00:12:57,705 --> 00:13:00,722
Let's just finish the surgery. I don't want to wait.

151
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:03,218
Have you eaten yet?

152
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:04,442
I have.

153
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,002
Here.

154
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:09,122
My friend who just had leg surgery

155
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:12,002
gave me this. They said it'll nourish your brain.

156
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,962
Take it before surgery.

157
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:17,002
They said you wouldn't feel dizzy when you woke up.

158
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,602
I'll just have this now since I have to stop eating and drinking soon.

159
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,682
You're really strong.

160
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,905
You've done kidney dialysis and various stuff,

161
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,482
but you can still walk.

162
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:32,962
If it's me,

163
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:35,082
I'd already fall on the ground.

164
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:38,882
Tomorrow, I'll go to the hospital after I get off work.

165
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,442
You should go. It's fine if you're busy.

166
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,722
(March 16th, Kidney Dialysis. March 17th, Surgery with Dr. Prim.)

167
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,522
From the CT scan,

168
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,722
although the cancer tumor isn't that big,

169
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,602
it's already spread out of the thyroid gland

170
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,082
to nearby muscles.

171
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:11,162
After surgery, you'll need additional treatment,

172
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:12,978
which is called radioactive iodine therapy.

173
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:16,002
It's necessary for me to remove your thyroid gland.

174
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:17,682
And after

175
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,780
all of the procedures, you will need to take thyroid hormone.

176
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:24,561
- Do you have a headache? - A little bit.

177
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:28,081
Have you stopped taking antiplatelets for seven days?

178
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:29,762
Yes, Doctor.

179
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:31,762
I've stopped taking them for over a week.

180
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:32,962
Over a week? Okay.

181
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:35,882
- Prim, I'll leave this to you. - Yes, Professor.

182
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:37,602
- Thank you. - Thank you.

183
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:40,002
- Hello. - Hello.

184
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:41,882
Let me perform a check on you.

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,562
- Please lie down. - Yes.

186
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,562
Okay.

187
00:14:58,368 --> 00:15:01,362
Excuse me, have these bruises been there for a while?

188
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,155
I crashed into a pole a few weeks ago.

189
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:10,442
And these bruises haven't disappeared at all.

190
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,913
It's possible for those who have kidney disease

191
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,467
or who have antiplatelets to have bruises easier than normal.

192
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,882
If it's been a few weeks, it's probably nothing.

193
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:25,122
You haven't had any medicine or supplements, right?

194
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:28,002
- I haven't. - Okay.

195
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:29,802
Please have some rest for now.

196
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,958
Our nurse will call you later.

197
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:34,210
- Thank you. - I'll excuse myself.

198
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,299
Goodbye.

199
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:36,722
Let's go.

200
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:56,402
(She rode her motorcycle into the pole.)

201
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:59,082
Is she alright?

202
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:00,402
I think she's fine.

203
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:03,922
She even got someone to help her lift her motorcycle up herself.

204
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:07,201
(Patient Drop Off & Pick Up)

205
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,082
You can't park it here. Please go over there.

206
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:10,703
- Please move your bike. - Of course.

207
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,450
Thank you. Please go over there.

208
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:19,842
- Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning.

209
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:31,122
That's my medicine, Doctor.

210
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:35,762
Sorry.

211
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:51,602
Prim.

212
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:52,897
Yes?

213
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:57,602
Dr. Prim.

214
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,816
I need to talk to you, Dr. Prim.

215
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,439
No. I can't talk now.

216
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:05,985
It must be now. This cannot wait.

217
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:07,522
I'm busy.

218
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:08,722
Dr. Prim.

219
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:10,122
Yes.

220
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,402
What are you standing here for? Why aren't you in OPD?

221
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,802
I saw a red motorcycle with scratches,

222
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,482
just like the one we saw at the market.

223
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:29,002
And there's Clopidogrel in there.

224
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,099
If it's medicine for the patient inside,

225
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:32,922
it's extremely dangerous.

226
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,042
Who is the doctor of this case?

227
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,162
Dr. Prim.

228
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,370
Aren't you overthinking this?

229
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,562
It might be a different motorcycle.

230
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:47,882
And when there's a prescription for a medicine,

231
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,362
the doctor and pharmacist will contact each other about it.

232
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:55,056
Let's go to OPD. Don't just stand here.

233
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:57,722
Shoan.

234
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:15,602
Why is there still bleeding?

235
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,962
Has she had any herbs or supplements, Prim?

236
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,122
When you went out, I had already checked with her.

237
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:26,362
There's still bleeding.

238
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,610
Okay.

239
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,962
You'll have to stop the bleeding and prepare for the drain.

240
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,082
Then, stitch the wound. I have to go to another room.

241
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:40,402
Remove the drain.

242
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,602
It's as bland as water.

243
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,442
Just eat it.

244
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:06,802
The hospital's meal is designed not to trigger any of your symptoms.

245
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:09,962
You've already had salty food all your life.

246
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:12,562
You should eat some bland food sometimes.

247
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:18,642
How long do I have to listen to your complaints?

248
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:26,202
The blue bag

249
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:29,202
that I asked you to find in my backpack.

250
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,402
Have you found it?

251
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,122
Here. Is it this one?

252
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:17,082
When are these taken?

253
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:22,282
Do we still have a place to develop films nowadays?

254
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,482
I'm not sure.

255
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:29,802
I'll just ask some kids in the cafeteria. They might know.

256
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:45,162
Thank you, Dr. Win,

257
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,242
for letting us take care of Kawee's pictures.

258
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,242
I think our team

259
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:52,482
is going to send you a draft soon.

260
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,202
I'm so grateful for this.

261
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,442
This is really nice.

262
00:20:55,536 --> 00:20:58,922
Everyone is going to know and understand them more.

263
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,322
That's right. More private enterprises would come here.

264
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,922
Today, people from Buraphakhin Hospital will come here as well

265
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:08,732
to have a meeting about a special project with us.

266
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:13,082
I think we're going to have more progress soon.

267
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,402
- Buraphakhin Hospital? - Yes.

268
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:18,802
Buraphakhin Hospital.

269
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:22,442
Dr. Win, are you going to leave soon?

270
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:26,322
I think I'll just take a look around for a little longer.

271
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,410
I'll leave you to it then.

272
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:32,042
Thank you so much for coming here to support us.

273
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:33,522
Thank you so much.

274
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,442
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

275
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:19,922
(White Gown Ceremony, 2007)

276
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,642
What's that building? It's pretty.

277
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,722
Aren't you coming home?

278
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,122
Can you come home?

279
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:41,722
Come home, Win.

280
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:43,922
I can't.

281
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:46,962
I have to stay in my dorm.

282
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,042
Sleep with me, then.

283
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,322
I'll sleep with you.

284
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:53,522
You can't.

285
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,762
That place is only for medical students.

286
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,642
I'll be a student.

287
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:01,762
I'll be a student.

288
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:04,042
A university student?

289
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,122
You can be one.

290
00:23:08,368 --> 00:23:09,762
You have to work hard, though.

291
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,922
And you have to grow up more than this.

292
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,362
Good.

293
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:15,482
Good.

294
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:17,868
- Good. - Good?

295
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:20,042
- Home. Good. - Don't be loud.

296
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:26,720
The deceased fell down from the 15th floor of an abandoned building.

297
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:31,274
We've learned that the deceased is autistic.

298
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:34,081
We offer our condolences to the victim's family.

299
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,642
Wait, I'm a doctor.

300
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:37,402
How's his vital sign?

301
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,202
Have you done CPR?

302
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:42,065
Have you done CPR? I'm a doctor. I can help him.

303
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:46,122
No! I'll help him!

304
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:49,469
- He's already passed away. - Wee!

305
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,122
Please back off.

306
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:31,882
Fill in all of it.

307
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:35,482
What color do you want?

308
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,242
What color? Do you want the orange one?

309
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:40,842
It'll look like a sausage now.

310
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:11,002
You can make a big dot.

311
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:16,722
Oh...

312
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:21,162
- It's so detailed. - Do you want more orange ones?

313
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:23,024
- Please give him the orange one. - Orange?

314
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:25,402
- Excuse me. - Yeah.

315
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,522
I think

316
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:42,122
if we met sooner,

317
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:44,304
everything would be much better.

318
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,042
Win.

319
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:51,922
It's already pretty good right now.

320
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:26,922
Oh, Dr. Win.

321
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:29,082
Oh, hello.

322
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:33,042
Long time no see, really.

323
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,602
Are you not busy with your work today?

324
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:38,362
I have an afternoon shift.

325
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:41,082
- How are you? It's been a while. - I'm fine.

326
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,042
I just finished talking about a special project with May.

327
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:46,362
Right.

328
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,362
I want to talk more,

329
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:50,802
but I have to prepare for my lesson.

330
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:52,962
Are you still teaching?

331
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,442
Of course.

332
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:57,082
I might find another great artist like Kawee.

333
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:58,722
Well, you two...

334
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,170
- I'll leave you to it. - Yes.

335
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,242
- See you. - Goodbye.

336
00:27:01,323 --> 00:27:02,602
Goodbye.

337
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:10,122
May, are you here for some business?

338
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:12,642
Right...

339
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:14,802
He just told me.

340
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:18,482
I met Champ earlier.

341
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:19,882
Champ?

342
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,562
He's the boy who liked to be spoiled by you, right?

343
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,042
Yeah.

344
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:26,482
He's already Fresh's assistant now.

345
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,402
Really?

346
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:32,231
What about Pond? Is he still here?

347
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:36,642
He's here. He's working as an IT guy.

348
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:40,242
I can't believe that they all can take care of themselves now.

349
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:45,322
Well, it's been almost 10 years.

350
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,802
May, I was going to...

351
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:57,042
Hello?

352
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,842
You're here?

353
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,882
I'm in the gallery. I'll go out.

354
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:04,202
See you later.

355
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:36,042
Doctor, the patient at Bed 28 said he felt great pain from his wound.

356
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:38,762
I gave him medicine two hours ago, but he's still not better.

357
00:28:45,162 --> 00:28:46,922
Do you feel a lot of pain around your wound?

358
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,402
A lot.

359
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,322
I'd like to see your wound.

360
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,202
Your wound doesn't look good.

361
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,002
I'll dress your wound again.

362
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:15,642
You're safe now.

363
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:20,002
Trust me. You look more refreshed

364
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,002
and cheerful.

365
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,762
You're refreshed now.

366
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,042
How is it?

367
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:31,282
I think the medicine you took before surgery

368
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,082
really does work!

369
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:36,442
Other people who just came out of the OR

370
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:38,634
seemed dizzier than you.

371
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,322
And from now on,

372
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,322
you should take this until you get to leave.

373
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:46,922
I've asked Tong to get you some clothes.

374
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:48,962
I'll go pick them up.

375
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:53,762
I'll be back.

376
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:09,202
Excuse me, have these bruises been there for a while?

377
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:12,706
I crashed into a pole a few weeks ago.

378
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:16,202
She rode her motorcycle into the pole.

379
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:25,002
You haven't had any medicine or supplements, right?

380
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:26,842
I haven't.

381
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:30,682
That's my medicine, Doctor.

382
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:34,402
I think the medicine you took before surgery

383
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:36,082
really does work!

384
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:39,082
Other people who just came out of the OR

385
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:41,242
seemed dizzier than you.

386
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:03,042
Emon, please call Professor Archawin or Dr. Prim.

387
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:04,722
Yes.

388
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:08,522
Dr. Prim is here.

389
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:12,282
Dr. Prim, your thyroid gland cancer patient

390
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,922
has taken Clopidogrel before her surgery.

391
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:17,442
Really? Please call Professor Win.

392
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,082
- Em. - Doctor?

393
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,978
The thyroid cancer patient is breathing heavily.

394
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:23,482
Her neck feels stiff. Her wound is extremely swollen.

395
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:24,802
Extremely swollen?

396
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:28,105
Hematoma! Upper airway obstruction. Remove the stitches.

397
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:36,722
Open her wound.

398
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,202
Take the lump of blood out.

399
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:44,562
Remove the stitches.

400
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,082
Kidney tray, please.

401
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,842
Now...

402
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,802
Gauze bandage, please.

403
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,722
She was still fine when she got out of the OR.

404
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,336
- How did she suddenly have bleeding? - Set up the OR.

405
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,642
- Did you make any mistakes during surgery? - Yes.

406
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:17,882
What a sloppy place!

407
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:20,242
I'll sue the doctors and the hospital.

408
00:32:29,585 --> 00:32:33,682
I've found the bleeding spot and stopped the bleeding.

409
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:36,639
I'm really sorry, Doctor,

410
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:38,738
for lying like that.

411
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:42,642
I thought it was a small matter, so I didn't tell you.

412
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:46,682
I also don't want to postpone my surgery again.

413
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:50,202
I understand waiting for your queue can take a long time.

414
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:54,906
But this kind of thing is really dangerous for you.

415
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:57,442
It's my fault.

416
00:32:57,571 --> 00:33:00,082
I have to apologize to you.

417
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:07,802
That doctor has already given me a lot of scolding.

418
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:09,682
Now,

419
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:12,202
I've learned my lesson.

420
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:14,395
Did you make any mistakes during surgery?

421
00:33:14,545 --> 00:33:17,722
What a sloppy place! I'll sue both the doctor and the hospital!

422
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:21,042
- Get that doctor here! - Please don't raise your voice.

423
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:23,203
You're waking up all the patients. Please calm down.

424
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:24,602
How could I be calm?

425
00:33:25,282 --> 00:33:26,602
Excuse me.

426
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:27,936
What?

427
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:33,122
I'm here to return your medicine.

428
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:35,602
I'm sorry for taking it without permission.

429
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:38,682
That's my sister's medicine.

430
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:40,682
Yes.

431
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:46,762
And the reason that she had bleeding

432
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:48,642
is because of this medicine.

433
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,042
How is it possible?

434
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:54,602
The one who gave me this.

435
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:55,922
Said this medicine

436
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:58,162
could improve blood flow to the brain!

437
00:33:58,849 --> 00:33:59,882
You can't do that.

438
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,482
Clopidogrel can't be taken before surgery

439
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,802
as it'll stop blood from clotting.

440
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:09,682
You only should take medicine from the pharmacist.

441
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:12,162
Wait...

442
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:14,322
Is this true?

443
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:19,002
- Yes. - Am I going to be the one who caused my sister's death?

444
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,962
She's not dead

445
00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:24,442
because we've found and treated her condition in time.

446
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:28,602
But please remember this.

447
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:30,242
When we ask you anything,

448
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,760
you have to answer honestly. Please don't hide anything.

449
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:34,442
Everything is for your benefit.

450
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:41,402
I won't hide anything anymore.

451
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,522
Do you have any other questions?

452
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:46,402
No.

453
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:47,842
Thank you so much.

454
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,722
I'll go tell other people about this as well.

455
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:54,082
Great. I'll excuse myself now. Goodbye.

456
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:55,922
Thank you so much, Doctor.

457
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:02,082
I have to apologize to you as well.

458
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,162
I was worried about my sister.

459
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:08,082
- I understand, but please don't raise your voice. - Good evening.

460
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:12,322
That's good, then.

461
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:14,322
We'll excuse ourselves now.

462
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,442
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

463
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:25,193
I'd like to talk to both of you.

464
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:27,322
Oh...

465
00:35:27,696 --> 00:35:29,002
Yes.

466
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:33,674
I was really worried. I thought you were going to die.

467
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:52,602
Fortunately,

468
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:54,522
the patient was understanding.

469
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:57,482
Yes.

470
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,762
What happened between the two of you? Why don't you talk?

471
00:36:00,962 --> 00:36:02,442
Explain.

472
00:36:05,402 --> 00:36:07,002
Dr. Prim doesn't want me to tell anyone.

473
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,042
What?

474
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:17,242
It's my fault.

475
00:36:18,215 --> 00:36:20,722
I'll be more careful, Professor.

476
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:24,442
Dr. Prim has already examined her patient thoroughly.

477
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:26,722
The patient was hiding important information,

478
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:28,682
so she wasn't in the wrong.

479
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:31,562
- Shoan! - Hey...

480
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:36,202
I asked you to explain, not to have a childish fight.

481
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,722
(Reception)

482
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:44,540
What I want to tell you is when you work together,

483
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:47,248
if you don't talk to each other, it'll affect your job like this.

484
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:52,922
You have to talk. Don't let this happen again, got it?

485
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:56,762
You can leave.

486
00:37:13,551 --> 00:37:16,042
Why would you have to defend me earlier?

487
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:20,722
I was just explaining the truth.

488
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:22,882
I don't understand what you're mad at me for.

489
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:25,762
I'm mad because I know it's my fault.

490
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,939
I should have realized what had happened.

491
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,082
I was uncomfortable to talk to you.

492
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:32,922
I don't understand.

493
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:36,122
If you're uncomfortable with me confessing to you,

494
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:40,002
it means you don't separate your work and personal matters.

495
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,642
Then, I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable.

496
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,642
From now on, we only talk about work.

497
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,042
I'm really sorry.

498
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:12,042
Korn wasn't that bad at all,

499
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:21,042
but it's probably because my heart is still not ready.

500
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:22,722
(Sure.)

501
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:26,362
(You're not ready because you still miss your ex, right?)

502
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:30,082
(Korn said he saw you two at the foundation.)

503
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:34,682
There's nothing. It's just a coincidence.

504
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:37,562
(Please ask your heart if there's truly nothing.)

505
00:38:37,722 --> 00:38:40,202
- (I'll just watch from afar...) - Ploy, I have to go.

506
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:43,562
I'll have to meet my mom. She's probably here. We'll talk later.

507
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,522
I'm coming, Mom.

508
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,202
I'm coming, Mom. I...

509
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:52,614
- May. - Win?

510
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:54,242
May, hold on.

511
00:38:55,242 --> 00:39:01,242
I bought your favorite snack near the hospital along with this thing.

512
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:16,522
Can I go to talk to you inside?

513
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:25,642
I'm really sorry.

514
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,762
Win.

515
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:35,202
Do you think I was kidding?

516
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:36,562
No.

517
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:39,842
I know you're serious. You're always serious about this.

518
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:44,162
But please let me talk this time. You're the only one talking last time.

519
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,842
Please listen to me this time.

520
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:51,362
I've already thought about this carefully, May.

521
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:54,162
I've already thought about this carefully for 10 years.

522
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:04,042
May, if I didn't have you, I wouldn't become a doctor.

523
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,562
If I didn't have you,

524
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:13,682
I wouldn't be able to continue to be myself.

525
00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:21,642
So, I'm ready...

526
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:26,762
I'm ready to fight with you all my life.

527
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:32,122
From now on, I'll be the one who tries to make up with you.

528
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:43,852
You didn't give me a chance

529
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:45,642
to refuse at all.

530
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,202
I'm sorry.

531
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:56,402
Are you crying? I'm sorry.

532
00:40:58,362 --> 00:41:00,362
Right, but

533
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:02,995
I have a shift at 10 pm.

534
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:07,562
It's already nine.

535
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:10,362
You don't even have enough time to make up with me.

536
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:12,282
Why would you come here if you're busy?

537
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:13,842
I can't wait, May.

538
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,562
I don't want to wait anymore.

539
00:41:18,138 --> 00:41:20,138
I really have to go soon.

540
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:21,602
Please wait for me.

541
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:24,882
I'll be back soon.

542
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:28,682
- I'll be back. - Just go.

543
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:35,322
Yes!

544
00:41:46,162 --> 00:41:49,282
- What's wrong with you? - Let me see.

545
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:52,962
What's with you?

546
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:55,282
What's wrong with you?

547
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:58,522
Miss, he's taking a creepshot!

548
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:00,298
You're doing an inappropriate thing.

549
00:42:00,323 --> 00:42:01,482
Delete them now!

550
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:02,882
It's illegal!

551
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:05,185
You can call 191 now.

552
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,282
What are you talking about?

553
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,522
Are you retarded? Let's mess him up!

554
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:14,082
What?

555
00:42:15,362 --> 00:42:16,362
Shoan!

556
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:18,362
- Shoan! - He has friends!

557
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:19,762
Are you alright?

558
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:23,402
- Are you alright? - They're taking creepshots. They're doing bad things!

559
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:25,362
- Are you hurt? - You won't stop? Fine!

560
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:28,402
Hey! What's this?

561
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:36,042
- Let's get him! - Don't!

562
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:37,842
Stop! What's going on?

563
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:40,802
Look at his wound!

564
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:43,882
You already know who started this fight with that!

565
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:47,082
There was really a fight, but it happened because of both sides.

566
00:42:47,256 --> 00:42:49,522
Those three were taking creepshots on women.

567
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:52,651
Haven't your parents taught you not to interrupt adults?

568
00:42:52,754 --> 00:42:55,362
Please hold on. What did you just say?

569
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,882
They took upskirt shots of women. It's illegal.

570
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,002
What? Assaulting them is still not enough?

571
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:05,132
Should I just sue you for defamation as well?

572
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:06,802
Please calm down.

573
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:09,842
Since we're here, that side hasn't really gotten to talk at all.

574
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,642
After we get the footage from CCTV,

575
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:12,802
we'll know soon.

576
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:17,802
Captain, the CCTV at the bus stop has been broken for a while.

577
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,842
Excuse me,

578
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,542
can I use my phone?

579
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:23,042
Yes.

580
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:25,042
Why does it have to break now?

581
00:43:29,948 --> 00:43:33,522
- Don't blame my son! Your son did this first! - Hey!

582
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,042
- You can't blame him like this. - What?

583
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:39,122
- My son is a good boy at my home. - You're wasting our time!

584
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,123
When people fight

585
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:44,882
or beat each other up, is it because they're angry?

586
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,042
I used to feel that I wanted to punish people who did bad things.

587
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,602
Professor Sicha said it's anger.

588
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:58,362
Sometimes, it's like that.

589
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,442
But sometimes, it's not.

590
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:03,002
It's like...

591
00:44:03,722 --> 00:44:06,162
When people attack others,

592
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:09,962
it might not be because they're angry that those guys do something wrong.

593
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:12,242
It might be because

594
00:44:12,585 --> 00:44:14,122
they can just do that.

595
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:21,242
Thank you so much for protecting me,

596
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:23,802
just like Shin did for me.

597
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,442
It's alright.

598
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:31,882
But I think you should learn some self-defense,

599
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,842
in case when you don't have me or Shin,

600
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,122
so that you can defend yourself.

601
00:44:38,162 --> 00:44:41,522
- No! - It's fine. I can teach you.

602
00:44:41,737 --> 00:44:43,242
How are you?

603
00:44:45,635 --> 00:44:47,002
Good evening.

604
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,482
(You!)

605
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:55,922
We now have the footage from the dashcam. Should we charge you?

606
00:44:57,484 --> 00:45:00,242
These idiots, apologize to them now!

607
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:04,122
I'm sorry.

608
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:05,682
It's alright.

609
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:14,562
Shoan, should I send you home?

610
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:18,522
I can go home by myself.

611
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,442
Thank you, but it's fine.

612
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:22,002
See you later.

613
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:27,009
Professor, have you solved your good surgical practice's problem?

614
00:45:27,303 --> 00:45:30,802
You seem happier. You don't look like this anymore.

615
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,962
Goodbye.

616
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,442
Well, well...

617
00:45:42,602 --> 00:45:44,122
Do you miss me so much?

618
00:45:44,216 --> 00:45:45,216
It's just been an hour,

619
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:47,377
but you've already called me to come to the station.

620
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:51,122
Look at you.

621
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:54,482
Look at how old you are. How could you get into a fight with kids?

622
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:59,292
I didn't want to do that. Shoan was ganged up on, so I had to...

623
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,242
See? How's your back doing?

624
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,729
It's probably from the scuffle.

625
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:08,858
But if I hadn't gone in, I think Shoan would be badly injured.

626
00:46:09,071 --> 00:46:12,762
You're worried about your younger brother, huh?

627
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,482
Did you drive my car here?

628
00:46:17,578 --> 00:46:18,937
- Yes. - Let's go home together.

629
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:21,162
It's fine. I can go home by myself.

630
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:23,042
It's easy to call a taxi here.

631
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:28,242
Let's go with me. I was going to stay in your condo for tonight.

632
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,522
I don't think I can go to my shift like this.

633
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:34,922
Let's go.

634
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:55,642
- As promised. - As promised?

635
00:46:55,841 --> 00:46:57,282
I'll take you to a boxing lesson

636
00:46:57,442 --> 00:46:59,762
so that you'll know how to defend yourself.

637
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:05,322
Jab! Don't rush it. Be accurate!

638
00:47:06,352 --> 00:47:08,122
Good job! Great!

639
00:47:08,322 --> 00:47:09,762
Stronger!

640
00:47:10,722 --> 00:47:12,922
Good! One more! Come on!

641
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:15,122
One more!

642
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:17,682
Good! Yeah!

643
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,842
Your left one!

644
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:22,602
Ready?

645
00:47:23,196 --> 00:47:25,722
Calm down. Put your hands up.

646
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,282
Doctor, get ready.

647
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:28,521
When you punch,

648
00:47:28,602 --> 00:47:30,442
this one is for this.

649
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:32,082
That one is for that.

650
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,562
Try it!

651
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:34,922
One!

652
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:37,042
Two! Two!

653
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:39,882
Punch harder! Like this!

654
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,722
Like this! Yeah!

655
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:43,362
Like this! Can you do this?

656
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:44,562
Let me show you!

657
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,602
Like this! Just like this!

658
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:49,402
Can you do this?

659
00:47:49,628 --> 00:47:51,802
- Isn't it going to hurt for him? - No.

660
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,602
Try it! Can you do this?

661
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:58,882
Punch it like this! Do what I did!

662
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:10,122
- Do you want another round? - No.

663
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,562
Professor, I can't do this.

664
00:48:17,825 --> 00:48:20,202
I can't do this. I don't like it.

665
00:48:20,727 --> 00:48:22,727
I'll try to find another way.

666
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:26,002
You've never exercised at all, right?

667
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:31,762
Listen, this is my order.

668
00:48:32,802 --> 00:48:34,802
Every surgeon has to be strong.

669
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:38,562
You have to exercise. You have to try harder, alright?

670
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,042
- Got it. - Good.

671
00:48:42,602 --> 00:48:45,322
You said you're already a grown-up man.

672
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:47,082
You told me that. Do you remember?

673
00:48:48,282 --> 00:48:49,522
Yes.

674
00:48:49,937 --> 00:48:52,362
So, you need to learn how to defend yourself

675
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:54,736
and defend your loved ones.

676
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:59,922
If you don't like to use violence,

677
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:03,362
you need to be agile.

678
00:49:03,662 --> 00:49:05,105
You have to know how to dodge.

679
00:49:06,715 --> 00:49:08,715
How to dodge...

680
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:11,402
I'll try.

681
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,522
Let's try that.

682
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:18,202
Hey, you have to dodge.

683
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:23,482
No, don't do this, Professor.

684
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:25,802
Why are you bullying me?

685
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:29,842
Since you don't like to use violence, you have to dodge.

686
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,842
Hey, what's going on?

687
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,722
- How are you, Shoan? - In the morning,

688
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:48,602
you're usually refreshed.

689
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,722
I can't do this anymore, Dr. Pleum.

690
00:49:54,186 --> 00:49:57,202
Professor Win wants me to exercise.

691
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:01,602
Let Nick handle this.

692
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:03,202
He's the tough guy around here.

693
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:06,682
He has a ripped six-pack.

694
00:50:08,482 --> 00:50:10,162
I think

695
00:50:10,602 --> 00:50:12,722
you have to start by squatting 100 times a day.

696
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:15,722
If you can do that, you can easily operate for five hours a day.

697
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:17,819
Don't be too tough on him.

698
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:21,962
Well, let's go play basketball this evening.

699
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:23,772
Running after a ball is pretty nice.

700
00:50:23,796 --> 00:50:26,282
- Let's do that. - I don't know how to play basketball.

701
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,002
Can you teach me?

702
00:50:28,922 --> 00:50:30,202
Sure.

703
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:36,202
Hello.

704
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,722
Prim.

705
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:44,762
Shoan, let's go to our morning round.

706
00:51:01,303 --> 00:51:02,303
Shoan.

707
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:05,042
- What? - Throw it!

708
00:51:17,728 --> 00:51:19,602
I'll cover him, Dr. Pleum.

709
00:51:32,328 --> 00:51:33,762
Shoot it!

710
00:51:38,436 --> 00:51:39,802
Shoan!

711
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:42,482
Shoot it!

712
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:45,122
Shoot it!

713
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,402
He's pretty cute.

714
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,322
(Ward Three)

715
00:52:16,962 --> 00:52:19,722
Oh, Dr. Prim, isn't your shift already over?

716
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:22,802
Yeah, but I'll leave soon.

717
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,522
How was your exercise earlier?

718
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:36,802
It's not good. It's difficult.

719
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:40,762
You should exercise a lot so that you'll be healthy.

720
00:52:41,273 --> 00:52:42,562
Yes.

721
00:52:43,483 --> 00:52:44,922
You should invite me next time.

722
00:52:45,015 --> 00:52:46,482
I want to be healthy.

723
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,280
Stop. You'll just be a black sheep there.

724
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:53,482
- I just want to be healthy too! - Stop!

725
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:59,210
Win, I'll be half an hour late.

726
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:01,202
Let's meet up in the garden.

727
00:53:09,695 --> 00:53:11,082
Hello, Shoan.

728
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,402
- Hello, Miss Maysa. - Hello.

729
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:17,122
Hello, Prim.

730
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,002
- Shoan, are you on your shift? - Yes.

731
00:53:20,722 --> 00:53:24,442
Do you have some time? I have something to ask of you.

732
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:27,202
I'm here to pick Win up, but he'll only be done in half an hour.

733
00:53:28,626 --> 00:53:30,666
I have to enter my patient's history in the system.

734
00:53:30,844 --> 00:53:33,282
It's fine. You can go.

735
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:35,962
We'll be fine here. I'll call you if there's anything.

736
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,442
Okay.

737
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:42,962
- Thank you. I won't borrow him for that long. - Yes.

738
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:45,282
Let's go, Shoan. Let's go buy ice cream with me.

739
00:53:45,572 --> 00:53:46,682
Yes.

740
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:55,162
Since when did those two start to get close?

741
00:53:56,398 --> 00:54:00,002
How would I know? I'm also curious.

742
00:54:16,242 --> 00:54:18,482
How was your boxing lesson with Win?

743
00:54:21,162 --> 00:54:23,602
It's not good. I couldn't do it at all.

744
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:25,402
But

745
00:54:25,691 --> 00:54:28,322
Professor Win forces me to exercise.

746
00:54:29,802 --> 00:54:31,922
It's because he's worried about you,

747
00:54:32,146 --> 00:54:34,146
but he wouldn't say it to you.

748
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:45,242
- Do you like ice cream? - I like it.

749
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:48,842
I should have invited Prim to come with us.

750
00:54:48,939 --> 00:54:50,602
I forgot about that.

751
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:54,882
You can't. You can't invite her for ice cream

752
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:56,562
because it's not about work.

753
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:58,322
What? Why?

754
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:01,642
It'll be uncomfortable if you only talk about work every day.

755
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:03,282
It's the opposite.

756
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:05,251
She's uncomfortable with her personal matters.

757
00:55:05,353 --> 00:55:07,353
She'll only talk about work.

758
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,962
And what is her personal matter all about?

759
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:22,842
If I tell you,

760
00:55:23,464 --> 00:55:25,002
please don't tell anyone.

761
00:55:25,808 --> 00:55:27,082
Promise?

762
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,482
I promise.

763
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:40,642
(This is bad. Please invite Prim to dinner with us.)

764
00:55:48,282 --> 00:55:49,722
Miss Maysa.

765
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:55,509
I'm really sorry. I was going to apologize to you privately,

766
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,442
- but... - She wouldn't come, right?

767
00:55:58,562 --> 00:55:59,842
Yes.

768
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:03,162
I've already talked about everything with him.

769
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:06,002
You don't have to worry. Please relax.

770
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:08,562
- I can relax now? - Don't give her an opening.

771
00:56:08,722 --> 00:56:09,722
- Sure. - Trust me.

772
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,282
See? Hey, Prim. Don't drink too much.

773
00:56:18,264 --> 00:56:20,162
What is Prim stressed about?

774
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,042
I think Shoan is the one who's stressed out. He'd get chewed out by her.

775
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:26,762
No.

776
00:56:27,899 --> 00:56:29,722
- It's you? - I was chewed out by him.

777
00:56:29,811 --> 00:56:31,122
Shoan said

778
00:56:31,282 --> 00:56:34,082
I couldn't separate my work and personal matters.

779
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:37,562
What do you think?

780
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:39,642
Another glass of beer, please.

781
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,533
Don't drink too much.

782
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:47,682
Miss May.

783
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:50,322
I have a question.

784
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:53,922
Why did Shoan allow you to touch him the first time you met him?

785
00:56:55,317 --> 00:56:58,802
The day that I took Win to see my dad, right?

786
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:02,522
I didn't do anything much. We just greeted each other normally.

787
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:04,762
No way.

788
00:57:06,282 --> 00:57:09,722
My friends and I needed a long time before we could touch him.

789
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,682
For Wee and Shoan, May

790
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:14,962
is like an angel.

791
00:57:17,178 --> 00:57:19,922
I think it's probably the same for you.

792
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:22,602
You haven't treated him like he's different.

793
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:26,322
Usually, people would treat Shoan differently.

794
00:57:26,496 --> 00:57:29,682
He probably can feel that and trust you.

795
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,922
Can I address you by your name?

796
00:57:51,528 --> 00:57:53,322
I think we're already close.

797
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:56,282
- Sure. Feel free to call me by my name. - Okay?

798
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:58,482
- Don't give her an opening. - I'll do that now.

799
00:57:58,882 --> 00:58:01,402
Can I consult you about something, May?

800
00:58:01,548 --> 00:58:03,082
Listen...

801
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:06,482
Shoan

802
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,849
- confessed to me. - What?

803
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:10,962
It's like...

804
00:58:12,128 --> 00:58:16,282
He gave his diagnosis to me. Like he was explaining his condition.

805
00:58:16,402 --> 00:58:20,642
I didn't know what to do. It's uncomfortable.

806
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,322
You don't have to be uncomfortable.

807
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:27,362
If you don't want Shoan to like you, you can just tell him.

808
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:29,242
Shoan is easy to understand.

809
00:58:29,323 --> 00:58:31,842
He can even deal with this kind of stuff better than we can.

810
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:33,442
That's true.

811
00:58:34,118 --> 00:58:38,002
He's straightforward. He'll just say whatever he has on his mind.

812
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,849
He'll do whatever he wants. He'll go out to find a dog.

813
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:45,522
- He'll just take a patient to the OR even if we all... - Skip that one.

814
00:58:46,071 --> 00:58:47,362
Okay.

815
00:58:48,368 --> 00:58:49,562
- Okay. - Okay?

816
00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:50,962
Are you okay?

817
00:58:51,082 --> 00:58:52,682
Right, his latest incident.

818
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,402
He fought with a minister.

819
00:58:54,842 --> 00:58:57,562
I admit that he's pretty talented.

820
00:58:58,242 --> 00:58:59,242
But...

821
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:03,202
He might not be able to truly discern his feelings.

822
00:59:03,419 --> 00:59:07,962
Like, he might not really like this or that.

823
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:10,722
Do you get me?

824
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:16,762
Shoan told me if I would continue to have sugar,

825
00:59:17,884 --> 00:59:19,722
I'd be as fat as a pig.

826
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:25,002
It seems like you remember everything.

827
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:28,002
True.

828
00:59:30,396 --> 00:59:33,802
Prim is always like this. She always likes to care.

829
00:59:33,922 --> 00:59:36,043
She cares about everyone's thoughts,

830
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,682
but she forgets about her own feelings.

831
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:43,442
That's right. That's why I thought Shoan misunderstood his feelings.

832
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:46,842
Prim.

833
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,922
You have to see for yourself whether Shoan had truly misunderstood.

834
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:55,882
But if you don't feel anything, I think it won't be that difficult.

835
01:00:04,082 --> 01:00:05,362
Prim.

836
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:08,162
Prim!

837
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:11,761
She's gone.

838
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:14,682
Look. She's a burden to us now.

839
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,762
It's fine.

840
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,482
- Professor? - Just a moment.

841
01:00:33,722 --> 01:00:34,902
Prim.

842
01:00:35,522 --> 01:00:37,122
Prim, we're here.

843
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:46,882
Has she drunk a lot?

844
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,882
Yeah. Please take her up with you.

845
01:00:50,202 --> 01:00:52,242
How would I go up then?

846
01:00:52,347 --> 01:00:54,122
Just carry her on your back.

847
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,482
Can you help me?

848
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,682
- Come here. - Please.

849
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,442
Prim.

850
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,482
Okay.

851
01:01:05,554 --> 01:01:07,162
Her handbag.

852
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:10,322
Professor, quick!

853
01:01:11,762 --> 01:01:14,602
Please take care of Prim as well as she takes care of you.

854
01:01:14,896 --> 01:01:16,562
Goodbye, Professor.

855
01:02:12,782 --> 01:02:14,782
Sit. Sit here.

856
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:21,082
Here. Right here.

857
01:02:29,385 --> 01:02:31,202
I'm sorry

858
01:02:34,465 --> 01:02:36,642
for raising my voice at you.

859
01:02:40,281 --> 01:02:41,642
Are you angry?

860
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:44,802
No.

861
01:02:45,074 --> 01:02:46,562
Good.

862
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,402
To be honest...

863
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:11,682
The kid fell from a high place. He has a pulmonary contusion.

864
01:03:11,928 --> 01:03:13,602
He's received his initial treatment.

865
01:03:13,802 --> 01:03:15,033
He's breathing normally.

866
01:03:15,114 --> 01:03:17,619
His MRI results are normal,

867
01:03:17,852 --> 01:03:19,362
but he still hasn't woken up.

868
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:24,242
If it's DAI, we can only give him palliative care

869
01:03:24,402 --> 01:03:25,922
as he still has a chance to wake up.

870
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:28,082
We still don't know how long it'll take, though.

871
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:56,802
Does it mean there's a chance he might have seen the culprit's face?

872
01:03:56,947 --> 01:04:00,289
Tachycardia, increased ICP. We have a problem, Dr. Prim!

873
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:02,082
Even though Shin died because of me?

874
01:04:02,202 --> 01:04:03,962
I caused your brother's death.

875
01:04:04,202 --> 01:04:05,362
Aren't you going to hate me?

876
01:04:05,546 --> 01:04:08,082
Shoan is really lucky that you gave him a chance.

877
01:04:08,234 --> 01:04:09,482
Sir?

878
01:04:09,675 --> 01:04:11,242
- Professor! You're hurt! - Shoan!

879
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:13,482
I have to help him this time!
