(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:37,994
Thank you.

3
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:44,722
Dr. Prim, when did you first attend an operation?

4
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:47,482
It was during my first year.

5
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,602
But I didn't get any hands-on.

6
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:52,282
I spent a while doing other things in there,

7
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,713
like stitches and holding things in place.

8
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:58,162
When will Professor Archawin let me attend an operation?

9
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:00,682
It's hard to answer that.

10
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:03,442
It takes time. He...

11
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:06,042
If he believes you can do it, you will get in.

12
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:13,571
Yen, please get the dishes in the back of the kitchen.

13
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:15,002
- Okay. - Thanks.

14
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,162
Yen!

15
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:34,162
- Yes, Aoy? - Here.

16
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:37,482
I brought you some curry. I couldn't sell it out.

17
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:38,682
Have some.

18
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,199
- Let me pay for it today. - No.

19
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,282
I'm giving some out to everyone.

20
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,792
If you have a family,

21
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,802
I would give you more.

22
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:50,482
- Don't worry. - Thanks.

23
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:51,962
Goodbye.

(GMC Medical Center)

25
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,082
Did the patient take NSAIDs, Prim?

26
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:17,154
Prim?

27
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,882
Did the patient take NSAIDs?

28
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,362
Yes.

29
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,482
Okay.

30
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:29,322
- Stitch up the wound. - Okay.

31
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,241
Professor, do we need ECMO?

32
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:48,842
Thank you again.

33
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:52,322
I will do my best.

34
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,402
Prim?

35
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,042
Boy, take over the stitching.

36
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:01,122
Okay.

37
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:18,362
Tired from breathing, throwing up, and unable to eat?

38
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:21,682
Who taught you to write a case review like this? Are you writing a fiction?

39
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,882
Exhaustion, difficulty breathing, vomiting.

40
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,082
These are the words to use. Fix it.

41
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:28,417
Yes, Professor.

42
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:32,405
Hello, Sandee!

43
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:34,322
Hello, ma'am.

44
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:36,122
How are you? Does your stomach still hurt?

45
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:38,741
- It doesn't hurt anymore. - Good girl!

46
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,645
I have some stickers for you today. Do you want some?

47
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,592
- I do. - So...

48
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:46,108
I'll leave it with Mommy.

49
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:48,043
- Okay. - This is for her.

50
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:51,362
- Thank you. - Give it to her after she takes her meds.

51
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,362
Goodbye.

52
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,161
Next case.

53
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:00,242
Khongkwan, female, age six.

54
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:02,785
She's getting her fourth session of chemotherapy.

55
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:06,122
Professor Supansa, from Pediatric Hematology, wants her to be on Port A.

56
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:08,889
She's staying here for pre-op.

57
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,921
Her parents are at work. They will be here in the evening.

58
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:14,522
They asked the nurses to keep an eye on her.

59
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:19,762
Khongkwan, good morning!

60
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,442
Did her parents take her to work?

61
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:44,802
(Episode 5: Gift)

62
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:47,202
Play your card. Come on.

63
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,442
If you don't, I will.

64
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:53,762
Take this!

65
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:56,603
I have protection against werewolves.

66
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:59,362
Who dropped this card? Nine, did you?

67
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:01,762
I don't think it's me, bro.

68
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:03,562
Not me.

69
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:05,122
Are you sure?

70
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:07,522
If you're sure, take me out.

71
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,023
I can choose not to.

72
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:10,186
Do it!

73
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,922
This guy dropped the card. I saw it.

74
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:18,042
Then you're mine. I won't hesitate now, bro!

75
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,962
What's that? Doc, why did you peek at me?

76
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:27,162
And you even told him! See? I lost now.

77
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:29,882
I really saw it. You snuck that card into the play.

78
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,202
Let me play with you.

79
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:33,802
We won't!

80
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,362
You're telling everything. That's not fun.

81
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,122
Go play with that one.

82
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:41,322
She wants to play hide and seek.

83
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,482
Wait a second.

84
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,118
Can I have that back, please?

85
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,842
I don't want to get an injection.

86
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,522
Do you like sea lions?

87
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:19,922
Oong Oong is a seal.

88
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,562
A seal goes "oong oong!"

89
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:44,882
That's not a seal.

90
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:46,962
It doesn't have ears.

91
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,722
That's a sea lion.

92
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,282
It has ear canals

93
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,642
and fins.

94
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,011
Its fins can rotate.

95
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:55,442
It can walk on land.

96
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,565
And it doesn't go "oong oong."

97
00:07:58,014 --> 00:07:59,402
It goes...

98
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,842
You're so funny, Doctor Sea Lion.

99
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:15,842
Do you know how they use their fins to walk?

100
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,882
(Dr. Archawin Akephaiboon)

101
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:44,282
Mr. Arun has been diagnosed with

102
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,962
chronic kidney disease-induced anemia.

103
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:49,698
Basically, you will have to undergo blood transfusions regularly

104
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:52,882
because your kidneys produce insufficient hormones.

105
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:57,442
What should I do next, Doctor?

106
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:00,082
I recommend a kidney transplant.

107
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:04,202
If it's successful, you can stop doing dialysis and blood transfusions.

108
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:09,882
Do you have a child or sibling who can donate?

109
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,602
- He... - I don't.

110
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,122
Doctor.

111
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,202
Put me on the waiting list.

112
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:19,642
Okay, we will

113
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,522
need you to undergo further checkups.

114
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,802
That information is needed

115
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:27,002
for the waiting list registration.

116
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:29,602
Yes, thanks, Doctor.

117
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:53,242
(Shoan, where are you?)

118
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:55,162
Do you have my coffee?

119
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:58,682
- I got it a while ago. - (We're looking for Khongkwan, )

120
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,002
- (a patient from Surgery...) - Come quickly! I'm about to sleep!

121
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:03,562
Silence, please.

122
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:07,802
- Why? - (We're looking for Khongkwan Penkrajang, )

123
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:10,362
(a patient from Surgery, please contact)

124
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,522
(the Information Counter. Thank you.)

125
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,162
(We're looking for Khongkwan Penkrajang, )

126
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,757
(a patient from Surgery, please contact)

127
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,602
(the Information Counter. Thank you.)

128
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:27,647
(We're looking for Khongkwan...)

129
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,802
Gosh, kids these days.

130
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:31,842
What's wrong with them?

131
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,162
Your veins are all stiff.

132
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,882
I can't find your veins. Stay still, please.

133
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:46,202
- I'll do it for you. It won't hurt. - No. I don't want to...

134
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:49,602
- I don't want to! - Come on.

135
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,361
- It's just a second. - My girl!

136
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,490
Khongkwan.

137
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:59,242
I don't want to. It hurts.

138
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:02,121
It's fine.

139
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,202
What's your relationship with the patient?

140
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,242
I'm her dad.

141
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,162
Come on. I'll do it for you. It won't hurt. I promise.

142
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:12,602
May I do it for you?

143
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,242
Khongkwan.

144
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,242
Let me give you an IV to boost your power.

145
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:26,482
Before I start, I'd like you to hold my hand.

146
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,802
If you squeeze my hand hard,

147
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:33,002
you will feel less pain, okay?

148
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:35,496
Because I'll share your pain.

149
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:38,162
Squeeze me hard.

150
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:44,682
Harder.

151
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:48,682
It's done.

152
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,242
You're right.

153
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:56,882
Professor, hello.

154
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:58,842
Professor, hello.

155
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,442
Thanks so much. I can take this from here.

156
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:06,202
Hello, Mr. Aof.

157
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:07,402
Hello.

158
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:09,042
You look nice today.

159
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:11,722
When I found out

160
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,322
she was missing from the hospital,

161
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:16,562
I left the show and rushed to come here.

162
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,962
Khongkwan's dad, you look so gorgeous.

163
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:24,162
Were you at a cosplay event?

164
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,079
Or are you actually a transgender?

165
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Shoan...

166
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,402
Sorry.

167
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:33,962
I'll go and round the ward.

168
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:44,602
How could you say that?

169
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:47,922
Do not ask anyone that question. It's rude!

170
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,682
I was curious.

171
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,242
It wasn't okay to ask it?

172
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,402
It's quite a sensitive question.

173
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:56,642
Do you know the phrase LGBTQ+?

174
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,322
Yeah. Mr. Aof is a drag queen. That's...

175
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:06,277
Sometimes, he dresses the way he does for his shows.

176
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,962
I heard LGBTQ+

177
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,082
can have children.

178
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,082
They just come in many forms.

179
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,322
For example, adopted children,

180
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:16,882
biological children,

181
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,282
and artificial insemination.

182
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:20,273
Which one is this case?

183
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,562
Let's just say

184
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,282
these questions

185
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:29,362
are too sensitive to ask.

186
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:33,322
Don't ask unless it's your close friend or it's necessary.

187
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,882
Understood.

188
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:39,562
- Don't ask unless it's a close friend or necessary. - Yeah.

189
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,882
Don't ask unless it's a close friend or necessary.

190
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,741
(Nurse)

191
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,442
Here, Uncle.

192
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:56,002
I'm sorry. I've been here for a while but haven't come to see you.

193
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:58,002
You don't have to apologize.

194
00:13:58,122 --> 00:14:00,767
Next time, don't bring a big gift.

195
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:02,983
How was your project?

196
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:05,188
Wellness tourism, right? How is it going?

197
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:07,682
I'm trying to cut a deal with the Middle East.

198
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:11,425
I also need to raise awareness about this kind of business.

199
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,482
Uncle.

200
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:18,722
Now that I'm here, can I run something by you?

201
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,162
Of course.

202
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:25,407
I wonder if you received an offer from A&R Medicine.

203
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,322
I think it feels strange somehow.

204
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:30,922
How is it strange?

205
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:46,082
Hi, Copter.

206
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,034
Are you calling me because you miss me

207
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,682
- or do you want your present? - (Dad!)

208
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:53,682
Uncle Anat is taking me to Phuket for my birthday.

209
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,402
(Please come here soon.)

210
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,282
Phuket?

211
00:14:58,387 --> 00:14:59,842
(I'm on my shift.)

212
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,682
I can't stay out of town overnight.

213
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,002
I want you with us.

214
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,082
I want to go too.

215
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,042
It's just too sudden.

216
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:10,194
It's too late to trade shifts.

217
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,482
You know what?

218
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,471
When you get back, let's unbox your present together at home.

219
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:17,682
(Copter.)

220
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,139
(Why would you bother your dad?)

221
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,762
(He's helping me out at work.)

222
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,582
Right.

223
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,562
(Go to your mom.)

224
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:32,202
So, how did it go with the Director?

225
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,605
I talked to Director Sirin.

226
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:39,282
She insisted that Professor Prapas has to decide.

227
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:43,122
If possible, I would like you to come in yourself.

228
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,602
Your words matter more than mine.

229
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:49,082
(Fine. I'll do that.)

230
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,482
(Let's see how hard it is to negotiate)

231
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:54,202
(with this Dr. Prapas.)

232
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:57,602
Right. Please take care of Copter.

233
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,922
(Suchat Jitdee)

234
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,485
(Status: Waiting for Donor)

235
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,443
(Status: Deceased)

236
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,282
Prim.

237
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,362
Is everything okay?

238
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,067
You seem out of it lately.

239
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:48,162
No. I'm fine.

240
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,442
I'm just tired, I guess.

241
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:08,082
Professor, wait.

242
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,682
Come on.

243
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,402
Can I not go in?

244
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:20,402
Don't you know? Ever since your DOT case,

245
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:22,732
you haven't been able to focus, Prim.

246
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:26,560
- Get in. - It's not that bad. I'll get better.

247
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:27,682
Prim.

248
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:30,482
You're a doctor.

249
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,482
That won't be the last time.

250
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:36,122
You have to be strong before you can help others.

251
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,842
Just get in there.

252
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,042
Is something the matter? Why do you all look so stressed?

253
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,042
- Good afternoon. - Hi.

254
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:45,442
It's nothing, May.

255
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:47,282
Prim is having a little trouble.

256
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:52,122
Do it.

257
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,482
Let's go.

258
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,922
That's an order.

259
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,402
Let's go.

260
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:59,123
When did you get here?

261
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,642
A while ago.

262
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:08,873
Why are you being so harsh with Dr. Prim?

263
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,690
She was so scared that she got pale.

264
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:13,682
I have to be harsh with her, or she won't do it.

265
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,562
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,322
What about you?

267
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:26,442
How did it go with Professor Prapas?

268
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,098
It was good.

269
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,882
We talked briefly, and I asked him about A&R.

270
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,882
A&R?

271
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,162
Yes. He said they were Dr. Phruek's relatives.

272
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:46,962
- Oh yeah, Win? - Yes?

273
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:49,882
Next month, my dad is coming back from Australia.

274
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:51,482
What would you say now?

275
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:55,001
This time you need to go to dinner with my dad.

276
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:57,225
You can't say no, okay?

277
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:00,242
Okay.

278
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,423
Good.

279
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,562
You're the best.

280
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,033
(The doors are closing.)

281
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,562
Mr. Aof, hi.

282
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,762
- Oh, Doctor. - Yeah.

283
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,042
Hi.

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Khongkwan's dad, good morning.

285
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:37,842
Morning.

286
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:41,202
You look different today. I barely recognized you.

287
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:44,011
Yes.

288
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,202
We have met twice already. Are we close friends now?

289
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:51,722
Yes.

290
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:54,722
How did you have Khongkwan?

291
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,304
Khongkwan is not my child.

292
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:10,002
She's my best friend's daughter.

293
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:13,122
My friend's boyfriend found out she was pregnant,

294
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:15,282
and he just left her.

295
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,002
My friend and I

296
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:19,922
had been raising her together since she was born.

297
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,722
Soon after Khongkwan turned two,

298
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:27,242
her mom was killed in a car accident.

299
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,362
She doesn't have a relative.

300
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:33,242
That's why I decided to raise her myself.

301
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,642
Khongkwan

302
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,322
is a gift, as her name suggests.

303
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,642
My childhood dream

304
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,082
is to have a child.

305
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:48,642
That's why I thought

306
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
I would do my best to raise her.

307
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,922
Doctor, will my girl be cured?

308
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:58,482
I've looked at her overall condition.

309
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,242
Khongkwan is

310
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,962
responding to the chemotherapy really well.

311
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:06,857
She's also getting treatment at a young age.

312
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,202
She will be fine.

313
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,610
Sometimes, I can't help but wonder.

314
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:19,202
Could it be that because I raised her,

315
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,002
she has such bad luck?

316
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,402
Because I'm not the right gender.

317
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,010
That can't be the truth.

318
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:30,602
White blood cell cancer

319
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:34,482
is caused by the over-production of blast cells.

320
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,402
Your gender, no matter what it is,

321
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:38,482
doesn't affect her good or bad luck.

322
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:44,842
You're right, Doctor.

323
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:47,682
But still, people think that

324
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,122
a gay man

325
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,362
can't possibly be a good father.

326
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:55,722
You're a good person.

327
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:57,762
You love Khongkwan.

328
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:01,362
That must mean you're a good father.

329
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,202
They're so cute.

330
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:19,082
Dad, I need to pee.

331
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:20,882
You need to pee?

332
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:22,602
Me too.

333
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:24,162
Let's go to the bathroom.

334
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:37,522
(Dinner with Dad. Friday at five at Buraphakin. Don't be late.

335
00:22:41,446 --> 00:22:43,282
Start your day in a bad mood, huh?

336
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,562
What bad mood?

337
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:46,942
What's wrong?

338
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:49,482
Did you have a fight?

339
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:51,282
What fight?

340
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,282
Did you forget? May is my friend.

341
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:01,122
You're upset you have to see her dad, right?

342
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:07,042
If you don't want to work for him, just be honest.

343
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:10,002
Your friend doesn't listen to me.

344
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,442
- Want me to talk to her for you? - Hey! Don't.

345
00:23:19,308 --> 00:23:21,362
The surgeons from Group B this year?

346
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,242
A few of them are interesting.

347
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:24,962
Especially

348
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,162
- Dr. Shoan. - What?

349
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,017
- Shoan, of all people? - Yeah.

350
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:34,082
Why? He does a good job. He pays attention. He can talk to kids.

351
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,242
- He's nothing like what you said. - No.

352
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,162
You haven't seen him at his worst.

353
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,564
If he panics inside an OR,

354
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:44,042
that will be huge.

355
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,202
Someone like Shoan should never have a scalpel in his hands.

356
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:49,602
- Really? - Yeah.

357
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,641
Interesting.

358
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,562
- Really interesting. - Hey.

359
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,402
- What? - How is he interesting?

360
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:59,882
You know me. Saying no makes me want to try.

361
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:01,649
- I have to go. - I'm not saying no.

362
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,730
- Bye. - I'm warning you.

363
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:03,882
I got work, okay?

364
00:24:03,963 --> 00:24:05,354
- I'm warning you. Listen. - See you.

365
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,582
- Hey! - I'm listening, okay?

366
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:17,682
When you get inside, check all the equipment.

367
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:19,242
Yes, Professor.

368
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:31,962
- Prim. - Yes?

369
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:34,402
You're assisting Professor Metta, aren't you?

370
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:35,842
Yes, Professor.

371
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:38,202
Then go.

372
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:41,962
For this case,

373
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:43,642
I'll let Dr. Shoan handle it.

374
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,962
Am I allowed inside, Professor?

375
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:53,705
Are you a surgeon or not?

376
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,602
I am.

377
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:59,722
You're a surgeon. You belong in an operating room.

378
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,882
Yay!

379
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,610
Please excuse me.

380
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:09,102
Shoan, do your best.

381
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:13,202
Thank you, Professor.

382
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,722
Yay.

383
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,042
Yay.

384
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:36,162
This is unorganized.

385
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:56,162
Hmm.

386
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,522
Blade, please.

387
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,042
Clamp.

388
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:22,762
Retractor.

389
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,282
Pull it up.

390
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:31,622
Give me the port.

391
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:45,562
The port fits in perfectly.

392
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:47,442
She's stitched up.

393
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,842
Let's test the port.

394
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:50,562
Yes.

395
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,722
Do you want to try sticking the port?

396
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,842
I do.

397
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:02,922
Okay. Come on.

398
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:18,682
Shoan, feel it gently with your hands.

399
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:22,002
There are three points in a port.

400
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:23,922
You need to put this needle

401
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:26,202
in the middle of those three points.

402
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:28,482
Stick it deep in the base of the port.

403
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,759
Then we'll try sucking out some blood.

404
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,322
If we can suck it out, it's a success.

405
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:36,082
- Yes. - Hmm.

406
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,402
- I found it. - Hmm.

407
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,442
Okay.

408
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,282
Professor Irin.

409
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:07,961
We have been informed of an emergency case.

410
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,922
Dr. Shoan is needed for assistance.

411
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,323
Okay. Got it.

412
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:18,242
You can go and help them. I got this one.

413
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:25,522
Yes, Professor.

414
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:27,802
Okay.

415
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,122
Which Professor needs my assistance?

416
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,609
Professor Archawin over there.

417
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:46,242
You need my help with an emergency case?

418
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:59,362
I called you here for nothing.

419
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,442
Did you lie to me?

420
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:13,762
I just don't want you in surgery.

421
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,282
Why?

422
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:19,082
Because it's too dangerous, Shoan.

423
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:23,642
Both to yourself and to the patient.

424
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:26,442
Then when can I perform surgery?

425
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:31,042
Dr. Prim said if I prove myself to you that I can do it,

426
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:33,322
you will allow me to perform one.

427
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:37,042
Shoan.

428
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:42,682
As long as you have this condition,

429
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,042
you can't perform surgery.

430
00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:52,002
It's too risky.

431
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,242
I was born this way.

432
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:00,962
There's no cure.

433
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,562
I can't be cured.

434
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,682
I can't be cured of it, Professor.

435
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,202
But I'll prove to you

436
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:12,642
that I can do everything like the others.

437
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:32,842
(Buddhist prayers)

438
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:35,162
(Buddhist prayers)

439
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:38,402
(Buddhist prayers)

440
00:30:38,508 --> 00:30:41,842
(Buddhist prayers)

441
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,362
I thought you wouldn't come.

442
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:47,762
I was hesitating, actually.

443
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,482
Professor.

444
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,922
If I had had more time for him that day,

445
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,722
listened to him more,

446
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:03,042
and not believed in myself too much,

447
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,961
all of this wouldn't have happened.

448
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:08,162
Win.

449
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,602
Do you still blame yourself?

450
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:15,362
Think about this. If Wee is looking at you right now,

451
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,882
would he want his brother to have this idea?

452
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:22,722
That was an accident.

453
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,082
I think Wee would be happy

454
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:28,502
that his beloved only brother

455
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:33,162
acknowledged him and believed that he could take care of himself.

456
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:34,977
How did that turn out?

457
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:40,905
I don't want that to happen again.

458
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,537
I don't want you to go through what I went through.

459
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:53,282
Professor.

460
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:56,882
- Professor. - Give me Mr. Arun's case.

461
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:06,082
Professor.

462
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,739
- Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Arun.

463
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:10,402
- Morning. - Please sit down.

464
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:11,762
Please sit down.

465
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:15,162
It's good you're here. I have good news for you.

466
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:18,533
Mr. Arun, you have a donor.

467
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,058
- Really? - Yes.

468
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:24,922
You're really lucky, Mr. Arun. Others usually wait for months.

469
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:28,892
May I know the name of the donor?

470
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:31,402
I really want to thank him.

471
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,042
Well, legally speaking,

472
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:38,712
the donor has the right to reveal

473
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:41,202
or not to reveal their identity.

474
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:44,042
- In this case, they... - Doctor.

475
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:49,202
I heard that organs from someone outside the bloodline

476
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:51,122
would be rejected by the body

477
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:55,562
more severely than organs from a relative. Is that true?

478
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:59,962
In reality, transplanting from someone in the bloodline or not

479
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:01,962
does not make that much of a difference.

480
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,202
In both cases, we will have to check

481
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:09,122
the compatibility of both the donor and recipient's blood and organs.

482
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:13,642
However, the side effect in most cases is

483
00:33:14,322 --> 00:33:17,602
how the patient's body responds to the new organ.

484
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:21,242
Sometimes, the patient's body doesn't respond

485
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:23,162
to the newly transplanted organ.

486
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:25,322
- Well... - Thank you so much, Doctor.

487
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,722
That's enough.

488
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,922
The doctor said it's fine, so it's fine.

489
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,362
Thank you again. Thank you.

490
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:34,642
- Right. - Congratulations.

491
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,962
Aof.

492
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,482
Aof.

493
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,882
Aof, is that you, son?

494
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:27,042
Emergency case!

495
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:36,362
- Wake up! - Don't tease me with something so real.

496
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,002
How much longer are you sleeping?

497
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,722
Come on!

498
00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:48,322
Dear Miss Prim...

499
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:51,242
What?

500
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:54,042
Buy me a coffee, please.

501
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,362
No!

502
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:57,018
Please, come on.

503
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:59,578
It's too often.

504
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:02,562
Can't you order a delivery?

505
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:03,962
Do that, okay?

506
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,842
Should I go and buy it for you?

507
00:35:08,202 --> 00:35:10,322
No, thanks, Auntie. This guy's lazy.

508
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:12,282
See? He's growing roots.

509
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:14,904
Are you a new cleaner?

510
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:16,962
I haven't seen you before.

511
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:19,122
I am.

512
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:22,082
If you need help, you can tell me.

513
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:23,762
Thank you so much.

514
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:28,562
You will pay, right? What do you want? I'll order something.

515
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:30,019
Just a black coffee.

516
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,562
No sugar? Large or small?

517
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:34,202
Okay. What else?

518
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:36,202
I can't do anything. I'm too drowsy.

519
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:39,322
Does Dr. Prapas use this room too?

520
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,097
He doesn't.

521
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:44,075
Only residents use this room.

522
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,242
My name is Prim. This is Nick.

523
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:51,802
We also have Dr. Pleum,

524
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:55,642
Dr. Mummim, and Dr. Shoan. That's all of us.

525
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,922
There's a Dr. Shoan here?

526
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:00,322
Yes.

527
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
See?

528
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,842
I told you. Shoan is an unusual name.

529
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:09,682
She didn't say it was an unusual name.

530
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,882
- You're a bully. - Just order the coffee.

531
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:16,242
Aof.

532
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,122
Mom.

533
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:33,522
Why don't you visit us at all, Aof?

534
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,722
Do you think I can?

535
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:41,282
Your dad was emotional.

536
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,762
He's been looking for you ever since that day.

537
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,682
Your dad has chronic kidney disease.

538
00:36:57,935 --> 00:36:59,842
He needs a kidney transplant.

539
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:04,922
The hospital actually said we got a donor.

540
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,842
But I heard that if it's from outside the family, it's

541
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:11,402
more dangerous to the recipient.

542
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,082
I know I have no right to ask you this.

543
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,522
I'm sorry, son.

544
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,042
Your dad is really suffering.

545
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:24,922
Can you help him, Aof?

546
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,842
So now I have some value to you, Mom?

547
00:37:33,082 --> 00:37:34,762
If Dad knows it's me,

548
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:37,362
he probably doesn't want it.

549
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:44,802
Could you please forgive us and start over?

550
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:48,993
Your dad and I never stopped loving you.

551
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:51,272
You love me, Mom?

552
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,002
If you love me, why did you let Dad hit me?

553
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,908
He kicked me out like a dog.

554
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,962
Why did you let him treat me like that?

555
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:12,282
I'm sorry.

556
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,082
I'm really sorry.

557
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:21,642
We can just forget all of that.

558
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:23,482
Let's forget about donating too.

559
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:27,402
Just come back and be the family we used to be, please.

560
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:29,482
Please?

561
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:37,282
Are we really a family, Mom?

562
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,802
Yes?

563
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:50,202
Khongkwan?

564
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,482
Daddy will be right there.

565
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:54,042
Wait for me, please.

566
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:57,762
Daddy?

567
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:00,602
I have to go, Mom.

568
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:08,202
Khongkwan, time for your meal.

569
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:12,202
Don't chew too fast, okay?

570
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:15,362
Okay. Another one.

571
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:18,722
Okay.

572
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,442
Hello there.

573
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:24,986
You're Khongkwan, right?

574
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,362
I am.

575
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:28,962
You're so cute.

576
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:30,402
Khongkwan.

577
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,842
This is your grandma.

578
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:34,482
She's my mommy.

579
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:40,442
Hello, Grandma.

580
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,547
You're such a good girl.

581
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:43,922
Here.

582
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:48,002
I brought you a teddy bear. Is it cute?

583
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:51,322
- Cute, right? - Thank you, Grandma.

584
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:00,802
Excuse me.

585
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:05,282
This is Doctor Sea Lion.

586
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:07,242
You have a new friend today.

587
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:09,802
My grandma brought it for me.

588
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:16,282
May I check on Khongkwan, please?

589
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,962
Yes, Doctor. Please proceed.

590
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:23,522
She's not your real daughter,

591
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:28,162
but you're a really good father to her.

592
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,562
She might not be as healthy as other kids,

593
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:38,522
but I love her so much.

594
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:42,002
I hope that someday,

595
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:44,522
she can run around like other kids.

596
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:46,162
As a parent,

597
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:48,522
that's all I ask for.

598
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:51,522
Mom.

599
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,882
Yesterday, you mentioned Dad's kidney.

600
00:40:55,112 --> 00:40:56,522
- I... - Yupha!

601
00:40:58,436 --> 00:40:59,882
What do you think you're doing?

602
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:02,962
Don't tell me you're still messing with my darn kidney.

603
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,402
- What? - She is, Dad.

604
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:09,082
Why would you yell at her?

605
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:10,522
Don't interfere!

606
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:13,362
I don't want anything from you.

607
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,050
Don't donate anything to me.

608
00:41:16,202 --> 00:41:17,642
I know that well.

609
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:20,667
You see, Mom?

610
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:22,682
No matter how much time passed,

611
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:26,122
he's still embarrassed by a queer son like me.

612
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:27,802
How could he accept my kidney?

613
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:29,322
No, my son. Stop.

614
00:41:31,465 --> 00:41:32,842
I'll accept my luck.

615
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:34,833
Leave us alone.

616
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:38,042
Go do whatever you want.

617
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,602
Just go!

618
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:42,842
Go!

619
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:47,922
Yupha.

620
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:49,562
Let's go home.

621
00:41:50,413 --> 00:41:52,212
- Wait, honey. - Hey!

622
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:53,602
Dad!

623
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:02,922
Mister, is this yours?

624
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:13,522
Khongkwan, say hello to your grandpa.

625
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:18,682
Mister... No, Grandpa.

626
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,682
You're my Dad's dad?

627
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,785
Hello.

628
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:17,162
Honey.

629
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,722
What's wrong, honey?

630
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:22,242
Please sit down.

631
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:26,642
Thank you.

632
00:43:29,762 --> 00:43:31,202
It looks like your BP has dropped.

633
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:32,842
You need to rest for ten minutes.

634
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:37,442
Are you okay?

635
00:43:41,513 --> 00:43:42,962
Why did you do that?

636
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,482
How could you ask that of him?

637
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:50,082
I kicked him out of our house!

638
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:57,722
Why did you kick your own son out?

639
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:06,602
Because the thing that he is.

640
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:10,202
I was afraid he'd get bullied.

641
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:13,202
I was afraid others would be disgusted by what he is.

642
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:15,482
I wanted him to be a man.

643
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:18,902
I wanted him to be cured of being gay.

644
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:23,722
Being gay is not an illness.

645
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:25,682
It's not something to be cured.

646
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,002
Also,

647
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:34,602
if you consider good things

648
00:44:34,722 --> 00:44:36,882
that come without you asking for as good luck,

649
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:38,762
then you're lucky.

650
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:40,642
Your son is a good person.

651
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,842
He is a great father.

652
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,962
Let's go home.

653
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:53,882
You're still too weak.

654
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,602
I'm not allowing you to go home.

655
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:58,602
You need a thorough diagnosis.

656
00:45:18,443 --> 00:45:20,922
Shoan. As long as you

657
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,442
have this condition,

658
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:25,002
I will never allow a doctor in your condition

659
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,642
to operate on a patient. You can't perform surgery. Do you understand?

660
00:45:30,058 --> 00:45:32,282
I was afraid others would be disgusted by what he is.

661
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:33,882
I was born this way.

662
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:35,522
I wanted him to be cured of being gay.

663
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:36,642
There's no cure.

664
00:45:36,738 --> 00:45:40,321
- I can't be cured. - Oh no! What have you done?

665
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:44,162
Why are you such a bad boy? I'm working myself to death, don't you know?

666
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:23,038
I understand that Professor Win is worried Shoan would do something weird.

667
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:27,902
Shoan probably doesn't feel anything with that, but

668
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:31,842
there are many better ways to deal with him.

669
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:34,962
So I...

670
00:46:35,966 --> 00:46:37,471
I came here to talk to you.

671
00:46:42,851 --> 00:46:46,562
If you say Shoan doesn't feel anything,

672
00:46:47,177 --> 00:46:48,682
I would say you're wrong.

673
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:50,722
He just doesn't know

674
00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:52,442
what he's feeling.

675
00:46:54,075 --> 00:46:56,602
He probably feels it more than we do.

676
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,402
I met him as a boy.

677
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,922
If he feels he loves or likes something,

678
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:05,642
(he'll develop it as his skill, )

679
00:47:06,744 --> 00:47:08,202
(and incredibly so.)

680
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:21,162
Oh no! What have you done?

681
00:47:21,243 --> 00:47:24,918
- Why do you keep causing problems? - Ma'am. Calm down.

682
00:47:25,057 --> 00:47:26,793
How can I be calm?

683
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:28,602
(He is talented.)

684
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:31,562
(He possesses mental capability beyond ordinary people.)

685
00:47:32,146 --> 00:47:33,882
(What kind of a six-year-old boy)

686
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:35,922
(would be able to draw those things?)

687
00:47:36,735 --> 00:47:37,922
(But still, )

688
00:47:38,185 --> 00:47:39,602
(what Shoan has, )

689
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:41,762
(even his own family)

690
00:47:41,952 --> 00:47:43,402
(doesn't understand.)

691
00:47:43,835 --> 00:47:46,242
(As a little kid he was back then, )

692
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:47,972
how could he have understood?

693
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:56,902
Is this why you're confident in Shoan?

694
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,042
I wouldn't say I'm confident.

695
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:02,162
I just believe in him.

696
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:07,002
All Shoan needs is someone who believes in him

697
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:08,842
and gives him a chance.

698
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:13,242
Win is well aware of that,

699
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,042
but he maintains his bias

700
00:48:16,608 --> 00:48:18,288
because of his younger brother's incident.

701
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,650
It's fine.

702
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:26,418
I'll figure this out.

703
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,922
I appreciate it, Prim,

704
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,442
for telling me.

705
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:36,002
And thank you for helping Shoan.

706
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:38,939
Sure.

707
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:47,522
Dad, I want this hairstyle.

708
00:48:48,464 --> 00:48:49,642
Which one?

709
00:48:50,484 --> 00:48:53,122
Wow! This one, like her?

710
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:57,682
I'll give you that hair.

711
00:49:03,202 --> 00:49:04,682
I'm sorry.

712
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:18,962
Wait for a while.

713
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,282
I'll give you that hair.

714
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:23,133
Wait a second.

715
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:25,802
I'll put this on you.

716
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,242
This wig

717
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,642
makes you cute in a different way.

718
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,442
Does Grandpa not like you, Dad?

719
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,002
No.

720
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,322
Maybe

721
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:02,202
I was a naughty boy.

722
00:50:02,922 --> 00:50:05,082
That's why he always raises his voice with me.

723
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:12,522
Your blood test is okay now. You can go home tomorrow.

724
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:14,242
Yes, Doctor.

725
00:50:15,153 --> 00:50:17,402
You're not naughty at all.

726
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:19,642
You're really kind.

727
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:22,282
You're sweeter than my Oong.

728
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:31,322
Khongkwan, sweetie.

729
00:50:32,052 --> 00:50:33,362
Khongkwan.

730
00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:35,082
Khongkwan...

731
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:38,322
I...

732
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,922
I'm really happy

733
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:44,162
that you keep giving me support.

734
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:45,696
I love you.

735
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:49,322
I love you too.

736
00:51:00,162 --> 00:51:01,602
If you love me,

737
00:51:01,962 --> 00:51:03,842
kiss my forehead one time.

738
00:51:06,762 --> 00:51:08,562
Okay!

739
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:13,242
I'm happy.

740
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:21,642
You're getting a transplant today. Won't you tell our son?

741
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,082
There's no need.

742
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:25,442
Don't bother him.

743
00:51:33,586 --> 00:51:36,042
See you on the other side.

744
00:52:25,536 --> 00:52:27,322
Grandma!

745
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:30,522
Khongkwan.

746
00:52:33,748 --> 00:52:35,802
Good morning, ma'am.

747
00:52:35,898 --> 00:52:37,898
Hi. Morning.

748
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,722
You guys are...

749
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:41,922
We're Aof's friends.

750
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:45,442
Yeah? And...

751
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,282
Why are you here?

752
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,562
We're here to support Aof.

753
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,122
Support Aof?

754
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:54,402
What's wrong with him?

755
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,562
My dad is a superhero.

756
00:53:03,122 --> 00:53:07,562
Actually, Aof told us not to tell you.

757
00:53:07,879 --> 00:53:10,882
He's donating a kidney to his dad.

758
00:53:11,136 --> 00:53:14,322
That's why he asked us to be with Khongkwan when he's in there.

759
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,524
Gosh, kids these days.

760
00:53:24,308 --> 00:53:25,482
Bew.

761
00:53:25,571 --> 00:53:27,042
Dr. Prim said

762
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,722
Mr. Arun Chaichana

763
00:53:28,803 --> 00:53:31,482
will undergo a checkup for a kidney transplant.

764
00:53:31,988 --> 00:53:33,842
These are his kidney results...

765
00:53:34,346 --> 00:53:36,002
Now that we told you,

766
00:53:36,162 --> 00:53:38,406
we should mention that he isn't doing this

767
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:39,721
because you asked him to.

768
00:53:39,802 --> 00:53:41,202
Can you help him, Aof?

769
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:44,562
So now I have some value to you, Mom?

770
00:53:44,914 --> 00:53:46,562
If Dad knows it's me,

771
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:49,282
he probably doesn't want it.

772
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:53,347
Are you ready to donate?

773
00:53:53,428 --> 00:53:54,428
I'm ready.

774
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,242
What organ would you like to donate?

775
00:53:56,786 --> 00:53:59,562
- I'm donating a kidney. - I don't want anything from you.

776
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,438
Don't donate anything to me.

777
00:54:02,602 --> 00:54:03,922
No matter how much time passed,

778
00:54:04,962 --> 00:54:07,322
he's still embarrassed by a queer son like me.

779
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,722
Please don't cry, Grandma.

780
00:54:52,562 --> 00:54:54,122
(GMC Medical Center - 50th Anniversary)

781
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:04,682
Khongkwan.

782
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:06,882
Have you said goodbye to your friends here?

783
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:08,042
I have.

784
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:13,707
We looked at her. She's really stable. Also, we got you an appointment.

785
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:16,482
Come again next month for a follow-up, okay?

786
00:55:16,587 --> 00:55:18,507
- Thank you so much, Doctor. - You're welcome.

787
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:24,882
Khongkwan, don't hug Daddy too hard. You're hurting him.

788
00:55:24,997 --> 00:55:27,362
- Oh? - Whoa, Nut! It's not that bad.

789
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:28,842
I made it!

790
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:33,202
Doctor Sea Lion.

791
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:37,362
I want to be a fish.

792
00:55:37,482 --> 00:55:39,282
Hey, be quiet. This is a hospital.

793
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,962
It's okay.

794
00:55:42,802 --> 00:55:44,202
Are you feeling fine now?

795
00:55:45,002 --> 00:55:47,482
Yes, Doctor. Thank you so much.

796
00:55:49,488 --> 00:55:51,457
Khongkwan, say goodbye to Dr. Shoan

797
00:55:51,585 --> 00:55:53,162
and Dr. Prim.

798
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:55,536
Goodbye, Dr. Prim.

799
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,091
Goodbye.

800
00:55:57,172 --> 00:55:59,172
Bye-bye, Doctor Oong!

801
00:56:00,555 --> 00:56:01,562
Oong!

802
00:56:02,562 --> 00:56:06,002
Okay! Let's go home. We need to beat the traffic.

803
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:07,282
Let's go.

804
00:56:09,027 --> 00:56:10,322
Come on up.

805
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,322
See you next month, Khongkwan.

806
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,082
- Come on, guys. Let's go. - Come with us.

807
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:29,569
Grandpa, Grandma, good afternoon.

808
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:32,097
Good afternoon, Khongkwan.

809
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:36,482
Are you all right, son?

810
00:56:36,711 --> 00:56:38,442
Do you feel any side effects?

811
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:41,402
No, Mom.

812
00:56:43,938 --> 00:56:45,282
Goodbye, Mom.

813
00:57:00,089 --> 00:57:01,089
Hey.

814
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:07,682
Bring my granddaughter over for dinner sometimes.

815
00:57:13,232 --> 00:57:14,722
You all can come.

816
00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:16,562
Thank you.

817
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:20,362
Yes, Dad.

818
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:49,882
Are you still playing your role?

819
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,442
Don't you have work to do?

820
00:58:10,994 --> 00:58:12,162
Blow it.

821
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:17,162
Why do I have to blow it?

822
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:21,722
Today is Nick's birthday, right?

823
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:24,879
And now, he left to party with his friends.

824
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,522
So, blow it.

825
00:58:29,915 --> 00:58:31,442
Why does it have to be me?

826
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,286
Fine. Don't. I'll blow it myself.

827
00:58:37,493 --> 00:58:38,653
I will.

828
00:59:04,136 --> 00:59:05,562
Are you feeling better?

829
00:59:08,522 --> 00:59:09,922
About what?

830
00:59:12,985 --> 00:59:14,762
Well, forget it.

831
00:59:20,153 --> 00:59:21,913
You got it on your lips.

832
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:23,282
Excuse me.

833
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:33,042
It's like I got a new baby brother at almost 30. There's still more.

834
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,042
Hello, Professor.

835
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:40,242
Oh! I'm on my way.

836
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:41,762
Okay. I'll be there.

837
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:44,962
Professor Win needs me. I haven't put this away.

838
00:59:45,401 --> 00:59:46,682
I will do it for you.

839
00:59:46,787 --> 00:59:48,402
Thanks a lot. I'll leave it to you.

840
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,856
I have to go.

841
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:04,162
Doctor, it's okay.

842
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:05,922
I'll get it for you.

843
01:00:10,882 --> 01:00:13,362
It's okay. I need to do this myself.

844
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:15,282
Shoan.

845
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,802
We got a case in the ER.

846
01:00:17,988 --> 01:00:20,282
Doctor, you should go.

847
01:00:20,428 --> 01:00:21,842
I can handle this.

848
01:00:22,107 --> 01:00:23,322
Please go.

849
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:25,002
Thank you.

850
01:00:25,843 --> 01:00:27,762
Dr. Pleum, wait for me!

851
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:50,882
Stop causing problems!

852
01:00:50,995 --> 01:00:53,282
I'm working myself to death!

853
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:55,802
You want me to die soon, don't you?

854
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:59,121
Why must my son be flawed?

855
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:01,402
I don't know what's wrong with him!

856
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:35,122
Happy birthday to Nick!

857
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:38,234
- Nick is having his party there, right? - Someone got shot!

858
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:40,167
Professor Prapas, please try these out.

859
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:42,202
- Thank you so much. - Your hands are shaking.

860
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,825
Close the wound, or we will increase the dose of anesthetic.

861
01:01:44,849 --> 01:01:48,354
No child would remember the mother who left him, right?

862
01:01:48,435 --> 01:01:50,962
I can't stop thinking that Win's cheating on me.

863
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,882
I also know who's in love with Dr. Prim.
