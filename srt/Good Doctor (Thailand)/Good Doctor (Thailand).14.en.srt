(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:33,482
- Please make way. - Please.

3
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:35,202
Hello? Excuse me?

4
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:38,362
Can you hear me?

5
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,836
She fell from a high place. Watch out for her head, neck, and spine.

6
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,618
Put her on the block and rush her to the ER.

7
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:48,762
- Nick, go with him. I'll wait at the ER. - Yes, Professor.

8
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:55,762
- Professor! - Shoan!

9
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,430
- Professor! - Shoan!

10
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,939
- Are you alright? - You're hurt.

11
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:01,442
- You're hurt! You have to be treated! - Shoan, I'm fine.

12
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:03,322
How is the patient?

13
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:06,362
How is Gamer?

14
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:10,202
He's already safe. It's ROSC.

15
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,642
But you're hurt! You have to go to the ER!

16
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,522
- Okay. Fine, I'll go to the ER. - You have to go right now!

17
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,282
Okay.

18
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:24,555
IV for joints. Oxygen mask with a bag for 15 l/min.

19
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:26,762
- Yes, Professor. - E-FAST.

20
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:33,722
There might be fluid.

21
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:35,322
It's probably pneumothorax.

22
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,082
- ICD. - Yes, Professor.

23
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,282
ICD is done.

24
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:48,882
BP is dropping, Professor.

25
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,522
The blood is filling up, Professor.

26
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,202
It's massive hemothorax.

27
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,042
- Pleum, prepare the OR. - Yes.

28
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:03,122
Rib retractor.

29
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:13,762
Okay.

30
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:17,522
She needs to wear a hard collar for now.

31
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:21,722
We will deal with her C-spine injury post-op.

32
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,962
We'll stop her bleeding for now.

33
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:29,802
Suction, please.

34
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:34,562
Absorb it.

35
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,162
Okay. This is probably all right now.

36
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:42,802
I'll stitch the wound now.

37
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,322
Suture.

38
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,002
Tying the knot.

39
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:55,962
Close it.

40
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:02,202
Done. It's alright now. You can take her to the ICU.

41
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,562
Although we can save her life,

42
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,762
she'll be paralyzed from her neck down.

43
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,122
She's still able to talk and communicate.

44
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:34,362
(Episode 14: Rewind #2)

45
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,602
(Samut Songkhram - 2010)

46
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,922
He has a brain tumor.

47
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,842
You've performed a thorough examination, right?

48
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,242
I thought it was just a febrile seizure.

49
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,802
That's why I let him wait.

50
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,178
An investigation into this matter has to be conducted.

51
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:57,522
Prepare your information.

52
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:58,962
If there's anything,

53
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:00,922
just explain the facts to them.

54
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,162
Can't we...

55
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:19,602
Can't we tell his parents...

56
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,202
Can we just not tell them about his tumor?

57
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,042
That's not right, Int.

58
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:30,322
His parents have a right to know what happens to their son.

59
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:33,042
But I still believe

60
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:34,854
that if we can explain that it's just a mistake,

61
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:36,736
not an intent to overlook,

62
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,497
his parents might understand us.

63
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,882
Or they might not understand.

64
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:57,203
What happened

65
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,882
- was... - Were you on the scene?

66
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:04,562
- No. - I'd like to listen to the people on the scene.

67
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,882
Please tell me what happened.

68
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,882
There's someone wearing black.

69
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,601
They're wearing a cap and mask.

70
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,842
I didn't see their face,

71
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,402
but they had a cutter.

72
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:19,882
They threatened me.

73
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,441
They're going to attack me.

74
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:23,897
They attacked Professor. They attacked the patient.

75
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:25,042
They attacked me.

76
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,162
And they attacked Professor.

77
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:28,361
They're a bad person.

78
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,762
They're a bad person. You have to arrest them.

79
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:31,882
You have to arrest them.

80
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,682
But someone saw you had a fight with them,

81
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,323
causing them to fall from the building.

82
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,682
I didn't have a fight with them.

83
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,722
They threatened me. They're going to stab me with their cutter.

84
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:43,082
They stabbed Professor. They attacked the patient.

85
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,856
You have to arrest the bad person.

86
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:49,522
Listen, you're going around in circles. Aren't you a doctor?

87
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:52,322
- How could you treat patients like that? - Wait, Officer.

88
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,122
I don't think it's your duty to express your opinion like that.

89
00:06:56,408 --> 00:07:00,282
Let me tell you that the injured doctor can now give testimony.

90
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:02,762
But he didn't see what happened, did he?

91
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,562
That the accused

92
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:05,883
went into the patient's room.

93
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:07,722
And also, this doctor

94
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,402
is receiving psychotherapy.

95
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:10,762
Is it possible

96
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,482
that he hallucinated?

97
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:15,282
Here!

98
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:17,122
This is a medical document.

99
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:19,162
It's evidence that can prove that

100
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:23,954
during that time, the patient is in a critical state.

101
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,162
It's not a coincidence.

102
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,842
And I'd like to make an objection to your eyewitness.

103
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,482
I don't think the witness is reliable

104
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:34,122
because they have eye problems.

105
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,602
They're waiting for their treatment.

106
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:39,082
If you don't have any more evidence,

107
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:41,002
I think I can take him home.

108
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,122
There's also another thing.

109
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,979
Officer, you should talk to Samut Songkhram Police Station.

110
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,539
You should talk to the police over there.

111
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:49,082
You might get more information.

112
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,522
Let's go, Shoan.

113
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:54,482
Goodbye.

114
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,002
(Medical Document)

115
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,367
(Inquiry Officer)

116
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:10,162
Call Samut Songkhram Police Station to ask what happened.

117
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:11,802
Yes.

118
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:21,751
Actually, I think I can go back to work now.

119
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:24,882
My wound is probably fine now.

120
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:27,642
And my hands are fine. Look.

121
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,362
I can still use them.

122
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:31,522
You're so stubborn.

123
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,482
Well...

124
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,042
Have you gotten to talk to Shoan?

125
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,186
I haven't seen him since the incident.

126
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:41,384
I don't know how he is.

127
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,802
Prapas is probably picking him up from the police station.

128
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,042
Police station? Why?

129
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:53,202
Well, Shoan might be accused of negligence, resulting in injury.

130
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,802
Fortunately, the injured person survived.

131
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:59,042
But it's not Shoan's fault.

132
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,402
Wait...

133
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:04,962
I was on the scene. I have to be the witness.

134
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,322
Calm down.

135
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:13,322
Come in.

136
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:18,242
- Shoan? How are you? - How are you, Professor?

137
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:23,522
I think I'll go out to talk about my work.

138
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,681
- Shoan, I'll leave you to it. - Goodbye.

139
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:26,922
Goodbye.

140
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,922
What's wrong? Why do you make that kind of face?

141
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:47,693
- I'm the cause of your... - Wait...

142
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:50,113
Wait, what cause?

143
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:55,362
With that kind of face,

144
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:57,898
you made me think of myself in the past.

145
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,042
How?

146
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:05,802
You...

147
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:10,002
Do you remember I had an autistic brother?

148
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:14,322
Do you want to know how he died?

149
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:18,322
How?

150
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:28,602
It was because of me.

151
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,529
I don't want you to go.

152
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:33,882
You already promised me. You already promised.

153
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:37,402
But you didn't tell me that there weren't any adults.

154
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,162
I can go.

155
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:40,802
I'm an adult. I can go.

156
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,242
- I can go. - Wee.

157
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:43,962
Wee! It's me. Take a breath.

158
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,145
Okay...

159
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:53,962
Wee is going to draw a building. He'd go to look at the inside structure.

160
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,642
But I don't want him to go

161
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,402
because no one will look after him.

162
00:10:57,492 --> 00:11:00,682
- I'm an adult. I can go. - Yeah, you're an adult.

163
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:04,242
You're an adult. Take a deep breath, Wee.

164
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:08,602
When you're an adult, you have to apologize when you do something wrong.

165
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:12,242
You surprised our mom. You hurt her as well.

166
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:14,362
What do you have to do?

167
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,402
What do you have to do?

168
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,522
Mom.

169
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,202
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,562
Good, Wee. Good.

171
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:28,522
Good job. You have to do this when you're an adult.

172
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,242
Do you want to go by yourself?

173
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:04,762
Yes.

174
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:06,362
I'll go by myself.

175
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:07,842
I can go by myself.

176
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:09,065
The high-rise building

177
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:10,602
is on Sathon Road.

178
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:13,522
I can go there via SkyTrain by getting off at Saphan Taksin Station.

179
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,242
Walk straight for 800 meters.

180
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:16,882
Turn left to the alley

181
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,682
and continue to walk for 200 meters.

182
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:20,642
The building will be on my right.

183
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,562
And what if a stranger wants to take you there?

184
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,242
I won't go.

185
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,952
What if they're taking you to see beautiful buildings?

186
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,242
I won't go.

187
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:38,762
I won't go.

188
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,442
What if I drive you there?

189
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,642
Drive me there?

190
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,962
You drive me there?

191
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:54,042
Go. I'll go.

192
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,762
I'll go. Good.

193
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:59,962
You'll drive me there. Good. I'll go.

194
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,642
I'll go.

195
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:06,762
If you're worried,

196
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:10,202
I'll secretly follow him to the building.

197
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:17,802
Back then, I thought

198
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,862
the best thing was to support him

199
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,002
in doing what he wanted.

200
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,802
Let him grow up

201
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:27,122
just like other people.

202
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,322
But

203
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,722
I was wrong.

204
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:13,442
The deceased fell down from the 15th floor of an abandoned building.

205
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:16,095
We've learned that the deceased

206
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:17,698
is autistic.

207
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,282
He's an award-winning artist.

208
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:23,962
- We offer our condolences to the victim's family. - He's my brother.

209
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:25,802
Wait, I'm a doctor.

210
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:28,362
Wee! What happened to him?

211
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:31,122
He fell from the 15th floor. He's now passed away.

212
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,362
How's his vital sign?

213
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,002
- He has passed away. - Have you done CPR?

214
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,562
Have you done CPR?

215
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:39,442
I'm a doctor. I can help him.

216
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,482
- He's already passed away. - Wee!

217
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:58,537
Please back off.

218
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,722
Wee! Where are you taking him?

219
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:05,762
No! Wee! No!

220
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:10,722
Wee! I'm going to help him!

221
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:12,682
I'll help him!

222
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,642
I've always wondered

223
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:25,202
if

224
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:28,282
I had stopped him from going that day,

225
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:31,762
he might still be alive today.

226
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,802
When I met you

227
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,682
who were like him,

228
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:50,002
I didn't want to make another mistake again.

229
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,962
I understand now.

230
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:04,882
You're right.

231
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:09,082
Your brother and I are similar in some ways.

232
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,602
But

233
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,082
I don't have to be like your brother.

234
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,042
And I think

235
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:23,522
you didn't want to cause your brother's death.

236
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,362
Right...

237
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,202
I think you've done a decent job

238
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,722
with that patient.

239
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,962
When you use the word "decent,"

240
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,722
how many points is that?

241
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:04,082
Ninety or more.

242
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:08,802
Ninety or more? I got an A, right?

243
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,647
- So you're saying I'm pretty good, right? - You...

244
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,482
You're not being humble at all.

245
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:16,330
How should I do that?

246
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,922
Tell me what you've done that day.

247
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,122
Of course.

248
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,603
First, I went in to check his condition.

249
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:30,122
I found

250
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:34,402
that he had cardiac arrest, so I gave him an inspection.

251
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:37,514
I found that he had PEA.

252
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,762
So, I gave him CPR.

253
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:41,962
Dr. Prim came to do CPR instead of me.

254
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:46,722
- We found that he had hyperkalemia. - Potassium...

255
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,001
We probably have to postpone elective cases.

256
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,363
There's a lot of patients now. We don't have enough beds.

257
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:08,202
Why? Let me see.

258
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,042
There might be some patients

259
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:14,202
that we can let go home.

260
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,162
Here.

261
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,515
Duangdao of bed No.49.

262
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:24,882
She's been here for three weeks because of an infected foot from diabetes.

263
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:27,060
She'll probably get better after the prescription.

264
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,939
She said she wanted to stay here for a bit longer.

265
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:30,523
She's waiting for her son to pick her up.

266
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:34,706
But Professor Karn said she'd probably be able to go home in two days.

267
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,962
(Miss Duangdao Samangdi, 70 Years Old)

268
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,882
- Hello, Auntie. - Hello.

269
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:49,762
How are you?

270
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:51,962
It's normal.

271
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,842
When will your son come to pick you up?

272
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,362
You're asking me that again.

273
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,882
I said he would come after he's done with his training.

274
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,882
(The society is asking questions)

275
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:23,442
(about the disappearing ethics among doctors.)

276
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:25,002
(The loose security.)

277
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:27,319
(Have we already passed the point of no return?)

278
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:28,722
(With what has been happening, )

279
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,999
(how could the public have faith in the system?)

280
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,602
(There has to be an investigation as soon as possible)

281
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,162
(to regain the trust of the public.)

282
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,842
We're a hospital.

283
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:39,682
Someone has to take responsibility.

284
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:42,322
The hospital let a criminal in

285
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,602
to assault a doctor with a weapon.

286
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:46,042
Is that acceptable?

287
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,482
I'm directly involved in this matter.

288
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:52,202
I can say that Shoan isn't guilty here.

289
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,722
But if there's evidence that Shoan's guilty,

290
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:56,682
I'll take responsibility by resigning.

291
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,602
Hey, if there are only good people here,

292
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,602
when the media ask me,

293
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,770
who can I point my finger at then?

294
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,802
If the evidence can prove

295
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,962
that Dr. Inthira is really guilty, this will be a big deal.

296
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:20,482
It'll affect our industry as a whole.

297
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,922
No matter who it is,

298
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:25,522
if you do something wrong, you're guilty.

299
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,882
And if you haven't done anything wrong,

300
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:30,462
you're innocent.

301
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:33,735
That's why I have to object to the board for trying to dismiss Shoan.

302
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:37,362
Or else the board would continue to make a wrong decision again.

303
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:41,882
I'd like more time to handle this incident.

304
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:43,842
Yes.

305
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,482
Archawin.

306
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:49,962
You shouldn't promise them anything like that.

307
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,762
If we can't find any more evidence in a week,

308
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,042
it'll affect your future.

309
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,402
There has to be a way.

310
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,054
What are you doing?

311
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:13,915
Cleansing your bad luck with holy water.

312
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,442
You're always in trouble.

313
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,562
But you're not a monk, though.

314
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,562
What did the police say?

315
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:37,682
They said

316
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,622
there was no witness. All the cameras are broken.

317
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:43,842
So, my testimony

318
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,842
doesn't have enough support or evidence.

319
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,762
I'm so mad. The cameras...

320
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:51,842
- This is the second time now. - Yeah.

321
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:54,685
How could there be only one person on the floor?

322
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,178
Calm down.

323
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:58,188
It was also after visiting hours on that day.

324
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,202
- What? - Dr. Prim, help. Help!

325
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:21,762
I can't...

326
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:25,602
Me again?

327
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:32,602
- Mim? Mim! - That's scary.

328
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,042
Go!

329
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:37,922
Go away!

330
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:40,882
Go!

331
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:45,202
- Wow, so manly. - As expected of her,

332
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:47,042
what a tough girl we have here.

333
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:49,882
It's gone.

334
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,003
It's so small. What are you afraid of?

335
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:54,522
By the way, Shoan,

336
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:57,882
don't you usually like all animals?

337
00:22:58,073 --> 00:22:59,522
Are you afraid of spiders?

338
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,881
I understand its nature,

339
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:09,402
but its movement and posture make me scared.

340
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:11,042
I don't like it.

341
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:33,162
How's your training?

342
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,242
Are you tired?

343
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,842
If you're free, come to visit me sometimes.

344
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:43,322
Your training must be hard over there.

345
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:47,562
You should visit me when you're free.

346
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:50,882
I miss you.

347
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:56,762
Come often.

348
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,882
Come to see me often.

349
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,482
Hello.

350
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:15,682
You'll have to do more MRI scans.

351
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:18,082
It's within your right of treatment. Please don't worry.

352
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:21,122
As for your son, we still can't contact him.

353
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,402
Do you have other numbers or his workplace's number?

354
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,082
Why can't you contact him?

355
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:30,642
My son was just talking to me earlier.

356
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:38,802
Who were you talking to?

357
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:41,322
My son.

358
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:03,842
My memory is bad now, Doctor.

359
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:11,442
Soon,

360
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:14,322
I'll probably forget everything.

361
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:18,802
I'll forget everyone.

362
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,752
I'll forget about myself.

363
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:23,922
Right, Doctor?

364
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:36,402
In this case, it's possible that it's delirium or Alzheimer's disease

365
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:39,522
as she placed her belongings in weird spots.

366
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:45,682
I saw her put spoons and forks under her pillow.

367
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:47,922
We have to tell Professor Prapas.

368
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,642
Prepare your report.

369
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,122
Yes.

370
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:56,562
(Reception)

371
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:59,322
Professor, Dr. Pleum has a report to tell you.

372
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,610
Sure.

373
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:06,442
Here.

374
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:10,442
Delirium?

375
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:11,962
Yes.

376
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
We still can't contact her relatives.

377
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,842
I think we have to call for doctors from Neuro Medicine.

378
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:20,922
- Yes. - Yes, Professor.

379
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:24,882
Hello?

380
00:26:29,017 --> 00:26:31,442
Yes, I'll be there. Thank you.

381
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:40,242
Okay...

382
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:45,562
There's no leakage in the ICD and no additional bleeding.

383
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:48,184
Mummim, you can try clamping ICD.

384
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:49,917
Perform an x-ray on her chest tomorrow.

385
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,455
If her lung expands and she doesn't have pneumothorax,

386
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,282
you can take off the ICD.

387
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:55,882
Yes, Professor.

388
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:08,802
(It's possible)

389
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:12,522
(that Dr. Inthira really knows the deceased.)

390
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,162
Doctor.

391
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:24,482
Have you seen this woman?

392
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:27,962
I've never seen her. I can't recognize her at all.

393
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:30,899
- Who is this woman? - (From the photo on the deceased's social media, )

394
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,602
(I think Dr. Inthira didn't realize she was in the photo, )

395
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:35,425
(so she didn't admit to it.)

396
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:38,002
(We're checking the suspect's vehicle)

397
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:40,402
(to see if it's linked to Dr. Inthira.)

398
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:41,722
(For now, )

399
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:43,242
(I'll send officers)

400
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,162
(to guard the front of the room.)

401
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:48,922
Those kids are trying to find another patient

402
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:50,882
who we think might have seen the incident.

403
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,838
They also posted about this on the internet.

404
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,482
I don't know if they'll find them.

405
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:00,936
Or do we have to expect her

406
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,322
to say the truth, Professor?

407
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,362
How's the grilled pork?

408
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,202
I got this from a patient. If not, I wouldn't get to eat.

409
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:31,042
What are you drawing?

410
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:33,162
I'm drawing a picture.

411
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:38,322
Do you still have to submit it to Professor Sicha?

412
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:42,802
Not anymore.

413
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:47,162
But I want to draw it for relaxation and for my memory.

414
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:48,642
Speaking of memories,

415
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,122
my case's patient,

416
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,882
I think she has Alzheimer's. She can't remember anything.

417
00:28:57,082 --> 00:29:02,722
Is it possible to use pictures or drawings

418
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,202
to stimulate the memory of people who have Alzheimer's?

419
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,082
In theory, it's possible.

420
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:15,122
In practicality, I'm not sure.

421
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,682
Interesting.

422
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:20,202
Shoan.

423
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:21,922
I need your help with something.

424
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:23,482
I'll call you tonight.

425
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,882
Yes.

426
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,362
Sure, I'll be there.

427
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,962
I'm leaving now.

428
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,562
Shoan.

429
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,722
Don't forget about the ER tonight.

430
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:40,442
Yes.

431
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:47,602
How could you be that generous to other people?

432
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:51,402
Have you finished all of your work? It's not like you have less work.

433
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:53,242
I think it's fine, though.

434
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:55,162
You're also generous.

435
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:57,402
Everyone said when I

436
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,679
was with the police, you were really concerned about me.

437
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:04,122
Who said that?

438
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,042
You're mistaken.

439
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,522
(#SaveDrShoan, #CheeringForDrShoan)

440
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:24,322
You can call me.

441
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,322
You can call me anytime.

442
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:30,362
Thank you so much, goodbye.

443
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:33,282
I have nothing.

444
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,802
I also have nothing.

445
00:30:37,562 --> 00:30:39,562
It's almost the deadline. What should we do?

446
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:42,602
- Right, Prim. - What?

447
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:45,922
Are you okay with today's shift?

448
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:49,682
I'm okay.

449
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,642
Excuse me.

450
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:10,722
Please squeeze your hand.

451
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:22,242
When I saw you,

452
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:26,522
it made me think of when I was a resident of Samut Songkhram.

453
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:30,882
I was going to be a pediatrician.

454
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:33,922
In the end, I got to do everything

455
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,082
as there were only two doctors in that hospital.

456
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:41,242
I was doing my best, just like you now.

457
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:45,162
I wanted to be in a small hospital

458
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,122
somewhere far away,

459
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:51,642
hoping to be able to offer treatment to local villagers.

460
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,202
But in the end,

461
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:59,282
when you get to see various things,

462
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:03,922
you'll realize it's not as you thought.

463
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:11,482
Why do they have to expect me to have an ideology?

464
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:15,602
Why do I have to sacrifice myself more than others?

465
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:20,642
Why can't I just live my life normally? Why can't I eat or sleep

466
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,722
like normal people?

467
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:27,082
Am I not a human as well?

468
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:32,562
I'm just working for money.

469
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:36,602
You'll realize

470
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,362
that working for money

471
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:43,402
sometimes

472
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:47,042
gets you even as much honor as the money from your salary.

473
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,282
I realized one day

474
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:57,122
that no one would help or care about me.

475
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,522
I have to do everything by myself anyway.

476
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:05,482
That's normal.

477
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,282
You probably understand now

478
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:15,082
why I have become like this.

479
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,722
Dr. Prim.

480
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:07,402
Are you going out for a run?

481
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:09,802
Yes. It's Professor Win's order.

482
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:12,002
I knew it.

483
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:15,242
I didn't know you exercised.

484
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:18,402
Do you want to run together?

485
00:34:18,928 --> 00:34:20,402
Sure.

486
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:22,922
Let's go.

487
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,842
Your mood right now

488
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:08,202
isn't anger or sadness.

489
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:10,482
You're not upset, either.

490
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:13,482
It seems like

491
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:16,402
you're agreeing while not agreeing with something.

492
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,002
You're good at reading people's emotions now.

493
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,282
Have you felt like this before?

494
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,122
You're trying to do your best

495
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:42,122
even though you know

496
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,242
that you won't get anything back.

497
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,882
Would you still do that if it were you?

498
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:02,882
I think if you do something,

499
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,229
you're going to get something back for sure.

500
00:36:05,315 --> 00:36:06,642
For example,

501
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:08,842
I went jogging today.

502
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:12,082
I ran for 1,7899 steps.

503
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:15,299
My step length was 0.94 meters.

504
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:18,802
Therefore, I ran 1.68 km.

505
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:24,162
It's almost impossible not to gain anything when you do something.

506
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:26,242
Okay...

507
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:30,562
And for the question of whether I would do it...

508
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Let me give an example about being a doctor.

509
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:38,962
Even though you know how much chance a patient has of surviving,

510
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:42,042
you have to treat them because we're doctors.

511
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,962
As for if you want to do it or not,

512
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,042
you have to think for yourself.

513
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:55,602
That's true.

514
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,282
You don't have to bring up

515
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:04,162
physics theory to explain something to me anymore. It's too much.

516
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:35,362
Have you found anything?

517
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,553
Nothing at all, Prim.

518
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:40,162
- I haven't found anything. - Really?

519
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:45,442
She sent me a dancing clip, but I didn't see anything in it.

520
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:46,842
Let me see.

521
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:50,682
Should we try to gather signatures for a petition instead?

522
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,962
I think that's better.

523
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,322
Shoan, look at this.

524
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:03,522
What?

525
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,922
Take a look at this. It'll continue to loop.

526
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:47,314
Int.

527
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:54,082
Please don't ruin a good doctor's future.

528
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:05,842
Why didn't you think like that back then?

529
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,722
Do you remember that kid?

530
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:13,922
The one I told you about.

531
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,322
He has a brain tumor. You've performed a thorough examination, right?

532
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:21,736
An investigation into this matter has to be conducted.

533
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:24,362
Can we just not tell them about his tumor?

534
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:26,682
That's not right, Int.

535
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:29,922
His parents have a right to know what happens to their son.

536
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:32,122
I only made one mistake.

537
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,362
You cut off my future.

538
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,602
And now what?

539
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,642
Why does that boy have to get more opportunities than me?

540
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:45,562
Is it because he's autistic?

541
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:47,262
Do you feel sorry for him?

542
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:49,652
Is that why he should get more opportunities than others?

543
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,322
That's right.

544
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:59,882
Prapas, you really changed my life.

545
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:04,122
If I still believed in what you said,

546
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,722
I'd still be living my life with resignation.

547
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,122
Prapas, you should accept that

548
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:18,122
your ideology and grand delusion

549
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:21,242
have destroyed me.

550
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,722
It has destroyed doctors.

551
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:28,402
It has destroyed every doctor's future.

552
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:48,737
If what I had done made you think like that,

553
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,002
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:58,882
If I could turn back time,

555
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,602
I'd still make the same decision.

556
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:16,922
Oh, it's not...

557
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:20,467
It's not related to the surgery I did for your grandson.

558
00:41:20,555 --> 00:41:23,002
I had already told them

559
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,272
that the kid had a febrile seizure,

560
00:41:25,362 --> 00:41:28,722
but he arrived too late, so he had already passed away.

561
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:32,562
There'll be nothing that is linked to you, Director.

562
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:34,762
Yes.

563
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,282
It's alright. I understand your concern.

564
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:41,762
You're welcome, Doctor.

565
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:50,862
This...

566
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:53,762
This is the difference between you and Shoan.

567
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:57,467
You had a chance to fix it,

568
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:00,282
but you chose to blame it on others.

569
00:42:17,962 --> 00:42:20,002
(For this murder case, the police have revealed)

570
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:24,322
(that the accused is a doctor from a private hospital.)

571
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:28,642
(They believe the motive is linked to drug importation corruption.)

572
00:42:28,802 --> 00:42:30,122
(This doctor)

573
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:33,335
(also attempted to silence a child witness through killing.)

574
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:35,133
(This is such a disturbing case.)

575
00:42:35,214 --> 00:42:37,442
Why are doctors nowadays so cruel?

576
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:42,482
- Let me handle this. - (Let's hear from the Minister.)

577
00:42:44,043 --> 00:42:46,043
(I'd like to commend the police)

578
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:48,114
(for their thorough and impartial investigation, )

579
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:50,762
(and not being swayed by public sentiment.)

580
00:42:51,922 --> 00:42:54,522
(With this case happening, I understand)

581
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:58,282
(the public's concern and loss of trust in doctors and hospitals.)

582
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,322
(However, I still believe that)

583
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,202
(most doctors are good doctors.)

584
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,442
(I also believe that the public)

585
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:08,322
(is going to see that soon.)

586
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:46,842
Let's give a round of applause to our detective doctor.

587
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,722
Stop that. No!

588
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:52,482
Your future boyfriend will be scared of you for sure.

589
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:54,280
- Why? - You'd even check for his shadow.

590
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:59,002
That's true. I haven't seen anything after I watched it 10 times.

591
00:44:00,442 --> 00:44:03,042
Shoan, look at this.

592
00:44:05,322 --> 00:44:08,522
- What? - Take a look at this. I'll continue to loop.

593
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:15,842
(I'm sorry for not coming out sooner.)

594
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:19,202
(Since she got out of the hospital, she wouldn't say anything.)

595
00:44:19,353 --> 00:44:23,002
Yes, I understand, ma'am. So...

596
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:27,122
(She just said she had the clip of everything that happened.)

597
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:32,562
Bad person! A bad person!

598
00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:35,522
Bad person!

599
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:53,962
No, stop this!

600
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:56,645
I'm in a good mood today. I'll treat you all to coffee.

601
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:58,562
- Let's go. This isn't a big deal. - Wow.

602
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,962
I'd like green tea.

603
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:03,282
- Sure. Let's go. - I'd like some pastries, Nick.

604
00:45:03,974 --> 00:45:05,762
- What about you, Pleum? - Cocoa.

605
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:08,182
- Coffee is fine. - Shoan.

606
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:09,922
Yes?

607
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:13,522
I got an answer to your physics question now.

608
00:45:19,939 --> 00:45:21,682
You probably understand now

609
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:26,642
why I have become like this.

610
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,642
It's because of you

611
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:37,842
and your greed.

612
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,922
What we're doing

613
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:43,724
right now might

614
00:45:43,843 --> 00:45:46,122
not be the best way out,

615
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,126
but it's our business.

616
00:45:48,252 --> 00:45:50,362
We have to learn from that experience ourselves.

617
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:55,362
You have no right

618
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:58,122
to look down on anyone's determination.

619
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,002
Professor...

620
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,282
Please stop

621
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:05,922
acting like you're the victim.

622
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:09,202
Please accept the fact that you're a murderer.

623
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,082
I'll be honest.

624
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:44,162
Since we approved transferring more of the budget to security,

625
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:47,522
my position as the director is starting to feel shaky now, Professor.

626
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:51,322
I understand that.

627
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:55,402
Sometimes, choosing to do the right thing isn't easy.

628
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,442
That's why I really feel thankful to you.

629
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:02,602
It's fine. We have to do the right thing.

630
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,882
(Ward Three)

631
00:47:06,963 --> 00:47:09,242
What does your son look like?

632
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,562
He's handsome. He's tall. He's a soldier.

633
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:15,962
Is he more handsome than Pleum?

634
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:17,882
When I look at you,

635
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,962
you're pretty handsome yourself.

636
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:23,343
Don't give him too much praise. He'll get arrogant.

637
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,842
When I go home,

638
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:28,482
- I'll get some for you. - Thank you.

639
00:47:28,698 --> 00:47:31,522
My son is handsome, just like his mother.

640
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:33,762
Because when his mother was young,

641
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:37,842
- she was more beautiful than you. - Oh wow, really?

642
00:47:57,185 --> 00:47:58,242
Pleum.

643
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:00,962
Let's go. Our new patient is waiting.

644
00:48:01,482 --> 00:48:02,802
Just a moment.

645
00:48:12,728 --> 00:48:18,162
(Tom, her son, a soldier. He has already passed away.)

646
00:48:19,498 --> 00:48:25,461
(Dr. Pleum, Auntie Dao's Doctor, Drawn by Shoan)

647
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,442
I knew it.

648
00:48:45,153 --> 00:48:47,922
I really want to see the faces of those who criticized him.

649
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:50,802
My Shoan

650
00:48:51,082 --> 00:48:53,082
was the one who helped that kid's life.

651
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:00,202
What's wrong?

652
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:03,602
Yen, you...

653
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,282
Can you go ask for more of that medicine?

654
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:10,562
- My stomach hurts! - You just got that about an hour ago.

655
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,362
Can you wait for a bit?

656
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:14,327
I can't! Please go right now.

657
00:49:14,408 --> 00:49:16,682
Well, I'll go ask a nurse.

658
00:49:43,753 --> 00:49:47,082
He is starting to have organ failure now.

659
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,706
He can have heart failure at any time.

660
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,202
What I want to recommend is palliative care.

661
00:49:58,408 --> 00:50:01,602
If that's the case, can I take him home?

662
00:50:01,952 --> 00:50:03,042
No.

663
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:05,139
Heart failure can happen at any moment.

664
00:50:05,314 --> 00:50:07,314
He has to be watched by doctors all the time.

665
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:10,602
But he said if his condition couldn't be treated,

666
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,202
he wanted to go back to our home, Shoan.

667
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:15,962
- You can't... - Shoan.

668
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:19,322
Right now,

669
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:22,582
your dad doesn't have much time left.

670
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:26,442
Let him do what he wants.

671
00:51:24,522 --> 00:51:25,922
How was it?

672
00:51:31,194 --> 00:51:33,722
Does no one want to be with me at all?

673
00:51:41,804 --> 00:51:43,842
Well, it's not wrong for you

674
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,042
if you would want to think like that.

675
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:52,842
No one has ever told you anything in the past.

676
00:51:57,128 --> 00:51:58,522
But now...

677
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:01,962
This time, it's different.

678
00:52:06,912 --> 00:52:10,762
When he has to do palliative care,

679
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:14,242
it doesn't mean

680
00:52:17,376 --> 00:52:19,562
that your dad is going to leave you.

681
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,842
It also doesn't mean

682
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:27,082
that you can't do your duty as his son.

683
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:35,642
I'm serious.

684
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:39,122
It is

685
00:52:40,181 --> 00:52:41,442
a choice

686
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:43,522
that he makes

687
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:48,362
in deciding how he wants to leave this world.

688
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,042
Let's take your dad to your home.

689
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:19,550
Yes.

690
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:45,122
Shin,

691
00:53:46,242 --> 00:53:48,242
I'm cleaning this for you.

692
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:54,962
It's clean now, son.

693
00:54:26,842 --> 00:54:29,082
- Have a seat here. - Yes.

694
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:38,722
I miss Shin.

695
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,162
It's such a shame.

696
00:54:42,671 --> 00:54:44,242
I want Shin to still be alive.

697
00:54:44,602 --> 00:54:47,242
He'd be able to see that his brother has become a doctor.

698
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,322
It already happened

699
00:54:50,523 --> 00:54:52,162
for both what was right

700
00:54:52,696 --> 00:54:54,322
and what wasn't right.

701
00:54:55,233 --> 00:54:57,042
Professor Prapas said,

702
00:54:59,282 --> 00:55:01,402
"Whatever will be, will be."

703
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:04,562
We can only do our best from now on

704
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,642
and do what is right.

705
00:55:08,922 --> 00:55:11,482
I wanted to be nice to you...

706
00:55:13,482 --> 00:55:14,802
Or at least,

707
00:55:17,282 --> 00:55:22,522
I want to apologize to you and your brother face to face.

708
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:31,003
You have to have a balanced diet, Dad.

709
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:33,362
Don't drink alcohol. Don't smoke.

710
00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:36,442
If you have a stomachache, call the nearest hospital.

711
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,122
And, here.

712
00:55:39,762 --> 00:55:41,162
I'll give this to you.

713
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,562
We'll be able to see each other's faces while calling.

714
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:48,602
You can call me 24/7 as well.

715
00:55:50,091 --> 00:55:52,682
This doctor son of mine is so strict.

716
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:54,322
You can go now.

717
00:55:54,716 --> 00:55:57,442
Driving at night is dangerous.

718
00:55:58,402 --> 00:55:59,842
You can leave now, ouch.

719
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:03,842
It means he's worried about you.

720
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,882
Don't worry. I'll do as you said.

721
00:56:07,082 --> 00:56:08,242
Good.

722
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:10,442
Have a safe drive, Doctor.

723
00:56:10,793 --> 00:56:12,482
- I'll leave him in your care. - Yes.

724
00:56:12,642 --> 00:56:14,642
I'll take my leave then.

725
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,612
Goodbye.

726
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:18,162
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

727
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:19,722
Have a safe drive.

728
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:46,002
Right, I forgot to buy something. Come with me.

729
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,922
- Yes. - It's just over there.

730
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:54,762
Shampoo...

731
00:56:54,997 --> 00:56:56,282
Okay.

732
00:57:05,746 --> 00:57:07,282
Let's take shelter here!

733
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,362
What should we do?

734
00:57:20,802 --> 00:57:23,042
It's such a heavy rain as well.

735
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,217
Right now...

736
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:00,162
Do you still

737
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:04,642
like me?

738
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:09,562
Yes.

739
00:58:10,993 --> 00:58:13,682
Don't you think that

740
00:58:14,185 --> 00:58:17,122
it might be a misunderstanding?

741
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,842
I haven't asked you why before. Can I ask you that?

742
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:24,122
Sure.

743
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:27,042
It's because you're kind

744
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,842
and normal.

745
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:34,762
Well...

746
00:58:34,997 --> 00:58:36,522
Usually,

747
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:39,562
most people would think of me as a weirdo

748
00:58:39,788 --> 00:58:41,442
or a genius.

749
00:58:41,721 --> 00:58:43,602
But you're in the middle.

750
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:46,562
You see me as a normal person,

751
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:49,922
so normalcy is something that is really special for me.

752
00:59:05,611 --> 00:59:08,882
I'm sorry for making you feel bad.

753
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:12,082
It's the first time I feel like this.

754
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:16,322
I can't keep it to myself. I have to let you know.

755
00:59:18,479 --> 00:59:19,746
And...

756
00:59:23,815 --> 00:59:25,322
Don't you feel bad?

757
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:30,762
I've already calculated it.

758
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,682
I know there's more chance that you would reject me

759
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:35,362
than accept my confession.

760
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:37,850
It's already good enough for me

761
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:41,562
if you don't slap me or if you still see me as a normal person.

762
00:59:54,851 --> 00:59:56,682
Do you feel uncomfortable?

763
00:59:56,914 --> 00:59:58,914
Are you uncomfortable because of the rain?

764
00:59:59,803 --> 01:00:03,162
- Rain can lower your serotonin level, so... - Come on.

765
01:00:03,243 --> 01:00:04,522
Are we going right now?

766
01:00:57,681 --> 01:01:01,842
- Mr. Anat, we have to take her to the hospital immediately. - To GMC?

767
01:01:02,183 --> 01:01:03,737
With the shortcut, it'll be five minutes.

768
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:06,322
- It takes five minutes to go to GMC. - It's around 20 cm.

769
01:01:06,447 --> 01:01:08,139
There must be a lot of bleeding with these.

770
01:01:08,163 --> 01:01:10,424
That doctor is still just a resident.

771
01:01:10,518 --> 01:01:13,289
We can do balloon occlusion within the internal iliac artery.

772
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,322
If something goes wrong, even for a bit,

773
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:19,602
I'll do everything to take you to court.

774
01:01:25,342 --> 01:01:26,962
Oh, that special kid?

775
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:29,705
I just met him during an ovarian tumor operation with Professor Sarocha.

776
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,522
He really liked to show off. So cocky. Did he think professors...

777
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,122
If you want to be praised like him,

778
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:35,786
use this badmouthing time for training.
