Shoan!

5
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:29,362
How have you been doing at work?

6
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,122
Just fine.

7
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,762
Have you decided?

8
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,185
What field do you want to study?

9
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:43,482
I'm actually interested in plastic surgery.

10
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:45,762
Or maybe neuro.

11
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,482
I'll decide later. I have a year left.

12
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:52,802
Have any professors invited you to study under them?

13
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:54,347
Dad.

14
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:56,482
I'm in my junior year.

15
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,162
You're already in your junior year.

16
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,802
That's why you shouldn't make simple mistakes.

17
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:08,922
I went to see Phruek at the hospital.

18
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:10,962
I heard them.

19
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:16,082
These days,

20
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:18,242
they don't call me Dr. Wit.

21
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:20,282
Do you know what they call me?

22
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,202
They call me Dr. Wit,

23
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:24,242
the professors' dad.

24
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,545
That's because your brother and sister

25
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,282
are both professors.

26
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:30,322
But you...

27
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:33,202
I don't want to put too much pressure on you.

28
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:37,522
If you want to be one, be one. If you can't,

29
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:40,482
it's okay.

32
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,402
We use instant green tea here.

33
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:00,562
There's sugar in it, but it's not too sweet.

34
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:01,762
Is that okay?

35
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:03,261
I want it not sweet at all.

36
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,602

Okay.

I'll have an extra sweet latte, please.

42
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,402
And the usual for the other three.

Of course, Prim.

45

Thank you, Dr. Prim.

46
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:43,602
It's alright.

47
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:47,522
Think of it as a welcome gift, okay?

48
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:54,922
Did you hear me this morning?

49
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:01,642
I did, but I was on my way to work.

50
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:05,202
Yeah. I was telling you to come with me.

51
00:06:07,254 --> 00:06:08,762
But your car was not working.

52
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,962
How did you know?

53
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,735
I saw it. Your car wouldn't start.

54
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,202
So you didn't even try to help?

55
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,602
I don't know how to fix a car.

56
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:28,082
No. I mean...

57
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,402
I don't need you to fix it, but...

58
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,183
What about a little courtesy?

59
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,642
Like asking about it, or...

60
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,042
Forget it.

00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:29,762
Genius.

68
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:31,682
Thank you.

69
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,522
You order an extra sweet. Aren't you afraid of getting fat?

70
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,242
You didn't laugh. The joke didn't work.

71
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,882
I'll try to come up with a new one.

72
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,122
That was a joke?

73
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:01,082
Don't say that to anyone else.

74
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:04,122
For your own safety.

75
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,282
Come on.

76

Take the other cup with you.

77
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,402
Hello? I'm at the hospital.

78

When are you coming?

79
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,907
Let's go to dinner tonight.

80
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:32,442
Everyone, good morning.

81
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,362
Anything you want.

82
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:37,962
Korean or Japanese?

83
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,922
- I have to go. - Coffee's here.

84
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,362
- Thank you. - Thanks.

85
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,491
My Thai tea, with milk.

86
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,922
- Finally. How much? - It's fine. My treat.

87
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,402
You're too kind.

88
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:52,682
Here's your schedule.

89
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:54,602
- Let's see. - It's already done?

90
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:59,402
Here's yours.

91
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:03,802
Mummim, you got three-day straight shifts, no beauty sleep.

92
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:05,682
- No... - How's yours?

93
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:07,082
This is not right.

94
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,642
I have no operation in my schedule.

95
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,442
Really?

96
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:17,122
GMC Medical Center's resident rules state that

97
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,362
every surgeon

98
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:21,082
should attend at least one operation per week.

99
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,442
The OR attending is decided at the supervising professor's discretion.

100
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:28,602
You're not ready.

101
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,242
Good morning.

102
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:33,602
You can't even round the ward.

103

How can you operate on a patient?

104
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:37,042
I want to operate.

105
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,562
Do you think you can do it just because you want to?

106
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,722
Then, can I let a ten-year-old do an operation if they want to?

107
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,362
No, sir.

108
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,202
A ten-year-old never worked as an intern.

109
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,882
- I have... - You can't!

110
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:57,762
I don't trust you in a high-responsibility place.

111
00:09:57,953 --> 00:09:59,682
You should know your place,

112
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:02,602
the place with no responsibility, understood?

113
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:07,882
- You don't like me, Professor? - Yes!

114
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:10,002
I don't like you.

115
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,322
You don't like me

116
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,362
because I am different?

117
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:15,682
You're well aware of that.

118
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:23,262
You should reconsider yourself.

119
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:26,042
You're not suitable as a surgeon.

120
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:32,752
What are you standing there for?

121
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,362
Don't you have your job to do?

122
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:36,922
Give that to me.

(Queue number 522...)

126
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,802
Let's see this one. A PU perforation.

127
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:12,042
Pretend I'm the professor.

128
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:16,242
I'm here for your case review or something.

129
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,922
And next, pretend I'm the patient.

130
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:21,842
I want to hear an update on my condition

131
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:25,122
and my treatment approach. I want to see how you say these things.

132
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:26,762
Try it.

133
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,362
The patient is male, 71 years old.

134
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,632
Two hours before he came in, he felt pain under his xiphoid.

135
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:34,801
He also got pale.

136
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:37,282
The initial diagnosis is dyspepsia with anemia.

137
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:39,751
The anemia was treated by a unit of packed red cells

138
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,257
and a proton pump inhibitor.

139
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:44,241
After that, they found free air in the acute abdomen series.

140
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:47,762
ER's diagnosis is peptic ulcer perforation with sepsis.

141
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:52,632
Okay.

142
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:57,311
Tell me the treatment approach next.

143
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,442
He's still in initial admission.

144
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,322
The patient has difficulty breathing.

145
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:14,402
His oxygen saturation is 94%. His BP is 80/64.

146
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:17,663
We tubed him and started an IV with norepinephrine and pip-tazo.

147
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:19,482
He was operated using

148
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:23,482
an exploratory laparotomy with a simple suture with an omental graft.

149
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:26,467
Post-op day one, his vital signs are unstable.

150
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,602
He's still pale. His hematocrit is 27.1%.

151
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:33,002
He was panting this morning, so we reintubated him, and

152
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:34,682
he's on a ventilator.

153
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:39,002
Post-op day ten, there have been no complications.

154
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,099
He can take food via feed.

155
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:43,562
We can discharge him.

156
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,242
Prim, I'll check out that area.

157
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:52,722
If we stick together,

158
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,162
nothing will get done.

159
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:55,802
I have to go.

160
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,762

161
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:04,882
- Hi, Win. - Hi.

162
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,242
Professor.

163
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:09,522
I heard Maysa came back from England.

164
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:11,802
She did.

165
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:15,202
She's working at Buraphakhin Hospital, her family's business.

166
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:19,122
Did her dad invite you to work there?

167
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,402
I heard they're opening their hospital next month.

168
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,802
We've talked about that.

169
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,642
They want me to move there full-time.

170
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,442
I haven't decided yet.

171
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:33,842
I understand.

172
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:35,242
Working here is hard.

173
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:38,202
You have your patients and your residents.

174
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,632
It will be just as hard there.

175
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:43,962
If I go, I will be working with Maysa's family.

176
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:48,642
Choose carefully. Do what you love.

177
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,642
Oh yeah! Tonight,

178
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,922
would you go to dinner after work?

179
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,322
No, thanks.

180
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:58,922
After the meeting at Sirirat,

181
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:00,522
I'll head straight home.

182
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,482
I can't imagine

183
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,562
what this place would be like without you.

184
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:07,842
One thing's for sure.

185
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:09,682
The younger doctors would feel lonely.

186
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:21,842
Say the most recent treatment only, understand?

187
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:23,522
Well...

188
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,762
Gender, age, symptoms,

189
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:29,202
and most recent treatment.

190
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:30,922
Gender, age, symptoms,

191
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,242
and most recent treatment.

192
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:36,522
That's all you need to say. A longer case review is just a waste of time.

193
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,722
- You have to hit the point. - Right.

194
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:43,202
I repeat. Most recent treatment.

195
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:44,639
Yes.

196
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:45,922
Okay.

197
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:49,442
Gender, age, symptoms, and most recent treatment.

198
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:53,282
Gender, age, symptoms, and most recent treatment.

199
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,682
Who's Mummim talking to?

200
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,762
He's an ENT resident.

201
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:03,989
Oh yeah?

202
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,202
How did you know?

203
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,202
He's not exhausted. He's not sweating. He's in no rush.

204
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,202
The nearest department is ENT.

205
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:18,082
And I saw his tag.

206
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,242
How many cases do you have left?

207
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,122
How can you see that far?

208
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,282
I have a 20/20 vision.

209
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,002
I have to go now.

210
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,562
Bye-bye.

211
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:35,162
Mummim. Come here.

212
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:37,642
What are you smiling about?

213
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,081
Boyfriend?

214
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:45,282
You didn't tell me you got a boyfriend.

215
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:47,553
We just started dating.

216
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,033
- We met in an app. - Wait a second.

217
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,402
Where did you wish for him? That's a great guy.

218
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,902
- He's cute, right? - He's pretty cute.

219
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,122
Would this work?

220
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:00,082
I mean, like...

221
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:03,322
You both work in the same place.

222
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:05,522
That's good. We'll see each other often.

223
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:11,722
That's okay, I guess. What about you, Shoan? Do you think it's good?

224
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,097
A boyfriend at work.

225
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,458
Seventy-seven percent of couples who work in the same place

226
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:20,282
break up within one year.

227
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:27,002
If you like short-term relationships, I think it's good.

228
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:32,602
Have you ever had a girlfriend? You talk like an expert.

229
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:35,482
- I have never. - Mim, calm down.

230
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:38,602
Easy.

231
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:41,722
Don't mind him. He's just kidding.

232
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:45,442
- He's wishing me bad luck. - It's nothing.

233
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,362
Next time,

234
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,691
you don't have to say everything.

235
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:55,202
It came from a majority of research...

236
00:16:56,659 --> 00:17:00,242
There's a fine line between

237
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:01,802
being

238
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:05,402
theoretical and practical. Also, there's

239
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:07,602
an emotional aspect to this.

240
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:10,334
And sometimes,

241
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,842
that's the reason you can't say everything.

242
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:17,802
- Sis. - Huh?

243
00:17:18,242 --> 00:17:20,602
Isn't this the factory near Professor Archawin's house?

244
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:22,682
In the group?

245
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:31,010
(The district mayor of Bang Phli is here. He reported...)

246
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:35,261
(Traffic is stuck on both sides of Kingkaew Road.)

247
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:38,322
(If you have a doctor's appointment today, )

248
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,659
(or if you want a COVID check, )

249
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,183
(please temporarily avoid the hospital.)

250
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:43,722
They still keep coming.

251
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:47,608
Yes, Director. We will.

252
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,401
The director said this was a mass casualty incident.

253
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:52,082
Everyone, get into your position.

254
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:55,642
Professor, someone is trapped under the pillars. We can't move them.

255
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,802
We need to send more doctors in.

256
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,969
We don't have enough residents in the ER.

257
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:01,642
Okay, I'll send someone in.

258
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,162
Nick, stand by right here.

259
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,554
Prim, hop on an EMS and go to the scene.

260
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,682
- Everyone, let's go! - Yes!

261
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,442
Yes. Tell me what's wrong.

262
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:13,729
Your arm?

263
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,002
Sir!

264
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,442
Can you hear me?

265
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:24,362
Take it easy.

266
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,802
Hi, how are you feeling? I'm a doctor.

267
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:32,242
Dr. Shoan.

268
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:35,642
Dr. Shoan?

269
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:37,202
What is your area?

270
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:41,322
- Yellow. - Yellow? This way, please.

271
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,098
I need a local anesthetic.

272
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:22,122
(The CDC has issued a warning regarding smoke and chemicals.)

273
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,002
Okay. Keep sending them in.

274
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,882
- Professor! - Prim?

275
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:51,282
- Are you here to help the patient inside? - Yes.

276
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:54,002
- We need to wait for the safety check. - Okay.

277
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:56,202
Are you coming in too?

278
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:58,042
I am. I'm here now anyway.

279
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,922
A lot of people got injured.

280
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,882
- How does it look? - We can confirm it won't collapse.

281
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,242
Okay. We can go in.

282
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:22,882
- Let's go. - Thank you.

283
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,802
Doctor, we took too long to control the flame. Here's the patient.

284
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:34,402
Prim.

285
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:02,282
It looks like an unstable pelvic fracture, Professor.

286
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:03,922
A fractured pelvis.

287
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,682
He likely has an intrapelvic vessel injury.

288
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:10,082
Nick.

289
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:15,922
Nick, prepare some Group O, low-liter blood.

290
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,842
Yes, Professor.

291
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:22,322
His BP is dropping.

292
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:23,922
Push the IV now.

293
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:33,082
- Ouch! - Professor?

294
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:37,263
I'm fine. Help him first.

295
00:21:57,874 --> 00:21:59,008
Doctor, here's the blood.

296
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:00,984
- Give it to me. - Here.

297
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:04,722
Hold him.

298
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,242
How does it look?

299
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,410
He's not coming back.

300
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,282
Come on.

301
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:33,802
He's coming back!

302
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,402
BP 92/61.

303
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:39,042
Prepare to move him.

304
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:02,067
(GMC Trauma Center)

305
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,802
Dr. Nick, this way, please.

306
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:11,682
His BP is dropping again.

307
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:13,962
Pleum, take this one for me.

308
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,242
Okay.

309
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:20,562
The rescuer said he has severe claustrophobia.

310
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:22,058
He was stuck in the lift for a long time.

311
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:23,642
He lost consciousness as he came in.

312
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,841
His vital signs are still normal.

313
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:27,202
We didn't find external injury.

314
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:29,642
Sir, can you hear me?

315
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,362
Okay. He looks normal. Wait and see how he feels.

316
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:36,882
Classify him as green for now.

317
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,361
Yes, Doctor.

318
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:45,242
(Number 3)

319
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,442
It's not your shift, isn't it?

320
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:53,953
If you hadn't gone in, you wouldn't have got hurt.

321
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,202
I was passing by.

322
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:59,576
It wouldn't feel right if I didn't help out.

323
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,042
Traffic Radio said they needed to clear the traffic.

324
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:04,882
I figured you'd be late.

325
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:06,562
Honestly?

326
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:09,042
Back there, I really thought

327
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,257
if the fireman had come to report a second later,

328
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:14,642
you would have rushed in to save the patient.

329
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,230
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

330
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:19,002
I'm not that kid, you know.

331
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:21,065
Kid?

332
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:28,722
You mean Shoan?

333
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:36,242
It's not a big deal. I think he was just following his instinct.

334
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:40,922
The instinct to save people is a good thing,

335
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,242
but he needs restraint as well.

336
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:45,682
Otherwise, he'd lead others into danger.

337
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,482
Yeah.

338
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:49,922
Cool speech.

339
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,682
Whose professor is this?

340
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,442
Let's go.

341
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,162
Green tag?

342
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:10,722
Why is he a green tag?

343
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:16,402
Oxygen?

344
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,282
Oxygen.

345
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:22,082
What's his oxygen level?

346
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:24,682
It was 100 ten minutes ago.

347
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:29,695
Blood? Carboxyhemoglobin? He needs a blood test.

348
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:50,082
This is not normal.

349
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:57,922
Doctor, he has unusually high carbon monoxide in his blood.

350
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:03,522
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

351
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,402
He needs oxygen.

352
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:07,362
He needs oxygen right now.

353
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,628
Wait, Doctor.

354
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,402
I think we need to ask the doctor who took him in.

355
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,202
Yes.

356
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,962
Dr. Pleum.

357
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:29,482
The patient has really high carboxyhemoglobin.

358
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:32,202
He needs oxygen within three hours,

359
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:33,402
or he will die.

360
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:35,882
We need to put him in a hyperbaric chamber now.

361
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:37,802
Is that okay?

362
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:42,842
An ER nurse said you took this case in.

363
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:44,955
I need your permission to proceed.

364
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,842
Dr. Prim said

365
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:48,602
we are a team.

366
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,538
Does the patient have any restrictions?

367
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,042
No.

368
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:01,762
His chest x-ray is normal. Take him in.

369
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,242
Shoan, wait.

370
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:09,162
Yes?

371
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,522
Nothing. Take him.

372
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:22,762
Hyperbaric is pressurized.

373
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:26,762
The patient is too weak to cooperate. He can't clear his own ear canals.

374
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:30,722
(ENT)

375
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:34,042
He needs a puncture. Wait a second.

376
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:36,442
Doctor?

377
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:44,962
Dr. Mummim's boyfriend?

378
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,602
Dr. Mummim's boyfriend?

379
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:50,362
I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, a resident surgeon.

380
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:52,282
I need your help.

381
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:58,122
The patient has carbon monoxide poisoning.

382
00:27:58,282 --> 00:28:00,722
He needs a high amount of oxygen

383
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:02,681
in a pressurized chamber.

384
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:04,562
He needs the hyperbaric chamber.

385
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,522
Who is this handsome doctor?

386
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,202
He's an ENT doctor.

387
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,104
The patient can't clear his own ear canals.

388
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,162
He needs a myringotomy.

389
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:19,202
Then proceed, Doctor.

390
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:20,642
Yes, Professor.

391
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:24,122
How did you know he needed a puncture?

392
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,722
He is unable to clear the pressure in his own ears.

393
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:29,442
Without a puncture, his eardrums might burst.

394
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:35,282
Your theoretical knowledge is sound, as Dr. Prapas said.

395
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:38,842
Have you reviewed the patient's history?

396
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,802
If so, sign this.

397
00:28:43,498 --> 00:28:45,202
This is a confirmation form.

398
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,522
His attending doctor needs to sign it.

399
00:28:48,802 --> 00:28:50,042
- But I... - Hey.

400
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,562
Won't you sign it?

401
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,722
Don't you want to treat him?

402
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:04,402
It's done, Professor.

403
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:16,402
That's all it takes.

404
00:29:16,602 --> 00:29:19,802
Now, change the IV set into a set for the chamber.

405
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:21,362
Put an infusion pump in him.

406
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,248
Em, where have you been?

407
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:30,282
I was helping Dr. Shoan with a patient named Kett.

408
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:31,882
We took him to the hyper room.

409
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:34,602
Hyperbaric? For this patient?

410
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,922
Do you like to watch these kind of things?

411
00:29:58,315 --> 00:30:01,402
In the meeting, you said you wanted to be a surgeon.

412
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:03,651
You wanted to save patients.

413
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:06,922
If you really become a surgeon,

414
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:08,882
what is the first thing you will do?

415
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:12,602
Operate on a patient to save them.

416
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:16,202
That's your job, of course.

417
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:18,482
I mean, what is your goal after that?

418
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,002
Become a professor?

419
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:23,522
Build your own clinic? Or further your study as a fellowship?

420
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:29,362
I want to operate on patients to save them.

421
00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:34,442
I'll change my question.

422
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:37,402
If you don't pass this trial

423
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:39,234
and make a mistake within these six months,

424
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,946
and you don't get to become a surgeon,

425
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:42,562
what would you do next?

426
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:46,242
I'll try again. I will become a surgeon.

427
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:51,417
Are you aiming for something out of your reach?

428
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:55,922
Perhaps there are things you can do better than surgery.

429
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:01,162
(Shoan.)

430
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:03,242
(Shoan!)

431
00:31:06,257 --> 00:31:08,257
Didn't you hear me?

432
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,024
Shoan? Dr. Shoan?

433
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,002
- (Shoan!) - Dr. Shoan?

434
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:15,282
Are you alright?

435
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,762
It's not out of reach.

436
00:31:16,968 --> 00:31:19,642
I have analyzed it. Being a surgeon

437
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:21,522
is not beyond my efforts.

438
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:24,842
Insisting

439
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:26,842
is not a quality of a good doctor.

440
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,842
So, in your opinion, qualities of a good doctor,

441
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,202
what are they?

442
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:50,002
The patient is responding to oxygen in the chamber.

443
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:53,402
His carbon level is dropping.

444
00:31:53,594 --> 00:31:55,162
He's opening his eyes.

445
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:01,393
Pleum, what's wrong?

446
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:07,362
Nothing.

447
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:09,722
I'm just thinking about some stuff.

448
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,282
Dr. Pleum.

449
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:18,162
Dr. Shoan took the patient named Kett into the hyperbaric chamber.

450
00:32:18,322 --> 00:32:20,802
- But he has... - What does he have?

451
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:22,842
He has...

452
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:27,042
Did Shoan ask you if it's okay to take him in?

453
00:32:28,643 --> 00:32:29,882
He didn't.

454
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:32,078
I think we need to ask the doctor who took him in.

455
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:34,842
Dr. Pleum, does the patient have any restrictions?

456
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,522
What restrictions does he have?

457
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:38,682
Nothing. Take him.

458
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,082
- The patient has claus... - Right!

459
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:44,202
He has claustrophobia!

460
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:49,042
If he wakes up now and realizes he's in a chamber, it's dangerous!

461
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:54,402
Where am I? What is this place?

462
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:00,482
Professor! The patient has claustrophobia.

463
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:02,122
What? You...

464
00:33:02,392 --> 00:33:05,129
Didn't you take his medical history? Don't you know he's claustrophobic?

465
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:06,482
Should we take him out?

466
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:07,832
You can't.

467
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:11,042
If you take him out of the chamber now, his lungs might rupture.

468
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:13,722
He's panicking. He might hold his breath.

469
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,954
If you suddenly depressurize him, his lungs will rupture.

470
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:17,162
We need to calm him down.

471
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:18,922
Get an anesthetist, quick!

472
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,322
Help! Help me! Get me out!

473
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:31,322
Shoan! I called for you.

474
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,672
Dad, stop.

475
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:35,002
- Who are you to order me around? - Let go!

476
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:36,534
I'm your father!

477
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:38,242
Listen to me. You must obey me!

478
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,922
- Don't cross the line with me! - Ouch!

479
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,082
Help me! Get me out!

480
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,362
(Shoan, keep your voice down.)

481
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:49,842
(If Dad hears you, he'll hit you again.)

482
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:51,922
(Close your eyes.)

483
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:55,602
(Count to three and tell me what color the oasis is.)

484
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,802
Help me! Get me out!

485
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:04,202
Get me out, please!

486
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,922
It's blue.

487
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:08,202
Calm your mind.

488
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:11,042
If you're worried or scared,

489
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:15,222
close your eyes slowly.

490
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,562
Count with me.

491
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,122
Slowly.

492
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,922
One.

493
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,082
Two.

494
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:28,762
Three.

495
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,682
Four.

496
00:34:31,476 --> 00:34:32,962
Five.

497
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,562
Blue.

498
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:39,682
Think of the color blue.

499
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,282
What do you think of when you see blue?

500
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:19,922
I can't let this go.

501
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:22,145
This is the second time.

502
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:23,608
What kind of a doctor are you?

503
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:27,402
You didn't ask him about any restrictions in treatment!

504
00:35:29,722 --> 00:35:31,202
I asked Dr. Pleum.

505
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,802
He said it was okay

506
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:34,602
and we could put him in there.

507
00:35:34,721 --> 00:35:36,042
I had to believe him

508
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:37,922
because we work as a team.

509
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:40,232
Are you blaming someone else?

510
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,922
Look. See for yourself.

511
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:45,373
You signed the confirmation form.

512
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,498
That signature. It's yours, isn't it?

513
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,579
The new kid won't survive this time.

514
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:51,482
Yeah. Let's go.

515
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:54,842
- Pleum, take this one for me. - Okay.

516
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,802
Phruek, take it easy.

517
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:07,762
Is there a better explanation, Shoan?

518
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,960
I asked Dr. Pleum.

519
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:16,082
I don't know what the board's decision will be.

520
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:19,282
Let's hope the director understands.

521
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:25,234
Hello.

522
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:28,962
Tomorrow's meeting?

523
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:33,002
What?

524
00:36:33,162 --> 00:36:34,842
Archawin said so?

525
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:39,282
Okay.

526
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:25,762
Hey, don't fly!

527
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,082
Please be quiet!

528
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:31,522
Shoan.

529
00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:35,322
- Shoan. Come in. - Yes?

530
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,402
- What's wrong? - Don't yell!

531
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:41,935
Are you afraid of cockroaches?

532
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,882
Okay, go then.

533
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:47,522
There. Take it out for me.

534
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,002
- Where? - There. Don't let it fly.

535
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:07,562
Bye-bye.

536
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:09,602
Good job.

537
00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:13,082
Thanks.

538
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:20,442
Are they cute?

539
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:23,762
When I was a kid,

540
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,469
I liked guppies.

541
00:38:26,907 --> 00:38:28,642
I used to live on a farm.

542
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:32,002
We had fish, birds, and hens.

543
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,922
We also had a lot of dogs.

544
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:36,122
That's why.

545
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:38,002
They're my pets. They're cute.

546
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:46,642
That's Professor Archawin.

547
00:38:52,272 --> 00:38:54,362
This photo was taken a long time ago.

548
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:00,023
Are you the same age as Professor Archawin?

549
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:05,722
Do I look that old?

550
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:10,002
This is me as a freshman.

551
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,202
See?

552
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,490
I was a freshie, young and cute.

553
00:39:15,793 --> 00:39:17,073
Yes.

554
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:33,162
Good morning. My name is Win, I'm a fourth-year resident.

555
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:35,922
- Good morning. - Morning.

556
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:41,122
I was assigned by Professor Paithoon to share my experience.

557
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:44,762
"Why do you want to be a doctor?"

558
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,762
This is a basic question, right?

559
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:51,322
I think there's a reason why

560
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:53,042
they ask this every year.

561
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:55,882
Some of you

562
00:39:57,217 --> 00:39:59,362
tell yourself you want to be a doctor because

563
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:00,842
your family are doctors.

564
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:02,402
Your parents are doctors, right?

565
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,442
Some of you might say

566
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,642
this is an honorable profession.

567
00:40:08,602 --> 00:40:09,842
You'll be respected

568
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,242
and earn a lot of money, right?

569
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:18,842
As a student, I rode taxis to school. Now I take buses to work.

570
00:40:19,256 --> 00:40:20,562
I haven't got rich.

571
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:24,522
Your answer will vary, but for me,

572
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I think my answer is simple.

573
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:32,082
I think my answer would be similar

574
00:40:32,402 --> 00:40:34,122
to a lot of yours here.

575
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:38,049
What if I ask you

576
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:41,802
why you want to be a doctor?

577
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:45,630
To save people.

578
00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:48,282
Right? You want to save lives.

579
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:50,482
It's like...

580
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:52,042
It feels easy.

581
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:55,002
Trust me, as time goes by,

582
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:57,882
you will forget this.

583
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:02,722
So I think what's important

584
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,562
is what we do

585
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:08,002
not to forget your answer to this

586
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,882
throughout your whole career as a doctor.

587
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,922
(Why do you want to be a doctor?)

588
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:37,882
- You forgot your fish. - Yeah.

589
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,042
Thanks.

590
00:41:40,242 --> 00:41:41,242
Mister.

591
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,482
- Yes? - Well...

592
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:49,122
What do you do so as not to forget your answer?

593
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,482
You won't.

594
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:59,322
When you get to work on a patient for real,

595
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,362
you will understand.

596
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:04,722
Okay.

597
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:07,962
See these?

598
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:11,882
They are gifts from a patient I treated.

599
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:15,882
You can have them.

600
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:17,722
- Raise them well. - Yes?

601
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:24,642
They will remind you of this conversation.

602
00:42:27,442 --> 00:42:29,362
Hello? Yes.

603
00:42:29,898 --> 00:42:31,362
I'm on my way.

604
00:43:03,555 --> 00:43:06,202
About today's patient,

605
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,522
did you forget to talk to the team again?

606
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,282
I didn't.

607
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:14,571
I did as you said,

608
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,122
but I still made a mistake.

609
00:43:19,642 --> 00:43:21,242
I'll go back to my room.

610
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,562
Thanks for your help.

611
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,322
Are you okay?

612
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:46,362
I'm fine.

613
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:48,682
I'm just tired.

614
00:43:50,203 --> 00:43:51,442
Oh yeah.

615
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:53,762
Let me ask you something.

616
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:58,082
- What? - Have you been asked to become a professor?

617
00:43:58,632 --> 00:43:59,802
No.

618
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,098
I don't want to be one.

619
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:05,202
Being a professor is hard.

620
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,282
I

621
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:13,882
Want to be a professor so bad.

622
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:17,722
My parents,

623
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:19,522
my siblings,

624
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:22,122
all of them are medical professors.

625
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:28,322
If I become different from my family,

626
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,562
would my parents still be proud of me?

627
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:41,642
They're proud anyway.

628
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:45,802
You passed your test.

629
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,362
They know how hard you work.

630
00:44:52,986 --> 00:44:55,962
Maybe they know I'm not that good.

631
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:58,122
That's why they expect nothing of me.

632
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:01,042
Pleum.

633
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:03,362
Your goals

634
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,682
are not to be reached today or tomorrow.

635
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,682
You're not even 30 yet.

636
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:13,802
There will be a lot more stress in your life.

637
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:18,585
You can have your expectations,

638
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:22,162
but don't do anything you would regret later.

639
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:34,042
Yes, Em. I'm heading out there.

640
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:36,642
Do your best!

641
00:45:42,624 --> 00:45:44,322
In his recent behaviors,

642
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,682
Dr. Shoan has already risked patients' lives twice.

643
00:45:50,836 --> 00:45:52,082
I think it's time

644
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:55,282
for us to proceed as agreed previously.

645
00:45:59,362 --> 00:46:01,042
This is my responsibility.

646
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:04,642
If Shoan is fired, I have to resign.

647
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:09,842
The board has decided.

648
00:46:10,922 --> 00:46:15,062
This hospital needs you no matter what.

649
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:18,122
I can't stay.

650
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:20,266
I have to keep my word.

651
00:46:23,274 --> 00:46:26,042
I think you should stop being stubborn and accept the truth.

652
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:29,402
Why do we have to lose a good human resource just because

653
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:32,202
you believe you can change autistic people?

654
00:46:32,906 --> 00:46:36,522
- Archawin? - I'm not saying autistic people aren't good.

655
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:39,003
He's capable. He's talented.

656
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:41,842
He has a good memory, perhaps better than all of us here.

657
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:45,082
What he lacks is decision-making.

658
00:46:45,591 --> 00:46:47,042
He can't make good judgment.

659
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,002
We can support him the way he is.

660
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,402
Don't force an autistic person to act normal.

661
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:55,482
What's wrong with being autistic?

662
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:59,921
You're the one who should change the rules you set for Kawee.

663
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:03,522
- Professor! - Why would you destroy an innocent man's dream?

664
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:06,311
This has nothing to do with Wee. Why would you bring that up?

665
00:47:06,392 --> 00:47:08,178
I have to take responsibility along with Shoan.

666
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:09,482
Professor!

667
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,882
Hey.

668
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:32,602
Where's everyone?

669
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:36,002
Mummim went home. She stayed back late last night.

670
00:47:36,257 --> 00:47:38,962
Shoan is in the meeting for yesterday's incident.

671
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,522
- Do you want to eat? - No, thanks.

672
00:47:49,761 --> 00:47:51,042
Yes, Em.

673
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,522
Dr. Prim.

674
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,002
Well...

675
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,002
I need to talk to you.

676
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:09,047
I am not lying.

677
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:12,162
Professor Prapas didn't take the patient into the hyperbaric chamber.

678
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:14,722
I took him in myself.

679
00:48:20,162 --> 00:48:21,664
Professor Prapas holds no responsibility.

680
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:25,122
Em confirms she was there when Shoan asked Pleum.

681
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,042
I think we should tell the professors.

682
00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:30,722
Tell them Pleum failed to describe the patient's condition.

683
00:48:31,024 --> 00:48:32,842
I'm not looking for a scapegoat, but

684
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:34,642
- I think there's something... - This is

685
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:37,251
- something we don't know. - No! This is not fair. Honestly.

686
00:48:40,242 --> 00:48:41,682
Hey, that's Pleum!

687
00:48:42,704 --> 00:48:45,722
Professor Prapas shouldn't take responsibility by resigning.

688
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:48,642
- I should be the one taking responsibility. - It's me!

689
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:50,562
I'll take responsibility myself.

690
00:49:00,153 --> 00:49:02,482
I didn't tell Shoan that the patient was claustrophobic.

691
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:06,602
I was confused and got the patients mixed up.

692
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:09,562
I alone have to take responsibility for this.

693
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:15,682
Shoan did nothing wrong.

694
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,370
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

695
00:49:25,273 --> 00:49:26,602
Let's just say this.

696
00:49:27,455 --> 00:49:32,202
We'll let the senior doctors discuss the solution.

697
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:34,242
Fine by me.

698
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:36,962
Apparently, this time,

699
00:49:37,094 --> 00:49:39,282
Shoan is not the only one at fault.

700
00:49:56,562 --> 00:49:57,922
By the way, Pleum,

701
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,602
I thought you were running away.

702
00:50:07,209 --> 00:50:08,882
I was blinded.

703
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:13,488
I wanted him to be wrong for once.

704
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:16,042
But I know

705
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:18,362
I took it too far.

706
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:20,922
Sorry.

707
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:32,042
There. That's the one you need to apologize to.

708
00:50:36,781 --> 00:50:39,282
- Yeah. Go on. Quick. - There.

709
00:50:40,395 --> 00:50:41,682
- Seriously? - Go!

710
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,642
Sorry.

711
00:51:02,243 --> 00:51:03,602
I was thoughtless.

712
00:51:06,218 --> 00:51:08,122
I didn't think it would be a big deal.

713
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:10,762
You don't like me

714
00:51:10,898 --> 00:51:12,682
because I speak the truth, right?

715
00:51:18,544 --> 00:51:20,242
Someone once told me

716
00:51:20,808 --> 00:51:22,808
that sometimes speaking the truth

717
00:51:23,065 --> 00:51:24,722
can hurt others.

718
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:29,882
If I had hurt you, I didn't mean to.

719
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:32,962
I'm sorry.

720
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:40,562
Why would you apologize?

721
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,882
I'm the one who should be ashamed.

722
00:51:43,095 --> 00:51:44,842
I couldn't face facts.

723
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:49,122
I thought someone else's mistake would make me look better.

724
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,922
I just want to be a good doctor.

725
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:20,922
Thanks.

726
00:52:43,545 --> 00:52:45,042
There's a fish up there.

727
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,482
What fish lives in the sky?

728
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:55,062
There!

729
00:52:59,562 --> 00:53:00,922
That cloud?

730
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,922
That's right. The cloud.

731
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:05,182
A fish is a fish.

732
00:53:05,634 --> 00:53:07,802
All fish don't have to be the same.

733
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,890
You and I are different,

734
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:17,162
but we are the same.

735
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:21,722
You want to be a doctor.

736
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:26,962
I want to be a doctor.

737
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:33,322
You're right.

738
00:53:40,257 --> 00:53:41,882
In the hyperbaric chamber,

739
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:44,802
I can't believe you worked it out so well.

740
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,102
That was cool.

741
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:34,402
Hello?

742
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:37,722
No one is fired yet.

743
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:53,082
This is no good.

744
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,321
This is no good.

745
00:54:55,402 --> 00:54:57,001
Shoan, keep your voice down.

746
00:54:57,082 --> 00:54:59,722
If Dad hears you, he'll hit you again.

747
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,557
This is no good.

748
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,282
Shoan. Shh.

749
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,584
You know what? Close your eyes.

750
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,057
Count to three and tell me what color the oasis is.

751
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:24,362
It's green. There are trees.

752
00:55:25,162 --> 00:55:26,442
There's water.

753
00:55:26,915 --> 00:55:30,122
Animals are drinking water. Bunny...

754
00:55:30,963 --> 00:55:32,562
You can't.

755
00:55:32,842 --> 00:55:36,122
Bunny, you can't be there.

756
00:55:36,275 --> 00:55:38,402
It can. Why not?

757
00:55:38,507 --> 00:55:41,482
Don't you remember? We even sent one to the moon.

758
00:55:41,778 --> 00:55:43,082
Let's try this.

759
00:55:46,282 --> 00:55:49,202
One, two, three.

760
00:55:49,298 --> 00:55:50,737
What does this look like?

761
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:53,882
- A bunny. - Yes.

762
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,122
A bunny can be anywhere, and a bunny means?

763
00:56:05,386 --> 00:56:08,122
A bunny means okay.

764
00:56:08,226 --> 00:56:10,602
That's right. Everything will be okay.

765
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:23,202
(Everything will be okay.)

766
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,762
(Everything will be okay.)

767
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,202
At the hospital, we have an autistic kid.

768
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:25,482
He joined as a resident.

769
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:27,482
Dr. Prapas brought him in.

770
00:57:27,755 --> 00:57:32,082
I think we can sit back and do nothing.

771
00:57:32,163 --> 00:57:34,442
Just wait until he makes a mistake.

772
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,953
If you can accelerate that

773
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,842
and make him fail earlier,

774
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,802
that would be good.

775
00:57:46,322 --> 00:57:49,002
This meal is on me.

776
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,122
All I ask you is this.

777
00:58:11,242 --> 00:58:13,601
If this operation fails...

778
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:16,081
The new heart is in place. Anastomosis is fine.

779
00:58:16,186 --> 00:58:18,922
- His BP is dropping fast. - Please let me go.

780
00:58:19,055 --> 00:58:21,202
I will do my best.

781
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:22,962
Twenty joules.

782
00:58:28,522 --> 00:58:30,522
- Hey! - Wait! Shoan is coming!

783
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:32,282
Come with me!

784
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,380
Shoan, don't ask anything now, please.

785
00:58:34,506 --> 00:58:37,762
I don't want to lie to others. I don't want to lie to myself either.
