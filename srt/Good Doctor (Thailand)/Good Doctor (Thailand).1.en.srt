30

My grandchild does too.

31
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,362
See? Like this one.

32
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:13,482
It's a shame.

33
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,362
Bunnies are jumpy.

34
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:17,762
In my house,

35
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,802
we have a few big dogs.

36
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,722
Our bunny got scared sick.

37
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:24,602
Bunnies are too soft, right?

38
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:29,510
Bunnies have heightened senses of hearing and smell.

39
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:30,842
They have surround-views.

40
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,387
That is why your bunny was constantly aware of your dog's movements.

41
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,602
That made it jumpy,

42
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:36,162
which led to its sickness.

43
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,042
Being soft is not an illness.

44
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,322
Is that right?

45
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,642
Who is that, by the way?

46

Is that you?

47
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,642
It's Shin. He's my brother.

48
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:56,682

53

It's dead. Why would you hold on to it? Lay it down.

54
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:45,322
Give it to me. If you can't, I will.

No.

Why would you hold on?

59
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,722
Shoan, it's dead. The rabbit can't play with you anymore.

60
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:03,562
If you hold on to it, it won't go to heaven.

61
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,362
- Can bunnies go to heaven? - Of course.

62

It will be up there, I'm sure.

65
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:18,882
I don't want it to go. I want it to stay.

Don't you remember what Dr. Prapas said? It doesn't go anywhere.

67

It's in here.

Are you doing a 24-hour fasting today?

My mom called, and she had been nagging

98
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,962
since noon. She just hung up. When could I have eaten?

99
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:43,162
Don't tell me your mom

100
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:45,402
knows you're going to Chiang Mai.

101
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:52,322
How do you know my mom knows?

102
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,562
Did you tell her?

103
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:01,242
I didn't. I look like a good boy,

104
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,242
but I never sell my friend's secrets

105
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:07,202

Are you really going?

109
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,762
You just got a job here.

110
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,899
You competed against hundreds.

111
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,002
In countryside hospitals,

112
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:26,682
it's difficult, you know?

00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:32,122
I know it's difficult, but...

114
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:36,962
You have a lot of good doctors here.

115
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,282

Dr. Prim, here are the details of your case.

121
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:54,082
Thank you.

122
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,459
- Of course. - Is it 1 pm already?

123
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:56,882
Yes, doctor.

124
00:11:58,313 --> 00:11:59,313
Thanks.

125
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,962
We have a lot of good doctors,

126
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,842
and we have a lot of patients as well.

127
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,802
- I'm out. - Yeah!

128
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:22,082
By the way, who told your mom about you going to Chiang Mai?

129
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,522
Is he autistic?

130
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,842
In my opinion, some things should remain fictional.

131
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:40,322
What do other professors think?

132
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:45,802
I understand that a resident doctor

133
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,482
is chosen by the head of the department.

134
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,042
I think, in this case,

135
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:54,362
it's going to affect the hospital's image.

136
00:12:56,217 --> 00:12:59,442
If you look at his entrance exam scores and grades,

137
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:01,602
he has always been on the top.

138
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:06,482
Also, a person with high-functioning autism can communicate.

139
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,402
If you say no to him now,

140
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,802
will it look like we have double standards?

141
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,162
This is why I need opinions from every department.

142
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:18,962
After all, we have a common future

143
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,842
in this hospital.

144
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:24,002
This doctor has received his education and training,

145
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:28,202
but the real thing is totally different.

146
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:33,802
What if he loses control in dangerous situations?

147
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:35,922
What do we do then?

148
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:39,842
If we see him as just a doctor

149
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:42,522
and don't look at what he has as an abnormality,

150
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:45,250
the fact that he had gone through what he went through

151
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:48,802
proves he's capable of controlling himself and the situation, right?

152
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,962
Everyone.

153
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:59,382
Our vision for this year in this hospital

154
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,202
is "equality," isn't it?

155
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,042
I think this is a chance

156
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,828
to make the vision that we made come true.

157
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,250
I agree with you on equal opportunities.

158
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,882
But as a doctor, you can't forget

159
00:14:13,513 --> 00:14:15,378
that you're responsible for your patient's life.

160
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,082
One thing is not more important than the other.

161
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,442
I understand that, Professor.

162
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,802
I've known this boy for almost 20 years.

163
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:28,762
I'm confident he's capable of being a resident here.

164
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,992
With that being said, you can be accused of nepotism.

165
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,099
Haven't they reached a decision yet? Yes or no?

166
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:35,882
Not yet.

167
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,104
- Dr. Prapas keeps insisting. - How can you be sure

168
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,522
that he understands

169
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:42,442
and controls himself like other doctors?

170
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:44,522
As the Assistant Head,

171
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,962
I'll share my opinion here.

172
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:48,929
In this day and age,

173
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,961
giving someone different an opportunity

174
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,682
is a social issue.

175
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:57,962
I believe many of you want to give this kid an opportunity.

176
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:00,474
However, we must not forget

177
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:02,762
that this opportunity we're about to give him

178
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:05,882
is about patients' lives and deaths.

179
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:07,682
This is a big deal.

180
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:10,802
I think we should make it clear

181
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:13,742
who is going to be responsible for this.

182
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:17,202
That's right. If a mistake happens,

183
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,042
who would be responsible?

184
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:33,755
(Soon, the temperature will increase, and this)

185
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:37,155
(will disappear as if it was an illusion.)

186
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:43,035
(In the summer, it occasionally rains in the Kalahari Desert.)

187
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,635
(These desert animals rely on their intelligence for survival.)

188
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:51,315
(They live here)

189
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,075
(as proof of life's mysteries)

190
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,203
(and wonders.)

191
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:59,675
Do you like it? Study hard, and I'll buy one for you when you grow up.

192
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,475
These kids! You're blocking my customers again! Go!

193
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:05,195
- Go away! - Let's go.

194
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,235
Yes.

195
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,115
Shoan has his limitations,

196
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,755
but I would like to ask all of you here.

197
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,795
Are you a perfect human in every way?

198
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,975
We all have made mistakes, right?

199
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,275
Shoan is just like all of us.

200
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:19,915
He tried so many times harder than we had to

201
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:22,435
for just this one opportunity.

202
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:26,675
This

203
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:30,955
is the opportunity, not just for Shoan or any kid.

204
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:33,602
It's an opportunity for us

205
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:37,355
to be better! To understand humans better!

206
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,955
(Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai)

207
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:12,795
So you want us to give this kid an opportunity, is that right?

208
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:15,955
That's right.

209
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,475
I object.

210
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:33,690
I think you shouldn't exploit your authority as head of department

211
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,435
to decide this on your own.

212
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:37,475
After all, every professor

213
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:41,435
in this hospital will have to help out this kid.

214
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,611
I think we should vote to decide.

215
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,195
I agree, but this meeting has gone on for hours.

216
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:52,675
We should take a break for now.

217
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,355
When we come back, we will vote.

218
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,555
Today, Dr. Shoan is coming in, right?

219
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:04,112
He is. He'll be here at two.

220
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:35,675
Hello? I'm stuck in traffic.

221
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,155
Five minutes. I got you your cold green tea.

222
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,795
The dolphins are swimming, see?

223
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,555
- Are you okay? - Pepper!

224
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:06,235
Pepper!

225
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:09,235
- Pepper! - Don't touch him!

226
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,795
He was struck in the neck by a piece of glass.

227
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:13,675
If we move him the wrong way,

228
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,555
he could be in danger.

229
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:18,435
- Has anyone called an ambulance? - I have.

230
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:21,022
I need a clean piece of cloth.

231
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,195
Do you have one? Okay, thanks.

232
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:27,875
- Pepper! - Will he be okay?

233
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,755
- Pepper! - Help him.

234
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:33,155
Pepper...

235
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,115
You can't. You're killing him.

236
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,595
What? I'm saving him!

237
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:56,275
He's a kid. Pressing in that spot will obstruct his windpipe.

238
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,315
No! Pepper!

239
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:19,435
Don't worry. An ambulance is coming. It will be here in 30 minutes.

240
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:20,918
No good.

241
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:23,395
Not enough time. It must be one trip.

242
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:24,850
What are you talking about?

243
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,332
With this type of wound,

244
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:30,355
one, we have 15 minutes to save his life.

245
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:33,515
Two, the patient can't be carried on multiple trips.

246
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:37,315
You need to drive this bus to the hospital now.

247
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,795
This will improve his chance of survival.

248
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:42,834
What did he say?

249
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:46,755
(Dr. Prapas)

250
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,955
The patient has neck vein engorgement. His mediastinum shifted sides.

251
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:14,515
It's probably tension pneumothorax.

252
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:16,155
What did you say?

253
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:17,635
Tension pneumothorax.

254
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,275
He has tension pneumothorax.

255
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,395
We need needle thoracentesis.

256
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:26,515
No, we need an ICD. Knife, alcohol, straw, bottle of water.

257
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:28,155
Do you have these things?

258
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:29,675
Do you have these things?

259
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:32,261
A straw? I have one.

260
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,475
Here's alcohol.

261
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:36,275
Thank you.

262
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:39,755
ICD. We need to do an ICD. Knife, please.

263
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:42,324
Knife. Does anyone have a blade?

264
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:44,595
- Here. - Thank you so much.

265
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,715
What are you doing?

266
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:07,955
We need to release air out of his pleural membrane.

267
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,675
Are you operating here?

268
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:13,475
Here. We need to do it here and now.

269
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:15,752
- You can't. - Wait.

270
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:17,915
What if something happens to him?

271
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,635
What happens?

272
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:22,294
Help him!

273
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:25,195
If he doesn't do anything, Pepper might die.

274
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,075
Bro, keep it steady and fast.

275
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:55,739
Bro?

276
00:23:57,252 --> 00:24:00,635
We can't take up too much of your time.

277
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:02,635
Let's vote right now.

278
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,795
When Dr. Shoan arrives, we'll tell him the results.

279
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:10,075
Pepper! Hang in there!

280
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:14,615
(This scene is filmed under professional supervision.)

281
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:17,490
(Please use your discretion.)

282
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:18,955
I need something to widen the gap.

283
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:22,275
Widen the gap? Pliers? Do you have pliers?

284
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:30,375
(This scene is filmed under professional supervision.)

285
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:33,383
(Please use your discretion.)

286
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:49,915
If any of you are in favor of accepting Dr. Shoan as a resident,

287
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,035
please raise your hand.

288
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:11,755
Is he safe now?

289
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,355
Where are you from, Doctor?

290
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:17,275
My name is Shoan.

291
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:20,947
Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai. I'm a surgeon at GMC Medical Center.

292
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:22,555
Thank you so much, Doctor.

293
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:25,195
- Thank you. - Thank you.

294
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:28,475
If any of you are not in favor,

295
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:30,035
please raise your hand.

296
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:46,675
The result is clear, Professor.

297
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,315
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:49,578 --> 00:25:53,675
Dr. Shoan will not be a resident here.

299
00:25:57,377 --> 00:25:59,391
Excuse me. Professor Archawin.

300
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:01,235
- There's an emergency case. - Yes.

301
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:03,835
Excuse me.

302
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:06,915
The patient has tension pneumothorax.

303
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:10,595
Professor Thawatchai, ER. Consultant needed. Dr. Prim is here.

304
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,355
How is he?

305
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,235
What's his condition?

306
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,555
- Well... - The patient is male, seven years old.

307
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,861
He was struck by pieces of glass in the neck and chest.

308
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:22,347
I have done an ICD on him.

309
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:24,875
He's still bleeding and discharging air through the ICD.

310
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:33,355
The EKG's amplitude is gradually dropping.

311
00:26:33,437 --> 00:26:36,275
It's not normal for this injury. He needs an Echo.

312
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:37,362
Is he a relative?

313
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:39,235
No, he performed first aid on the scene.

314
00:26:39,324 --> 00:26:40,715
He said he's a doctor here.

315
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:42,924
- I'll bring him outside. - Okay. I'll take it from here.

316
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:45,035
No. Stay out.

317
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:46,332
- An Echo! - You can't come in.

318
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,074
- An Echo! - You can't come in.

319
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:50,595
He needs an Echo! Please do the Echo!

320
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:53,555
An Echo.

321
00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:55,235
- Excuse me. - An Echo.

322
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:56,715
Please wait outside.

323
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:59,595
We have been told you claimed to be a doctor.

324
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:00,955
Please.

325
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:04,835
Please.

326
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:22,515
Tell the doctors.

327
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:23,675
He needs an Echo.

328
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,115
Otherwise, he dies.

329
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:26,675
He's going to die.

330
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:40,595
Who did the first aid?

331
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:47,955
Somrak said a person did it on the scene.

332
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:49,795
They're good.

333
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:53,435
They did an ICD, but he's still bleeding.

334
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:55,355
I think he has internal bleeding.

335
00:27:55,786 --> 00:27:56,955
Blade.

336
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,595
Rib retractor.

337
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,115
He does have internal bleeding.

338
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:11,235
We're going to stop the bleeding.

339
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:12,715
I need vascular forceps.

340
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:15,315
Professor, do we need an Echo?

341
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,515
Why do you think so?

342
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:19,595
The person who did the first aid

343
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,235
told me to do an Echo before we came in.

344
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:26,795
What do you think? Do you agree?

345
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:30,595
His heart rate is a bit fast, but his BP is stable.

346
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,395
We don't need the Echo yet.

347
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:35,635
Do you believe a stranger just because they said so, Prim?

348
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,315
I just think

349
00:28:39,408 --> 00:28:41,408
it won't hurt to check it out.

350
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:46,275
We will do it when there is a real necessity, right?

351
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:50,475
Right.

352
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:03,978
We've stopped the bleeding.

353
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,035
His BP is dropping fast.

354
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:21,643
The one who gave the first aid was right. Nick.

355
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,395
Prepare the Echocardiography.

356
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:25,692
- Yes, Professor. - Anesthetize him. Increase his volume.

357
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:26,915
Yes, Professor.

358
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:35,235
He's going to die.

359
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:46,275
(Samut Songkhram - 2003)

360
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:49,635
(Last week, Joke kicked the ball in here.)

361
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,035
(If you can get it out, )

362
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:53,955
(I'll play with your little bro. Do you dare?)

363
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:58,115
(This is nothing.)

364
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,635
(If I can get your ball, )

365
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:01,875
(promise to let my bro in.)

366
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:23,035
Shoan. I'll go and look upstairs. You stay down here.

367
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:24,395
Okay?

368
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:57,286
(He's going to die.)

369
00:31:58,071 --> 00:31:59,526
(He dies.)

370
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:31,903
His heart rate is normal now,

371
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:34,246
but his amplitude is dropping.

372
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,086
What if his pericardium

373
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,606
has excess liquid?

374
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:43,006
The patient

375
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:45,566
was struck in the neck.

376
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,717
A piece of the glass can enter his artery in the neck.

377
00:32:48,837 --> 00:32:51,806
It can get into his SVC,

378
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:55,726
resulting in a puncture in his vein,

379
00:32:56,423 --> 00:32:58,686
going into the back of his heart.

380
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:00,846
Is that possible?

381
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:07,326
- Nick, check his right atrium. - Yes, Professor.

382
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:33,086
Doctor.

383
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:35,606
The patient is stable now.

384
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:39,766
Thank you so much for saving my son's life. Thank you.

385
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,766
Actually, the person who performed the first aid

386
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:44,366
did a very good job.

387
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:46,566
Your son is lucky.

388
00:33:48,246 --> 00:33:50,846
Is he not a doctor here?

389
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:07,966
Bro.

390
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:09,798
Bro.

391
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,446
Tell me the truth.

392
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:17,046
Are you related to the patient? Are you cousins?

393
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:20,176
Why haven't you go home?

394
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:22,726
I'm a doctor. I want him to be saved.

395
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,766
Okay, you're a doctor.

396
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,445
Are you going to keep lying until the very end?

397
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:32,286
I'm not lying. I'm really a doctor.

398
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,646
So if you work here,

399
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:37,286
you have to tell me what your department is.

400
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:38,806
Because I know

401
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:41,246
all the doctors here, okay?

402
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:44,526
You're not a doctor here, right?

403
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:46,646
- Okay? - Doctor?

404
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,366
My son is safe. Thank you so much.

405
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:55,926
Without you, he wouldn't have made it.

406
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:57,366
Thank you.

407
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,246
Thank you so much.

408
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:07,446
It's too late.

409
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:16,006
- Thank you too. - Thank you so much.

410
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,726
You're welcome. I work here.

411
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:29,766
Good afternoon.

412
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:34,486
I'm here to see Professor Prapas Chewarattanakorn, the Head of Surgery.

413
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:40,326
Shoan.

414
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:48,270
What happened?

415
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,126
I am one hour, five minutes, and 35 seconds late

416
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,606
because of an accident.

417
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,686
I had to save the patient.

418
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,726
I'm ready to be interviewed now.

419
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,638
Shoan.

420
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,646
About that...

421
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:18,046
Why did they not accept me here?

422
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,646
It's okay.

423
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,006
If they don't accept you here, I'll find a job for you elsewhere.

424
00:36:26,748 --> 00:36:28,166
What did I do wrong?

425
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,366
You didn't do anything wrong, Shoan.

426
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:36,166
It's just how perplexing the hospital system is.

427
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:46,303
Shoan.

428
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:50,526
(The Medical Council of Thailand - Shoan Jatemeechai)

429
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,846
Shoan, you came a long way. Have you had lunch?

430
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,286
Let's get something at the cafeteria, shall we?

431
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,606
(A seven years old boy)

432
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:14,366
(has been saved in time.)

433
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:23,286
(This video is going viral. Everyone is talking about...)

434
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:29,286
Shoan.

435
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,006
Is that you?

436
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,417
(Today, at...)

437
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,526
I keep getting this video.

438
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:47,326
I've seen it many times.

439
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:51,206
I think he handled the situation pretty well.

440
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:53,886
We've been getting calls from the media.

441
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,526
I think we should give Dr. Shoan

442
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:58,646
a chance to present himself, at least, right?

443
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,406
He said in the video that he worked here.

444
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:04,486
Our hospital is now trending.

445
00:38:05,286 --> 00:38:08,126
We will not accept Dr. Shoan just because the people tell us to.

446
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:11,446
He will have to go through our standard procedure.

447
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:14,726
Please give Shoan a chance to explain

448
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,286
who he is and give his opinion on

449
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:20,406
things that will affect his future. That's all I ask.

450
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,750
So, is he here?

451
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,726
If he is, send him in.

452
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:18,046
Dr. Shoan.

453
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:21,206
Good afternoon.

454
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,286
I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, 26 years old.

455
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:26,326
I have high-functioning autism.

456
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,692
Today is my first day as a resident doctor

457
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:31,533
at GMC Medical Center.

458
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:40,126
Before you start working as a resident here,

459
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,726
we would like you to answer a few questions.

460
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:47,766
Why did you choose to work at this hospital?

461
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:50,086
Because this place gave me an opportunity.

462
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:54,526
That means if any place gives you an opportunity,

463
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:56,766
you will work there, is that right?

464
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,166
That's right.

465
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:04,606
You know that you have an abnormality,

466
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:07,646
which can present dangers to patients.

467
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:09,806
Why do you still want to be a doctor?

468
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:15,926
Reason number one.

469
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:20,406
My abnormality does not hinder my ability as a doctor.

470
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:21,612
I have my knowledge,

471
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:24,486
and I'm capable of treating patients with my knowledge.

472
00:40:27,086 --> 00:40:28,726
Reason number two.

473
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:38,486
The kid's name is Pepper.

474
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,126
He is like a dying man in a desert.

475
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:44,926
I want to be the oasis

476
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:48,380
that gives him a chance to keep growing up,

477
00:41:00,326 --> 00:41:02,206
unlike my older brother

478
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:06,686
and my bunny.

479
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:17,566
Therefore,

480
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,686
my reason number two is

481
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:24,886
I want to take this opportunity

482
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,526
to give dying lives a chance to survive.

483
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:33,166
That's why I want to be a doctor.

484
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:47,526
I would like

485
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,286
to ask you

486
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:51,086
to give him a chance.

487
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:56,726
Let him prove himself, and you can judge

488
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,126
if he can be a surgeon or not.

489
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:02,286
Actually, this is

490
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:04,806
us giving ourselves a chance

491
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,726
to show that we're capable of opening our minds

492
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,526
and accepting differences,

493
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,366
not seeing them as impairments.

494
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:22,166
And if,

495
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:24,246
in the next six months,

496
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:27,726
he

497
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:31,006
Causes trouble in a surgeon's line of work,

498
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:33,644
I, as the Head of Surgery,

499
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:36,326
will take responsibility

500
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:39,446
by resigning from my position.

501
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,006
Professor Prapas.

502
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,206
That is final.

503
00:42:52,224 --> 00:42:55,366
I'll ask all of you to cast your vote again.

504
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,286
In that case,

505
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,766
we will cast another vote.

506
00:43:11,444 --> 00:43:13,966
If you're in favor of accepting Dr. Shoan

507
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:16,486
as a resident doctor here,

508
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:19,166
raise your hand.

509
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:52,156
Congratulations, Dr. Shoan.

510
00:43:53,646 --> 00:43:57,526
You now have an opportunity for a resident trial.

511
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:01,366
Please do your job to the best of your abilities

512
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:03,366
for our hospital

513
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,956
and for all of your patients.

514
00:44:14,077 --> 00:44:16,886
From now on, just work hard like you always have.

515
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:20,046
Wait a second.

516
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:23,166
Dr. Win.

517
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:24,766
Yes, Professor.

518
00:44:25,406 --> 00:44:28,366
I'll leave Shoan in your care.

519
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,606
I think he can learn a lot from you.

520
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:36,446
You seem so confident in him.

521
00:44:39,767 --> 00:44:42,486
I understand what you're thinking.

522
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,566
Please see him as a normal guy.

523
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,726
No matter how much you trust him,

524
00:44:49,446 --> 00:44:51,366
I can't take your side in this matter.

525
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:54,166
But don't worry.

526
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:57,126
I'll watch him carefully.

527
00:44:57,246 --> 00:44:58,646
If he makes a mistake,

528
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:00,726
I can't let it go.

529
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:03,806
Excuse me.

530
00:45:40,957 --> 00:45:42,156
You're really here.

531
00:45:42,563 --> 00:45:43,836
Good evening.

532
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:46,836
How are you, Madam?

533
00:45:47,676 --> 00:45:49,876
You're impatient. What's wrong?

534
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:51,436
I am impatient.

535
00:45:52,004 --> 00:45:55,996
My daughter wants to waste her chance as a professor for the greater good.

536
00:45:56,396 --> 00:45:59,836
You can work as a professor for a while and move.

537
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,996
If I wait, I'll never go.

538
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,516
So, Professor Win told you?

539
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:11,916
- Was it him? - What would Dr. Win tell me?

540
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,556
I found out about it from my friend who works there as a nurse.

541
00:46:17,203 --> 00:46:20,156
Speaking of Dr. Win, how is he doing?

542
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:23,316
He seems well.

543
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,614
How can a doctor be so nice and handsome?

544
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:30,516
Why won't he ask my daughter out?

545
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:33,756
So you're okay with me going?

546
00:46:34,811 --> 00:46:35,996
Okay.

547
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:38,076
I am not.

548
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:40,556
I won't let you go, no matter what.

549
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,466
Sleep on it, please.

550
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:43,724
I won't.

551
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:45,876
- I won't. - I'll give you two days.

552
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:48,436
Is Dr. Prapas back in his dorm?

553
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,196
It's been vacant for a while.

554
00:46:51,229 --> 00:46:52,596
I don't think it's him.

555
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:55,356
It could be a ghost.

556
00:46:57,303 --> 00:47:00,023
- I'm serious. - What kind of a doctor are you to think of ghosts?

557
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:02,236
It's more likely a burglar.

558
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,556
A burglar?

559
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:09,836
Mom.

560
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,596
Mom, stay here and call the cops.

561
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:16,556
If anything happens, scream as loud as you can, okay?

562
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:19,116
What's the number for the police?

563
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,676
It's 191, Mom.

564
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:39,076
When we need them, we can never reach them!

565
00:47:39,212 --> 00:47:40,965
Try Dr. Prapas, then!

566
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:42,699
Where is he on your contact list?

567
00:47:42,795 --> 00:47:44,756
How would I know? Come on, Mom!

568
00:47:44,837 --> 00:47:46,236
What's going on?

569
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:50,516
Prim, why are you sitting on top of Dr. Shoan?

570
00:47:56,385 --> 00:47:57,716
Is he a doctor?

571
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:00,732
Yeah.

572
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:05,316
Sorry.

573
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:13,276
That was close. We're lucky that the new doctor didn't press charges.

574
00:48:13,836 --> 00:48:15,836
You said he was a burglar.

575
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:18,556
I had to get serious, right?

576
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:23,956
By the way, that doctor looks kind of cute, right?

577
00:48:24,878 --> 00:48:27,516
Stop it. All you talk about is men.

578
00:48:31,372 --> 00:48:33,476
Just choose someone already.

579
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,596
If you stay single til you hit your 30s,

580
00:48:36,676 --> 00:48:38,676
don't ask me for help.

581
00:48:39,036 --> 00:48:41,076
Oh! Your taxi's here.

582
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:43,796
Just go already, Mom.

583
00:48:46,363 --> 00:48:47,716
Love you.

584
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:02,316
Are you going home, Professor?

585
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:03,612
Good night.

586
00:49:04,594 --> 00:49:06,116
I'm sorry about just now.

587
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,356
Mom and I heard something in your room, and we...

588
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,236
We thought it was something serious.

589
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:12,496
It's okay.

590
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:14,956
You're just being a good neighbor.

591
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,876
Please take care of Dr. Shoan for me.

592
00:49:20,139 --> 00:49:22,436
He needs to adapt more than others.

593
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:25,796
He might seem strange at times, but he's fine.

594
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,836
- Alright. - I heard you're moving to Chiang Mai.

595
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:32,196
Have you decided?

596
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:35,315
I have been thinking about this for a long time.

597
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:39,276
I just kept asking for opinions, and I

598
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:42,116
delayed everything. That's all.

599
00:49:42,236 --> 00:49:45,796
I'm sure of it now, though. I'm going.

600
00:49:46,035 --> 00:49:48,696
If you're sure about it, I won't stop you.

601
00:49:49,378 --> 00:49:50,747
And I'm sure

602
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:53,596
you will be important to patients in Chiang Mai.

603
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:55,396
Thank you.

604
00:49:55,477 --> 00:50:00,756
It's a shame our patients are losing a caring doctor like yourself.

605
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:03,276
That's all.

606
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,196
I'm sorry.

607
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:03,316
It was a misunderstanding.

608
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,676
Forgive me.

609
00:51:11,223 --> 00:51:12,436
Did it hurt?

610
00:51:19,347 --> 00:51:22,036
You're Shoan, right?

611
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:27,156
My name is Prim. I'm a fourth-year resident.

612
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:32,075
Good evening. My name is Shoan Jatemeechai. I'm hurting and unpacking.

613
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:33,491
You can leave.

614
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:40,747
What's that?

615
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:47,276
About Chiang Mai, if you want,

616
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:48,636
you can go.

617
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,956
Hey, did you just tell me to go away?

618
00:51:55,525 --> 00:51:56,596
I didn't.

619
00:51:56,796 --> 00:52:00,756
It's a good thing. If you want to, you should follow your heart.

620
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,156
He sure is strange.

621
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:26,139
Who would want you on the team if you're sloppy?

622
00:53:26,305 --> 00:53:28,436
I really did my best.

623
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:30,756
Are you arguing? I'm your senior.

624
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,676
You have to obey my order.

625
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:36,450
You fired back at them and ran alone, so we all got killed.

626
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:39,716
I'm calling for a vote to ban you from the team. From now on,

627
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,316
you have no place here!

628
00:53:41,476 --> 00:53:42,716
Pleum.

629
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:44,276
I'm the senior.

630
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,396
Are you too obsessed with this game?

631
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:48,436
Let me get some kills too.

632
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:52,276
Well, sorry. I got too caught up.

633
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,796
Yes! I got it!

634
00:53:57,676 --> 00:54:00,276
Portable multifunction showerhead from Korea.

635
00:54:00,459 --> 00:54:02,596
It sprays collagen with Vitamin C.

636
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:05,996
For 390 baht. It's 50% off.

637
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:08,236
It was worth the wait for a big sale.

638
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,476
Why would you need a portable showerhead?

639
00:54:17,396 --> 00:54:19,676
I don't know. Let's play our game.

640
00:54:25,685 --> 00:54:26,956
It's work time!

641
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:33,236
Mummim, you always have time to shop.

642
00:54:33,596 --> 00:54:37,036
Every minute counts. We don't have much free time.

643
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,596
When we round the ward, we'll have no time to play.

644
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,156
By the way, Prim is not here yet?

645
00:54:49,705 --> 00:54:51,484
The professor assigned her to bring the new kid in.

646
00:54:51,508 --> 00:54:52,676
New kid?

647
00:54:53,396 --> 00:54:54,756
Do we have an intern?

648
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:57,356
No, it's a resident.

649
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,636
We hire residents this time of year?

650
00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:04,116
Is it the Nepo baby I heard of?

651
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:05,693
Nepo? Of whose?

652
00:55:05,774 --> 00:55:07,556
Of Professor Prapas, of course!

653
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:10,316
- That's big. - Hey.

654
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,617
Don't talk too loud.

655
00:55:11,697 --> 00:55:14,137
If he's not the real deal, Professor Win's going to kill him.

656
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:16,315
- Whoa! - You're right.

657
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:19,836
This room is the loudest in the hospital!

658
00:55:27,816 --> 00:55:30,183
Our new resident, his name is...

659
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:33,676
Good morning. I'm Dr. Shoan Jatemeechai, 26 years old.

660
00:55:33,805 --> 00:55:36,396
I'm a first-year resident. I have autism.

661
00:55:36,495 --> 00:55:39,722
I like bunnies. I like to look at the moon, and I like drawing.

662
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,323
I can watch TV for hours.

663
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:44,556
My strength is I have a 20/20 vision.

664
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:45,769
Nice to meet you all.

665
00:55:45,906 --> 00:55:49,596
Good morning. I'm Dr. Panthep Chokeswate, a fourth-year resident. My str...

666
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,676
Hey.

667
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,516
I was diagnosed with high-functioning autism.

668
00:55:57,818 --> 00:55:59,716
I might be socially awkward,

669
00:56:00,688 --> 00:56:02,516
but I want to be friends with everyone.

670
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:07,956
Okay, this is Nick, a fourth-year resident.

671
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:10,282
That's Pleum, a third-year resident,

672
00:56:10,362 --> 00:56:11,932
and this is Mummim, a first-year resident.

673
00:56:11,956 --> 00:56:15,156
Let's get to know each other. We'll work together for a long time.

674
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:17,756
- Okay? - Okay.

675
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:27,276
Hello?

676
00:56:28,548 --> 00:56:31,036
Yes. The OR, right? We'll be right there.

677
00:56:31,132 --> 00:56:32,483
Let's go. We have an emergency.

678
00:57:51,577 --> 00:57:54,297
I don't allow you to go in.

679
00:57:55,836 --> 00:57:57,276
Wait outside.

680
00:58:02,394 --> 00:58:03,396
Go!

681
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:47,196
It's been four or five months.

682
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,116
The cancer hasn't gone down a bit.

683
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:51,556
This hospital sucks, Dad.

684
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:54,595
We have a problem!

685
00:58:54,716 --> 00:58:56,079
Gallstone pancreatitis.

686
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,596
Doctor, you're crazy!

687
00:58:57,677 --> 00:58:59,642
- Move! - Don't bother me now!

688
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:02,079
I will never allow a doctor in your condition

689
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,516
to operate on a patient. Do you understand?
