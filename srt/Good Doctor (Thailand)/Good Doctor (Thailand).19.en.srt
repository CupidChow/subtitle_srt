1
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:18,122
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:10,882
Shoan.

3
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:14,362
Stop being upset with Professor Win already.

4
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:17,322
At this rate, how can you operate on him?

5
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,565
Like it or not, I have to do it.

6
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,882
The cancer has grown that big.

7
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,722
He must have felt something.

8
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,562
How can he be completely unaware?

9
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:32,802
You see.

10
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:36,922
This is a common mistake for us doctors.

11
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,082
We like to think that

12
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:41,762
we know about illnesses more than anyone.

13
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:44,922
That's why we get careless. That's the mistake.

14
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,202
Think about this.

15
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,882
You've made a mistake.

16
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:10,322
If all you do is reminisce on that mistake

17
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:12,082
without trying to fix it,

18
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,282
that mistake will remain a mistake.

19
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,482
But if you do something about it,

20
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,842
that mistake becomes a lesson.

21
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,091
You won't make the same mistake again.

22
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:33,202
We will fix it together by saving Professor Win.

23
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:42,722
(Prapas: Win, Shoan is okay now.)

24
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:45,322
That kid sure gets upset easily.

25
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:51,762
I agree with Shoan on this, though.

26
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,082
This is your husband here.

27
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:58,282
Yeah, Mr. Husband.

28
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:00,035
Take your medicine now.

29
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,636
(Episode 19: Unstable)

30
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:45,882
Thank you.

31
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,802
Everyone is just as shocked.

32
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,122
We'll just

33
00:04:57,802 --> 00:04:59,642
do what we do best.

34
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,402
What is that?

35
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:05,042
Here.

36
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,802
Study it.

37
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,442
Let's start studying tonight.

38
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:17,242
Okay.

39
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,482
Are you really okay?

40
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,442
Show me some enthusiasm.

41
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:26,962
I'm okay.

42
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:33,722
Smile.

43
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,162
Yeah. That's all I need.

44
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:41,922
- Can I go in? - Okay. Come on.

45
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:57,769
(Examination: Dr. Archawin Akephaiboon)

46
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:10,122
Come in.

47
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,322
What's with you guys?

48
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,722
Don't you have to see your patients?

49
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,802
We just want to see how our respected professor is doing.

50
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,402
Not only do we respect you,

51
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,042
but we also love you.

52
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:30,242
If we were on duty, I would have given you punishment for abandoning work.

53
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,042
You just left your patients?

54
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,962
He's as harsh as ever.

55
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,208
Do you need any help moving?

56
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,082
Let Pleum help you.

57
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,793
- Okay. You can take this. - Yes, Professor.

58
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:45,002
What's in that box?

59
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,882
Gifts and letters I got from my patients.

60
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:52,602
It's normal when you've worked for over a decade.

61
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,722
You've got a lot of those.

62
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,882
I'll take the box to your car.

63
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:58,962
See you downstairs.

64
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,162
Go back to your patients too.

65
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:03,642
All of you doctors.

66
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:06,980
If you don't, I'll deduct your points.

67
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,922
You're really taking a break.

68
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,874
I'm a patient now.

69
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,962
You'll still see me, though.

70
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,722
You'll be visiting me in recovery.

71
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,042
You won't avoid me this time, right?

72
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:38,122
I won't.

73
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,402
I have a question.

74
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,002
What is it?

75
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,322
Why does it have to be me?

76
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,002
Why did you want me in the OR?

77
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,882
Cases like mine

78
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,122
are interesting, right?

79
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:57,002
You don't see one of these cases often.

80
00:07:57,882 --> 00:07:59,562
Think of it as if

81
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,362
I'm still your professor.

82
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,862
I just won't be standing there to guide you. That's all.

83
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:08,762
Hey, Shoan.

84
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,522
I'm not asking you

85
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:15,265
to take my life in your hands.

86
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:20,842
Other professors will be attending this operation.

87
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:23,882
You're just there to observe.

88
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:30,222
Professor.

89
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:32,202
I read on the internet that

90
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:36,322
don't show your support by saying "keep fighting."

91
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:39,642
It will make them feel worse.

92
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,802
What should I say then?

93
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:46,521
So...

94
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,042
Has anyone said that to you?

95
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,257
Yes.

96
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:55,402
Did you feel upset, angry, or sad?

97
00:08:57,714 --> 00:08:58,802
I didn't.

98
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,362
Did you feel better then?

99
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:03,922
I felt

100
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,082
better, yes.

101
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:08,562
That's just how it is. Let's go.

102
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,242
Professor.

103
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,442
Are we ever going to leave tonight?

104
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,522
Keep fighting.

105
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:31,802
Of course, Dr. Shoan.

106
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,522
Oh, hey. Is everything alright?

107
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,922
It's alright.

108
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,082
That doctor said I'm outstanding among the first-year residents.

109
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:51,397
Really?

110
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:07,922
Don't listen to them. Let's go.

111
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:10,682
We have a lot to do, quickly.

112
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:19,402
(Examination: Ultrasound)

113
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,762
We'll find out the gender today.

114
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:25,562
See? It's obvious between his legs.

115
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,482
It's sticking out. He's a boy all right.

116
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:32,402
Is he healthy?

117
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:35,402
From the results, his weight is normal.

118
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,122
The level of amniotic fluid is good.

119
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:39,242
Let's see his fingers.

120
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:42,162
We can clearly see his fingers.

121
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,202
He's putting two fingers up.

122
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,722
He's telling his dad to keep fighting.

123
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,722
Let's listen to his heartbeat one more time.

124
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:06,722
His heart rate is within normal range.

125
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:09,322
It's consistent and clear.

126
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,082
Win, can we stop by the doctors' lounge and get my vitamin from Rin?

127
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:54,122
This morning, Rin had a patient, so she left it there.

128
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:55,882
Of course.

129
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:04,322
Win, you can go on ahead. I need to make a call.

130
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,922
- Welcome, Professor! - Yeah!

131
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:20,082
Now that you're here, please come to Examination Room 3.

132
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:23,922
You have 15 patients waiting for you.

133
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,682
- What? - You're working til midnight.

134
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,603
- It's work non-stop. - You guys are making this a big deal.

135
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,642
Professors are in on this too?

136
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:38,942
Look at these. Pizzas, fried chicken, and stuff.

137
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,602
This party's on me!

138
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:42,922
Yay!

139
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,562
- Go and sit down! - Professor.

140
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,522
Here you go.

141
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:51,362
Professor, today you'll see how we eat.

142
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:53,602
Nick.

143
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,469
You sound like you're asking for trouble.

144
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:58,762
It's okay.

145
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:01,642
You look way more lively today, Professor.

146
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,142
Last night was probably the first time in 20 years

147
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:06,642
I had eight hours of sleep.

148
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,282
- That long? - I'm jealous,

149
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:11,642
but I won't wait that long.

150
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:14,282
So how did it go? Do you have a date for your operation?

151
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,602
Yeah. In seven days.

152
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,882
- Exactly one week. - That soon?

153
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,042
I don't know if the surgeon's assistant is ready though.

154
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:22,562
I am ready.

155
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:25,642
Are you really? Do you have any questions?

156
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,713
- Can I ask? I do. I have a lot... - Hey!

157
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:30,082
- Not now. - What?

158
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:33,202
Do you need to ask right now?

159
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:36,842
Professor, I need your help on something. I'll send you the link.

160
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,482
By the way, is your little one a boy or a girl?

161
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,432
- It's a boy. Trust me. - Really? Why?

162
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:49,402
- The three-eyed god guided him. - Yay!

163
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:51,322
- How's that? - Yeah. With his third eye.

164
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:53,459
- I think it's a boy. - How did it turn out?

165
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,602
How did it go?

166
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,362
- Yeah. That's more like it. - I'm full.

167
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:36,322
(Ward 5)

168
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,082
Good morning.

169
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:47,122
- Good morning, Doctors. - You're having fun? You're fine now.

170
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:49,042
- So am I going home? - Yeah, let's go.

171
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,082
- Let's go! - For real?

172
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:54,362
Okay, Dr. Shoan. You may begin.

173
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,002
The patient is male, 15 years old,

174
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:58,620
with end-stage renal disease.

175
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,917
He has been receiving treatment for terminal kidney disease for four years.

176
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,322
Attached to him on the right neck is a permanent catheter.

177
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,762
Today is his second day in.

178
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:08,682
His latest condition is no fever and regular level pulse.

179
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,769
- Let me see your wound. - Of course.

180
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:21,522
No blood leaking through. No hematoma.

181
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,482
Okay.

182
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Is your sister not here today?

183
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:32,562
Paan is working the morning shift. She's coming in the afternoon.

184
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:36,842
Okay. It's nothing. I just want her to be here to listen.

185
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,722
When she comes in, please tell her

186
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:43,602
to go and see Professor Benz.

187
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:45,282
- Okay. - Okay.

188
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:50,862
Also, be careful of your wounds. Don't let it get wet. Don't let it off.

189
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,842
It's too much. Can I show Paan a recording instead?

190
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:58,082
- Of course. - We can.

191
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,162
Do you seriously believe that?

192
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:01,762
I was kidding.

193
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:04,892
What a jokester!

194
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:08,442
I'm afraid you'd get stressed. You're seeing a lot of us.

195
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,591
- Okay. - I don't want you tired.

196
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,162
Thank you.

197
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:16,042
Get some rest, and don't forget to tell Paan.

198
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:18,066
- Right. - Goodbye. Come on.

199
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,362
Goodbye.

200
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,602
- Did you just get off work? - Yeah.

201
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,202
Give me the file.

202
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,602
I want to inform you about Pek's condition.

203
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,642
His latest EKG results came back.

204
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:34,922
I

205
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,682
Took a look at that.

206
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,876
His heart seems to have got bigger.

207
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,122
He also seems to have a problem with his heart's contractions.

208
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:43,602
It causes

209
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:47,215
pulmonary hypertension.

210
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:51,402
He also has a leakage in the right side of his heart.

211
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,282
Right now, he

212
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:56,562
needs to stay in the hospital. His BP dropped while receiving dialysis.

213
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,442
He may have to get more frequent dialysis.

214
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:03,202
He might have to stay until his bloodwork is normal.

215
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,762
So he got a lot worse, right?

216
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,962
Honestly,

217
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:13,442
the best course of treatment right now is probably a kidney transplant.

218
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,162
But as you know,

219
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:20,842
he will have to wait for the right donor. And there's a waiting list.

220
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,762
Doctor, so...

221
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,882
What if...

222
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:39,074
(Prim: Professor.)

223
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:43,842
(Prim: This is the link that I need your help with.)

224
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:51,722
(My mom said that besides Dr. Shoan, )

225
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:54,162
(you were the one who saved me.)

226
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:59,082
(Dr. Shoan said you're sick and you need support, right?)

227
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:01,682
(I hope your surgery)

228
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,842
(- is a success. Keep fighting. - Hi, Doctor.)

229
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,842
(Since you operated on me, )

230
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,762
(I've been in much better health.)

231
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:15,082
(I pray that the powers that be bless you.)

232
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:18,282
(I hope your recovery will go well like mine.)

233
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:20,282
(I hope your merit from having)

234
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,322
(saved me and many others)

235
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:28,042
(will return to you by saving you too.)

236
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,605
(Doctor, get well soon.)

237
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:33,042
(Konmek and I are rooting for you!)

238
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:37,442
(I really want to let you know that the doctors)

239
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:40,402
(inspire me to work in a field where I can save people.)

240
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:46,362
(I'm not smart enough to be a doctor, )

241
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,282
(but I'll study as a nurse.)

242
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:53,242
(Please stay with me and support me one more time.)

243
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:56,162
(I'll be supporting you too.)

244
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,482
(I hope everything goes well.)

245
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,549
(Thank you for saving me and allow me to continue being with my daughter.)

246
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,202
(I wish you the best and forever happiness.)

247
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:41,842
(Burmese Text)

248
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,111
(Burmese Text)

249
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:44,722
(Burmese Text)

250
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:07,842
What are you doing, Win? Why are you not in bed?

251
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:13,642
Win?

252
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,042
Win? What's wrong, Win?

253
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:18,482
(Nurse Counter)

254
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:23,602
Professor Win is sleeping.

255
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,402
Thank you.

256
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,802
Let's come back tomorrow after training.

257
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,442
We'll be back.

258
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:37,682
Come on.

259
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:04,402
Shoan, this is Professor Benz. He will oversee your training.

260
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:06,442
If you have any questions,

261
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,042
please ask Professor Benz.

262
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,202
I heard you went through this course with Win before.

263
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:13,242
Let's try that again today.

264
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:17,666
- Of course. - Okay, Shoan. You may begin.

265
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:28,178
Retroperitoneal sarcoma.

266
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,522
This is your punishment.

267
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,682
Look carefully.

268
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:40,802
See what structure the tumor is on, and if it can be removed or not.

269
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,802
Mobilize, En bloc.

270
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:56,442
BP drops.

271
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:03,122
Push IV. Find out why. Find the bleeding.

272
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:09,362
Bleeding stopped.

273
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,242
Proceed.

274
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,322
Shoan, what do you think happened?

275
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:40,362
I'm trying to remove the tumor from IVC,

276
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:42,322
but I can't.

277
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,162
That's right. You have to remove the lump of tumor from IVC,

278
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,602
without bursting the lump and damaging IVC.

279
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:52,842
Let's try again.

280
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:54,522
Yes.

281
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:59,402
Remove it without bursting and damaging IVC.

282
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,530
Remove it without bursting

283
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,162
and without damaging IVC.

284
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,002
Remove it without bursting

285
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:08,462
and without damaging IVC.

286
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:22,442
Try again.

287
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,162
Without bursting and damaging IVC.

288
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:34,122
Why can't I do this?

289
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:38,122
It's not successful.

290
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,722
Remove it without bursting

291
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:44,322
and without damaging IVC.

292
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:56,082
I can't do this.

293
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,202
Why can't I do this?

294
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,602
Shoan, that's all for today.

295
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:07,562
Let's continue tomorrow.

296
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:11,282
Thank you anyway, Professor Benz.

297
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:12,682
You're welcome.

298
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:15,802
If the assistant understands the procedure,

299
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,522
he will be a big help in the real OR.

300
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:22,322
Anyway, I'll have to take my leave for today.

301
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:24,042
Goodbye, Professor.

302
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:46,802
Well, Shoan. Sometimes,

303
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:49,562
you don't have to pressure yourself too much.

304
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:53,042
You don't have to complete it in one day.

305
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:56,305
I have done it once.

306
00:24:57,074 --> 00:24:59,162
Why couldn't I do it today?

307
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:04,002
Two reasons. One, this is not a simulation.

308
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:08,282
Two, the patient is a real person that you know and care about.

309
00:25:09,113 --> 00:25:11,682
I'm not saying doctors can't have feelings.

310
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:14,722
We just have to

311
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:19,322
learn to control our feelings.

312
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:24,762
Control our feelings.

313
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:30,242
I will succeed tomorrow.

314
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,802
Win?

315
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:00,522
Win.

316
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:02,122
Win, are you in pain?

317
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:03,802
Would you like some medicine?

318
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:06,362
I think it's time for your medicine.

319
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:08,042
It's fine.

320
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:15,602
I'm in pain, but

321
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:17,442
it's bearable.

322
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,042
Are you sure?

323
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,442
They just went straight through.

324
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,642
That's disgusting.

325
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,202
You can come in.

326
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:53,693
- Good morning. - Good morning.

327
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,002
Good morning.

328
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:57,202
This is for the patient's family.

329
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:58,442
Thank you so much.

330
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:02,322
I just brought it here. Aunt Yen, Shoan's mom made it.

331
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:06,042
My mom said if you would like anything, you can tell her.

332
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,282
Please say thank you to your mom. I was about to order some delivery.

333
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:11,762
- Make yourselves at home. - Thanks.

334
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:13,922
How are you feeling?

335
00:27:14,106 --> 00:27:15,642
I'm okay. This is nothing.

336
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,642
- Are you really? - It's nothing.

337
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:21,042
Of course. Don't worry.

338
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:26,162
Didn't you sleep?

339
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:29,562
You look like someone who couldn't sleep.

340
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,882
I did. I slept normally, Shoan.

341
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:36,522
Don't stare too much.

342
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:44,882
Do you have to watch cartoons to relieve your stress?

343
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:47,402
No, it's not to relieve stress.

344
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:49,809
I'm watching it with my kid.

345
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,402
Okay, okay.

346
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:54,762
Professor, I'm doing so badly.

347
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,322
My simulation training is going very badly.

348
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,966
Oh? You were doing fine before this?

349
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:04,162
Why is it? Sit down.

350
00:28:04,522 --> 00:28:05,922
Let's talk. Come on.

351
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:13,242
I did way worse in training with Professor Prapas.

352
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:16,910
I scored 95% with you,

353
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:20,482
but last time, it was down to 80.

354
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:24,042
- I made so many mistakes. I... - How did those mistakes happen?

355
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:27,308
I felt like I couldn't focus.

356
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:29,482
Why couldn't you focus then?

357
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,802
You're scary.

358
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:37,322
You're making this face again.

359
00:28:37,937 --> 00:28:40,682
Then remember this face of mine,

360
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:44,482
- so you can do better in there. - Professor, your BP might be rising.

361
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,242
You're going to faint again.

362
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:51,722
I need to go to work.

363
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,362
- Good. - I'll be back. - Me too.

364
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:55,682
No.

365
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:59,362
Attend your training and focus on it, understood?

366
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:04,562
Understood, but I have time before training. I'll be here for five minutes.

367
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:09,042
Don't get stressed. Watch your BP, okay?

368
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,362
Okay. Let's go.

369
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:12,202
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

370
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:23,287
(Five days before the operation)

371
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,481
Are you ready for your operation, Professor?

372
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:28,002
You both did really well.

373
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:36,002
He's here again.

374
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:54,017
Mom asked me to bring her to you.

375
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,197
These foods are for Mrs. Maysa.

376
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:01,202
- It's good for your pregnancy. - Thank you.

377
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:03,634
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

378
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,242
How are you feeling, Professor?

379
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:08,642
Are you going to ask that every day?

380
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:21,842
(Four days before the operation)

381
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:24,002
He never listens.

382
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:25,722
Guys.

383
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:27,202
If you have a chance,

384
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:28,962
give your daughter-in-law a warning.

385
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:31,818
She has bought enough stuff to last until the kid is seven years old.

386
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:34,442
That's not true, Win. It'd just be enough until he's five.

387
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,042
- Five years old? - Yeah.

388
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:38,642
I bought these myself.

389
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:40,851
I'm not looking forward to seeing the baby, right?

390
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,082
(Three days before the operation)

391
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:47,402
If you have time, read these two. They're page-turners.

392
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:52,082
I have to go though. ER called me twice.

393
00:30:57,084 --> 00:31:00,962
I heard you have another regular visitor other than Maysa.

394
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,482
Yes, Professor.

395
00:31:03,752 --> 00:31:08,362
He comes so often that I'm afraid other patients would sue him.

396
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:18,882
You're going into surgery in three days.

397
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:21,682
Is there still anything you're worried about?

398
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,642
It's not like I'm worried.

399
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,099
When...

400
00:31:37,992 --> 00:31:41,922
When you get sick as a doctor, you can imagine a lot of things.

401
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,122
That's right.

402
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:52,562
Okay, you might be nervous, in pain, and hurt.

403
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:56,482
It's normal.

404
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:04,202
Just don't keep it to yourself.

405
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:10,682
Do you know that everyone's here

406
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:14,058
to share their feelings with you?

407
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:30,002
(Two days before the operation)

408
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,602
- Let's start. - Yes.

409
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:43,882
Focus.

410
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,802
I need to focus.

411
00:32:50,522 --> 00:32:51,682
Electrocauterize.

412
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,046
Clip it.

413
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:54,422
Remove it

414
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:56,642
with En bloc.

415
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:03,242
At this point, you know what to do, right?

416
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:07,762
I need to focus.

417
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,802
I need to focus.

418
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:15,882
Open into IVC.

419
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,402
That's it, Shoan. You're close.

420
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:54,352
Well done, Shoan.

421
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:12,242
Did you do well today, Doctor?

422
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:14,362
I did.

423
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,362
Here. Stir-fried vegetables on rice. Prim said you wanted this dish.

424
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:20,202
I did.

425
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:21,882
Where's Dr. Prim though?

426
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:23,242
She's on the night shift.

427
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,602
- The files. - Here are your papers on sarcoma.

428
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,242
Thank you so much.

429
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:47,922
Nick. Are we really helping him this way?

430
00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:51,362
Yeah. Won't Shoan work himself to death?

431
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:54,162
I don't know.

432
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,762
Does the pain occur more often?

433
00:35:05,882 --> 00:35:07,282
A little.

434
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,282
Where's your partner?

435
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:12,962
Do you mean Shoan?

436
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:15,688
I think he had training today.

437
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,523
I don't know how his training today went,

438
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,880
but yesterday, it seemed

439
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:24,652
like he wasn't satisfied. He kept making a long face all day long.

440
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:27,882
I can imagine his long face.

441
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:34,602
Shoan is lucky though. He gets frustrated easily and he's picky.

442
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:38,322
But those around him understand.

443
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,242
I'll say this though.

444
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:43,629
Prim.

445
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,682
I'm not hyping you up,

446
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:51,442
but you and Shoan went through a lot together.

447
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,282
I don't know about you

448
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,842
but I know Shoan.

449
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:04,242
He's really lucky to have you.

450
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:10,522
Hey, Professor.

451
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:14,762
- What? - Stop thinking about others. I got this, okay?

452
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,642
Right now, you need to relax.

453
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,562
Prim, hi!

454
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,522
Miss May, hi.

455
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,002
You don't have to worry.

456
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:26,215
My professor is feeling fine.

457
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:31,162
He can complain as usual. He'll be mean again in no time.

458
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,522
- He got this. - I didn't complain about anything.

459
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,482
I'm just kidding.

460
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,642
I'll leave you to her. See you again.

461
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,042
Goodbye.

462
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:48,082
You should be sleeping, Win. It's late.

463
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:51,282
Can I have one more hour? I want to read a bit more.

464
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,042
I'll give you half an hour.

465
00:36:56,627 --> 00:36:58,122
Half an hour?

466
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:01,978
- Don't be stubborn. - But it's so close to the end.

467
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,322
Half an hour it is.

468
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,352
May, sit down, please. I want to talk to you.

469
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:20,862
What is it?

470
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:38,602
If I beat the cancer,

471
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,042
I would like to be a lecturer in a school of medicine.

472
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,602
I want to have more time for you and our child.

473
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:03,682
I think that's great.

474
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:06,522
I'll be okay with anything you want to do though.

475
00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:08,762
I believe you have thought everything through.

476
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,482
Thank you.

477
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:19,722
(One day before the operation)

478
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:24,522
(Peritoneal Dialysis Clinic - National Foundation of Kidney Disease)

479
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,242
- We've found a living donor. - Yeah.

480
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:32,522
An older sister, age 22,

481
00:38:32,722 --> 00:38:36,402
would like to donate her kidney to her brother, Poramet Ngamsuang, age 15.

482
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:39,642
- If the sister is medically cleared, there should be no problem. - Okay.

483
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:46,002
- Good morning. Where's your brother? - Hi.

484
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:47,602
He's getting dialysis.

485
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:51,002
See. There he is.

486
00:38:57,522 --> 00:39:00,842
What's wrong? Why the long face?

487
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:03,362
Did you have a fight?

488
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,242
We didn't.

489
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,842
Come on.

490
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,522
There you go.

491
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:14,122
Okay.

492
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:17,642
Pek, what's wrong?

493
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:20,962
I told you getting upset is not good.

494
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:23,835
So what?

495
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,162
Do you want me to smile and be happy?

496
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,036
I know you're giving me your kidney.

497
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:37,842
What good is that sacrifice? Tell me.

498
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:45,682
Calm down. We can talk about this.

499
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:48,446
Take it easy.

500
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,416
Well, let's...

501
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:10,942
Let's wait until he calms down and I'll talk to him if you want.

502
00:40:13,082 --> 00:40:15,282
Doesn't he know that I'm doing this

503
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,562
because I want him to live a normal life like others?

504
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:21,002
I don't want him to always be in the hospital.

505
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
Try thinking this way.

506
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:34,122
He cares about you too.

507
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,242
He's not comfortable. He's worried.

508
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:42,322
He probably even feels guilty

509
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,882
that you

510
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:46,922
have to get yourself hurt for him.

511
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,362
I'm the one who should feel guilty.

512
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:00,042
The accident on that day,

513
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:02,722
when my parents' car flipped over,

514
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:04,602
I was driving it.

515
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:07,482
Pek has this condition

516
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:10,710
because of me.

517
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:13,842
I was the one who got my family into this mess.

518
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,602
Are you angry at your sister?

519
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:32,282
What else are you feeling?

520
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:38,602
I'm afraid.

521
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:41,882
At first,

522
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:44,762
I was afraid of putting someone else's organs

523
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,602
inside my own body.

524
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,522
But now,

525
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:51,602
I'm afraid

526
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:54,057
that if Paan gives me her kidney,

527
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:56,322
she'll get sick.

528
00:41:59,182 --> 00:42:00,882
Before every organ transplant,

529
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:03,442
there must be a thorough checkup.

530
00:42:03,602 --> 00:42:06,242
We need to make sure it's safe for both the donor and recipient.

531
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,082
Statistically, the success rate is pretty high.

532
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,082
A lot of people have to wait for this opportunity.

533
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,482
I'm not happy at all.

534
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:21,562
If I get cured, and Paan gets sick instead.

535
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:28,162
I think

536
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:32,002
this is what an older sibling would do.

537
00:42:32,346 --> 00:42:34,122
I had an older brother.

538
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:36,962
He did a lot of things for me.

539
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:44,322
Doctor.

540
00:42:45,205 --> 00:42:47,442
- Yes? - Do you know?

541
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:50,042
When my parents died,

542
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:54,402
everyone said I shouldn't be too sad.

543
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,242
That's because

544
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:59,282
everyone will die one day.

545
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:03,922
If that's the case,

546
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:08,609
she should let me die. That's what she should do.

547
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,082
Do I have the right to have that thought?

548
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:15,482
Think about it.

549
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:18,322
If

550
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:20,482
Everyone

551
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:22,362
has to die anyway,

552
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:25,122
why would a doctor save anyone?

553
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,082
- Dr. Prim. - Hmm?

554
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,682
I have

555
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:02,082
a question I can't answer.

556
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:04,344
It's stuck in my head.

557
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,402
What is it?

558
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:13,602
Pek, the kidney disease patient.

559
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:15,682
He asked me

560
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:17,522
if everyone has to die,

561
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:19,602
why would a doctor save anyone?

562
00:44:20,802 --> 00:44:22,522
I couldn't answer him.

563
00:44:37,202 --> 00:44:38,682
If you ask me that,

564
00:44:42,002 --> 00:44:43,522
I'd say

565
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:49,522
being a doctor is just a profession.

566
00:44:51,118 --> 00:44:55,002
What we do isn't that big of a deal.

567
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,362
It's...

568
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,442
It's a duty that we have to do.

569
00:45:07,442 --> 00:45:10,202
He's right in a way.

570
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:12,562
Everyone has to die.

571
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:15,842
But if a patient

572
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:22,402
decides to or wants to live on

573
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:24,402
just one percent more,

574
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:28,802
then that one percent

575
00:45:29,882 --> 00:45:31,162
becomes our job.

576
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,626
Are you stressed about Professor Win?

577
00:45:47,082 --> 00:45:48,442
I don't know.

578
00:45:52,762 --> 00:45:55,482
You'll have other professors in the OR.

579
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:58,162
You should just

580
00:45:59,482 --> 00:46:01,202
do your own part.

581
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:03,482
Do your best.

582
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:05,882
Just like every time.

583
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:13,682
The operation is tomorrow. Let's visit him once more.

584
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,682
That's great.

585
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:19,202
Good boy.

586
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:24,282
Okay.

587
00:46:28,025 --> 00:46:30,962
I haven't had food or water. I'm ready for the operation, Doctor.

588
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,762
That's good.

589
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:41,002
Professor.

590
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,602
If I can't do it,

591
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:47,604
if I make a wrong decision,

592
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:49,962
what should I do?

593
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:53,002
That's simple.

594
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:55,522
Let Professor Benz take over. Do the usual.

595
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:00,082
What do you expect in this case?

596
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:05,642
I want to do my best. I want you to recover.

597
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:15,362
If you're that worried, you have to

598
00:47:15,676 --> 00:47:17,676
lower your expectations in half

599
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:20,242
and just do your best.

600
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:24,842
If you do that, whatever happens is beyond your control.

601
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,282
Just let it go.

602
00:47:37,282 --> 00:47:38,562
Do you wonder

603
00:47:39,353 --> 00:47:41,122
why I let you join the team?

604
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:53,042
Because I want you to learn.

605
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:01,202
I believe

606
00:48:01,952 --> 00:48:03,042
that you

607
00:48:03,362 --> 00:48:05,562
can become more than a surgeon.

608
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:12,762
More than that?

609
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:15,802
What is it then?

610
00:48:18,266 --> 00:48:19,642
You'll find out.

611
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:29,562
Stop making that face.

612
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,210
It's making me uncomfortable.

613
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:40,602
One more thing.

614
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:42,642
Stop calling me Professor.

615
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:48,562
You can call me by my name or anything. I'm a patient now, not a doctor.

616
00:48:53,082 --> 00:48:54,482
Then...

617
00:48:55,122 --> 00:48:56,442
Win.

618
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:01,122
Win, it is.

619
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:03,602
You're going that far?

620
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,802
I call my brother Shin.

621
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:10,562
I'll call you Win.

622
00:49:15,156 --> 00:49:20,952
Wait. If I recover, I'll be back as your professor. Call me Professor.

623
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:22,402
Professor is good.

624
00:49:22,523 --> 00:49:24,082
You didn't like it, Professor?

625
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:28,726
I think Professor is better, okay?

626
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:39,682
(Operation Day)

627
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,042
The lump invades the IVC more than we thought.

628
00:50:31,235 --> 00:50:35,602
We need to try mobilizing his kidney, pancreas, and duodenum.

629
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:37,442
See if we can cut it off.

630
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:41,562
After that, we'll use intraop ultrasound to see how much thrombus there is.

631
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:43,762
Prepare intraop ultrasound.

632
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:45,082
Okay.

633
00:50:48,747 --> 00:50:49,747
Right angle, please.

634
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:56,762
Metzenbaum, please.

635
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:00,982
B620, please.

636
00:51:20,709 --> 00:51:21,962
Cut the suture.

637
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:24,922
Electrocauterize this.

638
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,682
Lanscheur.

639
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:36,522
Electrocauterize this.

640
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,242
How is his BP right now?

641
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:40,242
- It's good. - Okay.

642
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:54,842
May.

643
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:58,962
Sit down. Don't forget you're pregnant.

644
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,882
- Please. - Yes, Mom.

645
00:52:07,722 --> 00:52:09,762
Everything is mobilized now.

646
00:52:11,122 --> 00:52:13,322
Judging from the intraop ultrasound,

647
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:16,716
the tumor has extended very high up.

648
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:19,242
If we were to remove the entire tumor,

649
00:52:19,482 --> 00:52:22,162
we would have to do a cross-clamp suprahepatic IVC.

650
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,762
I don't know if he can endure this.

651
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:31,802
Or we should just stop here and try targeted therapy.

652
00:52:34,009 --> 00:52:36,369
I don't know how well he's going to respond to that either.

653
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:38,282
We have to choose now.

654
00:53:07,922 --> 00:53:10,282
You've reached a critical point.

655
00:53:11,312 --> 00:53:13,042
It's the point of no return.

656
00:53:14,745 --> 00:53:17,122
You no longer have the option to cancel the operation.

657
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:19,722
As the surgeon of this case,

658
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,522
what's your decision?

659
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:28,562
If I were in charge, I'd proceed to the end.

660
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:30,642
If we succeed,

661
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:32,802
the chance of recurrence will be very low.

662
00:53:34,457 --> 00:53:37,522
And what about you?

663
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,962
What would you do?

664
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:42,162
If it were me,

665
00:53:44,843 --> 00:53:46,362
I'd do the same.

666
00:53:53,224 --> 00:53:55,402
I want you to make a decision for me

667
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,042
who will be the patient.

668
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,522
I'll be in your care, Shoan.

669
00:54:07,306 --> 00:54:09,322
Professor Win would want to continue the surgery.

670
00:54:15,844 --> 00:54:17,682
Professor Win once said to me

671
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:19,642
if he were to do this operation himself,

672
00:54:19,772 --> 00:54:21,522
he'd proceed.

673
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:28,002
I believe that he can endure this surgery.

674
00:54:37,242 --> 00:54:38,362
Okay.

675
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:39,762
Everyone.

676
00:54:39,898 --> 00:54:42,322
Let's prepare a suprahepatic IVC cross-clamp.

677
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:44,242
We'll use the Pringle maneuver.

678
00:54:44,523 --> 00:54:47,962
Scrubs, please prepare a vascular syringe and tonsil clamp.

679
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:50,442
Let's save Professor Archawin together.

680
00:55:44,682 --> 00:55:46,242
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

681
00:55:46,338 --> 00:55:47,762
Hello, Professor.

682
00:55:49,155 --> 00:55:50,762
How did it go, Professor?

683
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:54,082
The operation was very difficult.

684
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,682
But

685
00:56:01,202 --> 00:56:02,722
it was a success.

686
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:07,602
He's safe now.

687
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:12,362
After this, we'll transfer him to the ICU to monitor his condition.

688
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,962
- Thank you, Professor. - You're welcome.

689
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:24,042
Shoan!

690
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,282
- Professor, thank you so much. - You're welcome.

691
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:41,922
I'll take my leave now.

692
00:56:42,245 --> 00:56:43,482
There he is.

693
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,762
Dr. Pleum, what are you doing?

694
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:51,562
We did it.

695
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:06,762
Okay...

696
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:50,402
May, I think you should get some rest.

697
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,762
Being restless is not good for your child.

698
00:57:54,362 --> 00:57:56,562
Win will be okay, right?

699
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,122
It's been a while. Why isn't he waking up?

700
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:04,082
After a major surgery, we give him painkillers and sedatives.

701
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:08,082
That's to relieve his pain and stress of the body.

702
00:58:08,744 --> 00:58:10,602
Win isn't waking up, but

703
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:13,002
it's normal. You can rest.

704
00:58:13,351 --> 00:58:15,282
We have doctors watching him anyway.

705
00:58:17,776 --> 00:58:22,056
Okay. I'll go home and get my stuff and come back to stay here.

706
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:26,739
Okay.

707
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,082
You're not going anywhere until he wakes up, right?

708
00:58:48,642 --> 00:58:50,082
Suit yourself.

709
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:55,042
Just don't forget that a doctor in bad shape can't save a patient.

710
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:34,322
Yes, Dr. Prim.

711
00:59:34,778 --> 00:59:36,522
(Are you still at the ICU?)

712
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,362
(I'll switch with you after I finish rounding.)

713
00:59:41,298 --> 00:59:42,562
(You need to rest.)

714
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:44,122
I don't want to.

715
00:59:44,282 --> 00:59:45,922
(You can't.)

716
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:50,202
(Before his operation, you have been on several night shifts.)

717
00:59:51,002 --> 00:59:53,362
(At least, you should get a shower and freshen yourself.)

718
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:55,242
Okay.

719
01:00:13,713 --> 01:00:15,162
Dr. Shoan?

720
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,402
Dr. Shoan.

721
01:00:17,922 --> 01:00:19,122
Dr. Shoan.

722
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,482
Yes?

723
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:27,842
I think you should get some rest.

724
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,146
Give him adrenaline every four minutes.

725
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,762
- Okay. - One milligram should do.

726
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:02,562
