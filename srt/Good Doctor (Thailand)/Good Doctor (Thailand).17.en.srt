(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:39,522
Since you're going to start a new journey,

3
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,842
your first step must be right.

4
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:05,002
Thank you, Shoan.

5
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,602
I promise that I'll love you.

6
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,442
I'll make every second that I have with you

7
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,722
as precious as possible.

8
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,122
Don't you want to dance?

9
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:30,402
No. What about you?

10
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:32,002
I just don't like it.

11
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:37,626
We'll just watch them over here.

12
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,762
- Win! - Professor!

13
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:54,871
- Professor! - Win?

14
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,824
Win!

15
00:02:57,322 --> 00:02:59,682
- Professor! - Win!

16
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:06,242
I can still feel his pulse.

17
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:14,042
Hi. Are you up?

18
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:20,355
How did it go? You barely eat or sleep.

19
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:23,962
Your wedding is today, yet you spent all night in the OR.

20
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:28,362
Stay and finish your IV, Mister Groom.

21
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,322
Thanks, Professor.

22
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:34,202
I'm sorry, May.

23
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,162
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

24
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:40,082
Okay.

25
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:43,362
Listen, Win. You have to take care of yourself.

26
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,482
Maysa, you too. You look tired.

27
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:48,122
How about this? Let's get you both a checkup at once.

28
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:52,922
It's fine, Uncle. I've already had a checkup.

29
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,242
Okay. That's good.

30
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,882
Win, do you know your juniors are worried?

31
00:03:58,201 --> 00:03:59,322
There.

32
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:16,722
Why are you all here? Don't you have your shifts?

33
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,402
Are you good already?

34
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,362
Okay. Then we're off.

35
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,362
Get some rest, Professor.

36
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:30,842
Shoan.

37
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,522
Come on.

38
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,242
Hi.

39
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,122
Good morning, Professor.

40
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,155
You're well-disciplined.

41
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,672
Right.

42
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:18,002
You've been getting along well with your colleagues, right?

43
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,722
It's likely to go well.

44
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,562
That's good.

45
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,642
The director has approved my retirement.

46
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,282
Do you not like being a doctor anymore?

47
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,962
I do, it's just...

48
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,002
I still get excited by difficult cases or brain diseases.

49
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,562
Sometimes it's just...

50
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,962
When you get older,

51
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:55,462
it's good to live a simple life.

52
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:06,162
Won't you regret it though?

53
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:14,522
When you do something for a long time, you'd grow attached to it.

54
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:15,882
But

55
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,962
it won't be as bad as I'd say I would regret it.

56
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:21,162
I would miss it. That's more likely.

57
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,682
But I'd prefer to have you around in the hospital.

58
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:41,002
Shoan, nothing, and no one lasts forever.

59
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:44,402
Changes and departures

60
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:48,282
are inevitable facts of life.

61
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,202
The start

62
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,802
and the finish.

63
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:10,682
That's right.

64
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,882
I think I have reached my finish line.

65
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,602
My goal has been accomplished.

66
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:24,482
You might not realize it yourself,

67
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,642
but I know you're ready

68
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,362
to start your run

69
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,882
on your own path.

70
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:38,002
Believe me, you can do it.

71
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,882
Also, the new head of surgery seems to favor you.

72
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,842
Who is it?

73
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,802
It's Professor Archawin.

74
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:15,562
(Episode 17: Goal)

75
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:18,882
Morning!

76
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:21,242
- Morning. - Morning, Prim.

77
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,522
- Prim. - Yeah?

78
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,602
The juices in the fridge,

79
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,562
- can I have one? - No!

80
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:40,202
That's for me to drink every day.

81
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:42,379
I can't miss even a day.

82
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:45,522
I need to take care of my health. I'm about to reach 30, you know?

83
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:48,816
You're old and stingy.

84
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
You want hot water?

85
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,042
By the way, where are the others, Prim?

86
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,962
I don't know. I think they'll be here soon.

87
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,122
Whoa, Pleum.

88
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:21,042
Are you running away from home?

89
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:25,562
I'm way past my rebellious phase.

90
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:28,202
I'm going camping.

91
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:33,562
Really? I'm jealous of you.

92
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,642
I haven't worked here long enough to take a leave.

93
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,777
Oh, don't be jealous.

94
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:43,602
I'm a fourth-year resident, yet I can't take a single day off.

95
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,802
The workload is super tight.

96
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,522
Has the professor approved your leave?

97
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,202
He hasn't.

98
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,402
- But I'm going. - That's a rebellious phase.

99
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,122
I'm not rebellious.

100
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:01,082
Where...

101
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,488
Dr. Pleum, are you running away from home?

102
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,242
It's over.

103
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,362
Wait.

104
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,162
Yes?

105
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,562
Shoan.

106
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:20,842
Would you go camping with me?

107
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:28,042
By camping, do you mean sleeping in a tent on the ground in a forest?

108
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,482
That's right.

109
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,322
I'm interested.

110
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:35,562
I like being in nature.

111
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:37,402
This is getting somewhere.

112
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,282
Where are you going to camp?

113
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:41,842
Yeah, where?

114
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,642
Just around here.

115
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,202
Around here?

116
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:51,482
Yes.

117
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:22,402
Big bro, I want this.

118
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:27,525
Oh. It's expensive. I'll buy one for you next time.

119
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,882
Promise.

120
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,402
Here.

121
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,562
I'll take this too.

122
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:48,682
For you.

123
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,762
- Is he buying it for you? - Yes.

124
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:58,802
I'll let you have it, but what do you have to say?

125
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,082
Thank you.

126
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:02,722
That's right.

127
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,722
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

128
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:09,962
Don't just play. Study hard too.

129
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,282
Yes.

130
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:13,682
Come on. Let's go.

131
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,202
Thank you.

132
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:43,202
Hey.

133
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,802
I got everything.

134
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:50,642
You sure are kind.

135
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:54,522
You saw that?

136
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,642
- Let's go. - If you have your own child,

137
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:04,562
would you be kind like this?

138
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:07,043
Or would you be mean like when you are in the hospital?

139
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,882
I think I would be

140
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,762
the kind type of daddy.

141
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:18,922
If our child is a good kid, that is.

142
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,042
If it's not a good kid,

143
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,562
if it's naughty, I would have to be mean sometimes.

144
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:26,042
But I wouldn't be as mean as...

145
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So...

146
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,002
When did you know?

147
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:52,842
Shortly before the wedding.

148
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:56,282
So...

149
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:59,072
That's when you were sick and

150
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,522
you didn't let me check your pulse. That's when.

151
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:04,802
Yes.

152
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:06,362
I was worried.

153
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:09,322
- I didn't know if you'd be happy or... - May!

154
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,242
I am happy!

155
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,434
I'm really happy!

156
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,442
Come on, May. What were you thinking?

157
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,322
I didn't know.

158
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,386
You said you had a lot of things you wanted to do. And your USA program?

159
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,362
No. I'm not going anymore.

160
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,186
I still want to go,

161
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:29,242
but now I don't want to go anymore. I won't go to stay for our kid.

162
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,922
Come on, May. Why would you think that?

163
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:38,922
- I was afraid. - Don't be.

164
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:43,202
Even though my wife owns a hospital,

165
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:46,682
I'd still want you to get antenatal care at GMC.

166
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:51,677
Okay? When you come in for a checkup, I can see you. Is that good?

167
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,609
I'll ask Professor...

168
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,396
Professor Sarocha to take your case. She's the best.

169
00:14:58,562 --> 00:14:59,762
Is that okay?

170
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,842
So what should we name our kid?

171
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,762
Isn't that too soon?

172
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,882
It's not too soon. It's...

173
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:08,802
How many weeks in?

174
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,882
- We have to come up with a name soon. - It's months away, Win.

175
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,241
Let's go shopping for the baby, shall we? I'm not going to work now.

176
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,602
- You're too much. - Can you walk?

177
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:20,442
Should I give you a piggyback ride?

178
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,722
Of course!

179
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:36,522
(Dr. Archawin Akephaiboon)

180
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:53,801
TEE results from your previous hospital

181
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:58,882
show that Miss Torfun has an atrial septal defect.

182
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,042
It's about two by 1.8 cm.

183
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,402
She's starting to have high blood pressure in her lungs.

184
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:08,722
The sign is when you

185
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,442
do your exercise, you'll be

186
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,906
unusually exhausted.

187
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:16,132
We have to close the leakage in her heart first.

188
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:19,202
And then you will be back to normal.

189
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,831
I'm finally getting my heart fixed, right?

190
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,726
What's the rush?

191
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:28,002
- Your heart is really important. It's risky. - No, it's...

192
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:29,682
If I can get it fixed soon,

193
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:31,401
I'll get to do what I want sooner.

194
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,476
- Let the doctor see if you're ready. - The doctors are good.

195
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,922
He's checking me, right, Doctor?

196
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,183
Yes, well...

197
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:41,962
- Listen... - At first, I'd like to consult our pediatric cardiologist.

198
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:46,162
We'll put a catheter into your blood vessel and evaluate your heart.

199
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:51,562
Then we'll plan a treatment that's safest and best for the patient.

200
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,906
If your heart's evaluation is good,

201
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:59,438
we can put a catheter in and fix the heart

202
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:02,922
without needing surgery at all.

203
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:08,078
Once we're done evaluating her heart,

204
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:11,202
our surgeons will consider

205
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,287
and notify your plan of operation

206
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,336
at your ward, okay?

207
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:17,282
Yes. Let's do that.

208
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:18,778
- Thank you. - Yes. Thank you.

209
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:20,202
Thank you.

210
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,842
- Great! - Easy.

211
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:31,602
A daughter who's close to her dad? That's cute.

212
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:35,042
Is everything alright?

213
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,002
These are all the cases for this afternoon, Professor.

214
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,922
- Thanks. - Thank you.

215
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:46,682
Prim, for that last patient's ASD secundum case,

216
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:50,322
when the catheter results come in, ask the pediatric cardiologist

217
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:53,078
to notify us and we'll consider our plan at her ward.

218
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,762
Okay, Professor.

219
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:57,282
You don't have an operation today?

220
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,882
Not at all.

221
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:03,562
- Okay. - I have to go to dinner with my beautiful wife.

222
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,202
Yeah!

223
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,070
I'm so hungry.

224
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,082
Prim, Shoan, come on. Let's eat.

225
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,562
Thank you.

226
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:29,327
What about Pleum? Is he not eating?

227
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,042
I don't know.

228
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:33,963
I last saw him at the back of the hospital. I don't know where he went.

229
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:38,962
I just registered for a charity fun run.

230
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:41,122
Won't any of you go with me?

231
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,482
Is your life not tiring enough?

232
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,122
Who's organizing this event?

233
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:48,002
It's a cosmetic brand or something.

234
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:51,562
The money goes to a child cancer foundation though.

235
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,602
- Yeah. - That's good.

236
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:55,402
I can't make it, Nick.

237
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:58,202
I haven't bought my new running outfit, new running shoes,

238
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:00,562
or new makeup, and I haven't updated my playlist.

239
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,002
You don't need all that.

240
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,242
Mim, that's too much. It's just a run.

241
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:07,962
Pleum, you know nothing.

242
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:09,842
That's a woman's happiness.

243
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:12,482
Exhaustion is fine, but we have to go full option.

244
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:14,242
Yeah, fine.

245
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:16,002
What about you?

246
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,722
Are you going for a marathon?

247
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
That's too much. This will do for now.

248
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:25,522
Running feels good for me. Also,

249
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:30,722
when I run, I feel like I get to cross the lines or goals that I set.

250
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,242
Yeah.

251
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,442
- Is it really that good? - Oh my.

252
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:37,306
- I'll see how long you can keep it up. - Patellofemoral pain syndrome.

253
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,122
Dr. Nick, you're 31 years old. You have a risk of that.

254
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:44,362
Therefore, you need to warm up enough and run with proper movements.

255
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,122
That will reduce the risk.

256
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:49,282
Yes, sir.

257
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,722
It's fine. I got lectured by him too.

258
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:00,922
Yes, Em?

259
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:02,922
Of course.

260
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:04,522
Shoan, let's go.

261
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:05,843
Where to?

262
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,322
A patient is having a problem with right hepatectomy.

263
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:11,202
- Okay. Wait a second. - Guys.

264
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,018
Don't throw my meal away. I'll be back to finish it.

265
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,042
Okay.

266
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,577
Wait!

267
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,002
Dr. Pleum, wait for me!

268
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:25,482
Pleum seems so busy. What about his camping trip?

269
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,802
- It's probably canceled. - I wonder.

270
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:40,089
You know me. I won't cancel it.

271
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,402
You always go big.

272
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,562
Surprised, aren't you?

273
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,875
Pleum, you've outdone yourself this time.

274
00:20:53,122 --> 00:20:54,962
It's just once in a while. Let me have my way.

275
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,971
Are we going to be in trouble for using the hospital's electricity?

276
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,522
- Right? - I got my own battery. It's fine.

277
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:06,242
- There's no trouble. - That's good.

278
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,682
Can you play guitar, Pleum?

279
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,602
It's a prop.

280
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:20,962
- Shoan. - Yes?

281
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:22,642
Do you want to try it?

282
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,562
May I? I want to try.

283
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,034
Go ahead. Show us.

284
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,610
This thing takes practice, you know?

285
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,922
- You can't play it with a high IQ. - Do you want to bet?

286
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,482
I bet Shoan can play it.

287
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,722
You're on.

288
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:37,322
- Whoever loses pays for lunch. - Deal.

289
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:41,322
Come on, Shoan.

290
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:44,202
Yes. Do you have a chord?

291
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,442
Here. It's something easy.

292
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,722
Can you really play though?

293
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,191
See? I can tell just by the first chord.

294
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,082
We'll see.

295
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:11,288
Shoan.

296
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:14,002
Can I film this for my YouTube?

297
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:20,082
Hello. This is "One Night with Pleum."

298
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,162
Tonight, we'll be watching Dr. Shoan,

299
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:24,722
a genius doctor, as he plays guitar for the first time.

300
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,782
Let's see if he can play it.

301
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:37,402
You're paying for lunch.

302
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,162
Okay.

303
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,882
(As long as the sea remains far from the mountains, )

304
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,642
(no matter how far we're apart, )

305
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:13,495
(I'm still the same, everything's the same. I'm waiting for only you.)

306
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:19,762
Before I became a doctor, I thought I'd work hard and play hard.

307
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:22,122
Those who say they don't have time,

308
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:23,602
I didn't believe them.

309
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:25,082
But now

310
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,122
I found out just how it is.

311
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:32,082
Me too.

312
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:36,322
I wanted to be a beautiful and capable doctor.

313
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:39,362
Now I'm barely surviving.

314
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:41,955
I'll worry about being beautiful later.

315
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,682
Shoan's probably the only one

316
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:48,962
that's getting to do what he wants to.

317
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,842
Pleum, as if you didn't want to be a doctor.

318
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:57,682
Actually, I didn't want to be a doctor.

319
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:03,901
I've become one because everyone in my family is one.

320
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:05,482
My dad is a doctor.

321
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,442
My siblings are doctors. That's why I'm here.

322
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:11,602
So what do you actually want to be?

323
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:14,442
I don't know.

324
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:17,242
This is probably me though.

325
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:19,362
A mid-doctor with nothing outstanding.

326
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:21,682
So...

327
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,922
Don't you want to change careers?

328
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,282
You've probably realized that a while ago.

329
00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:31,402
The reason is kind of corny.

330
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,082
When I see

331
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:37,322
a patient recover and go home,

332
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:41,202
it feels so wholesome.

333
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,857
I don't know if you guys feel that way.

334
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:44,322
- Everyone is the same. - Me too.

335
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:47,602
- Me too. - That's why we're sitting here.

336
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:54,522
Dr. Pleum, you're a doctor in your own way.

337
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,802
You seem to be happy,

338
00:25:56,993 --> 00:25:59,682
except when you've got Grey Turner's sign.

339
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:05,762
- Was that a praise or an insult? - Take it easy.

340
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:11,682
He means you're happy in your own way. Get it?

341
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:13,882
If we're complaining this much,

342
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:17,242
no kid would want to be a doctor anymore.

343
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:22,882
The videos that you make, I think they're good.

344
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:27,322
It's easy to understand. You don't use difficult words like other doctors.

345
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,562
I think general viewers can understand. That's a good thing.

346
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:35,282
Yeah. An influencer slash doctor is cool.

347
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:39,922
Yeah, I agree. Everyone has their own way, right?

348
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:42,329
You guys are embarrassing me.

349
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:44,362
I'm flattered.

350
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:45,802
Look, Prim.

351
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,402
What about your goal?

352
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:49,802
Do you still want to go to the countryside?

353
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:04,522
I have my own goals too.

354
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:07,442
Tomorrow,

355
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,282
I'm going to run at half past four in the morning.

356
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:13,962
I shouldn't have got myself in trouble.

357
00:27:14,282 --> 00:27:17,602
That's why I said, "Is your life not tiring enough?"

358
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,922
I'm amazed you can play guitar when you just pick it up.

359
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:42,882
That's because the guitar's chords are fixed patterns.

360
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:49,122
Tonight, I felt something.

361
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:50,922
What was it?

362
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:53,722
I felt normal.

363
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:57,002
I felt like I was a normal person.

364
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,482
I did my work.

365
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,122
I have my friends.

366
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,182
And...

367
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,762
Shin and my bunny up there are probably watching.

368
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:21,702
Of course they are.

369
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:26,862
They see

370
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,482
just how happy you are.

371
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,162
Hello?

372
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,122
Okay. Yeah. I'm on my way.

373
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,842
Okay.

374
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,802
Pleum!

375
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:09,442
Pleum! The ER needs us!

376
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:32,762
Professor, we've got Torfun's catheter results.

377
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:36,851
Right now, her ASD secundum's pulmonary flow

378
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:41,522
to systemic flow ratio is over 1.5 to one.

379
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:45,802
Which means she's starting to have pulmonary hypertension.

380
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,362
We should close her ASD leakage first.

381
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,722
Otherwise, her pulmonary hypertension is going to get worse.

382
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:57,522
Do you think we should do an open repair or just use an ASD device?

383
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:01,082
Her major axis now is smaller than 33 millimeters.

384
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:03,642
And her ASD rim is bigger than ten millimeters.

385
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:05,282
I think...

386
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:08,522
The chance of success with an ASD device is pretty high.

387
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:15,242
I think a transcatheter device closure is best for this case.

388
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:20,642
That's good. Inform the family and notify

389
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,082
our pediatric cardiologist.

390
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,682
- Okay. - Okay.

391
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:26,682
Professor, may I ask for Shoan's help with this case?

392
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:29,302
- Of course. - Okay.

393
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,442
(Nurse Counter)

394
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,202
Good morning.

395
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:39,202
- Good morning. - Good morning.

396
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:51,862
Your catheter results came back.

397
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:55,482
The leakage in your heart

398
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,366
is perfect for

399
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,242
a closure using a device.

400
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:02,762
We will not do an open chest surgery.

401
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:06,162
The operation will take two to three hours.

402
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,578
You will spend one day in recovery.

403
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:11,242
After one day, if there's no complication, you can go home.

404
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:15,682
It sounds difficult and dangerous, right?

405
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:18,184
To close a leakage,

406
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,132
we have two methods for that.

407
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:23,362
First is an open chest surgery.

408
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,882
The second method

409
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:28,602
is inserting a device through a catheter without surgery.

410
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:30,162
Both methods

411
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,322
are similar in success rates.

412
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,882
The difference is the second method will only cause a wound in her thigh.

413
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:39,722
Her recovery will be much faster than with the first method.

414
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:42,682
What about some exercise or

415
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:44,602
running after surgery?

416
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:46,162
What are you talking about?

417
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:48,482
This is not the time to think about that.

418
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:50,242
Take it easy, Mister.

419
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:56,162
If either of you have any questions, you can ask me.

420
00:31:57,061 --> 00:31:59,282
I have questions, Doctor.

421
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:03,682
Okay, please come to the counter. We need you to sign a consent

422
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:05,175
- for the operation. - Of course.

423
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:06,882
Okay. Shoan, I'll leave her with you.

424
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:08,202
Please.

425
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:31,162
Did your father get angry because you like to run?

426
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:34,322
He was just pretending to be angry.

427
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:36,842
Actually, he's the one who likes to run.

428
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:44,322
So...

429
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:46,802
What part of running do you enjoy?

430
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:48,962
That's an unusual question.

431
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:51,922
People who know my condition

432
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,402
usually say,

433
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:56,162
"Why would you run?"

434
00:32:56,322 --> 00:33:00,002
They know I can't run even if I try.

435
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:06,242
"Why would you?" I got asked that a lot.

436
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,642
I like the atmosphere of a running event. Have you ever been to one?

437
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:18,162
I like to get dressed up and

438
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:20,762
sit among them. Watch them run.

439
00:33:20,962 --> 00:33:24,242
Sometimes, I want to be on the podium.

440
00:33:25,802 --> 00:33:27,202
But

441
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:32,022
it's only a dream because I can barely live a normal life.

442
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,042
A normal life...

443
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,282
Doctor.

444
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:44,962
After my operation,

445
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:46,962
can I run a marathon?

446
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:50,562
She can.

447
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:56,202
Once her tissue completely covers the device,

448
00:33:56,346 --> 00:34:00,042
she can resume her exercise and running as normal.

449
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:05,482
You just have to wait for about three to six months.

450
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:11,082
I saw you got a bit angry with her.

451
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,842
Well, I just don't want her to hear.

452
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:18,802
I was afraid she'd get impatient and rush it.

453
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:22,002
May I ask you a question?

454
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,602
- Yes. - Why does she like to run?

455
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:28,042
It's probably because of me.

456
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:32,642
We go to running events as father and daughter. I used to bring her along.

457
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,402
Why does your dad

458
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:40,002
act like he doesn't like running when he likes it?

459
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:42,402
I think

460
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:45,722
it's because I can't run.

461
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:48,842
Personally, I

462
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:51,522
want to go running with my dad.

463
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:56,542
No matter how hard I try, I just can't.

464
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:58,522
At first, I thought

465
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,522
I was probably too young

466
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,282
or I didn't try hard enough.

467
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:08,922
At first, I didn't even know

468
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,034
that I had a heart condition since birth.

469
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:17,802
I heard a song that says

470
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:22,482
"Effort never hurts those who put their mind to it."

471
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:26,282
But now,

472
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,162
no matter how hard I try,

473
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:33,682
if my body and my heart can't handle it,

474
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:37,602
all it would do is harm me

475
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,122
and hurt my dad.

476
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:46,962
That's why

477
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:55,172
my dad didn't want me to sit alone and cheer him on,

478
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,962
so he stopped running.

479
00:35:58,402 --> 00:36:00,882
Actually,

480
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:07,242
I don't regret that I don't get to go running.

481
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:10,622
I'm just worried about her.

482
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,042
I feel like it's because of me...

483
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:19,042
I don't want her to blame herself as the reason I don't go running.

484
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:23,322
That my dad has to stop doing what he loves.

485
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,602
Once we fix that patient's heart, she will go back to running with her dad.

486
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:46,879
When I was in college,

487
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:49,642
someone told me

488
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:54,242
a degree in medicine is like a marathon.

489
00:36:55,762 --> 00:36:57,202
I won't argue with that.

490
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:01,082
You know?

491
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:02,722
It takes a long time to graduate.

492
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:04,622
That's six years.

493
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:06,956
After that, we have to work and pay off the tuition.

494
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,722
Haven't you heard? A doctor remains in school all their life.

495
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:14,842
It's just like a long marathon.

496
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:16,402
It's about

497
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,842
how you reach your finish line and when.

498
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,722
Not everybody gets to reach their finish line though.

499
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:28,762
That's why we have to do our best.

500
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:31,122
Do our best

501
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:33,082
to continue running on another event.

502
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,402
You're right if you want to study further as a fellowship.

503
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:48,282
Complications of an ASD device include

504
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,042
cardiac

505
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:52,642
perforation,

506
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,962
device embolization,

507
00:37:55,082 --> 00:37:57,522
and cardiac arrhythmia.

508
00:37:58,063 --> 00:38:00,522
Common complications

509
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,242
that lead to surgery include

510
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:06,602
device embolization...

511
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,642
There's also a 1.2% chance of thrombus formation

512
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:13,242
within four weeks after operation.

513
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,522
Dad.

514
00:38:40,522 --> 00:38:42,362
I can't sleep.

515
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:45,162
Are you nervous?

516
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,562
A little.

517
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,562
When I get better,

518
00:38:58,024 --> 00:38:59,656
let's go running together.

519
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,642
You can practice while I recover.

520
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,482
Of course I will.

521
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:10,942
Fun.

522
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:16,802
The reason I stopped running

523
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:18,722
is not because of you.

524
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,010
It's just not fun to go alone.

525
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:24,802
Let's go together.

526
00:39:28,895 --> 00:39:31,722
Everything will go well. Be strong.

527
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:36,002
You're more nervous than I am.

528
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:53,162
We'll bring the patient to the operating room.

529
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,002
I'll wait for you here.

530
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:00,442
Be strong.

531
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,322
You be strong too, Dad.

532
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,082
Professor,

533
00:40:36,202 --> 00:40:38,722
ASD secundum is two cm,

534
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:40,562
with left to right shunt.

535
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:43,042
Vital signs are now stable.

536
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:46,562
- Right. Amplatzer, 22 mil please. - Yes, Professor.

537
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,882
Amplatzer, 22 mil is in.

538
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:06,882
Fix wire, please.

539
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:10,402
Okay, we can open up the device.

540
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,642
Okay, the device opened.

541
00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:27,962
Professor, we've got a pulseful VT.

542
00:41:28,664 --> 00:41:32,082
- No! The device came off. We need surgery now. - Yes, Professor.

543
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:50,002
Professor, the device is probably still in her left atrium.

544
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,522
Aortic cross clamp, please.

545
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:05,842
Give her cardioplegia.

546
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:11,362
We'll open into the right atrium.

547
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:13,569
Then, we'll go into...

548
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:20,242
Professor?

549
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:22,762
Professor?

550
00:42:25,562 --> 00:42:26,882
Professor?

551
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:31,722
Call Professor Karn from CVT.

552
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:33,762
Or any professor from CVT who's available.

553
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:36,962
- Yes, Professor. - Professor, what's wrong?

554
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:38,282
I'm fine, Shoan.

555
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:40,242
- Are you okay? - I am.

556
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:42,402
Every professor there is working on a case.

557
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:45,242
Professor Karn has the earliest availability. We'll call her in.

558
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,682
We have no time.

559
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:51,602
Prim, you'll be the main surgeon.

560
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,602
- Yes? - I'll be overseeing you.

561
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:55,322
Start from...

562
00:42:59,017 --> 00:43:00,762
Start from right atriotomy.

563
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,360
Retrieve the device.

564
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:07,962
Come on! Shoan, take Prim's place as the assistant. Are you up to this?

565
00:43:08,282 --> 00:43:10,042
- I am. - Go.

566
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:19,282
Forceps and Metzenbaum, please.

567
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:33,922
Prim.

568
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:38,562
Stitch her ASD up using Dragon Patch Graft.

569
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:45,922
Shoan, on the right.

570
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,602
We'll start de-airing her heart chamber.

571
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:02,362
Copy that.

572
00:44:03,346 --> 00:44:04,562
Prim.

573
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:14,882
We need CO2 and water before closing her ASD.

574
00:44:15,872 --> 00:44:17,362
That's correct, Shoan. Well done.

575
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:20,322
CO2 is on.

576
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:26,282
Easy, Prim. Slowly de-air and let all the air out.

577
00:44:33,848 --> 00:44:37,802
The clamp is off. Her heart is beating well. The ASD patch has no leakage.

578
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:46,082
Okay. We gave you painkillers. Just rest for a bit and you'll feel better.

579
00:44:46,361 --> 00:44:49,402
Look, Win. This is not okay now.

580
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:51,678
You need to find time for your MRI scan.

581
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:53,759
Trade your shift with someone, okay?

582
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,282
Okay, Professor.

583
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:09,642
- Professor, how are you? What's wrong? - Professor?

584
00:45:09,817 --> 00:45:11,782
- Professor, what's wrong? - Shoan, easy.

585
00:45:13,323 --> 00:45:16,442
I'm fine now. I took some painkillers.

586
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:20,762
- Are you okay? - How is the patient doing?

587
00:45:21,146 --> 00:45:23,482
We sent her to the ICU. Don't worry.

588
00:45:23,594 --> 00:45:25,522
Okay. Well done, both of you.

589
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:30,982
I'm okay.

590
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:38,842
Hello, Mom.

591
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:40,602
(Shoan.)

592
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:43,762
(Your dad isn't doing well.)

593
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:47,242
(Do you want to visit him?)

594
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:54,362
Don't worry about it here. If you need to stay there, just stay.

595
00:45:54,654 --> 00:45:56,802
I'll take care of your shifts.

596
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:59,002
All right?

597
00:46:08,297 --> 00:46:10,122
If you feel bad,

598
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,322
try to breathe and count one to ten.

599
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:16,642
Understand?

600
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:22,642
One, two, three, four,

601
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,322
five, six, seven,

602
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:28,402
eight, nine, ten.

603
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,802
Talk to you later.

604
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,882
Please take care of him.

605
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,922
Shoan.

606
00:46:54,282 --> 00:46:56,442
You're good at drawing.

607
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,682
That's nice.

608
00:47:00,722 --> 00:47:02,082
Shin.

609
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:06,282
Take good care of the bunny.

610
00:47:07,228 --> 00:47:08,882
It gets scared easily.

611
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:22,042
Shoan.

612
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,122
You're here?

613
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,082
Why don't you eat something?

614
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:30,242
All you do is play around.

615
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:34,562
Shin.

616
00:47:35,195 --> 00:47:38,162
- Get your brother something to eat. - (Yes, Dad.)

617
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,402
Shoan.

618
00:47:48,138 --> 00:47:49,882
Hold your dad's hands.

619
00:47:50,882 --> 00:47:52,322
Try to comfort him.

620
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,722
Well done, Shoan.

621
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,202
Well done.

622
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,642
Shin.

623
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:54,402
You see? Your brother is still so little.

624
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:56,162
You're the big brother.

625
00:48:56,321 --> 00:49:00,322
You have to love him and help your mom take care of him. Can you do that?

626
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,202
I can.

627
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:04,162
Ahh!

628
00:49:04,415 --> 00:49:06,242
I see your eyes.

629
00:49:06,786 --> 00:49:08,786
I bet you'll grow up to be smart.

630
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:11,322
- Do you agree, Yen? - Yes, honey.

631
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,922
Oh, Shoan? Are you waiting for your dad?

632
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,082
Do you go to school like other kids?

633
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:28,682
Let's go. He doesn't speak. He's too old now.

634
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:31,410
I told his dad to hit his lips with a frog, and he didn't listen.

635
00:49:31,456 --> 00:49:32,882
What are you talking about?

636
00:49:33,295 --> 00:49:35,295
Are you going to hit a child's lips with a frog?

637
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,802
Are you crazy?

638
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:40,218
Your kid won't speak.

639
00:49:40,328 --> 00:49:41,922
He's not normal.

640
00:49:42,169 --> 00:49:43,482
It doesn't hurt to try.

641
00:49:43,641 --> 00:49:44,922
It does!

642
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,602
Should I hit your lips with a frog now?

643
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:50,149
You're speaking nonsense!

644
00:49:50,242 --> 00:49:53,642
(He's almost six and he still can't talk.)

645
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:57,042
(Cause he's retarded...)

646
00:49:57,345 --> 00:49:59,042
Hey! What's so funny?

647
00:49:59,148 --> 00:50:02,882
- (The dad can't touch him?) - (Your child won't grow any further.)

648
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,682
All they do is run their mouths.

649
00:50:11,643 --> 00:50:14,162
When you were a kid,

650
00:50:18,802 --> 00:50:20,522
you didn't understand.

651
00:50:23,362 --> 00:50:25,882
I went through a lot.

652
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:33,402
All the people said

653
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:36,722
you were dumb.

654
00:50:37,226 --> 00:50:38,682
You brat!

655
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:40,042
You're good for nothing!

656
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:42,842
- You were retarded. - Dad, don't hurt him.

657
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:45,322
They keep talking every day.

658
00:50:46,894 --> 00:50:50,562
- It was hard... - Shin! Take your brother and run!

659
00:50:50,768 --> 00:50:52,618
You're hurting me!

660
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:54,485
For me to ignore them.

661
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:58,242
Quiet! I said quiet! Why would you keep crying?

662
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:01,642
- Stop. Please stop drinking. - You can hate me.

663
00:51:03,281 --> 00:51:05,281
You can blame me.

664
00:51:06,488 --> 00:51:07,922
Everything

665
00:51:12,642 --> 00:51:14,402
was my own fault.

666
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:16,802
I can't blame anyone.

667
00:51:19,602 --> 00:51:22,362
I can't blame you for being this way.

668
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,802
I don't like what you did,

669
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:43,882
but I don't hate you.

670
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,562
Children cannot hate their parents

671
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:52,322
because parents are all they have.

672
00:52:09,353 --> 00:52:11,802
I remember good things about you.

673
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,762
I don't know if you remember though.

674
00:52:44,904 --> 00:52:46,104
Here's your reward.

675
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,762
Your drawing won the school contest.

676
00:53:41,658 --> 00:53:43,562
You're not my son.

677
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:50,642
You shouldn't have been born to me.

678
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,122
I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough.

679
00:56:35,722 --> 00:56:37,482
What's wrong, Professor?

680
00:56:38,847 --> 00:56:40,162
Nothing.

681
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,122
I just heard the view up here is nice.

682
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,242
I spend all my time in the OR.

683
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:56,562
I've never been up here.

684
00:56:57,005 --> 00:56:58,402
It really is nice.

685
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:06,162
How is your dad?

686
00:57:08,442 --> 00:57:10,122
Does he get enough painkillers?

687
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:17,122
My dad is dying.

688
00:57:24,088 --> 00:57:26,522
Professor Prapas would probably say

689
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:31,162
death is everyone's destination.

690
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:39,402
Professor,

691
00:57:41,842 --> 00:57:43,522
I wonder

692
00:57:44,842 --> 00:57:46,882
what your finish line is.

693
00:57:48,562 --> 00:57:50,282
You mean my goal?

694
00:57:51,842 --> 00:57:53,842
It's nothing exciting, actually.

695
00:57:55,962 --> 00:57:59,082
I just want to be a permanent professor to teach students.

696
00:58:02,169 --> 00:58:04,442
So you don't want to operate anymore?

697
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:07,282
That's like Professor Prapas.

698
00:58:09,082 --> 00:58:10,562
Actually,

699
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:13,882
I've never thought about it.

700
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,722
But when I'm about to be a father,

701
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:25,362
I start to feel like I'm on the right path.

702
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:27,922
Well...

703
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:30,522
- I... - You're expecting a baby?

704
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:38,722
You're going to be an uncle soon.

705
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:41,802
I'm going to say no.

706
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:44,522
I'm not made for that role

707
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,714
because of what I am.

708
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:53,362
You're actually not that different.

709
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:57,402
Among us doctors, you're

710
00:58:57,609 --> 00:58:59,242
one of the best.

711
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:06,402
And you're a good doctor.

712
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:11,075
If my child has an uncle who's a capable doctor

713
00:59:11,285 --> 00:59:13,122
and a good doctor,

714
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:14,699
what would go wrong?

715
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:20,682
What about you?

716
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:23,042
Do you have any goals in life?

717
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:27,962
My first goal is to be a surgeon.

718
00:59:30,998 --> 00:59:33,162
I also have a second goal.

719
00:59:34,254 --> 00:59:35,802
Really? What is it?

720
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:56,802
- Good morning, Professor! - Morning.

721
00:59:57,251 --> 01:00:00,242
- Professor, good morning. - Here's your patient file.

722
01:00:00,522 --> 01:00:02,282
Okay.

723
01:00:03,396 --> 01:00:05,842
Why do you seem so gentle today, Professor?

724
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,482
Yeah!

725
01:00:07,586 --> 01:00:10,962
Your killer instinct is pretty much gone, Professor.

726
01:00:11,962 --> 01:00:13,762
What killer instinct?

727
01:00:22,527 --> 01:00:25,842
Professor, what's that? Let me see.

728
01:00:30,976 --> 01:00:33,282
- There she is! - Is that true?

729
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,122
Yeah, okay!

730
01:00:38,962 --> 01:00:42,242
You're smiling more than the person in the photo!

731
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:45,242
- That's enough! Go back to work! - Oops.

732
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:47,162
This is his cruel mode.

733
01:00:47,682 --> 01:00:49,362
- This way! - Professor!

734
01:00:55,337 --> 01:00:56,826
Uncle Shoan?

735
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:04,922
The latest results show you're recovering well.

736
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:06,802
Your vital signs are stable.

737
01:01:06,979 --> 01:01:08,562
You should be able to go home tomorrow.

738
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:10,082
I heard you want to run now?

739
01:01:10,242 --> 01:01:12,402
You have to be strict with your medication.

740
01:01:12,692 --> 01:01:14,282
Don't rush it, okay?

741
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,282
- Take it step by step. - Okay, Doctor.

742
01:01:20,025 --> 01:01:21,562
Doctor.

743
01:01:21,882 --> 01:01:23,922
Thank you so much for

744
01:01:24,145 --> 01:01:28,562
helping my daughter live a normal life again.

745
01:01:32,282 --> 01:01:35,562
You're welcome. Dr. Prim here will provide further details.

746
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:39,002
You can ask her. Now, please excuse me.

747
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,802
Yes, Professor.

748
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:54,362
Yes. See you at four in the MRI room.

749
01:01:56,409 --> 01:01:59,402
Dr. Pleum, you're cuter in person.

750
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:01,722
Oh! Is she one of your fans?

751
01:02:02,362 --> 01:02:05,242
When will you post a new video? I'm looking forward to it.

752
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,482
It's coming soon.

753
01:02:09,547 --> 01:02:11,082
Easy, sweetie.

754
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,162
I also have a second goal.

755
01:03:13,145 --> 01:03:15,442
I want to have a family.

756
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:20,122
It might be like a marathon for me and

757
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:23,042
I might never reach that finish line.

758
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,282
It's a lump this big, yet you felt no sign at all, Win?

759
01:03:50,899 --> 01:03:52,522
Is it about to end?

760
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:54,522
The fact that I bring bad luck

761
01:03:54,613 --> 01:03:56,962
and that I am the reason for everything that went wrong.

762
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,482
The diagnosis is

763
01:03:59,642 --> 01:04:03,183
penetrating abdominal injury with hemorrhagic shock. We're about to

764
01:04:03,264 --> 01:04:04,979
explore his laparotomy to remove the steel rod.

765
01:04:05,003 --> 01:04:07,842
Head Surgeon, do you have anything to inform your team?

766
01:04:07,994 --> 01:04:09,202
You can tell them for me.

767
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:10,864
For the tumor IVC thrombus,

768
01:04:10,976 --> 01:04:12,322
if it's too close to the heart,

769
01:04:12,418 --> 01:04:14,642
the chance to remove the entire tumor...

770
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:16,042
Win?

771
01:04:16,467 --> 01:04:17,682
What are you talking about?
