1
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:18,070
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,105
(Mr. Kob wants you to keep it.)

3
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:05,757
The patient has regained consciousness, but she's still numb in the nerves.

4
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:08,298
She should get better after a while in the hyperbaric chamber.

5
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:09,322
Yes.

6
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:13,122
How is she?

7
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:14,762
Well...

8
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,642
She's awake. What about Ploy and the others?

9
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,122
They said the Dive Com was broken.

10
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,562
May dove in too deep.

11
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:27,202
She usually takes things seriously and never breaks the rules.

12
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:42,082
(Episode 9: Irreplaceable)

13
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,722
(Sir, during the cabinet meeting, )

14
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:48,562
(was there a mention of basic rights to treatment?)

15
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:51,682
- (There was.) - (Care to comment on that, sir?)

16
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,441
(I can't speak much at the moment.)

17
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:58,025
(We still have to consider what's best for every party.)

18
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:01,162
- (And I have to listen to opinions.) - The question he can never answer.

19
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:04,402
How can he possibly answer that?

20
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,802
His wife is asking a billion baht in divorce.

21
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:09,362
If he loses in court,

22
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,522
he loses both his money and face.

23
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,482
He'd probably lose his position too.

24
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:19,922
(Can you confirm you have never had an affair, sir?)

25
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,929
(I will not answer questions regarding my personal life.)

26
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,802
(What about the news of a well-known hospital)

27
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,345
(hiring a doctor with autism)

28
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,722
(who got careless and let a mental patient out?)

29
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:34,562
- (This needs further investigation.) - An autistic doctor?

30
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:38,802
I don't think it's a good thing to hire an autistic person as a doctor.

31
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:43,042
- Yeah. I find it strange. - Right.

32
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:55,762
Pleum, Nick, have you seen this?

33
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,482
What?

34
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,642
The hospital isn't responding at all?

35
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,242
Didn't they say they had evidence it wasn't Shoan's fault?

36
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:11,202
I know! Why won't they save Shoan for once?

37
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:29,002
The trash is still here.

38
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:31,802
Aunt Yen hasn't come in?

39
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:34,482
I don't think so.

40
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,282
She's probably cleaning other buildings.

41
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,842
Prim, how's Miss Maysa doing?

42
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,282
She's doing much better.

43
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:16,762
Professor Win is taking care of her.

44
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:28,484
How many months have we had first-year residents?

45
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,262
Why don't we throw them a welcome party?

46
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,279
- Oh? - That's right!

47
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,082
Yeah, let's do that.

48
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:37,705
How about the porridge place behind the hospital?

49
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,842
Prim, is food all you think about?

50
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:41,082
Let's do something fun.

51
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,367
Eat first, have fun later, all right?

52
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:44,682
- No, skip that. - Oh yeah!

53
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,522
Should we go to a karaoke?

54
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:49,882
How about tomorrow? We'll be all here.

55
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:51,082
I'm in favor.

56
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,362
You're not a first-year anymore.

57
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:55,042
I want to be there for my junior.

58
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,082
- Whoa! - Hey!

59
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,562
Shoan, come with us.

60
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,322
I have to go somewhere before that.

61
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,922
Is that a yes?

62
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,002
I think so.

63
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,082
He'll be there.

64
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,082
Is Aunt Yen here?

65
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:38,442
Yen is in the VIP building. What's the matter, Doctor?

66
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:40,842
Thank you.

67
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:55,602
Mr. Kob, you will undergo hip replacement surgery.

68
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,562
You're currently 60 years old,

69
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:59,403
but you still walk a lot.

70
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:03,123
Your hip replacement should be durable and suitable for movements.

71
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:06,042
That's why you should get a ceramic surface.

72
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:09,322
However, a ceramic hip replacement is highly expensive.

73
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,882
I have nominated you for the "Building Joints, Connecting Bones" project.

74
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,962
You will undergo this surgery for free.

75
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,642
Post-op, you will undergo a physical therapy course with a robot.

76
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:22,882
That will help you walk again.

77
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,002
Are you okay with this?

78
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,962
I am.

79
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:31,002
Thank you so much, Shoan.

80
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,435
Yes.

81
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,682
Mr. Kob, I have a question.

82
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,402
Who is this woman?

83
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:57,562
This woman brought you to the school.

84
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:24,052
If this patient also has a fractured pelvis

85
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:27,882
and the fracture gets on the sciatic nerve, how does it affect walking?

86
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:31,322
(This woman brought you to the school.)

87
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,842
Shoan.

88
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:39,202
Shoan.

89
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:41,623
Shoan.

90
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:44,762
Yes?

91
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:49,442
If this patient also has a fractured pelvis

92
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,362
and the fracture gets on the sciatic nerve,

93
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:53,642
how does it affect walking?

94
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:59,082
There is a walking simulation in on-ground training.

95
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,962
If the patient gets stimulated repeatedly

96
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,282
until the nervous signal

97
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,522
matches that of the spinal cord,

98
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,362
the patient will remember that pattern.

99
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:09,122
It will not affect walking.

100
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:12,922
Correct. That's called CPG, Central Pattern Generator.

101
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,409
This is how they remember movement behaviors,

102
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:19,952
and it will help them walk again.

103
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,522
Yes.

104
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,682
Professor Phruek's suspension period begins tomorrow.

105
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,875
As for the patient's family,

106
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:37,021
our representative gave them an explanation.

107
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,842
They have no problem with Shoan anymore.

108
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:42,882
What about the security system?

109
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:46,122
Is it possible to make that a priority?

110
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:47,722
I think right now,

111
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:50,602
our patients and staff may not feel safe.

112
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:52,922
I really can't promise you that.

113
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:57,122
You're aware that everything is a priority and necessary.

114
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:00,802
I have to choose what costs us the least.

115
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,882
You saw our numbers, right?

116
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:05,889
Yes.

117
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:12,202
Well, all we can do right now is try and understand.

118
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,922
Your orchids don't look really good.

119
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:24,682
Can you believe this?

120
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:27,122
There are so many orchid gurus

121
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,362
on the internet.

122
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:31,722
When they recommend anything, it sounds so easy.

123
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,475
But when we do it,

124
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,922
there are conditions

125
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,642
and many other things in play.

126
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,002
The best I can do right now is help them survive.

127
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:43,882
I think it's frustrating sometimes.

128
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,482
You know what you can do,

129
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,282
but you don't get to do that.

130
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:53,602
Maybe the person who gave it to me thought they were low-maintenance.

131
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,002
You didn't let them die, though.

132
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:00,944
I can't bring myself to.

133
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,602
Even if it's one percent, there's still a chance they will bloom again.

134
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:10,402
How is Shoan doing, by the way?

135
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:14,722
Has he seen the news or comments on social media?

136
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:16,722
I think he hasn't.

137
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:20,002
Even if he has, it's fine.

138
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:23,122
I'm sure Shoan can handle it.

139
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:24,882
What he went through as a child

140
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:27,042
was no different than those comments.

141
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:29,802
What I find unfair is

142
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:31,642
all he can do is

143
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,322
bear with it.

144
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:37,162
Did you give him a chance out of pity?

145
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:40,802
If I say I don't feel pity towards him,

146
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:42,602
I'd be lying.

147
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:44,202
But it's

148
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,802
not the main reason I gave him a chance.

149
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:50,882
Do you remember the day we voted in the meeting?

150
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:54,002
That's the reality in Shoan's life.

151
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,842
His skills don't matter.

152
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,682
Nobody gives him a chance to step forward

153
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,162
just because of his autism.

154
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:04,642
Therefore,

155
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,562
what Shoan has to do better than others is

156
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,802
keep his determination alive until he proves himself.

157
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,802
You're as stubborn as ever.

158
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:19,361
Ten years ago,

159
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:22,882
you were just like this when you nominated me to the board.

160
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:27,682
Ten years later, it just proves that

161
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:29,282
my judgment

162
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:31,082
of a person is spot on.

163
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,962
You know what?

164
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:35,562
I'll assign you

165
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:39,122
to give an explanation to the Ministry of Health.

166
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:42,282
I think you can give a clearer explanation

167
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:45,642
of both the case and Shoan himself.

168
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,834
- I will. - I'll have my assistant

169
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:51,122
inform the Ministry that tomorrow,

170
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,042
you will be there at nine, Professor.

171
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,722
Yes.

172
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:08,762
Hua Takhe, please.

173
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,490
Hurry up, please.

174
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,562
- Where do you think you're going? - Stop!

175
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,602
- Get over here! - No! Stop following me!

176
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,478
- Where are you going? - Leave me alone!

177
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,642
- It hurts! - Stop right there!

178
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:54,762
Stop! That hurts!

179
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:57,242
Yes, Aoy?

180
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,282
- No! - Stay right there!

181
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:00,562
No!

182
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,002
I'll be there in a few minutes.

183
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,130
Please hang it on your door.

184
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,042
Don't wait for me.

185
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:07,842
Thank you so much, Aoy.

186
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,982
- Stop! I give up! - Stay still!

187
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,481
(A car crashed into the barrier...)

188
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:19,363
Car accident. The patient is male, 23 years old.

189
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,161
Possible head injury. He's unconscious.

190
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:22,761
His Glasgow coma score is three.

191
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:24,761
Both his irises don't respond to light.

192
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:27,042
- Okay. - The patient is female, 25 years old.

193
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:28,522
No visible injury.

194
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:29,619
She probably wore a seat belt,

195
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,530
but she suffered a cardiac arrest on the scene.

196
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,562
She received CPR en route.

197
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,521
Here they come. Let's go!

198
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:38,842
This way, please.

199
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:40,783
Prim, Pleum, take that case.

200
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,202
I'll help too.

201
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:47,282
Shoan, Nick, put the defib monitor on and check the EKG.

202
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:49,282
See if he's non-shockable or not.

203
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,682
- Hurry. - I'll check the pulse.

204
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,682
- Prepare a tube. - Yes.

205
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:12,882
Both lungs are fine.

206
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:15,242
No pulse. EKG shows VF.

207
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:16,682
Prepare to defib.

208
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,002
Sir.

209
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,642
- Sir. - Charge to 200 joules.

210
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:24,522
- Shock. - Sir.

211
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:26,282
His Glasgow score is three.

212
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:27,634
Pleum, tube him.

213
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,282
Nurses, please continue his CPR.

214
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:31,922
Twenty-eight, 29, 30.

215
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:33,282
Pleum, tube him.

216
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,002
Still VF.

217
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:37,242
Charge.

218
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:39,882
Shock.

219
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:53,802
Doctor?

220
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,462
The patient is likely to be declared brain-dead.

221
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:06,802
He's on life support and stimulants to maintain his vital signs.

222
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,601
Six hours from now,

223
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:12,962
a team of doctors will evaluate him to confirm his brain death.

224
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,560
The reason I have to inform you first

225
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,483
is that we found that

226
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:25,362
your son is listed as an organ donor.

227
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:28,322
He had a very noble intention.

228
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,162
If something happens to him,

229
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,042
he will be able to save a lot more lives.

230
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:34,962
But in order to proceed,

231
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:38,482
his family has to grant us permission.

232
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:41,962
Please take the time to think about this.

233
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:45,842
I would like you to consider his noble intention.

234
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:48,362
No matter what the family's decision is,

235
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:51,722
we will proceed accordingly without fail.

236
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:55,482
What about the other patient's family?

237
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,282
They're not here yet, Professor.

238
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:00,602
You can tell me about her, Doctor.

239
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:03,482
She is like my own daughter.

240
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,162
What is her condition?

241
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:09,882
The patient who came with your son suffered a cardiac arrest.

242
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:15,162
We're using ECMO to maintain her condition.

243
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:19,642
We have to wait for detailed results from the lab,

244
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,922
and she needs to be transferred to the ICU

245
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:24,562
and placed under close observation.

246
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:27,922
Please allow me to continue treating the patients.

247
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:32,762
Are you okay, ma'am?

248
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:38,882
If you're okay, please excuse me.

249
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:05,642
How are Best and Pat doing?

250
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,402
How are Best and Pat doing?

251
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:10,162
Are they all right?

252
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:15,042
Pat's heart is not beating.

253
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,322
What about Best?

254
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,642
What about Best?

255
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:24,282
Best's brain-dead.

256
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:25,962
No...

257
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:29,562
That's not true.

258
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,002
Shoan is right.

259
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:43,282
The patient lost consciousness while driving due to severe myocarditis,

260
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,002
resulting in an accident.

261
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:47,522
We're lucky she received a good CPR.

262
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,962
Blood still flows to her brain.

263
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:51,002
Otherwise, she'd never wake up.

264
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,482
I think we can't save her with drugs alone.

265
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:57,962
We need a heart transplant immediately.

266
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,283
It's just me.

267
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,522
You dropped this back there.

268
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,122
Thank you, Doctor.

269
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,762
You look pale, Mrs. Yen. Are you ill?

270
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,242
I'm not. I'm fine.

271
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:30,042
- Okay. Then excuse me. - Yes.

272
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:35,402
Oh, there's something you should know.

273
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:38,362
I'm on my way to the Ministry to explain

274
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:39,962
what happened to Shoan.

275
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:43,242
I think it should go well.

276
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:45,402
That's all.

277
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,282
Doctor.

278
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:50,362
Well...

279
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:55,002
Now that Shoan doesn't recognize me,

280
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:58,042
if I change my job soon,

281
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,682
- I'd like you to... - Mrs. Yen.

282
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:06,122
I think it doesn't matter if Shoan recognizes you or not.

283
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:10,122
It's been 20 years

284
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,882
since you left him at the orphanage.

285
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:14,922
I don't know why you did that.

286
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:20,202
I think now

287
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,822
is the time for you to do the right thing.

288
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:26,282
You are his mother.

289
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:30,042
You are one of the few family members he has left.

290
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:34,242
You're someone I can't replace.

291
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,522
(Bloodwork Queuing)

292
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:12,202
Bank, did you take me here to see a doctor or to get your news?

293
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:13,722
It's both.

294
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,802
See? I told you I don't need to come here.

295
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:18,362
My belly only hurts a little. I don't need the hospital.

296
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:19,682
Yeah, just see the doctor.

297
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,122
They'll be done in five minutes.

298
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,922
It's not a big deal at all.

299
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:26,882
Five minutes with 100 queues is eight hours, right?

300
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,482
I can go to a nearby clinic for things like this.

301
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:32,122
Are you a doctor's wife or something? Why would you complain?

302
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:36,242
Stay here. I'll call you later.

303
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:05,674
- Doctor? - Yes.

304
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,378
The Minister told me the meeting will start a bit later.

305
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:12,221
May I ask what time do we start?

306
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:13,722
He didn't say.

307
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,962
Okay.

308
00:22:30,627 --> 00:22:33,322
(Dr. Prapas)

309
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:39,198
If you need an explanation from me,

310
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,590
you can tell my assistant.

311
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:43,986
You don't have to come all the way yourself.

312
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,842
I won't beat around the bush.

313
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:51,242
I need a heart to be changed for someone.

314
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:55,322
I've learned that there is a brain-dead patient here.

315
00:22:56,602 --> 00:22:58,162
I don't care what you do.

316
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,602
Just get his family to sign a consent ASAP.

317
00:23:03,704 --> 00:23:06,882
I don't know how you gained access to the patient

318
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,922
and donor information.

319
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:12,042
We have rules for this procedure.

320
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:16,282
I can't possibly pressure

321
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,362
the donor's family to give consent.

322
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:26,309
Or do you have any better reason for it?

323
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:28,842
The life of this patient

324
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,809
will decide the future of your autistic doctor

325
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,882
and your professor.

326
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:37,162
Your job is

327
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:39,282
to choose.

328
00:23:58,098 --> 00:23:59,631
Please check the trauma patient

329
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:02,842
who came in last night and is brain dead.

330
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:28,535
(Professor Win.)

331
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:29,721
(We have a donor.)

332
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,562
(He's right here in this hospital.)

333
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:38,922
Best, honey.

334
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:48,922
(The harvest team is ready.)

335
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,762
Mummim, please inform the Organ Donation Center.

336
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:56,482
Also, I need a CVT professor

337
00:24:56,602 --> 00:24:58,962
in the harvest team. Pleum and

338
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:01,482
Nick, go and help the harvest team.

339
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:02,882
The heart is good.

340
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:05,178
Please inform the recipient team.

341
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:08,722
Anesthetist, I need a systemic heparinization.

342
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,402
Give me 30,000 units.

343
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:15,242
Prim, Shoan, and Mummim.

344
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:17,522
Prepare the patient for the transplant team.

345
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:27,682
(The transplant team is now in the OR.)

346
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:33,282
Is Professor Archawin in the OR?

347
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:35,442
Connect me to him.

348
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,122
Professor Archawin.

349
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:43,350
Yes?

350
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:47,322
Professor Win.

351
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:50,242
From this moment, no matter what happens...

352
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,202
Yes, Director.

353
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:00,122
Everyone.

354
00:26:00,682 --> 00:26:03,722
This operation is being observed.

355
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:07,161
During these hours, I would like you

356
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:08,842
to do your best.

357
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:10,842
Come on. Let's save the patient.

358
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,202
Yes.

359
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:16,162
Now, we will begin cutting her chest open

360
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,718
and prepare to receive the incoming heart.

361
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,902
Blade.

362
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:35,762
Your orchids are in serious condition.

363
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,482
I think you need to replace them.

364
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,042
Three minutes of heparin is now done.

365
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,682
Prepare to canorate the ascending aorta.

366
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:52,922
Aortic cross clamp, please.

367
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,722
Cross clamp on.

368
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:00,602
Cardioplegia is working.

369
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:02,602
Ice, please.

370
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,650
Cardioplegia is good.

371
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,442
Prepare a metzenbaum.

372
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:21,242
Nick, help me with the suction.

373
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:24,002
- Yes, Professor. - Suck the blood out.

374
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,245
The heart is out.

375
00:27:34,326 --> 00:27:36,082
Container, please.

376
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,442
Put it on ice.

377
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,162
Yes, Professor.

378
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,042
Come on. We're too late! Move!

379
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:49,482
Where are they now?

380
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,282
Fact News?

381
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:54,794
How did they get this video?

382
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:57,042
Change of plans.

383
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:58,802
Don't chase the autistic doctor.

384
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:00,242
Let's chase this one.

385
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:02,602
Tell Mr. Doang this.

386
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:07,042
If this is how he performs his duty as a father, don't.

387
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:11,602
That family did more for Pat than her own father.

388
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:34,362
- Yes? - Doctor.

389
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:37,522
The Minister said this meeting was canceled.

390
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,042
Oh?

391
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,882
- Really? - Yes.

392
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,482
Thank you.

393
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,442
(The number you dialed cannot be reached...)

394
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:07,082
Hello? This is Dr. Prapas.

395
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:08,682
Is Director Sirin there?

396
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:11,482
(She's in a meeting with a guest from the Ministry.)

397
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,402
Thank you.

398
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:35,522
(It's been 20 years)

399
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:38,002
since you left him at the orphanage.

400
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,082
I don't know why you did that.

401
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,442
Please take care of him for now, Mr. Kob.

402
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:48,322
I have to work, so I don't have time for him.

403
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:51,122
Next month, I'll come and pick him up.

404
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:08,722
(It doesn't matter if Shoan recognizes you or not.)

405
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:12,242
You are his mother.

406
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:15,482
You're someone I can't replace.

407
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:20,642
I think now is the time for you to do the right thing.

408
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,642
(Tell Mr. Doang this.)

409
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:38,762
(If this is how he performs his duty as a father, )

410
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,842
(don't.)

411
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:45,282
(That family did more for Pat than her own father.)

412
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:48,322
I'll tell the news outlets

413
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,419
to delete that post ASAP, sir.

414
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:02,282
Get some men to guard the operating zone.

415
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,122
No outsiders allowed.

416
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,642
Focus, everyone.

417
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:39,882
Prim.

418
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:43,003
This is your second chance.

419
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:45,346
This time, we'll succeed together, okay?

420
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:48,122
Shoan, help Prim check carefully.

421
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,522
If you see anything unexpected,

422
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,682
say it immediately.

423
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:51,962
Yes.

424
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:02,610
The new heart is here.

425
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:10,122
Aortic clamp, please.

426
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,162
Stitch.

427
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:23,370
We'll start with the left atrium.

428
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:29,202
Next is inferior vena cava.

429
00:32:33,682 --> 00:32:35,962
Onto superior vena cava.

430
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:39,554
And pulmonary artery.

431
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:45,242
I will now connect the aorta.

432
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,602
Now, we will begin de-airing.

433
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,362
(Let the air out of all chambers.)

434
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:17,762
Rewarm.

435
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:22,482
She needs methylprednisolone before you take off the aortic cross-clamp.

436
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,002
That doctor seems more normal than I expected.

437
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:41,482
He is. What makes him special is on the inside.

438
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,842
Well, ma'am.

439
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,882
Doctor Shoan is in surgery. I don't know when it will be finished.

440
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:04,362
It's fine. I can wait.

441
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,882
If that's the case,

442
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:14,122
it's worth helping him out after all.

443
00:34:16,113 --> 00:34:19,202
You seem to understand what's worth it and what's not.

444
00:34:19,762 --> 00:34:24,642
Why does the hospital always take heavy losses every year?

445
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:30,162
I'm sorry. I might have been too honest.

446
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:33,322
I just wanted to say

447
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:36,482
only money and power

448
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:38,962
could protect you

449
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:41,202
and what you want to protect.

450
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,882
That's not true for the heart

451
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:52,522
that's being transplanted into your daughter.

452
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:00,122
Please accept my condolences.

453
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:04,722
The doctors have declared the patient brain-dead.

454
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:06,802
He will never

455
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,562
recover and live his life again.

456
00:35:12,332 --> 00:35:14,842
This is the paper

457
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,842
detailing the doctor's evaluation.

458
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:21,562
On the back is his will

459
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:23,482
to donate organs.

460
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:25,722
Could you please

461
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:29,042
consider this carefully and take your time?

462
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:33,562
Nevertheless, please keep his noble intention in mind.

463
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,322
I promise

464
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:22,962
that his noble intention will save other lives.

465
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,642
We will do our best.

466
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:27,962
For you, you think power helps...

467
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:29,722
The life of this patient

468
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,522
is the future of your autistic doctor

469
00:36:34,617 --> 00:36:36,057
and your professor.

470
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:38,962
Some people think money can save them.

471
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:41,922
It's an undeniable truth.

472
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:44,722
But this is a hospital.

473
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:47,342
We still have hope for the good of humans.

474
00:36:47,423 --> 00:36:50,681
That family gave Pat their son's heart.

475
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:52,322
Best, no...

476
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:53,602
Best...

477
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:56,202
Those outside the bloodline

478
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,442
were the ones who saved Pat,

479
00:36:58,727 --> 00:37:00,727
even before her own father came to his senses.

480
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:02,682
If doctors lose hope,

481
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:04,762
they lose their strength to save anyone.

482
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:09,402
Please check the trauma patient who came in last night and is brain dead.

483
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:13,602
(His family signed a consent with Dr. Phruek this morning.)

484
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:17,082
(Professor Archawin is performing a heart transplant as we speak.)

485
00:37:17,642 --> 00:37:23,202
Please remind them to treat the patient's family with utmost respect.

486
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:26,162
Professor Win.

487
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:29,262
This is not a normal situation.

488
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:32,242
From this moment, no matter what happens,

489
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:34,562
please do your best to save the patient.

490
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:36,042
Yes, Director.

491
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:43,962
Aren't you too optimistic?

492
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,962
Everyone is just doing their job.

493
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,572
What about your job?

494
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:05,709
Okay. Anastomosis is done. The cross-clamp is off.

495
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:07,134
- Prim, take it from here. - Yes.

496
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:08,342
Yes, Professor.

497
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,522
The BP is dropping fast!

498
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:20,802
We need to stop the bleeding.

499
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:22,842
Spatula, please.

500
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:37,482
- What's going on? - The patient is bleeding.

501
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:39,442
The doctors are looking for the cause.

502
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:42,162
They are trying to stop the bleeding.

503
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,122
Her blood isn't coagulating.

504
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:48,842
We probably need PCC.

505
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:51,442
The patient is here on basic rights.

506
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:55,042
What are the nurses saying?

507
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:56,563
Why aren't they doing anything?

508
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,722
The patient is receiving treatment on basic rights.

509
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,842
The drug she needs is not on the basic list.

510
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:02,642
Is this the time to talk about money?

511
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,802
Only the patient's family

512
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:07,282
can grant permission to use that drug.

513
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:16,562
Darn it! You are doctors!

514
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:18,562
How expensive can the drug be?

515
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:20,682
I'm the patient's father. I'll pay for it all!

516
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:26,442
Here's 1,500 units of PCC, Professor.

517
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,482
The PCC is working.

518
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:42,482
Her blood is starting to coagulate.

519
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:47,514
Have you seen the reality now?

520
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:49,872
You said you would pay

521
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:52,122
any amount for your daughter

522
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:54,203
for the best treatment available.

523
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,442
Some people can't afford to pay for that.

524
00:39:57,602 --> 00:40:00,482
They place their hope in the hospital and its doctors.

525
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,402
Sometimes, the hospital has to help them out.

526
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:06,521
We would like patients to receive treatments that are up to standards

527
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,842
and to survive safely.

528
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:10,442
This is the answer

529
00:40:10,523 --> 00:40:13,042
to why our hospital takes losses.

530
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,002
I agree

531
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:18,842
patients should have access to good treatments that are up to standards

532
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:20,282
and equally so.

533
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:22,562
At the same time, our staff

534
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:24,802
should receive good protection

535
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,122
and equally so.

536
00:40:29,522 --> 00:40:31,802
That is your job.

537
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,362
Professor, the blood we prepared is not enough.

538
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:41,912
Tell the blood bank. We need blood now. We can't wait.

539
00:40:41,993 --> 00:40:43,192
Yes, Professor.

540
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:48,602
Professor, the blood bank said we only have two more bags.

541
00:40:48,754 --> 00:40:51,242
The patient's blood type is O-negative.

542
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,682
We have to make that work somehow.

543
00:40:54,842 --> 00:40:56,242
Yes, Professor.

544
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:00,082
You can't go in.

545
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:02,282
I need to deliver blood to the patient inside.

546
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,442
You can't.

547
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,042
You need permission from my boss.

548
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:07,042
The patient inside is in danger!

549
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:09,162
What permission do I need?

550
00:41:09,441 --> 00:41:10,922
Are you guys out of your mind?

551
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:14,282
- Whoa! - Get him!

552
00:41:14,363 --> 00:41:17,882
Let me go! They can't wait any longer! Hey!

553
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:22,042
The patient is in danger! What permission do I need? Are you nuts?

554
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:26,962
- Call security. Take him. - I have to...

555
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:31,482
(What you're doing is wrong.)

556
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,162
(You need to let him in to deliver the blood now.)

557
00:41:34,282 --> 00:41:36,242
(You should not prevent a life-saving procedure.)

558
00:41:36,322 --> 00:41:39,002
(You should not raise your voice as it might distract the doctors.)

559
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:52,562
Blood is here.

560
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,842
Defib, 20 joules.

561
00:42:18,772 --> 00:42:20,242
Twenty joules.

562
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:24,202
One, two, three. Clear.

563
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:25,682
How's it looking?

564
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:28,642
It's in sinus rhythm now, Professor.

565
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,594
The operation was a success.

566
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:28,962
The patient is now in the CCU as we monitor her condition.

567
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,322
If you want to visit her, you can.

568
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:41,482
Thank you, doctors,

569
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:43,659
for taking good care of my daughter.

570
00:43:45,553 --> 00:43:47,522
It's a doctor's job, sir.

571
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,642
We should take our leaves.

572
00:43:51,802 --> 00:43:53,242
We still have work to do.

573
00:43:56,642 --> 00:43:57,882
Let's go.

574
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,722
Um, ma'am.

575
00:44:35,913 --> 00:44:37,962
Would you like to leave a note?

576
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:39,882
I'll give it to him.

577
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:45,226
- Yes. - Here.

578
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,402
Here.

579
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:00,730
- Okay. - Please give this to Dr. Shoan.

580
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:02,042
I will.

581
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:04,362
- Don't forget. - Yes.

582
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:05,962
- I won't. - Thank you.

583
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:07,202
Yes.

584
00:45:25,507 --> 00:45:27,507
The patient's relative is allowed

585
00:45:27,802 --> 00:45:29,482
to look closely.

586
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:45,522
A relative?

587
00:45:47,554 --> 00:45:49,442
Maybe I'm just a relative, as you said.

588
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,202
I didn't raise her, right?

589
00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:01,202
Half of her genes

590
00:46:01,577 --> 00:46:03,042
came from you.

591
00:46:03,272 --> 00:46:04,602
Therefore,

592
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:07,802
biologically speaking, you're her father.

593
00:46:09,682 --> 00:46:11,882
However, emotionally speaking, it's complicated.

594
00:46:12,094 --> 00:46:13,734
I once heard that

595
00:46:14,762 --> 00:46:16,322
some people have children,

596
00:46:16,538 --> 00:46:18,658
but their children don't consider them their parents.

597
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:21,762
Some are not fathers by blood,

598
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:24,202
but they can be considered fathers too.

599
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:29,162
Why did you not raise your daughter?

600
00:46:36,986 --> 00:46:38,682
Because I was selfish.

601
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:41,562
I just left her

602
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:43,502
because I wanted power.

603
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,962
I wanted important positions.

604
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:53,122
An illegitimate child

605
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,122
is still your child.

606
00:46:57,611 --> 00:46:59,642
Are you criticizing me?

607
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:02,442
I'm not.

608
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:05,282
I just agree with you

609
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:08,842
about your selfishness.

610
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:12,962
Today, you did very well.

611
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:14,962
I did?

612
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:16,722
What did I do well?

613
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:19,124
You realized you were wrong,

614
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:21,242
and you fixed it immediately.

615
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:24,602
Just like us.

616
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:28,578
We realized there was something wrong with her heart,

617
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:30,642
and we fixed it immediately.

618
00:47:42,482 --> 00:47:44,442
The patient's father is allowed

619
00:47:45,649 --> 00:47:47,722
to visit her inside.

620
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:51,562
Please excuse me.

621
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,722
Wait, Doctor.

622
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,482
I think I now understand

623
00:48:00,442 --> 00:48:02,402
what Director Sirin said about you.

624
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,033
You can go.

625
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,842
Yes.

626
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:31,065
The deal is off.

627
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,242
Leave GMC alone,

628
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:36,602
especially Dr. Shoan.

629
00:48:37,202 --> 00:48:38,682
This is not a request.

630
00:48:39,243 --> 00:48:40,722
This is an order.

631
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,562
Do you understand, Anat?

632
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:53,571
Enough. I've already spent all my energy for this month.

633
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:55,202
I can't anymore.

634
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:58,242
By the way, Shoan, you were awesome.

635
00:48:58,451 --> 00:48:59,850
Thank you.

636
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:08,042
Hello?

637
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:10,562
Oh? Okay. Wait a minute, please.

638
00:49:12,322 --> 00:49:15,482
Guys. It's

639
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:18,242
the karaoke I booked. Are you guys still up for it?

640
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:20,282
I thought a professor called.

641
00:49:20,482 --> 00:49:22,482
- Let's go then. - Of course!

642
00:49:22,563 --> 00:49:24,202
You scared me.

643
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:26,882
Confirmed. It's at eight o'clock.

644
00:49:27,002 --> 00:49:28,442
Yes. Goodbye.

645
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:32,031
- Aren't you tired? - Let's go, Prim.

646
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:34,122
Guys, let's meet up in ten minutes.

647
00:49:35,028 --> 00:49:37,442
- Let's go. - Dr. Shoan.

648
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:41,362
A maid, I don't know her name. She left a note for you.

649
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:43,682
Thank you.

650
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:12,482
(Hello, Aunt Yen?)

651
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:16,402
Good afternoon.

652
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,657
Cheers!

653
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:35,377
- Hey, hey! - (Singing in gibberish.)

654
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:41,802
(Singing in gibberish.)

655
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:46,602
(Singing in gibberish.)

656
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:49,442
Thank you.

657
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:52,161
Join me with a second mic!

658
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:59,002
(Singing in gibberish.)

659
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,360
- (Singing in gibberish.) - Hey!

660
00:51:01,443 --> 00:51:02,842
Wait a second!

661
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,762
Can we turn the lights on?

662
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:07,282
It's too dark. I want to see the show.

663
00:51:07,387 --> 00:51:08,907
- What? - It won't be a disco, then!

664
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:11,401
I want to see the show.

665
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:13,522
Give me a special show, okay?

666
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:24,931
Win.

667
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:27,962
She...

668
00:51:28,782 --> 00:51:30,402
May transferred to another hospital.

669
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:35,955
She told me not to tell you.

670
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:37,562
Why?

671
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:40,962
She also said

672
00:51:43,657 --> 00:51:45,602
she didn't want to see your face again.

673
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:50,882
Win.

674
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:52,962
Answer me honestly.

675
00:51:54,993 --> 00:51:56,762
You already have May.

676
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,602
Why would you go after Dr. Prim?

677
00:52:01,562 --> 00:52:02,722
Prim?

678
00:52:03,722 --> 00:52:05,202
What does Prim have to do with this?

679
00:52:13,077 --> 00:52:15,696
(The words that you explain, )

680
00:52:15,788 --> 00:52:21,422
- She's starting! - (I only hear one thing.)

681
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:24,282
("You don't love me.")

682
00:52:24,363 --> 00:52:29,082
(So now what do I do?)

683
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:31,251
Guys, I'll say this right here.

684
00:52:31,362 --> 00:52:34,202
I won't date anyone before I become a professor.

685
00:52:34,297 --> 00:52:36,857
- Hey, we'll hold you to that! - You said it!

686
00:52:37,002 --> 00:52:38,042
Cheers!

687
00:52:38,123 --> 00:52:40,282
- It's a promise! - Shoan, come on!

688
00:52:40,434 --> 00:52:41,722
Shoan!

689
00:52:42,254 --> 00:52:45,042
True love doesn't exist, understand?

690
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,922
- Understood. - Why would you agree with her?

691
00:52:50,277 --> 00:52:54,202
Her next stage is about getting possessed by a Japanese ghost.

692
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,682
Dr. Mim, we have guests!

693
00:52:56,842 --> 00:52:58,842
"Welcome! How many guests?"

694
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:00,522
"Yes! Four guests? Yes, sir!"

695
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:02,482
"Please come in!"

696
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:06,682
- Cheers! - Let's drink!

697
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:09,962
Shoan, be honest. Have you ever had a drink?

698
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,362
I've never had a drink.

699
00:53:12,835 --> 00:53:14,162
Do you want to try?

700
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:19,362
- Hey, you! - Why would you say that? Now we have to try!

701
00:53:19,506 --> 00:53:21,682
I happen to have a glass.

702
00:53:21,793 --> 00:53:24,787
I happen to have a bottle opener.

703
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:27,342
- Stop. That's enough. - Okay.

704
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,682
Stop.

705
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:32,962
Bingo! Boging!

706
00:53:35,323 --> 00:53:37,777
Don't drink if you don't want to. It's okay.

707
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:39,122
I'm fine.

708
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,282
He said, "Ahh!"

709
00:53:58,418 --> 00:54:02,289
- That means one more! - Hey!

710
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:04,584
- Let's go. - Stop. That's enough.

711
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:06,722
Just a little.

712
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:11,242
No. This is his first time. Don't make him drink like this.

713
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:12,922
- His first time? - Yeah.

714
00:54:13,027 --> 00:54:16,882
- Stop already. - Dr. Prim, but there he is.

715
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:19,802
- What? - Look at him.

716
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:23,842
- Shoan, slow down. - Bottoms up! And then...

717
00:54:31,055 --> 00:54:33,242
- Refreshing... - I'm okay.

718
00:54:34,682 --> 00:54:36,322
Are you really okay?

719
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:20,842
Hey! Shoan!

720
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,442
- Are you okay, Pleum? - We're fine.

721
00:55:33,745 --> 00:55:37,162
Dr. Pleum, I don't feel so good.

722
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:39,531
If you're going to throw up, do it here.

723
00:55:39,762 --> 00:55:42,162
No, it's not that.

724
00:55:48,593 --> 00:55:51,842
I have tachycardia. I need an EKG check.

725
00:55:51,923 --> 00:55:54,042
- I need an EKG check. - Hey, hey.

726
00:55:55,865 --> 00:55:57,185
How long have you had this?

727
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,769
Not long.

728
00:56:07,223 --> 00:56:08,882
Does it only happen when

729
00:56:09,225 --> 00:56:10,722
you see someone?

730
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,442
How do you know that?

731
00:56:19,355 --> 00:56:20,882
You little boy.

732
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:23,802
This is called falling in love.

733
00:56:28,362 --> 00:56:30,802
By the way, who is it?

734
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:36,522
Dr. Pleum, you're suspicious.

735
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,042
Shoan!

736
00:56:38,964 --> 00:56:41,322
Come on, tell me. Hey, hey!

737
00:56:49,016 --> 00:56:51,282
Good morning, Dr. Rapper.

738
00:56:54,362 --> 00:56:55,842
Good morning, Somrak.

739
00:56:58,025 --> 00:56:59,202
Yo.

740
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:03,657
Yes. Yo! What's up? Very cool.

741
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:06,338
What's going on? Tell me.

742
00:57:07,462 --> 00:57:08,842
Last night,

743
00:57:08,977 --> 00:57:11,522
I saw Dr. Shoan's other side.

744
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,162
All I can say is it's so cute!

745
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:16,422
Why haven't I heard about this?

746
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:17,922
What did you do?

747
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,908
You were on a shift last night, right?

748
00:57:23,922 --> 00:57:27,922
- (What's the cabinet's opinion on rights to treatment?) - You missed.

749
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:31,082
(It's not certain yet.)

750
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:34,482
(My job is to get the cabinet to agree that these rights)

751
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:36,608
- (need to be changed...) - What about that? Is that cute?

752
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:38,602
(to suit the advancement in medicine.)

753
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,602
We will consider the quality of life of the people and hospital workers.

754
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:44,362
(What about your divorce?)

755
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:47,169
They didn't let me in to deliver blood.

756
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:48,682
I was so mad.

757
00:57:49,402 --> 00:57:52,122
(This is me making it right.)

758
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:53,642
(To your daughter, right?)

759
00:57:54,697 --> 00:57:56,962
(Yes. I have two children.)

760
00:57:57,737 --> 00:57:59,122
(It's good you bring this up.)

761
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:02,842
(I'm going to file a lawsuit against the outlets)

762
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:04,962
(and journalists who published this.)

763
00:58:05,122 --> 00:58:06,442
(That's the first thing.)

764
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,882
(They violated my privacy.)

765
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,281
(What about the autistic doctor's medical competence?)

766
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:13,742
(What's your opinion on that?)

767
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,125
(I have investigated this matter myself.)

768
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:18,402
(I found that the doctor is competent.)

769
00:58:18,722 --> 00:58:22,376
He has outstanding abilities and morals as a doctor.

770
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,242
- Awesome! - Good morning. This is Ward 4A.

771
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:29,722
Dr. Shoan, someone is here to see you in OPD.

772
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:35,882
Shoan!

773
00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:38,282
I know you're here!

774
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:40,162
Come out right now!

775
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:41,722
Come out!

776
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:44,402
- Show yourself! - Sir!

777
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,810
- Please stop. - Did you want to see me, sir?

778
00:59:00,482 --> 00:59:02,162
I finally found you.

779
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:38,322
We're lucky he didn't recognize me!

780
00:59:38,419 --> 00:59:41,633
That ungrateful brat forgot his own parents?

781
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,122
Hey, it's okay.

782
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:45,562
Where is my dad?

783
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:47,329
How did she get that bruise?

784
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:49,321
She was naughty, right?

785
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:52,082
The patient is likely abused.

786
00:59:52,242 --> 00:59:55,522
Keep it? You can't even take care of yourself!

787
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,378
- Mummim, stitch the wound for Shoan. - Yes, Professor.

788
00:59:57,402 --> 01:00:00,313
The kid is naughty. Don't you understand?

789
01:00:00,402 --> 01:00:01,753
I don't like it when Dad comes home.

790
01:00:01,777 --> 01:00:04,219
- I don't like it when Dad comes home. - What are you crying for?

791
01:00:04,243 --> 01:00:05,402
Stop!

792
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:07,122
Shoan, focus on my voice.

793
01:00:07,243 --> 01:00:09,063
- You deserve a slap... - Shoan, stay back.

794
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:11,682
- to cure your stupidity! - Don't hit my mom!
