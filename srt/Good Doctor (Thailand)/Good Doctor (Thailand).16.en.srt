1
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:18,078
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:30,402
The patient has underlying HOCM, she can't afford to lose too much blood.

3
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,409
We must remove the lump while controlling blood vessels to stop bleeding.

4
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:37,522
We can do balloon occlusion within the internal iliac artery.

5
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,082
Is that possible, Professor?

6
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,242
It is. Good idea, Shoan.

7
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,922
Vital signs are good.

8
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,722
- Prepare to close her abdomen. - Yes.

9
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:54,682
Thank you

10
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:56,522
for saving my wife.

11
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:58,802
A doctor's job is to save lives.

12
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,122
(Please allow me )

13
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,282
(to look at you like this for the rest of my life.)

14
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:35,162
(It wasn't supposed to happen here.)

15
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,642
For you.

16
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,122
It's a thank-you gift for attending OPD for me the other day.

17
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,042
A cardiology stethoscope?

18
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:55,162
Take good care of it.

19
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,722
This is a very important item for a doctor.

20
00:03:02,177 --> 00:03:03,282
Yes.

21
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:05,002
Oh yeah, Mom.

22
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:09,122
He has high-functioning autism.

23
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,639
A stethoscope is not what's important.

24
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,858
It's what's between the earbuds.

25
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:27,602
(Episode 16: Echocardiogram)

26
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,002
Beautiful. Next pose, please.

27
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:36,482
Next one.

28
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,602
Next one.

29
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,522
Act like you're laughing.

30
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,282
Do you have another one?

31
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:02,922
Great. Look at the camera. One, two...

32
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,482
Okay. Is it good?

33
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,562
Get closer together. Look at the camera. Smile.

34
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,639
Look at each other's faces.

35
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,193
Hold each other's hand.

36
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,202
One, two...

37
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,562
And now...

38
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,200
Now, let's move to another spot.

39
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:37,202
What? What are you smiling for?

40
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:41,202
I thought of one patient that I just met.

41
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:44,602
They said they would be disappointed if they didn't get married.

42
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:48,042
What's with you today?

43
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,202
I'm serious.

44
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,562
I think if I never get to marry you in this life,

45
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,602
I'd have to live the rest of my life

46
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,322
in so much regret.

47
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:12,762
You can see that the gallbladder wall is really thick.

48
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,682
It seems there's inflammation.

49
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,542
We'll remove the inflamed gallbladder wall.

50
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:22,082
Then, put it in the bag.

51
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:24,522
We'll remove it with the access port.

52
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,882
- Yes. - Okay.

53
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,082
Okay, let's remove the gallbladder.

54
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,082
Kidney tray, please.

55
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:56,482
Okay.

56
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,922
Shoan, get a half-cm suture.

57
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:06,042
We'll close the wound. Vicryl 4-0, please.

58
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:08,682
Let Shoan close it.

59
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:34,362
(Prim - Do you want to go buy presents for Professor Win tomorrow?)

60
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:02,362
This is our OR schedule for the month.

61
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,922
Thank you.

62
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,242
Thanks.

63
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,842
Your food is here.

64
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:15,042
- Thank you. - Thank you.

65
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,802
- Here you are, Pleum. - Thanks.

66
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:21,442
Wow, Shoan.

67
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:24,122
When are you going to sleep or eat with this?

68
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,562
When I'm hungry and sleepy.

69
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,722
You're probably talking about my OR schedule, right?

70
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,682
I'll answer again.

71
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:41,202
I like to operate.

72
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,802
Like, all day long?

73
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,962
No one is going to buy presents with me this Saturday?

74
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:53,082
No one has replied back to me at all.

75
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:01,242
- I have my shift. - I'll go. After two pm, right?

76
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,082
- Okay. - What about you, Shoan?

77
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:05,082
I'm going.

78
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,842
- Good. Thank you. - I have to go now.

79
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:10,202
Where?

80
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,762
There's surgery for advanced liver cancer.

81
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:29,602
He's so motivated.

82
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,282
He's full of energy now.

83
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:34,922
Who ordered this liver?

84
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,842
Shoan was the one who wrote what we should order himself.

85
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:44,162
- Unbelievable. - Shoan is cool, though.

86
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,520
If he likes something, he truly likes it.

87
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:48,802
He has always been interested in surgery.

88
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:51,362
He probably has seen everything in his first year.

89
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:55,482
Heart, liver, kidney, lungs. I don't even get to see that much.

90
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:57,843
What?

91
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:59,659
Do you want to join the OR more often?

92
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,105
Not really.

93
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,162
He's just talented.

94
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,482
Are you jealous?

95
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:07,002
Well...

96
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:10,050
- If you want more, I can help you. - It's fine.

97
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:11,682
Okay.

98
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:12,962
It's fine.

99
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:15,433
(Surgery)

100
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,122
(Reception)

101
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,402
Fifth floor.

102
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:34,722
The fifth floor, please push it for me.

103
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,722
What's this?

104
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:49,464
What are they thinking? Letting a 12 to 15-year-old kid

105
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:51,193
get a cervical cancer vaccine injection?

106
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,362
If someone sees a girl

107
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:57,122
waiting for a pelvic exam,

108
00:11:57,212 --> 00:12:00,122
people would gossip about her.

109
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,322
It's for protection.

110
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,202
This is for protection.

111
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:09,442
More Thai women have passed away from cervical cancer every year.

112
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:13,962
Cervical cancer is one of a few cancers that we have a vaccine for.

113
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:17,442
The period that the vaccine will be the most effective

114
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,193
is around 12-15 years old.

115
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:21,257
It's not embarrassing for you to go to

116
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:22,762
Obstetrics-Gynecology.

117
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,362
Your health is more important

118
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,642
than what other people would think.

119
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:28,082
And...

120
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:30,042
If you need to ask for someone's help,

121
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:32,202
you should be polite.

122
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:50,762
I'll take my leave first. Goodbye.

123
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,162
Shoan.

124
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,082
For Professor Win's wedding,

125
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,067
do you want to change the style of your outfit?

126
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,002
You've worn the same outfit every day.

127
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:05,562
But I like it this way. It's clean and convenient.

128
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,162
Shoan is wearing a shirt, long pants, and sneakers.

129
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:14,162
Does he even need that much stuff?

130
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,042
True.

131
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,842
Don't you want to try changing it up?

132
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,522
Like, your shoes. Do you like

133
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,502
to be like a soldier? Or like...

134
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,922
A routine?

135
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:26,642
It's cheap.

136
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,882
Did you buy them when they were on sale?

137
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:36,362
It's not about the price. It's just right.

138
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,922
Professor Prapas said

139
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,522
our first step is important.

140
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:45,824
If it's right,

141
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:47,602
your next step will be right as well.

142
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,002
Huh?

143
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:54,722
Hey, Mr. Shoan.

144
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:57,722
Can you at least let me say something cool too?

145
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,322
Well, are we leaving?

146
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,722
- Yes. - See you, everyone.

147
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,522
Where are you going?

148
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:07,042
Secret.

149
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:52,602
Dr. Prim.

150
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,042
Did you get a haircut?

151
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,962
Do you like me?

152
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:28,162
What I wanted to ask was if you like my hair.

153
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,962
Yesterday, Dr. Pleum took me to a barber and bought me a new bag and shoes.

154
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,082
It's nice.

155
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,842
- Really? - Yes.

156
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,362
Nick is going to bring his girlfriend as well.

157
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:50,122
Will you feel awkward?

158
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:51,682
If you feel that, you can tell me.

159
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:53,202
I'll just call Nick.

160
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,122
Who's she?

161
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,882
I don't know who she is.

162
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:04,522
- Prim, Shoan. - Oh.

163
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,841
- Oh, Miss Charm, hello. - Hello, Miss Charm.

164
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:10,322
Hello, Dr. Prim. Hello, Dr. Shoan.

165
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:13,242
Miss Charm is Dr. Nick's girlfriend?

166
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,162
I don't feel awkward.

167
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,242
Okay.

168
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,122
I was going to tell you at first,

169
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:23,202
but you seemed busy, so I didn't tell you.

170
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,402
It's not like I'd say anything.

171
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:27,379
When you're not in your hospital outfit,

172
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,791
you look pretty cute, Dr. Shoan. You too, Dr. Prim.

173
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,602
- Thank you. - Thank you.

174
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,522
What about shoes?

175
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:44,802
This looks good.

176
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,042
- Yeah. - I think I'll take it.

177
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:01,322
You should wear them too.

178
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:19,635
Should we buy a skateboard for Professor Archawin?

179
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:22,346
- You're being nonsense. - He doesn't skate.

180
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:24,675
Let's look at something else.

181
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:34,768
Should we get it for us?

182
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:37,362
- Why would you want that? - The yellow one is cute.

183
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:53,190
Thank you.

184
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,762
We can split up for now. Let's regroup later.

185
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,002
- Yes. - See you.

186
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,369
Okay.

187
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:16,562
Do you want to play?

188
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,322
- Yes. - You're good at calculating, aren't you?

189
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,002
You should try this.

190
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:50,402
Another one. You can get it in one more try.

191
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,140
You're out of money, aren't you?

192
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,242
I've taken it out for you.

193
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:38,762
I chose the small one

194
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:41,042
so that it won't affect your allergy.

195
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,002
Thank you so much.

196
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:54,042
Let's go.

197
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,722
You took too long.

198
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:04,282
Your dog is sick.

199
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:05,562
I'd like to check it.

200
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:09,602
Excuse me, he's really a doctor, just not a vet.

201
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:11,562
Please don't worry.

202
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:28,482
This is bad.

203
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:30,193
It's possible that it has a heart disease.

204
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:32,642
You have to take it to see a vet.

205
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:36,042
- Yes. - Shoan. I'm sorry.

206
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,762
Shoan! How could you say that to her?

207
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,362
Anyone would be shocked when you suddenly told them like that.

208
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:47,522
I'm sorry.

209
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:52,482
Do you know how to check on animals?

210
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:58,162
When I was studying, I liked to go to a vet hospital when I was free.

211
00:21:58,298 --> 00:22:01,962
Well, why didn't you become a vet then?

212
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:07,402
I can't. I'm too similar to animals.

213
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:14,714
Animals and I can't communicate with people.

214
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:17,022
They should have a person who understands

215
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,402
and can communicate on their behalf.

216
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:33,002
Okay.

217
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:40,922
You spent a lot of time with the claw machine.

218
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:47,042
Dr. Prim, are you mad that I caused you not to get to look around?

219
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:51,502
I'm not mad. Forget it. Let's go. Nick is waiting.

220
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:54,322
Come on.

221
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:59,141
I got a new bag. Don't you think it's pretty?

222
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,762
- It's pretty. - I got this for my new costume.

223
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,322
- That's nice. - Right?

224
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:18,242
Thank you.

225
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:27,162
What's this? Are you acting like a gentleman now?

226
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,402
This is new to me.

227
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,322
Well, Nick is always gentle like this.

228
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:44,082
I'd just be gentle with people that I want to be gentle with.

229
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,882
When you say that yourself, it sounds strange to me.

230
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:52,522
- Is it a Kuman Thong or something? - Yeah.

231
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:55,002
- I won't bother you anymore. - What are you saying?

232
00:23:56,322 --> 00:23:59,042
- They're showing off... - I...

233
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:01,642
This place is loud. I feel uncomfortable.

234
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,882
I'll go wait outside. You don't have to come out with me.

235
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:12,642
He's probably a maniac.

236
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:15,489
- Why would they take him out? - Look at the other one.

237
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:18,282
How could she dare to come out with that kind of face?

238
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:23,602
- It's so funny. - Excuse me.

239
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:28,842
If your manner and words are still like this,

240
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:32,202
I think you guys are the ones who should stay home.

241
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:35,922
Why are you coming out here to embarrass yourself?

242
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,691
Excuse me.

243
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:46,402
Bill, please.

244
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:06,362
- I'm so tired of it. - What's wrong?

245
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:11,402
If it were you, would you take it? It's old-fashioned now.

246
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:13,762
- I don't care. - What?

247
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:19,522
- I don't want to. - If I pay you, would you dare to cut my hair?

248
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,882
- Shoan? - If I see them...

249
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:23,562
Let's go.

250
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:25,602
I'll slap them first.

251
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,562
- Yes. - We still have the ER shift.

252
00:25:57,362 --> 00:25:59,642
Aside from facial expression,

253
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:02,882
a sigh can be a signal to show

254
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:05,042
that you're feeling uncomfortable, right?

255
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:06,882
Did I get that right?

256
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:13,322
You were sighing earlier.

257
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:15,522
- Me? - Yes.

258
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,562
It's like this.

259
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,082
When people sigh,

260
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,442
there are different types of sighs.

261
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:37,122
Sometimes, you sigh because you feel relaxed or relieved.

262
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:38,770
You're just breathing out.

263
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,122
It's like when you're listening to a patient.

264
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:49,562
Listening to their lungs or heart. It can be different, right?

265
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:01,242
I don't get it.

266
00:27:19,242 --> 00:27:20,682
What are you doing?

267
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:26,242
I'm trying to discern the different types of sighs.

268
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:36,282
Hey, Shoan, listen.

269
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:39,282
When you sigh,

270
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,682
it is...

271
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,722
It will be

272
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:46,242
about emotions as well.

273
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:48,882
For example, you might...

274
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:53,077
Like I said, you might sigh because you feel relaxed.

275
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:56,361
If you feel uncomfortable, you can sigh as well.

276
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,082
It's about emotions. That can be a delicate matter.

277
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:00,962
How should I explain?

278
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:04,562
It's like...

279
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:08,593
When you're excited, scared, or surprised,

280
00:28:08,676 --> 00:28:10,635
your heart will beat faster.

281
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:15,562
But when you don't feel anything, it'll just beat normally.

282
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:19,642
They might be similar to each other, but they're not the same.

283
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,002
I understand that.

284
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:25,762
Now, we can prove that I'm fine.

285
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:27,602
Nothing is wrong with me.

286
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:29,122
Listen.

287
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,162
Got it?

288
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:56,762
I got it.

289
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,851
There were 70 beats per second.

290
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:01,122
No!

291
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:07,882
Dr. Prim, you're sighing again.

292
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:40,349
You've been feeling pain

293
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:43,282
in your lower right abdomen and pubis for three days?

294
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:46,642
This condition can be a sign of appendicitis.

295
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:50,802
But you're a woman. You've felt pain for three days. You had your period.

296
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:53,242
It can be other diseases as well.

297
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:55,602
Did your period come normally?

298
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:57,922
Was there any vaginal discharge?

299
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:59,386
It's normal.

300
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,082
It comes normally.

301
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:05,522
But she always says that she feels menstrual cramps.

302
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:09,042
I told her it's natural to have menstrual cramps.

303
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:11,842
But for vaginal discharge,

304
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:15,682
I don't think there is. She is a tidy person.

305
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:18,042
Right, Aoy?

306
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,562
Yes. My period has been gone for several days,

307
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,282
but I still feel stomach pain.

308
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,602
Your period is over, but you still feel stomach pain.

309
00:30:26,762 --> 00:30:29,522
It can be a sign of various diseases.

310
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:32,802
Prim, take a blood and urine test for her.

311
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:34,042
Yes, Professor.

312
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:38,882
I'd like to ask a gynecologist to perform a pelvic exam.

313
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:44,682
She already has her period. It's possible to have gynecological conditions.

314
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:46,042
No.

315
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,562
My daughter is still young.

316
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:49,882
She has never had...

317
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:54,082
How could she get that kind of exam?

318
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:58,882
Excuse me. For this kind of matter,

319
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:01,442
it's not embarrassing at all.

320
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:03,842
If you feel uncomfortable with this,

321
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:05,886
you can request a female doctor.

322
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,568
It's normal.

323
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:09,962
This is a matter that can affect our diagnosis as well.

324
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,122
Listen.

325
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,882
Have you thought about what you just said?

326
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:16,225
You're a woman as well.

327
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:18,227
You should be more reserved.

328
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:19,962
Please calm down.

329
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:22,402
It's a necessary exam.

330
00:31:22,522 --> 00:31:24,985
We have to perform a correct diagnosis

331
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:27,362
so that we can successfully treat her.

332
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:31,682
Prim, please take this to Professor Sarocha from Gynecology.

333
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:33,082
Yes.

334
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:35,162
I'll excuse myself.

335
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,282
PID.

336
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:53,042
PID?

337
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,602
But her mom said she's never had sexual intercourse before.

338
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:59,746
Her medical history also doesn't have anything

339
00:32:00,264 --> 00:32:01,962
that could cause an infection.

340
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,658
But from the pelvic exam, we found vaginal discharge that looked like pus.

341
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:08,282
There's also cervical motion tenderness.

342
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:10,002
I think it's possible.

343
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:12,802
Based on the symptoms and lab results,

344
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:15,602
ESR and C-reactive protein have increased.

345
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:18,242
It's highly likely that it's PID.

346
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,522
And...

347
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:22,802
The patient might have kept her sexual history a secret.

348
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,162
- I'm so tired of it. - What's wrong?

349
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:30,122
If it were you, would you take it? It's old-fashioned now.

350
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:37,162
But for vaginal discharge, I don't think there is.

351
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,802
She is a tidy person. Right, Aoy?

352
00:32:45,104 --> 00:32:46,842
I think it's possible.

353
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:52,922
Sorry, Professor.

354
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,322
I'll go talk to her mother myself.

355
00:32:58,418 --> 00:32:59,579
As for you,

356
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,954
write a detailed report about it.

357
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,722
Don't ask for anyone's help.

358
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:04,922
Yes, Professor.

359
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:17,202
Ma'am, I have to perform an ultrasound on her vagina

360
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:20,447
to check for pelvic inflammatory disease

361
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,402
and other complications,

362
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:26,522
such as pus, for additional surgical procedures.

363
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,161
Please stay calm for now.

364
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:32,882
For this disease, we can give her IV therapy. She'll get better soon.

365
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:36,562
Our nurse can give you a more detailed explanation if you'd like.

366
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,522
What is pelvic inflammatory disease?

367
00:33:40,904 --> 00:33:43,362
Is it related to menstrual cramps?

368
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:49,242
After the pelvic exam, does she still need a vaginal ultrasound?

369
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:52,802
Won't that be painful for my daughter?

370
00:33:57,442 --> 00:33:59,322
You can tell us what happened

371
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:01,242
so that we can treat you right.

372
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:08,402
Have we met at the parking lot?

373
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:20,662
Are you worried about your mother?

374
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,979
Are you afraid she'll scold you?

375
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,754
If...

376
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:34,704
If you feel better after taking pills, it's fine.

377
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:37,202
But if it doesn't work like that,

378
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:40,722
you still have to tell her in the end.

379
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,642
My mom would hit me to death for sure.

380
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:48,122
But if your condition gets worse,

381
00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:50,842
it's more dangerous than getting hit by your mother.

382
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:01,282
Well, having a lover or sexual intercourse is normal.

383
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:04,522
It's natural. We can talk about it openly.

384
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,762
I understand it's a sensitive matter,

385
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,602
but we have to talk about what we should do

386
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:12,522
and how we should make it safe.

387
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:14,442
Doctor, what are you saying to my daughter?

388
00:35:14,538 --> 00:35:17,402
How could you put this disgusting idea into my daughter's brain?

389
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:19,662
Move!

390
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,482
What would you do if she really followed your advice?

391
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:27,202
You shouldn't use violence against Dr. Prim.

392
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:29,842
She was telling the truth. She's worried about the patient.

393
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:32,162
She's teaching her to value herself more.

394
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,282
- Shoan. - You!

395
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:34,522
Mom!

396
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:39,322
I have something to tell you.

397
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:47,042
Well, we'll excuse ourselves.

398
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:11,442
Her relative was being rude to you.

399
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:14,442
Aren't you mad?

400
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,242
Well...

401
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:23,082
Honestly, I didn't like it when they did something like that.

402
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:27,122
But what could I do?

403
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,562
I understand her. She's a mother.

404
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:34,552
She's just worried about her daughter.

405
00:36:38,585 --> 00:36:42,282
(He has high-functioning autism.)

406
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:48,802
(He's autistic, but he became a doctor. I think he's a genius.)

407
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:52,202
(I read somewhere that this type is capable of raising a family.)

408
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,362
(I'm worried about you, but I think you probably have your answer now.)

409
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,242
(No matter what you choose, I'll believe in your decision.)

410
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:09,322
It's normal, Shoan,

411
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:12,762
to be in love or

412
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:17,002
to have a lover. It's normal.

413
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:18,282
But...

414
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:23,242
It depends on your luck if it'll go well or not.

415
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,282
It's like you're buying a lottery ticket.

416
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:29,642
Haven't you seen people asking for their love's blessing?

417
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:35,442
But the chance to win a lottery is only 0.0001 percent.

418
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:37,482
Is it really that difficult?

419
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:44,191
I won't talk to you anymore. I'll go back to work.

420
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:47,322
- I'm having a headache. - Wait for me.

421
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:09,602
Are you alright? Your face seems so pale.

422
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,002
Come here. Let me perform a diagnosis on you.

423
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,922
Your temperature is normal.

424
00:38:18,418 --> 00:38:20,122
I'm fine, Win.

425
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:21,922
I just have a stomach ache.

426
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,602
Are you stressed about our wedding?

427
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:32,162
When something doesn't go the way you want, you should let go of it.

428
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:36,162
The only important thing is our happiness, got it?

429
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,442
Got it.

430
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,762
What's wrong with you recently?

431
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,682
You've been a lot sweeter to me.

432
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:47,242
Are you nervous about our wedding?

433
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,922
Nervous? Well, I'm a little nervous.

434
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:59,442
Right, there's a wedding at my hospital today.

435
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,202
But...

436
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,602
The groom was a sleeping prince.

437
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,882
That's sad, though.

438
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:12,442
It's sad, but

439
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,282
it's also heartwarming to me.

440
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:20,066
I can't imagine

441
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:22,436
how I would live

442
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:24,682
if we were like them.

443
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:29,362
Are you going to stop loving me if we're like that?

444
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:32,242
No way.

445
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:34,602
That's the answer.

446
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:58,097
Mim, set the OR and call Professor Win to see if we can repair vessels.

447
00:40:58,193 --> 00:41:01,112
- Yes. - No. Win just got out of the OR at four am.

448
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:03,412
I'll take care of this. Let him do his duty as a groom.

449
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:05,122
Don't you also have someone?

450
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:06,962
I'm not going to have a wedding soon.

451
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,442
- Consider this our blessing for him. - Yes.

452
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:12,002
Let him have some time with her.

453
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,722
- Yes. - Let's go.

454
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,162
Multilocular

455
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:23,202
cystic structure at right adnexa 10 cm.

456
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:24,962
TOA is really big.

457
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:30,362
The patient's body is 39.5 degrees Celsius. She's in extreme stomach pain.

458
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,969
Call for Professor Sarocha now.

459
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:34,202
It's probably ruptured TOA. Set up the OR now.

460
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,442
My daughter.

461
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:46,562
- My daughter... - Mom...

462
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:58,922
See you in the room.

463
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:00,402
Yes.

464
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:25,402
Blade, please.

465
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,722
Giving the blade back.

466
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:35,482
Forceps, please.

467
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:49,362
On the opposite side, cauterize it.

468
00:42:49,689 --> 00:42:51,402
Suction, please.

469
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,242
Retractor, please.

470
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:04,242
At this spot.

471
00:43:16,823 --> 00:43:18,442
It's in the abdominal region.

472
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:22,442
Retractor at this spot.

473
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:28,922
Pus suction.

474
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,962
There's a lot of pus. Shoan, set up the lights.

475
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:44,642
Back probe.

476
00:43:47,762 --> 00:43:49,282
Another back probe, please.

477
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:52,482
Her left Fallopian tube is normal.

478
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,162
We'll only remove the right one.

479
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:07,282
- Win. - Professor.

480
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,642
You don't have to get up.

481
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:10,402
Yes.

482
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:13,922
How are you?

483
00:44:15,483 --> 00:44:16,842
Are you nervous?

484
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:19,722
- I can see it from your face. - Really?

485
00:44:21,074 --> 00:44:23,042
I thought I wouldn't be nervous,

486
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:25,882
but my heart was beating so fast.

487
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,442
It's normal.

488
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:32,642
I came to see you first because I know you have to see a lot of guests.

489
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,182
I want to

490
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,602
express my congratulations to you.

491
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:40,322
I'm really happy

492
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:44,682
that you finally have someone you want to stay with forever.

493
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:50,602
But you have to stop shouldering everything yourself.

494
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:54,962
You need to share both happiness and sadness with your partner, right?

495
00:44:56,353 --> 00:44:57,482
Yes.

496
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:00,682
Thank you so much, Professor,

497
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:03,922
for always being in my important moments.

498
00:45:05,112 --> 00:45:06,322
No problem.

499
00:45:06,945 --> 00:45:08,122
Right.

500
00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:11,522
The director has already approved of my retirement.

501
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:14,002
They'll probably announce

502
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:16,522
the new Head of Surgery officially soon.

503
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,522
- Yes. - Trust me.

504
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,882
You can do it.

505
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:25,895
Professor!

506
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:29,362
How would I have time for a honeymoon, then?

507
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:35,362
Have you told Shoan about this?

508
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:37,162
Not yet.

509
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:39,522
I think it'll be fine. He'll understand.

510
00:45:39,643 --> 00:45:41,402
From now on, he

511
00:45:41,483 --> 00:45:43,202
will have you who can take care of him.

512
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:47,783
Okay. I'll see you again outside.

513
00:45:47,884 --> 00:45:49,242
- Yes. - Congrats.

514
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,722
- Yes. - Calm yourself. It's so obvious from your face.

515
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:53,642
Yes, Professor.

516
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:36,242
Come in.

517
00:46:47,352 --> 00:46:49,522
Sit down, here.

518
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:55,082
A present for you.

519
00:46:58,945 --> 00:47:00,562
Do you have time to buy that?

520
00:47:06,144 --> 00:47:08,482
You should open it now.

521
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,642
You're forcing me, huh?

522
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:33,642
Since you're going to start a new journey,

523
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:35,802
your first step must be right.

524
00:48:02,562 --> 00:48:04,002
Thank you, Shoan.

525
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,282
What about you? Are you ready?

526
00:48:42,977 --> 00:48:45,682
I'm not confident at all. I'm afraid I'll screw it up.

527
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:48,802
You should let someone else do it.

528
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:50,962
No way.

529
00:48:57,395 --> 00:48:58,922
This is my order.

530
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,042
I'm ready now, I guess.

531
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,122
Shoan, you don't have to take a shower anymore.

532
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,602
I can't. I have to take a shower.

533
00:49:57,322 --> 00:49:58,562
It'll be fine.

534
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:00,682
I have to.

535
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:03,762
See you at the wedding, then.

536
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,682
- Pleum, let's go! - Yes.

537
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:24,402
- Hey! - Oh, wow.

538
00:50:44,562 --> 00:50:46,282
Who made Prim become like that?

539
00:50:46,882 --> 00:50:49,242
It's me. Isn't she beautiful?

540
00:51:27,202 --> 00:51:28,722
Should we go together?

541
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:31,202
Sure.

542
00:51:46,489 --> 00:51:48,082
Good evening.

543
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:52,122
- You're so pretty. - Oh.

544
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,322
I have to go now.

545
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,362
- Where is Shoan going? - I don't know.

546
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:05,522
- What would you like to drink? - Let's go take a look.

547
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:48,962
- They're so beautiful. - May.

548
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:53,762
I promise

549
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:56,882
that I'll love you

550
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:59,522
until the last day of my life.

551
00:53:00,937 --> 00:53:03,402
I'll make every second that I have with you

552
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:05,882
as precious as possible.

553
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:12,042
I'll love you and stay by your side no matter when you're happy or sad,

554
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:14,762
when you're sick or healthy.

555
00:53:16,202 --> 00:53:17,802
I'll always be your strength

556
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:20,242
until the last breath of my life.

557
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,802
Thank you.

558
00:53:54,122 --> 00:53:55,522
We're married now.

559
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:32,882
This is so touching.

560
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:35,522
If you don't believe me, you should have a wedding.

561
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:38,882
- Oh... - Mim!

562
00:54:39,011 --> 00:54:41,602
- What? - What are you saying?

563
00:55:44,402 --> 00:55:45,762
Don't you want to dance?

564
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:47,602
No.

565
00:55:48,337 --> 00:55:49,562
What about you?

566
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:50,842
Nope.

567
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:52,522
Why?

568
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:55,642
Well, I just don't like it. I don't like dancing.

569
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,762
I understand. I also don't like it.

570
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:00,082
Okay.

571
00:56:00,522 --> 00:56:02,882
- Good. - Yes, good.

572
00:56:11,642 --> 00:56:12,882
Okay.

573
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:14,922
We'll just watch them over here.

574
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,762
- Win! - Professor!

575
00:57:26,971 --> 00:57:28,467
- Professor! - Win!

576
00:57:28,548 --> 00:57:30,402
Win!

577
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:31,802
Win!

578
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:34,162
Win!

579
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:39,562
He still has a pulse. Win!

580
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:18,962
When did you know?

581
00:58:19,098 --> 00:58:21,722
Your heart is really important. It is...

582
00:58:21,962 --> 00:58:23,482
If I can get it fixed soon,

583
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:26,522
I'll get to do what I want sooner. Isn't that right, Doctor?

584
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:30,122
- Yes. Well... - ASD secundum is two cm.

585
00:58:30,259 --> 00:58:31,762
Hello, Mom.

586
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:35,802
(Shoan, your dad isn't doing well. Do you want to visit him?)

587
00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:38,242
We'll open into the right atrium.

588
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:40,591
Then, we'll go into...

589
00:58:44,203 --> 00:58:45,522
Professor?

590
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:49,562
- There's retroperitoneal... - Prim,

591
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:51,603
- you'll be the main surgeon. - Yes?

592
00:58:51,706 --> 00:58:52,962
- Come on! - Yes.
