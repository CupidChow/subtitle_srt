1
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:18,024
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:36,002
(Ten years ago, Win might have wanted me.)

3
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:39,882
(But now, he might be able to live without me.)

4
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,032
(I think you should ask your own heart)

5
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,402
(how you)

6
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:47,202
(actually feel about him.)

7
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:56,602
(Recent - Dr. Win)

8
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:02,642
- Hello? Yeah? - (I want to meet Prim.)

9
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:06,322
If I go back, I want to be clear with myself.

10
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,482
I feel guilty for blaming her too much.

11
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:12,202
You know where she lives, right?

12
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:14,002
In the same building as Shoan.

13
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:15,562
Professor Prapas' condo.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,162
Should I send you the location?

15
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,162
Oh? Uncle Prapas'.

16
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:20,282
I know that place.

17
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:22,842
Yeah. At least, you need to hear it from her.

18
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:24,882
It's not right to break up this way.

19
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:27,346
Okay. Thank you.

20
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:28,922
Bye.

21
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:43,362
May.

22
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:49,262
(Dr. Prapas: Shoan is staying here. Don't worry)

23
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:55,202
- Shoan is at Professor Prapas'. - Just follow her!

24
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:22,282
How is it? Is that alright?

25
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,668
It's alright, just a bit salty.

26
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,042
You usually eat salty food, Professor.

27
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:31,602
Yeah. I guess you're right.

28
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:35,602
I heard Win took you to Professor Sicha.

29
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:37,242
How did it go?

30
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:40,962
It's not good. I don't like it.

31
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,362
Listen to me, Shoan.

32
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,618
The treatment of any illness

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,242
is difficult at the beginning.

34
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:53,762
Especially when it comes to mental illness.

35
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,290
Be patient, but believe me, in the end,

36
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:59,402
it will be good for you.

37
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,362
You know what?

38
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:08,442
Let's play a game.

39
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:11,442
- Let's do it. - Okay.

40
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:13,522
This is a game of imagination.

41
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,962
Imagine yourself operating on a patient.

42
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:23,882
You know the patient has a tumor on their thalamus.

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,522
You know the fiber pathway.

44
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:29,162
You know the neurovascular structures.

45
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,002
If you know they can be saved, even if it's difficult,

46
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,082
you won't give up on them, right?

47
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:39,482
So that means

48
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:41,162
if you look,

49
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,082
you will see the problem.

50
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,522
In the end, we will...

51
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:49,131
Remove the tumor.

52
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:52,682
The patient will recover.

53
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,002
That's it. You got it now.

54
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,602
That's how we cure the brain, Professor.

55
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,922
Is that how you cure the mind too?

56
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:05,682
I've lived for 60 years, I know a thing or two.

57
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:10,562
Oh yeah. I'm going to a plant nursery tomorrow. Do you want to come?

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,402
- I do. - Good.

59
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,842
That little one got a huge fruit.

60
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:34,802
This looks good.

61
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,442
Leaf...

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,202
Shoan?

63
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,202
Oh?

64
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:00,762
Why don't you have a pet, Uncle Prapas?

65
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:06,602
I don't have the time, and I live alone. Nobody will be with it.

66
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,402
Do you want to have a rabbit again?

67
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,122
I do.

68
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,165
But I'm just like you.

69
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,922
I don't have time, and I don't have someone to watch over it.

70
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:27,458
So that means if I have someone to watch over it

71
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:29,642
and I don't live alone,

72
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:31,802
I can have a bunny.

73
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,362
Hey.

74
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,362
Do you mean you want a girlfriend?

75
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:41,002
No.

76
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:43,482
I mean,

77
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,722
I will hire someone to watch it.

78
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,122
But if I have a girlfriend,

79
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:56,362
I won't live alone,

80
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,007
and I will have someone to watch over the bunny.

81
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:10,202
(Episode 11: Rabbit)

82
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,282
This is your plant, isn't it?

83
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:19,562
Yes.

84
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,219
Professor, good afternoon.

85
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:23,802
Oh, hi!

86
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:30,442
You didn't come home last night, did you?

87
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:33,762
Did you bother our professor too much?

88
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,402
It's fine. Okay, see you tomorrow.

89
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:38,562
Okay.

90
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:40,676
- Goodbye. - Goodbye. Here's another one.

91
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,282
- Goodbye, Professor. - Goodbye.

92
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,802
- Have you eaten? - Not yet.

93
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:49,042
I'm going to cook. Want something?

94
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:52,146
I do, but can you cook?

95
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,842
You know nothing.

96
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,882
This dish is too bland.

97
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,915
I made healthy food.

98
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,042
Clean food, you know?

99
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,122
Try this.

100
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,442
It's too salty.

101
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:44,242
Just eat it with rice to balance it out.

102
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,762
This one is too hot.

103
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,002
You're picky, aren't you?

104
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,122
You said you wanted a comment.

105
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,538
If you can't eat any of this, I'll order something.

106
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:10,082
I can eat them.

107
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,442
This is okay.

108
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:37,202
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:38,842
I ran away.

110
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,522
It wasn't right to do so.

111
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:48,642
It's okay.

112
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:52,922
I understand.

113
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,496
I had to see Dr. Sicha once.

114
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,162
It was difficult for me too.

115
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:07,202
You have to sit there and say things you don't want to say.

116
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:08,882
You have to

117
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,842
tell her something you don't even want to remember.

118
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,482
It's normal.

119
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,442
Everyone has fears.

120
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,002
I get it.

121
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:26,642
You need to apologize to Professor Win, though.

122
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:29,682
He has been looking for you all over.

123
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:33,442
One day, you'll know how it feels

124
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:36,153
when you make an appointment with a patient, but they don't come.

125
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:40,002
I want you to pat my head,

126
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:44,202
but I was at fault. I don't deserve a reward.

127
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,602
It's good you know that.

128
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,122
Okay.

129
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:55,762
Now is the time

130
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:58,082
for the chef to eat.

131
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,682
Let me remove my retainer.

132
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:29,074
The X-ray shows she broke her arm.

133
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:32,242
When it's swollen, it could push the nerves.

134
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,642
There might be some numbness in her hand.

135
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,242
I would like her to stay for a day or two to keep watch on her condition.

136
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:46,962
There's a skate competition in America late this month. Will she make it?

137
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:51,842
I'll need to consult our orthopedist on that.

138
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,202
I'll keep you posted.

139
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:54,722
Excuse me.

140
00:11:58,649 --> 00:11:59,921
It's okay, Mom.

141
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,202
I'll wear a cast to school for my friends to draw on. It's cute.

142
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:04,922
Still joking?

143
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,602
You were too playful and forgot your safety. Do you want to compete or not?

144
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,122
I do, Mom.

145
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,354
She doesn't have appendicitis.

146
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,842
How could it not be appendicitis, Doctor?

147
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:17,642
I've read on the internet. The symptoms match.

148
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,402
You're just a doctor in training. You're inexperienced.

149
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,162
I don't think you know what you're doing.

150
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:26,285
This is not a symptom of appendicitis.

151
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,597
She has Henoch–Schönlein purpura.

152
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,842
What does she have? Can you use human language?

153
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,002
It's an inflammation of the blood vessels.

154
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:40,482
Whoa! What are you talking about? Is there any doctor that speaks human?

155
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,962
What's the matter?

156
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,682
My daughter has appendicitis.

157
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,882
This doctor won't let her get surgery.

158
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:49,322
What should I do with this hospital?

159
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:53,160
The patient has a palpable purpura.

160
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:56,042
I think it's Henoch–Schönlein purpura.

161
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,202
Let's do this, ma'am.

162
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,202
We'll send her in for an MRI to find out what she has.

163
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:06,926
Okay. Do whatever you have to.

164
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,802
What's wrong with this hospital's doctors?

165
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:11,298
I told them you have appendicitis and they won't believe me!

166
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,202
Does it hurt so much, sweetie?

167
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,282
Dr. Shoan

168
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,451
will explain her MRI results.

169
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,009
The cause of the pain in her abdomen

170
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:44,802
is the inflammation and swelling of blood vessels around her intestine.

171
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,362
It's not appendicitis.

172
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,682
She can recover by taking medicine.

173
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,202
Surgery is not required.

174
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:51,882
Okay.

175
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:01,522
I'll forward this case to our pediatrician.

176
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,602
Come in.

177
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,162
Sit down.

178
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,002
You know what you did, right?

179
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,402
I know.

180
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:05,482
I ran away from therapy

181
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:08,162
because I was afraid.

182
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:11,239
However...

183
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,482
However what?

184
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:19,002
If I'm afraid, I can't be a surgeon.

185
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:21,592
I won't run from therapy again.

186
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:31,402
In that case,

187
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,202
meet me in the simulation room after your shift.

188
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:40,842
Yes.

189
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:52,642
Prim, let me ask you something.

190
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:54,682
Are you seeing someone?

191
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:57,482
I see patients, their families, and you guys.

192
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:59,842
That's not what I mean.

193
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:02,322
Did anyone ask you out?

194
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,562
No.

195
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:10,122
I don't have time to meet guys, man.

196
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,802
All I do is work. I don't even have my meals regularly.

197
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:15,402
That's what I thought. You're a meanie.

198
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,026
And you want to go live on a mountain.

199
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,122
What kind of men can be with you?

200
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:20,802
Nick.

201
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:24,202
Pleum, can you believe this? In college,

202
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:27,322
no boy ever dared to ask her out. She never had a boyfriend.

203
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:28,863
Really?

204
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,722
You spent years there.

205
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:33,402
Pleum.

206
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,362
Sorry.

207
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:37,722
She's really a meanie.

208
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,602
I'm just kidding.

209
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:41,732
Here.

210
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,242
I'm not eating that.

211
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,682
Shoan.

212
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:56,682
Yes?

213
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,882
Do you think she's mean?

214
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:10,562
She's not.

215
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,082
You're giving him that look.

216
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,962
Would he dare say the truth?

217
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,442
Dr. Prim is the opposite of mean.

218
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:24,922
She is kind and lovely.

219
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,362
How?

220
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:32,482
But...

221
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:35,362
Sometimes, she can be really mean.

222
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,882
I'm going to punch you.

223
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,282
Prim.

224
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:45,362
This is my friend, Art.

225
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,282
I went to high school with him.

226
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:49,122
He owns a resort in Mae Taeng.

227
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:51,933
He texted me and asked for your number a few times.

228
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,523
I haven't given it to him yet. I'm asking for your permission.

229
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:56,002
Why didn't you?

230
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,442
I need your permission first, right?

231
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:02,324
Pleum.

232
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,664
What do you think? Should I give him my number?

233
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:09,042
I think you should. I want to see you with a boyfriend.

234
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,362
Okay, fine.

235
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:18,482
At least I'll have a friend when I move to Chiang Rai.

236
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:23,242
If this goes well, you'll satisfy your mom twice over.

237
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:26,362
Your career and your relationship, right?

238
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:30,722
It's not like he's my boyfriend, right? I don't even know him yet.

239
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:32,842
I said that just in case.

240
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,882
I hate you.

241
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:41,162
Is it 1 pm already?

242
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,807
I have to go. Throw away the trash for me.

243
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,642
- Leave it there. - See you later.

244
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,322
Your bag.

245
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:00,362
Boss.

246
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:02,802
Someone's here to see you.

247
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,322
She said her name was Primlada.

248
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:14,602
Tell her I'm busy and send her away.

249
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,322
Of course.

250
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:55,082
May.

251
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:59,482
There was really nothing between us.

252
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,922
Shoan ran away. I just went there to wait for him.

253
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:10,362
Win.

254
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,002
I think what's happening to us right now

255
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,802
has nothing to do with Prim.

256
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:21,962
I'm just not sure if I want us to get back.

257
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,962
Why is that, May?

258
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,922
What made you unsure?

259
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,962
You can tell me.

260
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:36,954
I think it's because of these past ten years.

261
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:41,802
Ten years made us used to having each other.

262
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:44,642
It made us neglect each other.

263
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:47,362
It used to be all about our love,

264
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:49,442
but that's not it anymore.

265
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,442
We have work. We have families.

266
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:55,882
Anything can make us fall out.

267
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,962
I'm sorry, I

268
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,042
didn't know you'd been feeling that way the whole time.

269
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:16,722
Win.

270
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,362
We should end this.

271
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:31,922
I have to go.

272
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,882
I'm sorry

273
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:58,482
for running away.

274
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:02,882
I understand you're getting used to this.

275
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,922
Let's start our session, okay?

276
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:11,082
Win said you froze,

277
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,562
and you were scared

278
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,482
during an operation?

279
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:16,922
Can you tell me

280
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:20,642
how you felt or what you saw at that moment?

281
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,122
I didn't know what I felt,

282
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:26,961
but I saw...

283
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,762
You don't know?

284
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:35,722
My dad hit me.

285
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:37,282
He didn't like my bunny.

286
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:39,042
This thing is irritating!

287
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:42,022
You love it so much, huh?

288
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:46,202
Shin stopped Dad, so Dad hit him.

289
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,362
I heard the bunny cry.

290
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:50,762
Dad hit Mom. Dad hurt everyone.

291
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:54,162
- Dad hurt everyone. Dad hit me. - Shoan.

292
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,442
Shoan.

293
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,242
Breathe in.

294
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:01,322
Take a deep breath. Breathe in.

295
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,162
Take a deep breath.

296
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,162
And exhale slowly.

297
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,482
That day, I came home from school.

298
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:26,762
I saw Dad looking for something.

299
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,522
He turned to me.

300
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:30,482
His expression looked scary.

301
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,762
He walked toward me.

302
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,949
He asked where Mom kept her cash.

303
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:38,242
I didn't know.

304
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:40,042
I said I didn't know.

305
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,009
Dad grabbed me by the collar.

306
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:46,002
Shin stopped him, so he slapped Shin. Dad hit Shin.

307
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:47,882
Dad...

308
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:50,642
Dad picks up the bunny cage.

309
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:53,242
Dad throws the cage against the wall.

310
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:57,206
(This scene depicts violence. Please use your discretion.)

311
00:23:57,287 --> 00:24:00,962
The cage fell to the ground. The bunny lay there belly up.

312
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:03,122
I picked the bunny up.

313
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:04,922
The bunny was dead.

314
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:06,402
My friend was dead.

315
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,002
My friend was dead.

316
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,522
Shoan.

317
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,562
If it's too much, you can take a break.

318
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:16,122
Take a break.

319
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:26,322
I'm fine. I'm going to fight this.

320
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:28,042
Well done.

321
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,082
Well done, my Shoan.

322
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:39,322
So, do you have a good memory of your father?

323
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:43,122
Please explore your thoughts thoroughly.

324
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,042
Look at every detail.

325
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,002
There might be something

326
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:50,082
that you forgot.

327
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:54,442
There could be a good feeling hidden in there somewhere.

328
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:56,842
Look carefully.

329
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,762
Look thoroughly.

330
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:06,842
Take it easy.

331
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,874
You like it, huh?

332
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,962
You like it, huh?

333
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:11,122
You like rabbits?

334
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,762
You like rabbits?

335
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,995
You like them so much, huh?

336
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:24,082
When Dad dies,

337
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,522
will he go to heaven?

338
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:33,352
I don't want him to go to heaven.

339
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:35,233
I don't want him to meet Shin there.

340
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,922
I'm sorry

341
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:45,162
that I couldn't protect Shin.

342
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:47,802
I couldn't protect you either.

343
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:50,882
It's okay.

344
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,202
Professor Irin said

345
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,602
being good parents is not easy.

346
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:57,682
So I think

347
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:00,362
it was too hard for the two of you.

348
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,042
Shoan.

349
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:18,282
I'm here to replace his saline bag.

350
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:51,538
Are you here to see me? Come in.

351
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:00,002
Good morning.

352
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:01,562
My name is Minnie.

353
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:04,042
I sneaked out to get your autograph.

354
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:07,762
I watch every video of yours. You're so cool.

355
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,482
Oh.

356
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:14,522
I guess you can't sign an autograph.

357
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:17,082
Your arm is in a cast.

358
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,322
Does it hurt?

359
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,642
It's done.

360
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:46,002
Being kids is great.

361
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,642
It doesn't take long to make friends.

362
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,042
- My handwriting is bad. - What are you doing, kids?

363
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:56,522
- Good morning. - Good morning.

364
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:07,088
(Nurse Counter)

365
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:27,082
So how many days do I have to stay, Doctor?

366
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:30,442
If there's no complication, you can go home tomorrow.

367
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,802
It's really hard being a doctor, right?

368
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:34,842
I think it's harder than being a skater.

369
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,322
It's hard,

370
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:42,482
but I've never skated, so I don't know which is harder.

371
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,562
So, if you're not a doctor,

372
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:49,122
what would you want to be?

373
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:54,432
As a kid, I wanted to be a tennis player,

374
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:57,482
but I realized being an athlete doesn't suit me.

375
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,322
You have to train really hard.

376
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:03,962
What about you, Dr. Shoan?

377
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:08,362
Nothing.

378
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,002
I've always wanted to be a doctor, never anything else.

379
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,322
That's just like me. I've never wanted to be anything else.

380
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:17,442
My mom wants me to be the best skater.

381
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:23,242
In first grade, I wanted to be either a princess or a doctor.

382
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:27,922
But after seeing my mom getting mad at you, I don't want to be a doctor.

383
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:38,962
Thank you.

384
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,042
What's that?

385
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:52,842
That's nice.

386
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:54,442
Maple, what's wrong?

387
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:56,082
Me?

388
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,362
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

389
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:03,402
- Look. - I think she needs to wear the cast for two weeks.

390
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,162
We won't have enough time left for training.

391
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:13,642
I understand that the competition is important.

392
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,922
But a broken bone

393
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,722
takes about three to four weeks to recover.

394
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:21,842
She can train in the cast.

395
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:26,982
She can't. That's extremely dangerous.

396
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:32,962
Then, find a way for her to train.

397
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:36,042
- I... - She can't train.

398
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,282
Professor, she also feels dizzy.

399
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:44,282
Isn't it normal to be stressed before a big competition?

400
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:47,722
I don't know. Please find a way for her to train.

401
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:54,762
Get well soon, Maple.

402
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,162
I'll be on my way.

403
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,762
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

404
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,562
Maple, what's wrong?

405
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:17,202
Nothing, why?

406
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,388
What's wrong with me, Doctor?

407
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:26,482
Shoan, where is Professor Irin?

408
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:29,682
- She left. - Maple isn't looking good.

409
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:33,282
Just now, she had a spasm unknowingly. Her muscles seem weak.

410
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:36,682
We did confirm she didn't suffer head injuries.

411
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:41,642
Losing balance?

412
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,362
Insidious onset and ataxia

413
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:46,762
localized in the cerebellum.

414
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:49,682
This is bad, Dr. Mummim.

415
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,522
We need to consult Professor Prapas.

416
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:54,282
Shoan.

417
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,481
Is that Maple?

418
00:33:06,577 --> 00:33:09,762
- Are you Maple? - Please teach me how to skate.

419
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,042
Yeah. We're your followers.

420
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:13,802
You look cool in your videos.

421
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:17,162
I can't now. Look at my arm. My doctor will get mad.

422
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,602
- Come on. - Please.

423
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:26,962
Please.

424
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,682
That's amazing.

425
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:53,322
You're so cool!

426
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,598
You're not doing it right.

427
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,089
You need safety equipment to play.

428
00:33:56,178 --> 00:33:57,796
You need to skate in the right place too.

429
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,621
Look at me. Even with safety, I still got hurt.

430
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,402
Of course.

431
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:12,562
- Maple? - Maple, are you okay?

432
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:14,442
Hey, get a doctor here.

433
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,282
- Hey! - Maple?

434
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:36,722
Maple has a cerebellar tumor.

435
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,362
Water is clogged in her brain because the tumor is blocking it.

436
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:44,082
I recommend immediate surgery.

437
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:47,162
Otherwise, she could be in danger.

438
00:34:47,282 --> 00:34:49,602
It could be fatal

439
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:51,642
due to high pressure in the brain.

440
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,882
Maple?

441
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:59,242
Why did you let yourself get so sick?

442
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:02,082
Why didn't you take care of yourself?

443
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:06,602
This tumor has nothing to do with self-care.

444
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,823
Maple probably has been having headaches for a long time.

445
00:35:09,904 --> 00:35:11,605
If we had found this tumor sooner,

446
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:13,193
it wouldn't have grown this big.

447
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:18,417
You should make a decision soon

448
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:20,482
whether to allow her to go into surgery.

449
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:22,722
If you leave it be, she could be in danger.

450
00:35:24,465 --> 00:35:26,602
Do I need surgery, Mom?

451
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:35,722
Professor, how is she doing?

452
00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:38,802
She needs surgery.

453
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:43,442
Will she be able to skate again after surgery?

454
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:47,962
Ma'am, with her tumor at this stage,

455
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:50,962
she needs constant checkups even after surgery.

456
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:54,562
The thing with this type of tumor is it can regrow.

457
00:35:56,802 --> 00:35:59,962
We will try our best to save her, though.

458
00:36:00,362 --> 00:36:02,402
Think of this year

459
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:04,642
as a recovery year for her.

460
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,762
She can still compete next year.

461
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:09,802
A year?

462
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:15,266
We don't have that much time.

463
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:23,962
What are you thinking about, Maple?

464
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,522
I'm scared. I don't want to get surgery.

465
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:29,962
Why?

466
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,762
I'm scared I can't skateboard again.

467
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:35,682
If I can't, Mom will be sad.

468
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:40,322
Why would she be sad?

469
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:43,082
You're the one who competes, not your mom.

470
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:52,649
My mom quit her job to drive me around. If I can't skate,

471
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,585
she will be very sad.

472
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Maple is afraid of surgery.

473
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:08,522
She's afraid she can't skate.

474
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,922
She's afraid her mom would be sad.

475
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,162
She won't compete.

476
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:21,002
You're not the only one disappointed. Me too.

477
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:23,202
We put so much effort into this.

478
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:25,602
The doctors said it depends on her follow-up.

479
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:29,002
Just tell me when you book the flight.

480
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:31,602
Doctor.

481
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:34,522
What is it, ma'am?

482
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,362
(Why would she be sad?)

483
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,842
(My mom quit her job to drive me around.)

484
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:59,762
(If I can't skate, she will be very sad.)

485
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:08,322
What are you crying for?

486
00:38:08,658 --> 00:38:10,982
You're good for nothing!

487
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:20,042
A kid like you?

488
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:21,682
What pet can you keep?

489
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:24,122
You can't even take care of yourself!

490
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:26,838
(My mom quit her job to drive me around.)

491
00:38:26,965 --> 00:38:29,722
(If I can't skate, she will be very sad.)

492
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,162
What is it?

493
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:07,482
Are you here to add insult to my injury?

494
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:10,442
No.

495
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,682
I have a question.

496
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:18,922
Why did you kill my bunny?

497
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:22,362
What are you talking about?

498
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:26,642
My little bunny.

499
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,642
Why did you kill it?

500
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:36,082
It was decades ago.

501
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:39,242
I can't remember that.

502
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:41,488
You bought it for me,

503
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:43,162
and you killed it.

504
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:44,882
Sometimes, you were nice to me.

505
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,402
Sometimes, you were cruel.

506
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:47,970
I don't understand.

507
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,122
I was drunk.

508
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,402
I don't remember anything.

509
00:39:57,242 --> 00:39:58,922
What do you want from me?

510
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:03,104
Do you want me to apologize?

511
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:07,682
No. I don't want your apology.

512
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,042
That's how you are.

513
00:40:14,842 --> 00:40:17,082
Why can't you be like other kids?

514
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:22,482
All you did was play with the bunny.

515
00:40:23,602 --> 00:40:25,602
The neighbors said that you

516
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:33,032
were retarded.

517
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:43,242
You became that way because of me?

518
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:48,042
Because of me? You hit Shin.

519
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:51,922
You hit Mom. You killed my bunny. You hit me too.

520
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,922
Was that all because of me?

521
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:02,402
If that's the case,

522
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:06,482
I can't change myself.

523
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:08,122
I can never be cured.

524
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,322
I can never be cured, Dad.

525
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:13,602
I just want to tell you that

526
00:41:15,562 --> 00:41:17,842
what you did was very wrong.

527
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:19,562
It was very wrong.

528
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:30,882
Professor Sicha said

529
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:35,842
I should think of good things about you.

530
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:38,922
Think about the nice things you did for me.

531
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,402
I can think of some.

532
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:46,962
(Do you like rabbits?)

533
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:49,562
You like rabbits?

534
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,802
You want this one?

535
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,362
You like rabbits, right?

536
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:01,522
Take good care of it. It's not cheap, you know.

537
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:12,682
You were nice

538
00:42:13,082 --> 00:42:14,762
when you weren't drunk.

539
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:17,962
You were very nice.

540
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:51,202
It is a cerebellar tumor.

541
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,682
The tumor is pressing against her cerebellum.

542
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,522
It's pressing against the nerves.

543
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:01,842
It's pressing blood vessels around it.

544
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:06,402
Start operation. Open skin. Aponeurosis.

545
00:44:06,882 --> 00:44:09,442
Periosteum. Skull.

546
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:12,322
Dura mater. Arachnoid.

547
00:44:12,657 --> 00:44:16,602
- And then... - Why are you waiting here?

548
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,762
We're friends.

549
00:44:23,882 --> 00:44:28,642
Are you upset that I requested that you not attend the operation?

550
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,042
No, ma'am.

551
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:35,922
So why are you staying close to my daughter?

552
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,010
Maple needs a friend.

553
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:43,402
She's afraid of surgery.

554
00:44:45,322 --> 00:44:48,202
You were with her when she was skating

555
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:50,443
because you didn't want her to be scared, right?

556
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:02,562
Maple is afraid of three things.

557
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:04,482
One,

558
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:06,202
she's afraid of surgery.

559
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:08,362
Two,

560
00:45:08,548 --> 00:45:10,762
she's afraid she can't skate again.

561
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:14,482
And three,

562
00:45:16,282 --> 00:45:18,002
she's afraid you'll be sad.

563
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,882
Ma'am.

564
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:11,065
For the patient's sake,

565
00:46:12,254 --> 00:46:14,682
I can't grant your request.

566
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:20,082
Dr. Shoan was the first one to find out what she had.

567
00:46:20,922 --> 00:46:22,162
Therefore,

568
00:46:22,522 --> 00:46:25,442
he has earned the right to attend this operation.

569
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,162
Good. I get it now.

570
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:38,042
Come on, Shoan.

571
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:43,962
Thank you.

572
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:55,122
Okay, Shoan. Evaluate her condition. Tell us if you notice anything.

573
00:46:55,793 --> 00:46:56,922
Yes.

574
00:46:58,097 --> 00:46:59,282
Okay.

575
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:01,722
All right. We're making an incision.

576
00:47:03,177 --> 00:47:04,482
Blade.

577
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:16,122
Metzenbaum.

578
00:47:17,528 --> 00:47:19,202
Heart rate 75.

579
00:47:20,697 --> 00:47:21,962
Heart rate 80.

580
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:23,242
Heart rate 90.

581
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:24,722
Dr. Shoan, keep your voice down.

582
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:26,722
You could distract Professor Prapas.

583
00:47:28,091 --> 00:47:29,402
Sorry.

584
00:47:32,611 --> 00:47:33,985
Bipolar forceps.

585
00:47:42,202 --> 00:47:43,562
BP is dropping.

586
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,602
Sorry.

587
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:55,242
Things to consider when BP drops.

588
00:47:55,464 --> 00:47:56,464
Number one

589
00:47:57,683 --> 00:47:59,322
is her response to anesthetics.

590
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:00,442
Two,

591
00:48:00,842 --> 00:48:02,082
the amount of blood.

592
00:48:02,242 --> 00:48:03,242
Third,

593
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:06,322
whether the tools press against blood vessels.

594
00:48:08,978 --> 00:48:11,242
If we open her dura mater when the patient

595
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:13,162
has increased intracranial pressure,

596
00:48:13,362 --> 00:48:15,402
there is a chance her BP could drop.

597
00:48:15,882 --> 00:48:19,482
That's why we always inform the anesthetist before we open a dura mater.

598
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,362
If her BP drops,

599
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:23,882
give her an IV fluid load right away.

600
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:27,825
- Yes. - Yes.

601
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:36,322
Hi, I heard your operation was a success.

602
00:49:40,202 --> 00:49:42,162
Why are you sitting here depressed alone?

603
00:49:49,282 --> 00:49:51,082
Can you keep a secret, Dr. Pleum?

604
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,282
Pleum means trustworthy.

605
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,705
I'm having the same symptoms again.

606
00:50:07,642 --> 00:50:09,442
But this time it's different

607
00:50:09,642 --> 00:50:10,882
because

608
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:13,282
I don't feel good when I see her.

609
00:50:13,604 --> 00:50:15,362
The same one from the karaoke?

610
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:20,002
I won't tell you that.

611
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:22,962
I only trust you 50%.

612
00:50:24,562 --> 00:50:29,042
You feel bad when you see her, so you don't want to see her?

613
00:50:33,522 --> 00:50:35,242
Sometimes I do.

614
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:37,202
Sometimes I don't.

615
00:50:38,355 --> 00:50:40,355
You're so complicated, Shoan.

616
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:42,802
There must be reasons, like...

617
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:47,482
Why do you want to see her? Why do you not want to see her?

618
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:50,122
What changed in the situation?

619
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,842
For example,

620
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:01,082
the person you see her with.

621
00:51:04,682 --> 00:51:06,562
If it's the same person as last time,

622
00:51:07,048 --> 00:51:09,002
that's called being jealous.

623
00:51:10,202 --> 00:51:11,722
I know jealousy.

624
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:14,909
Jealousy is when you don't like

625
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:18,482
a person of the opposite sex getting close to your partner.

626
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:23,762
So,

627
00:51:24,117 --> 00:51:26,042
who are you talking about, Dr. Shoan?

628
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,642
I won't tell you, Dr. Pleum. You don't look trustworthy.

629
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:35,682
It's me, Shoan.

630
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,259
You can trust me 100%.

631
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,602
Here we go! My friend is finally getting with someone!

632
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:01,922
Look at this.

633
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:03,602
See?

634
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:05,602
Art

635
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:09,162
rode big bikes with his pals up the mountain

636
00:52:09,402 --> 00:52:11,122
to give children up there some free gifts.

637
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,282
It's cute. Look.

638
00:52:14,842 --> 00:52:16,442
You're clicking with him, aren't you?

639
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:19,002
Well...

640
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,162
I don't know.

641
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:23,682
But we do get along, and it's...

642
00:52:24,322 --> 00:52:26,202
It's no pressure. It's just chill.

643
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:32,122
- It's like... - Riding a bike like that is dangerous.

644
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:36,202
If the bike is not in good condition,

645
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:38,322
it could also contribute to pollution.

646
00:52:38,507 --> 00:52:40,282
It also hurts wild animals.

647
00:53:03,945 --> 00:53:05,322
What are you doing, Shoan?

648
00:53:05,979 --> 00:53:07,482
Good afternoon, Professor.

649
00:53:08,345 --> 00:53:10,442
I'm trying to read a book in a quiet place.

650
00:53:11,448 --> 00:53:14,202
Good. Carry on. I'm just leaving.

651
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:37,282
Aren't you leaving, Professor?

652
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:49,562
What are you reading?

653
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:18,522
With that brain of yours,

654
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:21,482
is there any book you don't understand?

655
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:23,562
There is none.

656
00:54:25,802 --> 00:54:27,722
But what I don't understand

657
00:54:29,722 --> 00:54:31,202
lies outside the books.

658
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:39,442
Some people are harder to read than a medical study.

659
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:43,122
If I specialize in psychology,

660
00:54:44,082 --> 00:54:45,842
will I understand more?

661
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,402
Even a psychiatrist can't help me now.

662
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,322
So now,

663
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:01,482
will you continue reading?

664
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,242
I have to.

665
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:06,402
It's the only way

666
00:55:06,656 --> 00:55:08,522
that we can understand.

667
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:28,562
Is that a new TV?

668
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:31,002
Yes.

669
00:55:32,698 --> 00:55:34,882
Oh! We need to

670
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:38,562
welcome your new TV, right?

671
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:42,282
Today is not a good time.

672
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:56,162
(...preyed amongst by every predator in the UK)

673
00:55:56,722 --> 00:55:59,482
(is the ability to breed constantly and readily.)

674
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,782
(This is an art the rabbits have mastered.)

675
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:11,842
(...bobbing their tails is not indigenous species.)

676
00:56:19,993 --> 00:56:23,162
(Rabbits populate and breed...)

677
00:56:51,362 --> 00:56:53,162
Pleum, where's everyone?

678
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,642
Nobody's here yet.

679
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:58,122
Shoan's gone to round the morning ward.

680
00:57:04,852 --> 00:57:06,202
Let me ask you something.

681
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:12,666
Lately,

682
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:15,202
has there been anything wrong with Shoan?

683
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,602
Like...

684
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:20,105
I think Shoan seems strange.

685
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:21,762
How is he strange?

686
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:25,790
Like, he avoids me. He doesn't want to see and talk to me.

687
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:27,122
And

688
00:57:27,722 --> 00:57:29,762
when we run into each other,

689
00:57:29,922 --> 00:57:32,402
he walks away, just like that.

690
00:57:33,189 --> 00:57:34,562
Is that strange?

691
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:38,042
When I tell you this, don't tell anyone.

692
00:57:40,026 --> 00:57:42,026
I think Shoan has a crush on someone.

693
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,602
Shoan?

694
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,042
Really?

695
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,580
Yes.

696
00:57:50,248 --> 00:57:53,562
What's wrong? Actually, I think Shoan is cute. Like...

697
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:55,562
He's worth protecting.

698
00:57:56,842 --> 00:57:58,642
No. I mean, he can have a crush.

699
00:57:58,745 --> 00:58:02,202
He can have a crush on anyone, but why would he be strange to me?

700
00:58:02,652 --> 00:58:05,338
- Why are you getting mad at me? - I'm not. I just don't understand.

701
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:06,682
It's frustrating.

702
00:58:07,071 --> 00:58:09,722
You know what? You think he acts strange with you,

703
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:13,002
but did you act strange with him first?

704
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,402
- I did? - Yes.

705
00:58:15,656 --> 00:58:17,922
When did I act strange with Shoan?

706
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:36,242
I can't deal with it anymore.

707
00:58:36,816 --> 00:58:39,242
I want to regain my focus.

708
00:58:39,842 --> 00:58:42,242
I tried, but I can't.

709
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,642
Why did you have to avoid her that much?

710
00:58:49,162 --> 00:58:50,482
It's because...

711
00:58:53,682 --> 00:58:55,162
Who do you mean?

712
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:56,802
Did you find out?

713
00:58:57,322 --> 00:58:58,882
It's so obvious.

714
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:00,522
It's Dr. Prim, right?

715
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:04,122
Yes.

716
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:07,762
I tried testing myself.

717
00:59:08,802 --> 00:59:10,562
I saw Dr. Sicha.

718
00:59:11,193 --> 00:59:12,642
But

719
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:17,442
I keep thinking of Dr. Prim in here.

720
00:59:18,482 --> 00:59:20,722
At this point, you have two options.

721
00:59:21,842 --> 00:59:23,322
Either confess to her or

722
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,362
stop thinking of her.

723
00:59:25,922 --> 00:59:27,162
Can you do that?

724
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,762
You know what? Either way,

725
00:59:39,626 --> 00:59:41,362
you need to use this.

726
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:44,122
Not this.

727
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:49,696
I mean, you need to use your feelings.

728
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:51,442
Understand?

729
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,042
Yes.

730
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:57,482
I will try that.

731
01:00:03,777 --> 01:00:04,962
Dr. Pleum.

732
01:00:06,554 --> 01:00:08,554
How many girlfriends have you had?

733
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,082
- I haven't had one. - Oh?

734
01:00:17,842 --> 01:00:20,842
I understand. I need to listen to you less.

735
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,442
You know what?

736
01:00:25,981 --> 01:00:27,442
It's fine if you don't listen to me.

737
01:00:28,999 --> 01:00:30,999
All you need to listen to is yourself.

738
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:17,722
(Dr. Prim makes me uncomfortable.)

739
01:01:17,802 --> 01:01:20,362
(Sometimes I don't like it. I can't focus)

740
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:52,242
Can we talk?

741
01:02:58,282 --> 01:02:59,722
I'll say it anyway.

742
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:01,402
I like you, Dr. Prim.

743
01:03:48,113 --> 01:03:50,682
Are you sad it turned out this way?

744
01:03:51,378 --> 01:03:53,122
I need to talk to you, Dr. Prim.

745
01:03:53,282 --> 01:03:54,762
No. I can't talk now.

746
01:03:54,867 --> 01:03:56,762
It must be now. This cannot wait.

747
01:03:56,843 --> 01:03:59,322
Hematoma! Upper airway obstruction. Remove the stitches.

748
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,242
- What a sloppy place! - Take the lump of blood out.

749
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:04,602
I'll sue the doctors and the hospital. Get that doctor here!

750
01:04:05,282 --> 01:04:06,442
Then I'm sorry

751
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:07,882
for making you uncomfortable.

752
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,645
From now on, we only talk about work.

753
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,944
Are you retarded? Let's mess him up!

754
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:13,521
(The victim is autistic.)

755
01:04:13,602 --> 01:04:15,642
(We offer our condolences to the victim's family.)

756
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:18,442
No!
