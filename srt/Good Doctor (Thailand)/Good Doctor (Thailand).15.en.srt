00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:18,162
(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:08,002
Do you still

3
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,802
like me?

4
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:17,762
Yes.

5
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,842
I haven't asked you why before. Can I ask you that?

6
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,442
Sure.

7
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:28,602
It's because you're kind

8
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,362
and normal.

9
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,730
You see me as a normal person,

10
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,362
so

11
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:41,082
Normalcy is something that is really special for me.

12
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,602
(Do you feel uncomfortable?)

13
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:10,882
(Are you uncomfortable because of the rain?)

14
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,961
- (Rain can lower your serotonin level so...) - (Come on.)

15
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,522
(Are we going right now?)

16
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,200
(Episode 15: Reason)

17
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,986
(Cancer medicine from well-known company recalled.)

18
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,332
(Usage before approval discovered.)

19
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,932
(Super poll found people need approval on medicine before use.)

20
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:53,122
If this batch of medicine doesn't get approved,

21
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,882
our families are going to fail.

22
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,322
If you don't worry about yourself,

23
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,912
think of your wife

24
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,082
(and your son.)

25
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,442
(They will suffer.)

26
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,241
(Elitist owner to provide clarification)

27
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:16,345
(on whether or not test results were fabricated.)

28
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:18,026
(His company expected to lose billions.)

29
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,842
(A cancer medicine from a well-known company has been recalled, )

30
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:36,082
(after an investigation found usage before approval.)

31
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:44,722
Professor, good morning.

32
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,242
Seventh floor, right?

33
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,562
You look tired, Prim.

34
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,162
Did you sleep?

35
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,442
Where are the first-year residents?

36
00:04:57,824 --> 00:05:00,802
Shoan and Mummim are on rotation.

37
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,962
Next month, they will be on Gynae.

38
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:11,082
What about your transfer?

39
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:13,802
Have you done your document? I heard nothing from you.

40
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:20,162
Well, it's in progress.

41
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,962
Excuse me.

42
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:47,842
Hey, you have to hurry up. You're about to be late for school.

43
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:51,522
Oh, honey.

44
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,282
Where are you going?

45
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:55,882
You don't want to know.

46
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,642
Don't go. Let's talk. Where are you going?

47
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:03,424
I'm going to visit Sophida.

48
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,002
I told you. You don't want to know.

49
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:11,002
What's wrong with Anat's wife? Why do you have to visit her?

50
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:13,264
You can't help her even if you know.

51
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,082
Don't pretend to care.

52
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,383
I'm talking to you nicely.

53
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,562
She has a tumor.

54
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:23,362
She's going to get surgery in America.

55
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:27,162
America? Is Anat going with her?

56
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,802
Is this the time to ask questions?

57
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,682
I'm done, Dad.

58
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,064
Okay, come on! Let's go to school!

59
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,042
I'll hold this for you.

60
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:56,404
(Nurse Counter)

61
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:13,802
You look happy. Are you ready for the ward round?

62
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:18,802
GMC's happiness just walked by.

63
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,682
That's Dr. Shoan.

64
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:24,882
So, do you mean I'm gloomy?

65
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,642
That's not it, Dr. Pleum.

66
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,693
It's different.

67
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:31,882
Dr. Shoan is innocent.

68
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,802
Just look at when he does ward rounds with Dr. Prim.

69
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:38,242
Dr. Prim becomes so much kinder.

70
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,842
She gets lively and gentle.

71
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:43,002
But with you, she's so mean.

72
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,650
What? That's me?

73
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,882
- Yeah. - That's not true.

74
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,722
You all are exaggerating.

75
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,962
Hello?

76
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:01,953
Yeah. Pleum just told me.

77
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,162
Do you want to come home with me tonight?

78
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,762
I have a little errand after work.

79
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:11,602
If you can't wait, you can go ahead.

80
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:14,762
Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

81
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:20,042
See? Big sister and little brother.

82
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:21,682
They're always there for each other.

83
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:23,642
Are you still talking about that?

84
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,242
Em, I'm going to get you!

85
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:31,242
Yeah, I've known you for a long while.

86
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:33,442
I haven't seen you date anyone at all.

87
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:35,068
Why don't you try opening up to him?

88
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:39,402
Maybe

89
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,042
it's time...

90
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,442
I'm just kidding.

91
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,682
I don't have time. That's nonsense.

92
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:55,042
Then stay single with your other little brother.

93
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,842
- This one will probably be single for a long time. - Whoa...

94
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:01,562
Em.

95
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:04,322
I can be dating without you knowing, right?

96
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:10,842
Is he upset?

97
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:12,682
Is he?

98
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:14,842
Here. This is done.

99
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,682
Shoan, are you on the ER shift today?

100
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,682
Good morning, Professor Phruek. I'm on shift here today.

101
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,602
Shoan is on the ER shift.

102
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:58,122
Be careful while you work.

103
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:02,482
- Shoan's got much better, Professor. - Really?

104
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,682
Next, open up IVC.

105
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:45,642
Remove the entire IVC tumor thrombus.

106
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:47,702
Correct.

107
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:11,602
Okay, Shoan. You've reached a critical point.

108
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,362
It's the point of no return.

109
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,522
After this,

110
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,362
it will be very difficult and risky.

111
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:24,042
You no longer have the option to cancel the operation.

112
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,642
As the surgeon of this case,

113
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:29,962
what's your decision?

114
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:41,602
If I were in charge,

115
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,922
I'd proceed to the end.

116
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,922
If we succeed,

117
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:48,262
the chance of recurrence will be very low.

118
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:55,305
And what about you?

119
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,482
What would you do?

120
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:06,842
If it were me,

121
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,002
I'd do the same.

122
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,162
Yes.

123
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:17,362
Then, I'll proceed.

124
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:56,602
Success.

125
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:00,162
For today,

126
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,122
you did very well.

127
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,842
Yay! Professor praised me!

128
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:10,297
Thank you.

129
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,442
What's going on?

130
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,202
What's going on?

131
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,202
Try to find out

132
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,282
what you missed.

133
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:29,042
That's your homework.

134
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,562
Professor, what's wrong?

135
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,362
What's wrong, Professor?

136
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,922
It's nothing.

137
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,762
Maybe I stood too long in operation these past few days.

138
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,242
NSAIDs will do.

139
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,442
If you take NSAIDs,

140
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,002
you need to be careful of stomach ulcers. You...

141
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,083
Stop that. Just stop.

142
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,482
I'm a doctor too.

143
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,182
I know that.

144
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,842
Yes. Understood.

145
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:02,642
Go get some rest.

146
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,242
Yes.

147
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,682
You're good at drawing, right?

148
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:13,362
Professor Prapas told me.

149
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,722
Can you help me with something?

150
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,202
What is it?

151
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,082
What are you doing?

152
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,049
Hello, Mom.

153
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:40,606
How is Dad doing?

154
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,602
(He's just lying down all day.)

155
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:45,642
(I turn him around in the morning and evening. Don't worry.)

156
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,722
He talked about you too.

157
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:50,762
If you have time, come and see him.

158
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:54,802
I will. After I get my schedule for next month, I'll let you know.

159
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,762
(Is that Dr. Prim?)

160
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:01,202
- Yes. - Ma'am, good morning.

161
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,082
I just had my meal. I'm going back to work.

162
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:06,259
Oh no. Are you on a break?

163
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:07,962
(I won't bother you anymore.)

164
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,082
Thank you so much, Dr. Prim.

165
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,202
(Shoan is very lucky to have you.)

166
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:17,842
Goodbye, Mom.

167
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:19,362
Okay. Bye-bye, sweetie.

168
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:21,802
Please say hi to Dad for me.

169
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:24,882
Honey, your son said bye-bye.

170
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:26,722
(Say bye-bye to him back.)

171
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,322
(Honey?)

172
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:34,122
(Bye, sweetie.)

173
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:39,442
Should we go and visit your dad sometime?

174
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,362
Yes.

175
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,522
Shin.

176
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:52,522
Watch your brother.

177
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,682
Shoan's over there.

178
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,042
What is it, Shet?

179
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:00,962
What do you want?

180
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,002
What do I want?

181
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,282
I want Shin to watch Shoan.

182
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:07,442
He's running around. He might fall.

183
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:22,721
Ready?

184
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:24,842
- We're on our way. - Mom!

185
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,818
Tonkla, don't do that.

186
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,762
Your mom is hurting.

187
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:33,762
I miss you, Mom.

188
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:35,401
I'm fine.

189
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,642
Come on. Give me a hug.

190
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:44,602
Your stomach is still big.

191
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:49,322
Your mom is getting surgery to remove it in America.

192
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:55,762
Are you okay?

193
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:58,050
I need to use the bathroom.

194
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,962
Nurse.

195
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,522
Tonkla.

196
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,962
Nat.

197
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:14,602
Are you sure she's okay?

198
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,362
She is.

199
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:17,982
Don't worry.

200
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,922
Mrs. Sophida?

201
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,162
- Sophida? - Emergency.

202
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:27,647
- We need an ambulance. - Nat!

203
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:29,362
Nat!

204
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,442
Which hospital are we going to?

205
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:37,962
The nearest right now is GMC.

206
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,642
Mr. Anat?

207
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:45,602
No. Go to Health Med instead.

208
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:48,522
- Just go! - Okay.

209
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,922
- Sir, we're going to Health Med. - Okay.

210
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,962
Sir, how long until we reach Health Med?

211
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:10,322
- About 20 minutes. - What about GMC?

212
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:12,402
With a shortcut, it'll be five minutes.

213
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:19,922
We have to take her to the hospital ASAP.

214
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:30,305
The patient has an ovarian tumor with possible intratumoral bleeding.

215
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,080
The family has to wait outside.

216
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:55,242
Okay. We're lucky. It seems the tumor hasn't burst.

217
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:59,162
What if it bursts, Professor?

218
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:03,362
If the tumor is cancerous, staging will advance. That's not good.

219
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:06,442
We have to operate and remove the tumor before it bursts.

220
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,162
It's as Shoan said.

221
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:11,762
However, all we can do is keep her stable.

222
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:14,202
Her family doesn't give us consent to operate.

223
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,562
Why not?

224
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:19,722
They have their reasons.

225
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,842
We'll send her in for a CT scan.

226
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,912
Observe her in the ICU for one night.

227
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:27,482
If everything is stable by tomorrow morning, move her to special care.

228
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,282
Yes, Professor.

229
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,282
I don't understand.

230
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,202
Prim.

231
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:58,242
Mr. Anat's wife is not an easy case, right?

232
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:03,042
She's lucky she got here in time. It could have been worse.

233
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:07,322
The nurses said they wanted to go somewhere else at first

234
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,362
but changed their mind at the last minute.

235
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:12,242
Maybe they don't trust us.

236
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,402
Why don't they trust us?

237
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:16,762
That time.

238
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:18,954
There was an incident.

239
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:21,762
I saw the way he looked at Shoan like...

240
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:37,922
Forget it.

241
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,842
I think Shoan can separate it.

242
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:44,802
It's not his first time dealing with this, right?

243
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:47,522
That's right.

244
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,402
We have to separate work from life.

245
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:54,242
Because no matter who the patient is,

246
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,282
a doctor's job is to save them.

247
00:20:57,512 --> 00:20:59,282
You're as cool as ever, Shoan.

248
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:03,122
Who could be as cool as one of my juniors?

249
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:07,122
He's a third-year resident.

250
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:14,082
He's single, fair-skinned, young, smart,

251
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,722
and capable. Girls scream for him wherever he walks.

252
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:19,562
Who is it, Prim?

253
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,950
- I was kidding. - Go find a bigger chad. That's all I'd say.

254
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,346
What's that?

255
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:02,122
Hi, buddy.

256
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:04,802
Good morning. What time is it?

257
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:11,162
- It's way over nine. - Okay.

258
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:15,482
Seriously? Why didn't you say you were sick?

259
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,642
How much longer would you act tough?

260
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:20,602
I'm not acting tough.

261
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:24,122
I just didn't think a little rain would make me sick.

262
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:25,642
I'll be good in no time.

263
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,322
I can do the ward round this afternoon.

264
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,162
OPD?

265
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,242
I can't make it.

266
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:39,442
Don't go.

267
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:41,042
Someone got you covered.

268
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,762
Really?

269
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:46,402
You're my best friend ever. Thank you so much.

270
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:48,162
It's not me.

271
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:49,762
You don't need to thank me.

272
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:51,882
Go take a shower.

(Nurse Counter - Appointment)

275
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,842
Dr. Shoan, is it your shift again?

276
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,002
Yes.

00:24:58,002 --> 00:25:00,202
(Dr. Pleum)

280
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:21,402
Why are you crying?

281
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,922
My mom is sick. I'm afraid my mom would be hurt.

282
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:36,282
Your mom is in hospital.

283
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:37,882
She's close to doctors.

284
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:40,402
She will be diagnosed with...

285
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:47,802
His name is Tonkla.

286
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,762
Tonkla, you must not cry.

287
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:55,098
If you cry,

288
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:57,226
your mom will cry with you.

289
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,242
Crying will hurt her wound.

290
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,042
Tonkla, can you help out your mom?

291
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:04,322
Yes.

292
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:15,842
This is for you.

293
00:26:17,194 --> 00:26:19,362
It's

294
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:22,762
magic milk.

295
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:25,482
After you drink this,

296
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,682
share your energy with your mom.

297
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,242
Tonkla.

298
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,482
Come here.

299
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,362
Thank you.

300
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:15,722
According to Dr. Phruek,

301
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:19,522
Miss Sophida intends to do the operation in your hospital.

302
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:23,122
But because of the situation right now, that she has

303
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:24,762
peritonitis,

304
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:27,242
we would like to suggest and convince her family

305
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:30,042
to do the operation in our hospital instead.

306
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:32,162
It would be best for her.

307
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:35,642
I couldn't agree with you more, Dr. Prapas.

308
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,442
We have postponed her surgery so many times

309
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,242
because of her heart condition.

310
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:42,323
That made her abdomen worse.

311
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:45,842
I'll send you all her information via email

312
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,682
after this meeting, okay?

313
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:49,202
Agreed.

314
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,128
Doctor Sarocha, our gynecologist,

315
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,962
specializes in ovarian tumors.

316
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,642
She will be in charge of this case.

317
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:00,402
Great. Anyway,

318
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:01,991
there's an important thing

319
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:04,482
you should know about her health insurance contract.

320
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:05,882
The contract?

321
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:13,642
Yes. We need the consent or signature of her parents or her partner

322
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,779
to let you do the operation at GMC.

323
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,644
Otherwise, we can't do it,

324
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,242
and we have to move her to Chicago.

325
00:28:19,442 --> 00:28:22,322
And as you know, it would be very dangerous for the patient.

326
00:28:22,688 --> 00:28:23,802
Okay.

327
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:27,442
That's done. Thank you, Doctor.

328
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:29,802
- See you again. - See you.

329
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,602
Bye.

330
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:40,122
The patient is in a high-risk condition.

331
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,842
But we can't do anything

332
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:47,802
if Mr. Anat doesn't sign a consent to have her operation here.

333
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:01,722
In a day or two. I'm going there anyway.

334
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:07,962
Hospitals in America are more credible, of course.

335
00:29:09,035 --> 00:29:10,802
How are you, Sophida?

336
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,290
You're okay. You're all right.

337
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:20,241
It's nothing. You're just out of morphine.

338
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,762
I'll ask a nurse to replace it.

339
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,202
Nat.

340
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,642
Nat.

341
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:33,722
Please let us help Sophida.

342
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,162
Or was it all because of me?

343
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,162
I've made my decision.

344
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:58,465
I'll get you some morphine.

345
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,715
Bear with it for a few days.

346
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,075
I'm going to take you abroad.

347
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:15,642
You'll be cured there.

348
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:32,642
(For your fever, every six hours or as symptom occurs.)

349
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:49,042
(For your fever, every six hours or as symptom occurs. - See other side.)

350
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,342
(The patient knows how to take medicine.)

351
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,499
(But due to unnecessary overworking, her condition worsens.)

It's not me.

You don't need to thank me.

I miss your brother.

359
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,522
Me too.

360
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:58,122
Do you feel lonely with just us?

361
00:32:59,596 --> 00:33:01,482
I don't come home often.

362
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:05,282
So what if

363
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:08,761
we have another one

364
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:11,602
in the family? Would you be okay with that?

365
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:15,482
Are you serious right now?

366
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:20,802
Are you sure?

00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:48,682
What's that, sweetie?

370
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:51,402
Magic flowers. For you.

371
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:58,122
Thank you. Magic flowers?

372
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:00,962
They erased my pain.

373
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,962
Good morning.

374
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:06,402
Good morning.

375
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:09,472
Let us see how Mommy is doing.

376
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,282
I have magic flowers, like you, doctors.

377
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:16,162
You have magic hands.

378
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,922
You can heal my mom.

379
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:19,578
I have magic flowers.

380
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:21,722
I can heal my mom too.

381
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,322
It's good to smile.

382
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:28,442
Yes. If I cry, she will cry with me.

383
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:30,523
That will make her wound hurt.

384
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,762
Well done, Tonkla.

385
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:40,362
Let us see how Mommy is doing.

386
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,762
Excuse us.

387
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:12,162
She has guarding peritonitis.

388
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:19,602
The tumor is starting to crack.

389
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,802
Tell Professor Sarocha immediately.

390
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:23,001
We need to operate ASAP.

391
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:26,162
Give her fentanyl, 30 micrograms, via IV stat.

392
00:35:42,522 --> 00:35:43,722
Tonkla.

393
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,602
We're taking Mommy to another room.

394
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:51,362
Then, we'll use our magic hands to heal her.

395
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,962
Please share your energy with her.

396
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,201
Yes.

397
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,682
What's going on?

398
00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:57,882
Professor.

399
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:00,522
She has peritonitis. We need to operate now.

400
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:02,602
Professor Sarocha is on her way.

401
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:04,682
Nat.

402
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:07,002
Sophida can't wait any longer.

403
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:25,202
Family, please wait outside.

404
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:11,402
Dr. Prapas.

405
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:13,233
Yes?

406
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,082
I don't want that doctor to attend my wife's operation.

407
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:24,442
What's your reason?

408
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:29,122
You know I don't trust him.

409
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:36,202
If you trust doctors elsewhere more,

410
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:37,522
I'm fine with that.

411
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:40,802
But our doctors here have morals.

412
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:43,482
For us, the patient comes first.

413
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:48,002
You've seen that in many situations so far.

414
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:51,322
Anyway,

415
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:54,642
that doctor is still just a first-year resident.

416
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:57,682
Isn't this operation too complicated for him?

417
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,433
A resident is a doctor.

418
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:02,282
Don't worry.

419
00:38:02,395 --> 00:38:04,095
The doctor in charge of the operation

420
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:06,282
is a professor with a team of residents.

421
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:10,802
Residents will observe and assist in the operation.

422
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,162
Okay. In addition,

423
00:38:16,402 --> 00:38:17,842
Dr. Phruek and I

424
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:19,802
will be observing too.

425
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:27,282
Fine.

426
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:30,162
If you yourself guarantee, that is.

427
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:34,722
If something goes wrong, even for a bit,

428
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:38,282
I'll do everything to take you to court.

429
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:46,922
Fine.

430
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,642
Nurse.

431
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:52,322
Record everything in that operating room.

432
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:54,042
Yes, Professor.

433
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,522
Clamp.

434
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:07,762
Suction.

435
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:13,202
It's around 20 cm.

436
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:15,291
There must be a lot of bleeding with these vessels.

437
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:19,242
The CT scan shows a lot of collateral vessels around the tumor and uterus.

438
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:20,738
There's a high chance of bleeding.

439
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:24,242
The patient has underlying HOCM, she can't afford to lose too much blood.

440
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:28,975
We must remove the lump while

441
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:31,282
controlling blood vessels to prevent bleeding.

442
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:35,282
We can do balloon occlusion within the internal iliac arteries.

443
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:40,682
You mean angioembolization within internal iliac arteries during removal?

444
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:42,402
Is that possible, Professor?

445
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,722
It is. Good idea, Shoan.

446
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:52,322
Mummim, call in Professor Boss. We need angioembolization in the OR now.

447
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:54,042
Right.

448
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,249
We'll start balloon embolization

449
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:09,129
on both sides of the internal iliac arteries.

450
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,162
We'll start puncturing at the right femoral artery.

451
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:14,922
Let's start puncturing.

452
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,842
Okay. Puncture's in. We got blood. Wire, please.

453
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:26,082
The wire is in.

454
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:28,842
Look at the wire's position in fluoroscopy.

455
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:30,722
Fluoroscopy, please.

456
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:34,282
Okay. The position is good. Sheath, please.

457
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:37,002
Put the sheath on, please.

458
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,882
We'll confirm the position in fluoroscopy.

459
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:42,162
Fluoroscopy, please.

460
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,082
Okay. The position is good.

461
00:40:44,218 --> 00:40:47,002
Okay. Contrast media is in her artery.

462
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:49,282
Connect a catheter now.

463
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:54,482
Balloon in.

464
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,122
Okay. It's crossed to

465
00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:58,202
the right internal iliac artery.

466
00:40:58,362 --> 00:41:01,202
Okay, the balloon's in position. We'll start blowing the balloon.

467
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:04,562
- Yes, we're ready. - Right. Connect an inflator now.

468
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:06,482
All right. Start blowing the balloon.

469
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:08,122
Slowly.

470
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:12,202
Okay, turn it up slowly.

471
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:17,882
Okay, put it at ten ATM.

472
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:22,322
The balloon's in a good position. We're done with the balloon now.

473
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:25,722
Her current intravascular volume is okay.

474
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:27,162
BP is not too high.

475
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:30,082
We have blood on standby in the OR. Ready to proceed, Professor.

476
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:33,122
Okay. We'll proceed with the operation now.

477
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:42,377
Suction.

478
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:45,282
Retractor, here.

479
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:47,362
Shoan, hold this part, please.

480
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,382
Heaney.

481
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:55,362
Heaney.

482
00:41:56,771 --> 00:41:58,162
Mayo.

483
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:01,082
Shoan, help me.

484
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:04,641
Take the specimen.

485
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:15,722
Check the patient's heart.

486
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:18,242
There's no bleeding in her abdomen.

487
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,082
LVOT is clear. Her heart is pumping fine. Volume is sufficient.

488
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:24,842
Vital signs are good.

489
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,082
Prepare to close her abdomen.

490
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,546
Yes.

491
00:42:39,002 --> 00:42:40,882
(The operation went well.)

492
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:57,609
The operation was successful.

493
00:42:57,722 --> 00:43:00,442
We'll transfer her to the ICU to monitor her condition.

494
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:03,322
Phruek.

495
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,762
Thank you

496
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,962
for always helping me.

497
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:12,802
Of course, I'll help you.

498
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,602
We're family anyway.

499
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,202
But I think

500
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,962
there's someone else

501
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:26,170
that you should talk to.

502
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,210
Why did you help me?

503
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,662
You know I don't like you.

504
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:56,162
Do you like pretending you don't know how people look at you?

505
00:43:56,451 --> 00:43:58,922
Or do you like being the good guy?

506
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:04,922
I'm capable of helping people who don't like me.

507
00:44:06,762 --> 00:44:08,442
You don't like me,

508
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:11,242
but you allowed me to operate on your wife.

509
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:36,042
Anyway...

510
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:42,082
Thank you for saving my wife.

511
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,690
A doctor's job is to save lives.

512
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:48,722
Excuse me.

513
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:09,714
Wow, Shoan. Your drawing is so lifelike.

514
00:45:09,962 --> 00:45:11,562
- Yes. - Thank you so much.

515
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:14,242
Yes. If that's all, excuse me.

516
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,602
You should get some rest.

517
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,162
- Goodbye. - Bye.

518
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:27,202
Miss Maysa, good afternoon.

519
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:29,162
Hi.

520
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,042
I won't tell you.

521
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:42,082
What's wrong with Shoan just now?

522
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:45,002
What is it that he wouldn't tell me?

523
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:47,202
What is it?

524
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,882
Well, Shoan...

525
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,522
Shoan was the first one who found out my secret.

526
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:00,522
What secret?

527
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:03,882
Is there anything he knows but I don't?

528
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,362
Well...

529
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:14,602
May, I'm sorry.

530
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,642
How should I put this?

531
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,962
This time,

532
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:21,762
I...

533
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:24,242
I couldn't tell you earlier because

534
00:46:24,602 --> 00:46:28,202
I had to know your answer first.

535
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:32,442
It wasn't supposed to be here.

536
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,042
Well,

537
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:58,042
I asked Shoan to draw this.

538
00:46:59,323 --> 00:47:01,043
It's this angle of you that

539
00:47:02,162 --> 00:47:04,282
I like to look at.

540
00:47:22,762 --> 00:47:24,122
Please allow me

541
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:27,202
to look at you like this for the rest of my life.

542
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:36,522
Is that okay with you?

543
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,201
Please marry me.

544
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:59,442
It wasn't supposed to happen here. Darn it.

545
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,482
Congratulations, Professor.

546
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:22,068
You guys found out so quickly.

547
00:48:22,123 --> 00:48:24,922
Yeah, Shoan knows, the world knows.

548
00:48:25,911 --> 00:48:28,042
- Is that right? - By the way, Professor.

549
00:48:28,148 --> 00:48:31,017
What hotel will your wedding be, and when?

550
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:33,383
- I'll prepare my suit. - There's no need.

551
00:48:33,482 --> 00:48:35,042
We won't go to any hotel.

552
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:38,442
We'll do it right here. You can't use a case as an excuse to bail.

553
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:41,242
All of you will be there to congratulate me.

554
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:43,122
Of course we will.

555
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:47,162
- Come on, Prim. - Yeah, Professor.

556
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:52,162
You never talk about getting married. This is too sudden. I don't get it.

557
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:56,402
I suddenly feel like I can be alone,

558
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:59,362
but it's better to come home to a hug from someone.

559
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:07,016
- Why are you so cringe? - Go on, Prim.

560
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:09,682
- Congrats, Win. - Thanks.

561
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:11,362
Have you got the date?

562
00:49:11,563 --> 00:49:12,682
Not yet.

563
00:49:12,808 --> 00:49:16,722
May will pick the date, but she'll just pick a day when we're free.

564
00:49:19,638 --> 00:49:21,142
We need to celebrate.

565
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:23,682
What about tonight? I'll invite Phruek.

566
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:26,402
Tonight? Yeah, I can go.

567
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,642
No alcohol, please.

568
00:49:28,723 --> 00:49:30,042
I'm taking NSAIDs.

569
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:32,522
I have back pain. I think it's a sprain.

570
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:36,682
I'll ask Phruek, and let's talk later.

571
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:41,802
Oh, that special kid?

572
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:45,402
I just met him during an ovarian tumor operation with Professor Sarocha.

573
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:49,122
He really liked to show off. You agree, right? He's so cocky.

574
00:49:49,324 --> 00:49:51,524
It's like he's afraid people won't know how good he is.

575
00:49:59,282 --> 00:50:01,562
A gossiping doctor is not cool.

576
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:07,588
He deserves the professors' praise.

577
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,202
He cares about his patients like he should.

578
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:20,882
If you want to be praised like him,

579
00:50:21,682 --> 00:50:23,362
spend your time studying hard.

580
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:31,762
What's so funny? You're laughing too loud.

581
00:50:32,922 --> 00:50:34,642
What is it? What's so funny?

582
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:37,522
We have a new legend.

583
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:39,082
It's Mim.

584
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:41,722
She worked in the delivery room for three days straight.

585
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:43,482
And she answered her phone and said,

586
00:50:43,783 --> 00:50:46,362
"Hello, This is Vagina speaking."

587
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:52,642
Stop that, Nick, Pleum!

588
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:54,882
The whole hospital knows already!

589
00:50:54,994 --> 00:50:56,962
Really? Did you really say that?

590
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,802
- I'm dead. - It's fine. Nick did that once.

591
00:51:02,002 --> 00:51:06,024
He was on shift for five days straight. He barely got any sleep.

592
00:51:06,118 --> 00:51:08,118
His brain was gone at that point.

593
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:10,682
He visited a gas station that day and said,

594
00:51:11,282 --> 00:51:12,522
"Mister.

595
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:14,962
Gasohol 95, less sweet."

596
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:18,682
He was messed up.

597
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,242
- Let's go home. - "Gasohol 95, less sweet?"

598
00:51:25,762 --> 00:51:28,442
It doesn't exist. It's a joke.

599
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,562
Did you get it, Shoan?

600
00:51:31,872 --> 00:51:33,722
Let's go home. Come with me?

601
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,482
You said you had to run an errand, right?

602
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:39,762
Yeah, but I'm not in a hurry. I can wait for you.

603
00:51:41,002 --> 00:51:42,442
Then I'm going.

604
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:46,362
Okay.

605
00:51:46,818 --> 00:51:48,122
See you tomorrow. Bye.

606
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:50,642
- Bye-bye. - Bye. See you.

607
00:51:51,402 --> 00:51:52,922
Shoan, be quick.

608
00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:16,282
For you.

609
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,168
What's this?

610
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:22,993
It's a thank-you gift for attending OPD for me the other day.

611
00:52:28,337 --> 00:52:30,122
A cardiology stethoscope?

612
00:52:33,537 --> 00:52:36,122
You should have a good one to use.

613
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:39,282
Take good care of it.

614
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:43,482
This is a very important item for a doctor.

615
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:47,242
Yes.

616
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:49,442
Someone once told me.

617
00:52:50,082 --> 00:52:52,442
A stethoscope is not what's important.

618
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:54,564
It's what's between the earbuds.

619
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:04,562
The brain?

620
00:53:12,762 --> 00:53:14,242
The brain it is.

621
00:53:58,722 --> 00:54:01,562
Hello, what's the matter?

622
00:54:01,762 --> 00:54:03,162
(I'm not sick.)

623
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,291
(I'm just calling to talk. What are you doing?)

624
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:07,122
I'm at home.

625
00:54:07,392 --> 00:54:08,922
I already had dinner.

626
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:11,842
(Did you eat alone or with someone?)

627
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:14,402
(Did you eat with the guy next door that you sat on him?)

628
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:17,602
Mom.

629
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,704
Are you still making fun of me with that?

630
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:22,762
(If you have someone to take care of you, I wouldn't worry.)

631
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:25,042
Again, Mom?

632
00:54:27,122 --> 00:54:29,522
Actually, we're taking care of him more.

633
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,362
Oh yeah, Mom.

634
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,562
He has high-functioning autism.

635
00:54:39,082 --> 00:54:42,682
(He's autistic, but he became a doctor. I think he's a genius.)

636
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:47,242
(I read somewhere that this type is capable of raising a family.)

637
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,242
You're not making sense, Mom.

638
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:56,848
I have to go.

639
00:54:59,002 --> 00:55:00,562
Okay. Bye.

640
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,842
Do you like me, Dr. Prim?

641
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:03,402
I think if I never get to marry you in this life,

642
00:57:03,562 --> 00:57:05,162
I'd have to live the rest of my life

643
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:06,962
in so much regret.

644
00:57:08,293 --> 00:57:10,635
- What about you? Are you ready? - I'm not confident at all.

645
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:12,082
I'm afraid I'd screw it up.

646
00:57:12,313 --> 00:57:14,962
Prove that I'm fine.

647
00:57:15,067 --> 00:57:17,522
Nothing's wrong with me. Listen.
