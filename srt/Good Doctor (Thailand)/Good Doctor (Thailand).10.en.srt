(Characters, places, organizations, and events in this show are fictional.)

2
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:45,602
What the heck is this?

3
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:51,842
Tell me

4
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:52,962
where your mom

5
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:54,842
is hiding the money.

6
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:57,762
Tell me! Tell me right now!

7
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,722
- I don't know. - You don't know?

8
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,508
You don't know? I told you to tell me!

9
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,042
Dad, don't hurt him.

10
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:05,602
Go find out where your mom is hiding her money!

11
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,362
What are you crying for?

12
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:10,962
Stop!

13
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:12,362
You ungrateful brat!

14
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,082
You're good for nothing!

15
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:16,482
What are you crying for? I told you to stop!

16
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:18,962
Stop! Stop crying right now!

17
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:20,922
Dad, stop!

18
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:22,762
So, I can't hurt your brother?

19
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:25,482
Fine! I'll hurt you then!

20
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,922
Hey, stop! Don't hurt our sons!

21
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,442
- What? - Please stop.

22
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,399
I can't hurt them, huh?

23
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,442
Shin, take your brother away! Shin!

24
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,802
- I can't hurt them? - It hurts!

25
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:41,562
Shin, take your brother away!

26
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:42,842
Shoan!

27
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,042
I know you're here.

28
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,122
Come out right now.

29
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:48,842
Come out!

30
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:51,882
- I can't hurt them? - Shin, take your brother away!

31
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:55,122
I finally found you.

32
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,032
What are you doing?

33
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,802
Don't get in my way!

34
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:09,642
Shoan!

35
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:15,204
- Doctor! - What are you doing to me?

36
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,118
- Doctor! - Let me go!

37
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,178
- Doctor! - Get him up.

38
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,464
- Doctor! - Let me go!

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,002
- Let me go! - Security, please take him away.

40
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,322
Where are you taking me?

41
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,482
I haven't done anything!

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,753
Could someone like you even be a doctor?

43
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:36,882
You autistic brat! I told you to let me go!

44
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,162
- Let me go! - Shet!

45
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,882
What are you doing to our son?

46
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:53,922
(Episode 10: First Time)

47
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,162
What are you doing to me?

48
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,722
I told you to let me go!

49
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,042
What are you doing to me?

50
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:08,282
This hospital is hurting civilians!

51
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,737
Shet, stop your nonsense!

52
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:13,082
You're already lucky that they didn't call the police.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,762
Let them call.

54
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,842
I'm just here to see my son.

55
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:18,842
I'm his father!

56
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:22,962
You wouldn't let me see him

57
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:26,002
because you're trying to live off him by yourself, right?

58
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,682
How would I dare to ask anything from him?

59
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:30,242
I didn't even raise him.

60
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,202
We're lucky he didn't recognize me!

61
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:36,042
If he could remember us, he wouldn't have come this far!

62
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,002
That ungrateful brat

63
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:40,082
forgot his own parents?

64
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:43,042
- I have to teach him a lesson! - Stop!

65
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:44,922
If you do something to him again,

66
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:46,722
I'll call the police myself.

67
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,465
Sir! Hey!

68
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:51,522
You have no right to come and cause trouble in this hospital.

69
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:53,802
As for Shoan,

70
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:55,722
if you need something, come to me.

71
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,522
It's you

72
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:03,362
who got involved with my son since he's a child.

73
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,402
Listen, Shoan is my son.

74
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:09,593
I can do anything to him.

75
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:11,962
So, you

76
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,242
want to steal both my wife and son away from me?

77
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:16,722
Shet!

78
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,442
I'm sorry, Doctor.

79
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:19,922
I'll take him away right now!

80
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,362
I told you I'm not going!

81
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,722
I'm not going until I get to see Shoan.

82
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:26,562
That ungrateful brat

83
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,682
needs to be taught a lesson by me!

84
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:29,922
You!

85
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:31,402
If you don't stop...

86
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:33,002
If you don't stop

87
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,602
saying bad stuff about our doctors here,

88
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,402
I'll send this video to the police for defamation.

89
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:39,802
Please leave.

90
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:41,562
Are you threatening me?

91
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:45,162
- You! You dare... - Shet!

92
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,482
What's wrong?

93
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:53,802
Don't touch me!

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,402
Shet, get out of here with me.

95
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,042
I'm really sorry about this.

96
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,842
Now, come with me!

97
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:03,402
Just you wait.

98
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:05,762
- Just you wait! - Leave now!

99
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,682
He's a little heavy.

100
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,042
Push him.

101
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,082
Is this alright?

102
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:16,722
Excuse me.

103
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,242
Dr. Shoan.

104
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,082
Dr. Shoan.

105
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:29,082
Dr. Shoan.

106
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,282
Dr. Shoan has wakes up.

107
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:47,642
How are you? Are you alright?

108
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:49,842
Hey, it's okay.

109
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,602
It's okay now.

110
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:56,402
Where is my dad?

111
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,107
He's already left.

112
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,802
It's alright now.

113
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,522
Calm down.

114
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:05,842
Are you okay?

115
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:08,162
It's alright now.

116
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,858
Was that really Shoan's dad?

117
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,442
Yes.

118
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:15,282
Shoan had a pretty unfortunate childhood.

119
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,674
He was physically abused by his dad when he was a child.

120
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,802
That's why he became like that when he saw his dad again.

121
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:26,722
I think we have to take better care of Shoan.

122
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,002
Yes.

123
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:49,415
For this step, we'll monitor the patient's BP to see

124
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,129
if it's stable.

125
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:58,602
Shoan.

126
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:01,842
Are you listening?

127
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,802
Yes.

128
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:09,682
I said we had to monitor the patient's BP.

129
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,145
Now,

130
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:12,762
it's stable.

131
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,282
We'll perform an incision

132
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:17,002
and remove old blood.

133
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,082
Yes, Professor.

134
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,202
Blade.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,162
It's pretty bad to break up at this age.

136
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:03,002
It's alright, though, since you would have to break up later anyway.

137
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:05,842
You can find a new man.

138
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,722
You can easily find one.

139
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:09,582
Nah.

140
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:11,402
Let me focus on my work,

141
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:14,122
go traveling, or do something for myself for once.

142
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,882
That's good, but don't take too long with that.

143
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,042
You're going to be in your forties soon.

144
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:21,322
Right, do you want to freeze your eggs now?

145
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,042
What do you say?

146
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:25,842
Egg freezing needs to be done before your thirties.

147
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,722
Ploy, why are you in such a rush?

148
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,441
May and Win

149
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:33,122
are probably going to make up like always, right?

150
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:36,242
I don't know.

151
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:38,002
It'll be hard this time.

152
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:42,722
May,

153
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,362
let's have dinner with me and Man.

154
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,641
There's a man I want to introduce to you.

155
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,002
Ploy, don't do that.

156
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,985
May just broke up with her ex.

157
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,722
Don't you think it's too fast?

158
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,762
You're not listening to me at all.

159
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,362
Let me see.

160
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:04,642
With this kind of bad boy vibe,

161
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:06,202
she wouldn't like him.

162
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:10,202
I can try meeting him. There's no harm in that.

163
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,562
See, Doctor?

164
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:16,042
- Well, I'll set up the date now. - Sure.

165
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:17,682
Now?

166
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,522
Let me take care of that then.

167
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,122
May.

168
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:29,602
Listen,

169
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,562
the thing I told you about Win...

170
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,402
Honestly, I...

171
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:40,682
I think it's more complicated than that.

172
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,282
Is there anything more complicated about it?

173
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:47,362
You said you saw it with your own eyes.

174
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:49,602
But I didn't see everything.

175
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:57,137
Answer me honestly.

176
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:00,962
You already have May.

177
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:03,482
Why would you go after Dr. Prim?

178
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:04,882
Prim?

179
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,482
What does Prim have to do with this?

180
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:11,082
I saw that you visited Dr. Prim at her condo,

181
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:12,762
so I told May about this.

182
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,922
Do you think May wouldn't be concerned?

183
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,402
Hold on, condo?

184
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,322
What's this about?

185
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:29,162
I was driving Shoan to his home.

186
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:31,722
Shoan and Prim live in the same condo.

187
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,961
I didn't know.

188
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,642
Ask me first, then!

189
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,442
May said

190
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,442
you and Prim often stayed together.

191
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,082
You're imagining everything yourself.

192
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:47,323
Why didn't you ask me first?

193
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:52,282
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:02,282
That's probably my fault. It might look too inappropriate.

195
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:04,497
But there's really nothing.

196
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,922
I just had a chance to tell you today.

197
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,242
- May... - Forget it.

198
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:25,047
The reason Win and I broke up

199
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,362
might not be related to Dr. Prim at all.

200
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,282
Ten years ago, Win might have wanted me.

201
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:38,282
But now, he might be able to live without me.

202
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,642
You really like to assume what Win is thinking.

203
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,482
I think you should ask your own heart

204
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:47,962
how you

205
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:50,172
actually feel about him.

206
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:52,242
Answer that question first.

207
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:56,562
Well...

208
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,122
I have no right to give you advice

209
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:01,432
since I'm the cause of this matter.

210
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,362
Hello?

211
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,082
Oh, of course. I'll go in.

212
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:17,002
Yes, thank you.

213
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,282
Hey, I have to go back to the hospital. There's an emergency case.

214
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,602
I'll get going then.

215
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,002
Tell Ploy I'm leaving first.

216
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:26,642
- See you. - Bye-bye.

217
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,762
The patient is a three-year-old girl.

218
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,522
She has been having a stomachache for three days.

219
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:43,713
Three days?

220
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,842
Yes.

221
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,922
She vomited bile today and isn't able to eat that much.

222
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:52,562
I think she has intussusception, Professor.

223
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,802
How could her parents leave her like that for three days?

224
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,362
That's what I thought.

225
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,802
The doctor will be here soon.

226
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,082
- Hello. - Hello.

227
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:08,151
Hello.

228
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,362
How is Praew doing?

229
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,202
From the ultrasound result,

230
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,962
Praew is extremely likely to have intussusception.

231
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,098
Intussusception?

232
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:19,721
Actually, this disease is often found

233
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,642
among two-month to three-year-old children.

234
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:25,282
Our intestines constrict

235
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:26,842
to move food to other parts.

236
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:29,702
Sometimes, they can slide

237
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,122
into each other's fold

238
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,002
and can't come out by themselves.

239
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:43,402
Honestly, you shouldn't have let her condition go on for this long.

240
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:45,082
Fortunately for her,

241
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,329
her intestines aren't dead or leaky.

242
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:50,562
- Leaky? - We thought she just had a stomachache.

243
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,362
That's right.

244
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,802
How did she get that bruise?

245
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:07,882
She was naughty.

246
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,962
That's why she got a bruise from that.

247
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:14,082
Right?

248
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:16,202
Yes.

249
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:22,602
Let me touch your stomach, alright?

250
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:27,162
Ouch, my tummy hurts.

251
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,242
Professor, she already has guarding.

252
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,082
She probably has peritonitis.

253
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:32,842
- Prepare the OR. - Yes.

254
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,082
Does she need an operation?

255
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:36,642
Does she need an operation?

256
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:39,722
- She has to... - We have to treat her intussusception first.

257
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:42,922
If we let this continue, her intestines might have ischemia,

258
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:44,841
and then her intestines have to be cut out.

259
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:47,522
Mom, my tummy hurts.

260
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:51,682
Mom, my tummy hurts.

261
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,682
My tummy hurts.

262
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:58,162
Red currant jelly stool. It's red currant jelly stools, Professor.

263
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,482
My tummy hurts.

264
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,162
Her heart rate is going up.

265
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:05,962
This isn't good.

266
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:07,555
- Please save Praew. - Fon.

267
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:09,420
- Load 300 cc of normal saline. - Yes.

268
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,922
Shoan, go check the lab result.

269
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,602
- Yes. - Hurry.

270
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:23,122
Pull.

271
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,122
Pull.

272
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:34,682
Her intestines are really swollen.

273
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,115
How could they leave her like this for three days?

274
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,482
I feel bad for her.

275
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,106
From the color, we might not have to cut them.

276
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:49,882
More anesthetic. We'll try to reduce her intestines.

277
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:51,362
I don't think they're dead,

278
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:52,823
but we'll try just in case.

279
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:55,122
- Yes. - Shoan, reduce them.

280
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,162
Yes.

281
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,002
We have a problem.

282
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,242
Her BP is dropping. Bradycardia.

283
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,282
It's reperfusion syndrome.

284
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,282
We have to cut the dead parts out first.

285
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,242
More anesthetic, please.

286
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:27,415
Please prepare calcium and bicarb.

287
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:28,642
Yes.

288
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,042
Clamp.

289
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,472
Clamp.

290
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:38,075
- Calcium. - Is this calcium?

291
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,122
Clamp.

292
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,042
Blade.

293
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:56,202
Her BP is back to normal.

294
00:17:58,065 --> 00:17:59,122
That was close.

295
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,162
Shoan, check her blending,

296
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:03,258
pump her stomach, and prepare to stitch the wound.

297
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,921
Warm saline, please.

298
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,002
Yes.

299
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:29,642
Splenic hematoma from blunt injuries.

300
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:31,802
The operation didn't cause this.

301
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:36,442
The patient is likely abused.

302
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:37,712
The patient is likely abused.

303
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:39,362
The patient is likely abused.

304
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:40,882
We'll talk about that later.

305
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,922
From the look of her spleen, it still looks alright.

306
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,682
The hematoma looks old. We might not have to cut off her spleen.

307
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:49,002
After the pump...

308
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:56,482
Mummim, stitch the wound for Shoan.

309
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:57,922
Yes, Professor.

310
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,922
Shoan, back off.

311
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,842
Shoan, back off.

312
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:13,562
(Reception)

313
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:20,722
The kid is naughty.

314
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,922
Don't you understand?

315
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:26,082
Do you still want your child to have a father?

316
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,282
Got it?

317
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:41,122
What?

318
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,562
You can just stay here

319
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:08,402
until he wants to leave.

320
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:09,802
Don't worry.

321
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:12,762
Nuay can help watch out for you here.

322
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:16,433
Thank you so much, Aoy.

323
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,447
I'll have to find a new place later anyway.

324
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:20,320
I don't want to trouble you.

325
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,762
Don't worry.

326
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:23,442
Really...

327
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:25,578
I don't know how you fell in love with that person.

328
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,842
At first, everything wasn't like this.

329
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:36,282
I understand.

330
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,842
But you and your son got beaten up by him.

331
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,882
Why don't you just cut him off?

332
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:45,562
In the past,

333
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,530
he was a nice guy.

334
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:53,362
I thought that nice guy would be back one day.

335
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:56,962
I'm so pathetic, aren't I?

336
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,802
I think it's time for me to accept the truth.

337
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:12,882
Be careful.

338
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,122
Be careful.

339
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:20,402
Here.

340
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,842
His body is really hot.

341
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:37,562
Yen.

342
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,602
Let me stay with you.

343
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,482
I have nowhere else to go, Yen.

344
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,402
Now you're acting meekly?

345
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,762
When you were fine, you were always beating up your wife and sons.

346
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:51,522
I have a stomach ache.

347
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,922
I have no strength to do anything.

348
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,322
Hey, don't raise your voice here.

349
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:00,442
Yen.

350
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:03,762
I promise

351
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:05,482
I'll stop drinking.

352
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:07,602
Let me stay with you.

353
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:09,482
Please, Yen.

354
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:14,122
Please.

355
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:18,899
You have to promise another thing.

356
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,642
Stop getting involved with our son.

357
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,002
If you do that again,

358
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:26,162
I'll be the one who put you in jail.

359
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:31,282
I promise

360
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:33,442
I won't get involved with Shoan again.

361
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,122
I finally found you.

362
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,658
It's fine.

363
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:26,242
It's fine now.

364
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,488
Thank you.

365
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,937
See? I knew it. He's here.

366
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:55,962
When I said it was for you, Jib said you'd be here.

367
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:58,522
Thank you.

368
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:02,402
Shoan, do you feel better?

369
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,102
A bit better.

370
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,802
It's at the medium level.

371
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,802
That's good, then.

372
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:13,962
You can go into the OR now.

373
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:16,642
We'll have laparoscopic surgery today.

374
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,322
I heard Dr. Win will grade this as well.

375
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,170
If you do well, he'll probably ask you to help him consistently.

376
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,562
Really?

377
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:27,162
Do you really like that?

378
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:29,842
Everyone doesn't really like to be with a strict guy like him.

379
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:32,282
If you're not truly good, it'll be hard for you.

380
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:36,242
He probably calls for Prim most often among us.

381
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,562
Doesn't he call for Dr. Prim often

382
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,722
because he wants to be close to her?

383
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,722
What?

384
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:48,864
Explain.

385
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,945
Yeah, explain.

386
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:52,362
I just saw his girlfriend come here the other day.

387
00:24:52,443 --> 00:24:54,202
- Yeah. - Whose girlfriend?

388
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:59,282
Dr. Prim and Professor...

389
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:01,922
It's Mim.

390
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,042
Mim

391
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,442
is using a dating app again.

392
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:07,682
Again?

393
00:25:07,802 --> 00:25:12,322
Please date someone far away this time. Don't date anyone here.

394
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:14,882
My back...

395
00:25:31,603 --> 00:25:32,882
I thought it was Yen.

396
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,642
Dr. Mummim.

397
00:25:48,562 --> 00:25:50,882
I have something to talk to you about privately.

398
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:58,962
With me?

399
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:28,826
Shoan.

400
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,082
Yes?

401
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,162
You can't go into the OR.

402
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,682
Why? What did I do wrong?

403
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:53,042
But why aren't you inside?

404
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:56,882
Another professor is taking care of that.

405
00:26:58,122 --> 00:27:00,242
I'll give you 10 minutes to get change.

406
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:02,642
Come see me at the parking lot.

407
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:07,002
This is an order.

408
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:11,722
Yes.

409
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:30,082
The seventh good surgical practice.

410
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:36,002
Both you and I

411
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,890
aren't well enough to be responsible for our patient's life.

412
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:43,802
Good surgical practice.

413
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:45,362
I know that.

414
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:50,282
But where are we going?

415
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:54,282
I'm going to take you to the place

416
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,362
that will enable you to operate again

417
00:27:58,122 --> 00:27:59,522
and make you get better as well.

418
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,082
Do you want to go?

419
00:28:01,737 --> 00:28:02,882
Yes.

420
00:28:09,796 --> 00:28:12,002
(Outpatient Building)

421
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:22,402
It's fine if it's a mess.

422
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:24,802
It's fine if it's a mess.

423
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:29,802
Your car is a mess.

424
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:34,282
I know that.

425
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:38,202
Oh...

426
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:41,859
Sorry. It's really a mess. Please put it back.

427
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:56,289
They don't need to be that organized.

428
00:28:58,962 --> 00:29:00,162
No way.

429
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,781
It'll make me uncomfortable.

430
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,105
Whose photo is this?

431
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,162
My younger brother.

432
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:24,962
He's a pretty good drawer.

433
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,762
I also like to draw.

434
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,802
He's autistic like you.

435
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,522
I want to meet him.

436
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,802
He's already in heaven.

437
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,722
If heaven isn't that big,

438
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:58,442
your brother will probably get to meet Shin.

439
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,002
Shin, is that your older brother?

440
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:06,762
Yes.

441
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:10,402
Good surgical practice.

442
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,767
Are you not ready because of this?

443
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,490
Actually, it's not about that right now.

444
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:17,682
Then, what is it about?

445
00:30:24,882 --> 00:30:26,602
I'll tell you about it when you grow up.

446
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:29,969
But I'm already 26 years old.

447
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:31,602
Haven't I grown up enough?

448
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,873
Not yet. You need to grow up a little bit more.

449
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:38,602
A little bit more.

450
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:01,002
Let me introduce myself officially.

451
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,640
I'm Sicha.

452
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:04,642
Hello, Professor Sicha.

453
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,602
Think of today as the day to introduce ourselves.

454
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:12,602
You might not want to talk about something.

455
00:31:12,818 --> 00:31:15,641
If you don't feel alright, you can tell me.

456
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,682
How are you today, Shoan?

457
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:27,322
What do you mean?

458
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:31,802
Well, just in general. It isn't about anything specific.

459
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,202
Normal.

460
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:41,002
Good.

461
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,242
Can you tell me

462
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:45,642
what you've been doing since this morning?

463
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:48,898
Today, I had a morning shift.

464
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:50,962
I checked on the OPD.

465
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:53,242
I've checked on

466
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:55,202
twelve patients in total.

467
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,682
I had to finish my pork congee quickly as I had to go into the OR,

468
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:01,242
but Professor Win wouldn't let me go in.

469
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,602
That's why I'm here.

470
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,362
Okay.

471
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:08,762
Do you have anything that you like or dislike?

472
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:12,042
I don't like pork congee

473
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:13,523
because it doesn't have vegetables,

474
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:15,682
but it's necessary for me to eat it.

475
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:18,842
And...

476
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:22,682
My patient.

477
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,002
She is only three years old,

478
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:27,922
but she might have been abused.

479
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:29,922
I don't like it.

480
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,242
When I knew that she might have been abused,

481
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:34,322
my heart was beating fast.

482
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,002
I don't like it.

483
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:38,442
People who do that kind of thing must be punished.

484
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:40,482
I don't like it.

485
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,482
What you're feeling right now

486
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:44,362
must be anger.

487
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,042
It's normal.

488
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,482
When you see someone getting abused, especially children,

489
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:52,322
you'll usually feel angry at the person who abuses them.

490
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:55,442
Do you have anything else, Shoan?

491
00:32:55,895 --> 00:32:56,962
Dad...

492
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,522
Dad is back.

493
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:04,603
I don't like it when Dad comes home.

494
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:06,602
Dad is back.

495
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:08,922
I don't like it when Dad comes home.

496
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:10,460
I don't like it when Dad comes home.

497
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:12,073
- I don't like it when Dad comes home. - Shoan.

498
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:14,282
- I don't like it when Dad comes home. - Shoan.

499
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,953
- I don't like it when Dad comes home. - Shoan.

500
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,588
- I don't like it when Dad comes home. - Shoan.

501
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:20,332
- I don't like it when Dad comes home. - Shoan, focus on my voice.

502
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:23,002
- I don't like it when Dad comes home. - Take a deep breath.

503
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:24,562
Take a deep breath.

504
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,962
Follow what I say. Breathe in,

505
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,842
breathe out.

506
00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:33,082
Breathe in,

507
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:35,722
breathe out.

508
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:40,242
Good, Shoan. That's really good.

509
00:33:54,922 --> 00:33:56,122
Goodbye, Professor.

510
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:57,402
Goodbye.

511
00:34:07,642 --> 00:34:09,082
I don't like this.

512
00:34:10,736 --> 00:34:12,362
You should have told me first.

513
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:21,802
That's true.

514
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:25,642
I should have told you first.

515
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:28,682
I'm sorry.

516
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:32,362
Next time, I'll tell you first.

517
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:35,722
Good.

518
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
But I want you to get better.

519
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:41,162
That's why I brought you here.

520
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:43,402
But I can't do this.

521
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:47,762
I'm scared when I think of my dad.

522
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
My dad makes me unable to operate.

523
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,322
Do you remember my brother,

524
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:01,242
who's already in heaven?

525
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,642
Yes.

526
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:05,882
I was the cause of his death.

527
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:11,042
I didn't want to think about it.

528
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,642
But if I continued to avoid it,

529
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,722
I wouldn't be able to be a doctor.

530
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:24,042
It's not easy. I understand.

531
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:28,002
But you'll get through it one day.

532
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:31,522
Trust me.

533
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,722
Why does it hurt so much?

534
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:49,107
Do you still have a stomach ache?

535
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,642
Should I take you to the hospital?

536
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,282
No.

537
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:56,802
I'm in pain

538
00:35:57,642 --> 00:35:59,442
because I don't get to drink.

539
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:05,762
I...

540
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:07,922
I already promised you

541
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:09,442
that I would stop.

542
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,882
I have to endure this.

543
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,882
But if it's that bad, please don't fight it.

544
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:20,802
I'll take you to see a doctor at clinics around here.

545
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,554
Doctor?

546
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,882
Shoan...

547
00:36:27,731 --> 00:36:29,202
Would he realize

548
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,242
that his mother's bedroom is even smaller than a rat's nest?

549
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:34,162
Again?

550
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:36,442
Please learn to be ashamed of yourself.

551
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:38,762
You hit him like he was an animal.

552
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:41,602
We're fortunate enough that he is able to come this far.

553
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:44,082
Don't drag him down again.

554
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:47,362
Are you my mother?

555
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:49,922
Stop talking.

556
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,962
I'll be back around six o'clock.

557
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,402
I've put your food in the fridge.

558
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:01,402
You can go get it yourself.

559
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:03,602
I'm leaving.

560
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:33,402
She is starting to recover.

561
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:35,242
Her life is not in danger anymore.

562
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:38,122
In two weeks,

563
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,242
she'll probably be back to normal.

564
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:43,722
Thank you so much, Doctor.

565
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:47,842
When will she get to go home?

566
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:52,002
Let us watch her condition for a few days.

567
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:53,602
If, on the fourth day,

568
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:55,301
she doesn't have any complications,

569
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:57,899
you can take her home.

570
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,002
If you haven't done anything wrong,

571
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:02,098
there probably won't be any problem.

572
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,122
We have to be thorough

573
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,762
with both outside and inside check-ups.

574
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,536
She recommends that she stay here.

575
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:18,635
Just do as she says.

576
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:21,562
If you're busy with work, I can take care of her.

577
00:38:30,802 --> 00:38:32,802
I'm sorry about this.

578
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:37,002
If you have time,

579
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,115
I have something to tell you.

580
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:58,362
What's wrong with you?

581
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:01,762
Prim, I don't think this is right.

582
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,722
Hey, calm down. Take a deep breath.

583
00:39:06,122 --> 00:39:07,522
Calm down.

584
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:10,922
Come here. Let's hear you.

585
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:14,922
It's like this.

586
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:16,562
I'm working on this one case.

587
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:18,302
The patient is a three-year-old girl.

588
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:19,917
During the surgery,

589
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:23,633
we found that there were a lot of bruises on her internal organs,

590
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:29,682
which might have been caused by several forceful blows.

591
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:32,402
And the bruises on her ear and thigh

592
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:35,762
that you said were caused by her playing around,

593
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:38,137
I don't think that's the case.

594
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:42,282
She is probably physically abused by someone.

595
00:39:49,842 --> 00:39:52,719
Do you have any idea

596
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,480
who that might be?

597
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,842
Don't tell me

598
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:08,106
it's her father.

599
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:14,162
Do you already know about this?

600
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:39,786
Are you scared?

601
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:41,727
Is that why you haven't told anyone?

602
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:47,322
Well...

603
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:49,562
You can tell me.

604
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:51,562
I'll do my best to help you.

605
00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:55,082
We have to tell the police.

606
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:10,002
What if her father is arrested?

607
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:14,442
Praew will become a fatherless child.

608
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:18,002
How would I live then, Doctor?

609
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,082
How could you think like that?

610
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:32,762
She's a three-year-old who almost died from being physically abused.

611
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:35,762
You should love your child

612
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:38,202
more than you love your husband.

613
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:47,162
Wow, he can't be a father. How could he do that to a child?

614
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:51,153
Yeah.

615
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:53,922
You can't really judge the book by its cover.

616
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:56,641
His appearance is nice. He looks like he has a good education,

617
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,882
but he's such a jerk.

618
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:02,442
The problem is how her mother has endured this.

619
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:04,322
I feel bad for her child.

620
00:42:04,603 --> 00:42:06,322
Have you told Professor Irin?

621
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:08,442
Yeah.

622
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:10,401
I got chewed out by her

623
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:12,362
for saying that to her mother.

624
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:13,882
Come on.

625
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:16,002
At least you get to say it out loud.

626
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:24,242
- What's up? - (Prim, are you ready for tomorrow?)

627
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:27,722
- Tomorrow? - (A dinner with Ning.)

628
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:32,731
Oh, can I say that I'm busy now?

629
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:37,618
(You can't. You have to come. I've already confirmed everything.)

630
00:42:37,714 --> 00:42:39,897
Okay. I'll be a little late. See you.

631
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:43,129
Why don't you want to go there?

632
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:48,682
Are you afraid you'll see your ex?

633
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:53,607
- I haven't had a boyfriend before. - What?

634
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:55,642
You haven't had a boyfriend before?

635
00:42:56,544 --> 00:42:57,544
No.

636
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,642
When you're so pretty like this?

637
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:01,922
You had the same reaction as my friend.

638
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:04,362
It's true, though.

639
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:07,882
I don't want to answer that question.

640
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:18,002
(Cute Animals in the World)

641
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:23,161
Spending a lot of time in front of a screen

642
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:25,562
can cause faster macular degeneration in children.

643
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:28,362
It's better if they play with touchable toys.

644
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:30,802
I'm sorry.

645
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,457
We really recommend

646
00:43:38,538 --> 00:43:41,137
that she stay here for at least a week

647
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:43,642
to let her wound recover.

648
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:45,882
Of course.

649
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:51,002
And have you made a decision about that matter?

650
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:59,522
- I don't think I can do it by myself... - Dr. Mim.

651
00:43:59,785 --> 00:44:01,634
Her father wants her to be discharged,

652
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,882
but I stalled to try to consult with you first.

653
00:44:05,457 --> 00:44:06,882
He has no right.

654
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,842
Only her parents

655
00:44:12,923 --> 00:44:15,162
can take her home,

656
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,842
and you want her to continue to stay here.

657
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,522
Isn't that right?

658
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:24,522
Yes.

659
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:29,282
Mummim, call 1300.

660
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:31,162
- Yes. - Fon,

661
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,242
please tell her father about it.

662
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:35,762
And call the police to be on standby.

663
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:36,922
Yes.

664
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,922
What police?

665
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:42,402
I just want to take my child

666
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:44,082
to a more comfortable place

667
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:46,882
with more space.

668
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:48,682
How is that a problem?

669
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:51,282
Right, honey?

670
00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:53,009
Tell them.

671
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,442
Please wear this for now.

672
00:44:57,218 --> 00:44:58,802
It's a problem

673
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:01,882
because, during the operation,

674
00:45:02,471 --> 00:45:03,762
we found a lot of evidence

675
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:06,122
suggesting that she was physically abused by someone.

676
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:09,482
Right now, her mother

677
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:11,076
agrees

678
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:12,680
to have an investigation.

679
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:15,402
What? Physically abused?

680
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:19,322
Thank you so much.

681
00:45:20,074 --> 00:45:21,722
But if you don't have evidence,

682
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:24,482
it'll mean that you, all the doctors,

683
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:26,442
are getting involved

684
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,242
with a family matter.

685
00:45:28,456 --> 00:45:30,002
More importantly,

686
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,362
is this even your duty?

687
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:35,362
- Although it's not... - We've done our best to do our duty.

688
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,305
But from now on,

689
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:43,402
we're doing our duty as human beings

690
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:45,266
to follow our common sense.

691
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,282
A girl at that age shouldn't have been abused like this.

692
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:50,714
If you want evidence,

693
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,762
here you are.

694
00:46:09,842 --> 00:46:12,242
I have to apologize on Dr. Mummim's behalf.

695
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:16,402
She might have been too harsh,

696
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:19,202
but she probably wanted to help.

697
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:24,608
Ma'am,

698
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:27,562
can I ask you something?

699
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:33,282
Do you really want this kind of family?

700
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:51,842
You might not understand,

701
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:54,202
but for a woman like me,

702
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:58,722
this is the first family I've ever had.

703
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:06,682
I want to protect it.

704
00:47:12,131 --> 00:47:14,402
Although it's bad,

705
00:47:15,802 --> 00:47:19,002
it's better than not having one.

706
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:25,282
Then, how long

707
00:47:25,763 --> 00:47:27,763
would it have to be like this?

708
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:30,322
How long would

709
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:31,882
you and Praew

710
00:47:33,994 --> 00:47:35,994
have to endure this?

711
00:47:37,408 --> 00:47:38,642
Honestly,

712
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:41,025
I just feel that

713
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:45,402
a family should be the safest place on earth.

714
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:47,282
Isn't that what it should be?

715
00:47:55,682 --> 00:47:56,882
I think

716
00:47:57,762 --> 00:47:59,682
you should

717
00:48:00,562 --> 00:48:02,522
think about this carefully.

718
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:15,602
This is my number.

719
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:18,882
If you want my help,

720
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,922
you can contact me.

721
00:48:32,882 --> 00:48:34,282
Doctor.

722
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:39,602
Please come to the station with us.

723
00:48:41,715 --> 00:48:42,715
Let me go.

724
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:44,722
Please take him away.

725
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:46,882
As for you, her father,

726
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,402
with this decisive evidence,

727
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:51,882
I don't think there'll be any problem.

728
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:53,682
Let's go.

729
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:57,810
Come out!

730
00:48:59,442 --> 00:49:00,722
Stay still!

731
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,562
This is your mother.

732
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:06,202
This is you, Praew.

733
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,722
Do you like it?

734
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:12,762
There's a rainbow.

735
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:17,122
It ends up okay, Professor.

736
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,866
But I still don't understand how they can endure this...

737
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,162
Enough, Mummim.

738
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:24,242
We have no right to criticize what they do in their lives

739
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:26,762
because we don't know all of the circumstances.

740
00:49:27,713 --> 00:49:29,162
Yes, Professor.

741
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:32,202
Being parents for the first time

742
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:33,882
isn't easy.

743
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,882
Actually, any parent can make a mistake.

744
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,073
Some people just choose to endure.

745
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:41,162
Some people just choose to leave.

746
00:49:41,947 --> 00:49:43,242
But all in all,

747
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,682
all parents do that because they love and worry about their children.

748
00:49:48,412 --> 00:49:49,922
But it's not everyone.

749
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:56,802
Some parents

750
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,745
choose to continue to make mistakes

751
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:02,442
because they wouldn't admit they've made mistakes.

752
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:05,442
We should help them,

753
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,879
not be mad or criticize them.

754
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:09,402
Got it?

755
00:50:10,865 --> 00:50:12,722
Yes, Professor.

756
00:50:15,143 --> 00:50:16,145
It's obvious now

757
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:18,402
why you've become a pediatric surgeon.

758
00:50:26,905 --> 00:50:28,442
You two did really well.

759
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:31,162
It's good that you didn't ignore this matter.

760
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,802
Thank you, Professor.

761
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,162
Yay!

762
00:51:08,322 --> 00:51:10,802
And I found corn inside that, Em.

763
00:51:11,122 --> 00:51:12,802
So, I eat it.

764
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:19,802
Shoan!

765
00:51:19,922 --> 00:51:21,882
Come out to see me right now!

766
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:24,762
Are you going to abandon your parents now that your life is good?

767
00:51:24,937 --> 00:51:26,042
Open the door!

768
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:27,722
Have you called the security?

769
00:51:27,856 --> 00:51:29,602
I have. They're coming.

770
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,240
Call them again! The patients are in a panic!

771
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:33,442
Shoan!

772
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,962
I'll tell everyone that you're an ungrateful brat!

773
00:51:37,082 --> 00:51:38,442
Open it!

774
00:51:39,816 --> 00:51:41,042
Shoan.

775
00:51:42,464 --> 00:51:44,282
Come out to see me right now!

776
00:51:46,976 --> 00:51:48,009
Come here!

777
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,762
That autistic doctor is Shoan.

778
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:53,442
He's an ungrateful brat! He abandons his parents!

779
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:56,056
Shoan! Come out now!

780
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,082
Shoan!

781
00:51:58,646 --> 00:52:02,041
Shet, what are you doing here? I told you not to come here again!

782
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,562
Let me go!

783
00:52:03,863 --> 00:52:05,562
What? What do you want to do?

784
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:06,962
You idiot!

785
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,483
Why are you protecting him?

786
00:52:08,564 --> 00:52:11,330
- Doctor! - If he loved you, would he abandon you like this?

787
00:52:11,424 --> 00:52:13,402
You deserve a slap to cure your stupidity!

788
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:14,602
Shoan, stay back.

789
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:16,545
Don't hit my mom!

790
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:24,442
Shoan.

791
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:27,162
I'll teach you a lesson!

792
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,642
I don't like it!

793
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:37,962
I don't like it!

794
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,402
What you're feeling right now

795
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:42,042
must be anger.

796
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,362
When you see someone getting abused, especially children,

797
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:48,122
you'll usually feel angry at the person who abuses them.

798
00:52:48,218 --> 00:52:49,218
Now,

799
00:52:49,932 --> 00:52:51,322
I'm angry!

800
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:57,602
You're angry?

801
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:04,762
Excuse me.

802
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:16,362
From the CT scan,

803
00:53:17,882 --> 00:53:20,322
the patient has end-stage liver cancer,

804
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:23,202
and the cancer has already spread.

805
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,010
Is it really critical?

806
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:32,682
I don't think he has long to live.

807
00:53:39,057 --> 00:53:40,562
Is there no way to cure it?

808
00:53:42,817 --> 00:53:45,321
The best possible cure right now

809
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:46,482
is to observe his condition

810
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,122
and give him palliative care.

811
00:53:48,746 --> 00:53:50,002
I'm sorry for this.

812
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,202
Do you have to dress up this nice, huh?

813
00:54:58,558 --> 00:54:59,842
How did you get here?

814
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:02,362
I'm going to have dinner with my friend from school.

815
00:55:02,762 --> 00:55:04,002
What are you doing? A date?

816
00:55:04,106 --> 00:55:05,900
It's not a date. I'm here to see my friend.

817
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:08,336
- Are you sure? - Yeah, it's Ning.

818
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:09,417
Ning?

819
00:55:10,356 --> 00:55:11,482
Don't you remember her?

820
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:14,562
Order whatever you want.

821
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:15,922
Hello.

822
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:17,842
Hello, Win.

823
00:55:17,962 --> 00:55:19,402
How did this happen?

824
00:55:19,578 --> 00:55:21,882
Well, I know Ta.

825
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:23,242
Since I know you're coming,

826
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:26,682
and Prim is coming, we decide just to sit together.

827
00:55:26,772 --> 00:55:28,934
Yeah. I've already drunk a lot.

828
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:30,322
Just drink it yourself.

829
00:55:30,403 --> 00:55:31,786
- I'd like water. - I don't want it.

830
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,239
- I have a morning shift. - Eh?

831
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,841
Why are you with Prim?

832
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:37,361
You two...

833
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:38,748
What's this?

834
00:55:38,842 --> 00:55:41,242
I just met him in front of the store.

835
00:55:41,626 --> 00:55:43,066
But it's fine if you think like that

836
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:45,522
because my friend is single now.

837
00:55:47,162 --> 00:55:50,922
Really? This is your chance now, Prim.

838
00:55:51,027 --> 00:55:52,914
- Stop! - You've had a crush on him since school.

839
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:54,922
Stop talking! Eat your food.

840
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:00,002
- And what? - Are you alright?

841
00:56:05,787 --> 00:56:07,226
This treatment

842
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:10,122
is to improve your PTSD condition

843
00:56:10,395 --> 00:56:13,162
so that you'll be able to live your life normally again.

844
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,082
But before that,

845
00:56:15,187 --> 00:56:17,642
you have to accept that

846
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:19,562
your cruel past

847
00:56:19,682 --> 00:56:21,282
really did happen.

848
00:56:21,618 --> 00:56:24,402
You have to find a way to deal with it.

849
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:26,682
This

850
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:28,894
is a notebook that I'll give you

851
00:56:28,975 --> 00:56:30,362
so you can write your reflection

852
00:56:30,466 --> 00:56:32,066
for each week.

853
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:33,992
If you don't like to write,

854
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:36,362
you can draw in it instead.

855
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,642
You can try it right now.

856
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,442
What happened, Shoan?

857
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,042
Get it out of here!

858
00:57:19,242 --> 00:57:21,562
You can order more. Do you want to look at the menu?

859
00:57:21,668 --> 00:57:23,402
What's wrong with you?

860
00:57:23,594 --> 00:57:26,042
I can have fun. Don't worry.

861
00:57:27,398 --> 00:57:28,842
Just a moment.

862
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:31,198
Don't you want to drink? Drink it.

863
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,602
I'm sorry. I have to leave now.

864
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:35,642
What? You just got here.

865
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:38,002
I really have a morning shift tomorrow.

866
00:57:38,098 --> 00:57:40,442
I'm sorry. I'll make up for this next time.

867
00:57:40,632 --> 00:57:43,202
- See you again. - Next time, alright?

868
00:57:43,602 --> 00:57:45,642
- Okay? - What's with that pose?

869
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,315
Are you an elementary student?

870
00:57:47,424 --> 00:57:49,459
Tell me how much I have to pay. I'll transfer it to you.

871
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:51,052
- Bye-bye. - See you, Prim.

872
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,602
- See you. Goodbye. - Goodbye.

873
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,322
You're not in a rush, right?

874
00:57:56,442 --> 00:57:58,442
- I can stay here for a while. - Good.

875
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,842
Prim.

876
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:26,482
Shoan ran away from Sicha's therapy room.

877
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:29,397
- Huh? - I'm going to look for him at the hospital. Are you coming?

878
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:32,402
Okay. What's wrong? Why did he run away?

879
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,522
I don't know.

880
00:58:47,627 --> 00:58:49,723
(But I still don't understand how they can endure this...)

881
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:50,962
(Enough, Mummim.)

882
00:58:51,183 --> 00:58:53,320
(Being parents for the first time)

883
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:55,042
(isn't easy.)

884
00:59:00,658 --> 00:59:02,002
Hello, Nick.

885
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:06,002
Can you go look at Shoan's room?

886
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:09,162
Yeah. He has run away again. I'm afraid we won't find him.

887
00:59:11,271 --> 00:59:14,042
If you see him, please call me back.

888
00:59:15,402 --> 00:59:17,162
We'll be at the hospital in 10 minutes.

889
00:59:17,475 --> 00:59:19,082
Okay. Bye-bye.

890
00:59:24,585 --> 00:59:26,162
What are you stressed about?

891
00:59:27,569 --> 00:59:29,562
I was the one who took Shoan to therapy.

892
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,322
He might not be ready yet.

893
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,842
The first time is difficult for everyone

894
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:42,522
since you have to talk about what you don't want to remember.

895
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:46,362
You have to give him some time.

896
00:59:47,282 --> 00:59:49,402
I think Shoan is trying his best.

897
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:55,202
- Shoan messaged me. - What?

898
00:59:56,172 --> 00:59:58,172
He asked if I was at the condo.

899
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:01,042
He might be at the condo. Should we go there?

900
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,162
Okay. We're going to the condo.

901
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:12,442
I...

902
01:00:12,746 --> 01:00:14,602
Can I ask you something?

903
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:17,122
What?

904
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:22,162
Did you really break up with Miss Maysa?

905
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:28,033
She misunderstood

906
01:00:28,802 --> 01:00:30,082
that I liked you.

907
01:00:37,098 --> 01:00:39,442
Prapas? Then I think I know.

908
01:00:39,992 --> 01:00:43,002
If you have more information, call me.

909
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:45,322
Okay, thanks.

910
01:00:57,457 --> 01:00:58,497
Shoan!

911
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:00,322
Shoan!

912
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:04,122
Is he not back yet?

913
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,482
We can go and wait in my room then.

914
01:01:08,587 --> 01:01:10,642
When Shoan is back, we can come out.

915
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:12,362
Okay.

916
01:01:15,898 --> 01:01:17,514
Please come in.

917
01:01:21,785 --> 01:01:23,202
Have a seat.

918
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:41,642
Why did May think like that?

919
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:47,042
I don't know.

920
01:01:48,602 --> 01:01:50,482
I feel restless now.

921
01:01:51,243 --> 01:01:52,762
It might be because we...

922
01:01:54,706 --> 01:01:57,162
Or is it because you used to like me?

923
01:01:57,305 --> 01:01:58,724
What? Never.

924
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:00,882
When we're in school, though?

925
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:04,482
Back then...

926
01:02:05,663 --> 01:02:08,922
Everyone probably liked you. Look at you back then.

927
01:02:09,322 --> 01:02:11,722
You're so cool at the university.

928
01:02:12,682 --> 01:02:14,162
And when you gave me the fish,

929
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:16,258
was it because you're too lazy to look after them?

930
01:02:16,282 --> 01:02:17,642
That fish over there?

931
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,482
- There might be two of them left. - Wow.

932
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:25,442
There are only two left. The others are already gone.

933
01:02:40,842 --> 01:02:42,162
It's probably Shoan.

934
01:02:46,461 --> 01:02:48,882
- Professor, don't scold Shoan. - I know that.

935
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:58,618
Professor, I'd like to stay with you for a night.

936
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:01,122
Come in.

937
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:03,762
May?

938
01:03:41,122 --> 01:03:42,628
When I tell you this, don't tell anyone.

939
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,602
I think Shoan has a crush on someone.

940
01:03:44,773 --> 01:03:46,042
Shoan?

941
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:48,909
I'm scared. I don't want to get surgery.

942
01:03:49,096 --> 01:03:51,096
I'm scared I can't skateboard again.

943
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:53,442
Why did you get close to my daughter?

944
01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:55,202
We're friends.

945
01:03:57,482 --> 01:03:59,002
When Dad dies,

946
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,082
will he go to heaven?

947
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:03,202
I don't want him to go to heaven.

948
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:05,362
Win.

949
01:04:05,483 --> 01:04:07,442
We should end this.
