Today, it's Nick's birthday.

3
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,522
He already left to see his friends.

4
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:39,322
And we couldn't give him a cake in time.

5
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:40,962
So,

6
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,562
you can blow it now.

7
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:58,250
Welcome, everyone, to ZSUN Pub.

8
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,322
- I'll just go this way. - Okay.

9
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:28,039
Today is a special occasion.

10
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,322
Happy birthday to Nick!

(GMC Medical Center 50th Anniversary)

14
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:03,642
(Hello, I'm One Day with Pleum.)

15
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,842
(Our hospital is so colorful today.)

16
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,082
(Yay!)

17
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:12,657
(Today is the 50th anniversary of GMC Medical Center.)

18
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,162
(We, the residents and nurses, )

19
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:18,082
(are dressing colorfully to give some colors to our patients.)

20
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,802
(The first one is our little sheep.)

21
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,842
(Good morning, I'm Dr. Mummim. Baa.)

22
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,404
- (Our next one.) - (Good morning, I'm a nurse! Boo!)

23
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:31,842
(I'm Emon. I'm dressing as a cow.)

24
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,967
- (Somrak.) - (Good morning, I'm Somrak.)

25
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,642
(I'd like to tell the director)

26
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:42,642
(that we've been working really hard. I...)

27
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,482
(Doctor Sea Lion, greet your fan club.)

28
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:52,962
(Good morning, I'm Shoan Jatemeechai, 26 years old. I'm a resident...)

29
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:54,722
(Do it again.)

30
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:59,162
(Good morning, I'm Dr. Shoan. Today, I'm a sea lion.)

31
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:01,482
(When a sea lion sees a human, )

32
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,041
(it will like to play with us.)

33
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:05,636
(It'll come close to us as it's curious.)

34
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,682
(Dr. Pleum, I haven't finished yet.)

35
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:10,162
(Shoan, that's too long. Keep it concise.)

36
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,329
(I'll feel unsatisfied if I don't say it all.)

37
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:15,202
(Don't argue with me. I'm not Prim.)

(Good morning, I'm Dr. Mummim. Baa.)

40
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:36,882
The panda on my head...

41
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,922
Is this Shoan's idea?

42
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,722
And the penguin on your head...

43
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,979
Shoan said I looked like a penguin.

44
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,082
That's right.

45
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:47,442
You're like a penguin.

46
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,538
Some penguins, like the emperor penguins,

47
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:51,482
really love their own partner.

48
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:54,922
A male penguin incubates eggs for the female for two months.

49
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,762
It has to travel at least 50 km to visit its female partner.

50
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:06,522
That's me.

51
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,352
- How's the edited video going to look like? - (I'm a cow.)

52
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:16,242
If I add some graphics and filters, it'll look like this.

53
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,522
Hold on...

54
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,763
Beautiful.

55
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:31,482
Your type?

56
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,632
No. I just said she's beautiful,

57
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,202
- in terms of symmetry. - That's enough.

58
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:42,402
What about her?

59
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:44,162
Is she beautiful?

60
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:54,873
What are you doing?

61
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,042
Are you playing hooky?

62
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:03,482
You're watching these kinds of things?

63
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,802
No, I was just saying she's beautiful.

64
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,602
I'm just asking. What if she hits on you?

65
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,362
I don't like it.

66
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:17,362
What a heartbreaker you are.

67
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:18,802
Well,

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,242
tonight, a panda guy like me

69
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,642
would like to find my own partner.

70
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:25,562
My friends from high school

71
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,042
made a reservation at ZSUN Pub. It's difficult to get a reservation there.

72
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,762
I'd like to ask the female rabbit here to work on my shift instead.

73
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:36,162
Let's go, animals,

74
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,802
to our ward round.

75
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:49,042
Professor Archawin, I'd like the apple back, please.

76
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:53,242
Isn't your makeup too light?

77
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,331
You're teasing me, huh?

78
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:58,704
I think I'll put on more lipstick then.

79
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:00,522
- Is it too pale? - That's probably good.

80
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:03,008
If my mouth isn't red, I won't have enough energy for work.

81
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,442
- What? - Do you want to go buy coffee with me?

82
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
No.

83
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:20,522
Let's go buy coffee. People are looking. I'm embarrassed.

84
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,362
I just met May.

85
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:29,047
May said she had scheduled the date for you to meet her father.

86
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:30,602
Are you still stressed about this?

87
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,082
I feel even more uncomfortable.

88
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,442
Here are your no sugar cappuccino and hot americano.

89
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:41,202
I don't think this is just about the hospital transfer.

90
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,362
You're afraid they'd ask about the wedding, right?

91
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,322
Yeah.

92
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,282
I think I'm still not ready.

93
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:51,442
You're at the right age. You're successful in your job.

94
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:54,282
You already have some white hair. How are you still not ready?

95
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:57,682
I think May's parents are just curious

96
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:00,842
who their daughter will be with in the future.

97
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:05,202
What about your future?

98
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:06,922
Who would you be with?

99
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:08,922
With you acting like a giant...

100
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,842
I'm just like the little puppy on my head, right?

101
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,682
I'm a puppy, not a giant dog.

102
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:16,082
Whatever.

103
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,222
Please, at least pay me some respect.

104
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,482
I want to talk to you for a bit.

105
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:22,762
What?

106
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,287
- Good morning. - Good morning.

107
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,642
Good morning.

108
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:29,002
Shoan is pretty good.

109
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,962
He gets along with kids.

110
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,802
I also heard he's accurate with diagnosis.

111
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:35,922
If you don't want him,

112
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:37,482
I'll take him.

113
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,562
Well, I have to give it to him for his diagnosis.

114
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,120
If you want a headache during surgery, feel free to take him.

115
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:47,882
If he's good at that, why don't we just send him to Pathology?

116
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:51,202
Professor Nui, my wife,

117
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,242
is working there.

118
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,762
I heard she wanted a resident to help her with work.

119
00:08:57,225 --> 00:09:00,762
You can call me if you want me to talk to Prapas.

120
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,202
- Professor... - That's good.

121
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,362
I'll leave it to you.

122
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,082
- What's wrong with you? - Isn't this nice?

123
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,322
He wants to be a surgeon.

124
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,722
Have you asked him if he wants to transfer there?

125
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,242
It's fine. It's good for him to transfer.

126
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:25,202
If he's here, he'll be just a tool for others to attack us.

127
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,162
What tool?

128
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,842
Do you think it's only me who doesn't want Shoan to work?

129
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:34,642
There's Phruek.

130
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:37,097
Phruek is okay with Shoan working here, isn't he?

131
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,282
He's the worst one here.

132
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,682
Why?

133
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:43,354
I'm sorry

134
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:48,225
for getting Dr. Phruek to suddenly set this up. I want to finish this soon

135
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,282
for the benefit of GMC Medical Center.

136
00:09:51,977 --> 00:09:54,802
I have a medicine. It's called Hephaestus.

137
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:57,122
It's a medicine

138
00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:58,922
for intestine cancer.

139
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,402
No one has imported it into Thailand yet.

140
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,802
The Spanish company and I

141
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,882
came to an agreement with such a good price.

142
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:13,362
That's why I want this hospital to be the first one to get this.

143
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:17,242
Thank you for thinking of our hospital first.

144
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:20,162
But I heard that this medicine

145
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:23,682
hasn't been approved for Asian patients, right?

146
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,282
Yes.

147
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:31,482
But even if it hasn't been approved in Asia,

148
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:35,602
I already sent it to the Food and Drug Administration.

149
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:38,642
I think we'll hear the result in a few months.

150
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,442
Listen, Professor Prapas.

151
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,842
Please try these out

152
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:49,082
to see if they really work or not.

153
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:51,882
If you're interested,

154
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:56,362
you can contact me or Dr. Phruek.

155
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,162
I'll take my leave for today.

156
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,162
Hold on.

157
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,642
Thank you so much

158
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,122
for

159
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:25,322
giving us the trial drugs.

160
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,442
But if it has already been approved legally,

161
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:33,322
there's no need for any trial drugs.

162
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:45,642
Why didn't you tell me that it hasn't been approved yet?

163
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,722
That's illegal.

164
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:54,722
Europe and America already approve of it.

165
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,722
It'll get approved anyway one day.

166
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:00,682
I think the reason your boss is still hesitating

167
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:03,242
is because I haven't paid him enough.

168
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:06,442
Hey, Professor Prapas isn't that kind of person.

169
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:07,762
And so what?

170
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,482
Do you not want it?

171
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:13,362
If this batch of medicine can't be sold,

172
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:16,202
our family will be ruined.

173
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:18,562
If you don't care about yourself,

174
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,217
please at least think of your wife

175
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,282
and your children,

176
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,722
who will be in trouble.

177
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:28,522
Go think about it.

178

(I don't think this is just about the hospital transfer.)

180
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,345
(It's about the wedding, isn't it?)

181
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,282
Professor.

182
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:21,122
- Here. - What's that document?

183
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,442
The one I told you about.

184
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,922
And here,

185
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:26,802
Nick's birthday cake.

186
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,642
I couldn't surprise him in time as he had already left to have dinner.

187
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,042
I forgot about that.

188
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:36,842
Right, Professor. I want you to look at this.

189
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:39,522
- What? - Let me show it to you. I found it.

190
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:41,362
Look at this.

191
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:42,682
See?

192
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:53,682
Do you have that much free time? Do you want another case?

193
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:58,122
I'm not that free. I already have enough.

194
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,802
I'll leave you to this now. Goodbye.

195
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:17,802
Dr. Shoan.

196
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,642
Dr. Shoan.

197
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:24,202
What's wrong?

198
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:26,818
Why are women so hard to understand?

199
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:30,762
I send messages to her every day. I didn't send them for a day,

200
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:32,443
but she's so mad.

201
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:35,842
It's because they have estrogen, so they're hard to understand.

202
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:40,322
You're even a genius about women's matters, huh?

203
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,082
You have such a cute face.

204
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:47,442
Has anyone ever hit on you?

205
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:49,882
How old were you when you had your first girlfriend?

206
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,202
I've never had anyone,

207
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,362
but I had a crush when I was in grade six.

208
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:57,878
Not bad at all.

209
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:59,602
Did you confess to her?

210
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Yes.

211
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:02,922
- Really? - Really?

212
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:04,098
Yes.

213
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,122
What did she say?

214
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,682
She didn't say anything.

215
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:12,762
She slapped me.

216
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,762
She liked to borrow my homework notes.

217
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,362
She's beautiful.

218
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:19,682
That's why I thought she liked me.

219
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:21,682
Okay...

220
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,722
- So I hugged her. - Huh?

221
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:29,482
After that, she laughed and slapped me.

222
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,682
Oh...

223
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:32,442
My face hurt,

224
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:36,202
but my chest hurt even more.

225
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,722
After that, I don't want to love anyone again.

226
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:43,082
Well, you're still young at that time.

227
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:46,002
You'd think girls like you when they're close to you.

228
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,882
Love and like are really different.

229
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:51,722
What is love anyway?

230
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:53,642
You must have loved someone before, right?

231
00:15:57,883 --> 00:15:59,000
Well...

232
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:02,513
It's rude to ask a woman that question.

233
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,842
Your pupils are dilated. It means you're lying.

234
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,202
Why don't you want to answer?

235
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:10,061
I'm not lying. I just don't want to answer. If you ask me that again...

236
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:11,922
Please stop.

237
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:15,842
Dr. Shoan, I realize now that we're quite similar.

238
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,962
We can split up now. That's enough.

239
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,042
That's true.

240
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,207
(Breaking news.)

241
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,362
(There's a mass shooting incident at ZSUN Pub.)

242
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,183
(It's been reported that there are already seven casualties, )

243
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:28,922
(with various injured people.)

244
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:32,002
(Police are trying to control the situation.)

245
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:33,391
Nick is having

246
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,962
his party there, right?

247
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,922
- Em? - That's right.

248
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,322
This is Surgery.

249
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:52,842
HQ,

250
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,338
there's an incident at the pub. Many people are injured.

251
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:57,048
Send people to this place right now. Over.

252
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,882
(The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.)

253
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,762
I'll leave this to you.

254
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,922
Please wait. I'm a doctor.

255
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,282
I see.

256
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:18,362
There's a wound on his right thigh. There's no injury to the bones.

257
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,193
You can take him to the hospital.

258
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,202
Help! Someone got shot!

259
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:31,602
Excuse me.

260
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,682
(Police are trying to control the situation.)

261
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:39,762
(The culprit is believed to still be inside.)

262
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:43,242
(As for the injured people, they're taken to the nearest hospital, )

263
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,122
(which is GMC Medical Center.)

264
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,362
Good evening, this is the ER of GMC Medical Center.

265
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:48,576
Please give us your details.

266
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:50,562
- (Hello, Prim. It's me, Nick.) - Nick?

267
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:55,062
(A patient got shot on the right side of her face. It's an open fracture)

268
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:57,099
(from the cheekbone, but it doesn't reach the earlobe.)

269
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:59,778
There's no problem with her airway. She can still breathe by herself,

270
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,059
but there's active bleeding.

271
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,402
Okay. Roger that.

272
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,242
What are the vital signs?

273
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,682
The BP is 110/80. Her pulse is 80.

274
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:11,222
She's stable.

275
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,578
This is going to be a long recovery for her.

276
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,532
From the look of it,

277
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:22,362
the bullet didn't hit her vessels or nerves.

278
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:26,762
After her wound is dressed, you can send her for an x-ray.

279
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,776
You don't have to come here yourself, Director.

280
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,738
You can just tell your secretary to call me.

281
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,122
It's not a problem for me.

282
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,962
I just walk here myself.

283
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:46,762
Professor, I'm not sure if there's any problem.

284
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:51,282
However, from the information of the residents here,

285
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:52,842
overall,

286
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:57,922
Dr. Shoan has too few hours in the operating room.

287
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,722
Please take a look.

288
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:08,465
Could you remind them about the operating room attendance

289
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,760
for every resident in our hospital?

290
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:14,722
We have to send this information to The Royal College soon.

291
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,242
Of course, I'll take care of it.

292
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,802
(Wardroom Three)

293
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:29,642
Pas.

294
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,722
Oh, Suksan.

295
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,362
Do you have to meet your patients?

296
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:34,882
Yes. Right,

297
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:36,681
it's good that I see you.

298
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:39,002
I have something to talk to you about.

299
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:43,562
I have to admit that it's really true.

300
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,322
He is a special kind of person.

301
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,042
His memory is good.

302
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,362
And

303
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,442
his ability to perform a diagnosis

304
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:52,876
is extremely accurate.

305
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:55,282
That's why I recommended that he study here.

306
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:58,682
If he's good at diagnosis,

307
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,962
why don't we just get him to work on diagnosis?

308
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:06,042
So he doesn't have to risk himself using operating tools.

309
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:07,842
And you

310
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:10,862
wouldn't have to risk getting yourself fired.

311
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:18,661
I realized something when you told me that.

312
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,642
I want to ask you for a favor.

313
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,002
We'll use an all-direction scanner

314
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:29,722
to check all of the bones on her face.

315
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:34,956
We'll do a 3D printing to create titanium implants to reshape her face

316
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,442
and replace all of the broken bones.

317
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:39,322
What about the damaged skin?

318
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,850
How are you going to treat that? Have you done any research?

319
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:43,482
Not yet.

320
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:46,002
You have to research more about this.

321
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,762
I'll let Nick take care of this case.

322
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,082
Yes.

323
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:52,342
And you as well, Shoan.

324
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:54,002
You'll help me with this.

325
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,202
Of course.

326
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,322
Are you sure, Professor?

327
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,202
I'm sure.

328
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,432
He's a surgeon. He needs to operate on patients.

329
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:04,202
What do you think?

330
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:06,562
Nothing.

331
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:09,642
You'll report to me next time.

332
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,162
Of course.

333
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:21,482
This is a skin graft.

334
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:23,122
Yes?

335
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:26,522
We'll probably have to do a skin graft for Miss Charm

336
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:28,042
to take some of her skin

337
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,002
to apply on the titanium implants.

338
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,642
We can't do that, Dr. Nick.

339
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,770
Why?

340
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:37,322
The missing skin on the patient includes the hypodermis.

341
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:39,682
Her skin has collagen.

342
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:43,122
Therefore, after the treatment, her skin can shrink.

343
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,642
Also, skin grafts require blood from vessels.

344
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,722
If we apply it to titanium,

345
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:50,802
the skin graft will surely die.

346
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,042
Thank you.

347
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:10,602
Dr. Nick, have you ever loved anyone before?

348
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,762
That question is so random.

349
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:16,082
Of course, I have.

350
00:22:16,762 --> 00:22:18,002
I have a question.

351
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,922
I want to know

352
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:23,122
how love and liking are different.

353
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:25,562
Well...

354
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,082
If you like someone, you will just want to look or watch them.

355
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:31,922
You'll get bored soon.

356
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:34,562
But if you love someone...

357
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:39,562
How should I explain this?

358
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:42,162
Listen, Shoan.

359
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:45,522
Have you wanted to spend a lot of time

360
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:49,602
with someone before? Like, you feel good when you're with them.

361
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:52,322
Yes.

362
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:56,802
It's Shin, but he's my brother.

363
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:59,122
That's your brother.

364
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:00,322
If it's your girlfriend,

365
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:02,642
it'll be more special. Like...

366
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:05,602
That person will be a stranger to you.

367
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:08,522
You'll feel good when you're with that person.

368
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,722
- Good feelings for a stranger? - Yes.

369
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:15,442
You'll want to be with them. You'll want to take care of them.

370
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:21,962
It's like your heart is fulfilled. Got it?

371
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:28,362
- Fulfilled... - Yeah.

372
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:30,282
I got it now, Dr. Nick.

373
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:32,642
Free flap.

374
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:36,842
For Miss Charm,

375
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,402
we have to use a free flap.

376
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,522
For free flap, it isn't just attaching a skin onto something.

377
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:44,802
You'll have to take blood vessels and tissues

378
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,202
to fill the area of damaged skin.

379
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,338
You'll also have to stitch the blood vessels together.

380
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,610
The advantages are, one,

381
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:53,402
her skin won't shrink.

382
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:56,602
Two, you can apply it on titanium.

383
00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:59,242
Third, the thickness of her skin

384
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,435
will be similar to the skin thickness of normal people.

385
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:03,842
I think free flap is good for us.

386
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:06,162
Let me see.

387
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:27,602
(This scene depicts violence)

388
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,282
(Please use your discretion)

389
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:50,642
Charm, are you alright?

390
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:53,362
Calm down. Hold yourself together.

391
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,242
Doctor! Nurse! Help!

392
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:00,762
Doctor, please help my sister.

393
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:02,802
Please give us one amp of Valium. Vein stat.

394
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,802
Calm down.

395
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:07,802
Excuse me.

396
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:26,402
Would Charm even dare to look at herself in the mirror again?

397
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:30,562
How will my sister live from now on?

398
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:03,202
(Dr. Rin)

399
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:07,082
Hello? What's wrong?

400
00:26:07,305 --> 00:26:08,842
Are you busy, Doctor?

401
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:10,202
I'm on lunch break.

402
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,442
I can talk to you. What's the matter?

403
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,202
You might think I'm crazy,

404
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,522
but...

405
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:20,762
I can't stop thinking that Win's cheating on me.

406
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:23,002
Win?

407
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:24,417
Listen,

408
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:28,042
(Win doesn't even have time to have a meal in the hospital.)

409
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:29,642
(Why would you think that?)

410
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:32,282
I don't know. It's a woman's intuition, I guess.

411
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:37,602
After I come back, I feel like he's different.

412
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:41,762
(It feels awkward. He gets annoyed when we talk.)

413
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,322
(Do you think)

414
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:45,642
it's because we've been dating for a while now?

415
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,562
Do you feel that every time you meet him?

416
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:52,922
(Not really. I especially felt that when I talked about)

417
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:57,602
working in my dad's hospital or meeting with my family.

418
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:00,882
I got it now.

419
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,282
I think

420
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:04,002
Win

421
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,162
is pressured

422
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:07,762
(about the wedding.)

423
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:12,402
This is an extremely important matter for men.

424
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:15,562
I've given him 10 years.

425
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:17,585
Listen,

426
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:20,562
you should try doing something new.

427
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,545
(Take him to a place with a nice atmosphere.)

428
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,442
Then, you can talk to him calmly.

429
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:29,042
(Win isn't a difficult person)

430
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:33,082
(Fine.)

431
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,682
I'll try to do as you say.

432
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:37,922
Thanks.

433
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:40,122
(I won't bother you now. Bye.)

434
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:43,282
Bye.

435
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:02,202
There's no need for any risk.

436
00:28:04,242 --> 00:28:06,562
We can't always be by his side.

437
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:10,842
Shoan should be in a place that suits him.

438
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:29,418
A spider.

439
00:28:51,768 --> 00:28:52,842
Yes!

440
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:57,242
What's wrong?

441
00:28:58,761 --> 00:29:00,362
You have a TV, Dr. Prim?

442
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:04,402
You came here to ask me that

443
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,922
at midnight?

444
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:08,602
No.

445
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:11,642
Can you catch a spider in my room?

446
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,322
I don't like it.

447
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:15,522
Shoan, I don't like it either.

448
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:17,642
But I helped you catch a cockroach before.

449
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,102
And so what?

450
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:20,882
You have to repay the favor.

451
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:24,682
Where is it?

452
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,122
It's just a small one. It's not scary. It's already gone.

453
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,110
Is it a tarantula?

454
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,282
It's so big. I can't stand it anymore.

455
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:46,632
Dr. Prim, please take it out.

456
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:47,992
Are you crazy? No way!

457
00:29:48,073 --> 00:29:51,442
- Please take it out. - It's too big. No way.

458
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:53,162
Excuse me.

459
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:54,562
Have you seen my girl?

460
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:56,361
I've gone through every floor now.

461
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:59,482
It's a small black spider. It's extremely cute.

462
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,642
Please take it away.

463
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,042
(Mom)

464
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:38,402
What else do you want me to catch?

465
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,282
It's not that.

466
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:42,122
Can I watch your TV?

467
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,042
Okay. Come in.

468
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,282
I forgot to give it back. I didn't know I picked it up.

469
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,242
Sorry about that.

470
00:31:01,513 --> 00:31:02,762
Is that your mom's picture?

471
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:04,202
Your mom is pretty.

472
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:05,442
Like a celebrity.

473
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:07,082
It's a celebrity.

474
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,002
I can't remember my mom's face,

475
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:10,842
so I drew a celebrity instead.

476
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:31,042
This one is good.

477
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:39,426
Sorry.

478
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:41,562
I'll leave you to it now.

479
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:45,602
I'll go to bed. After you're done,

480
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,994
turn off the TV and lock the door for me.

481
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,161
Okay?

482
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,522
Of course.

483
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:52,402
Okay.

484
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:08,082
Your sister just went out for her breakfast.

485
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:10,762
If you still feel pain,

486
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,522
you can tell me.

487
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:15,882
Right now, do you feel like this?

488
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:17,682
Or like this?

489
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:32,242
Oh, you want the bag?

490
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,082
Here you are.

491
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,242
The mirror?

492
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:57,682
I have to tell you that right now,

493
00:33:58,242 --> 00:34:01,092
you're in the process of facial skin treatment

494
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:03,177
to make your skin as normal as possible.

495
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:22,082
You don't have to worry.

496
00:34:22,202 --> 00:34:25,242
Every treatment needs some time.

497
00:34:41,177 --> 00:34:42,522
It's done.

498
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:48,402
I believe

499
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,242
that all bad things

500
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:52,682
can't stay with us all the time.

501
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:08,351
We believe that the best way to restore her facial skin is a free flap.

502
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,642
Good job.

503
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:13,242
You've done your research well.

504
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:17,322
But where do you think is the best place

505
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:20,082
to take her skin and replace her damaged skin?

506
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:22,042
From under her forearm

507
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,922
as it has the closest color to her face.

508
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:27,002
But in this case,

509
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:28,562
her damaged skin area is big.

510
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,922
We need a soft tissue expander

511
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,922
to increase the area of the skin.

512
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,362
This method is probably the best for her.

513
00:35:37,116 --> 00:35:38,482
I concur.

514
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:41,162
How's her condition?

515
00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:44,442
At 7.35.34 am,

516
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:46,162
her vital signs are stable.

517
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:48,762
Her pulse is 65 beats per minute.

518
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:51,802
Her blood pressure and blood oxygen level are normal.

519
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:55,362
Her wound isn't infected. It's clean.

520
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:58,922
Nick and Shoan, you can continue to take care of her.

521
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,722
But I think Shoan is still not ready to go to the OR.

522
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:04,729
You haven't talked to Professor Prapas?

523
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:09,522
Shoan's hours in the OR are lower than the requirement for residency.

524
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:11,322
He has to go in there.

525
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,402
I understand that. But what if he causes trouble again?

526
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:49,442
Stay still, stay silent, and listen to the professors' orders.

527
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:51,882
Be like shoes.

528
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:53,562
It's fine if they're untidy.

529
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,032
It's fine.

530
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,122
Blade, please.

531
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:03,162
Nick, check if there are all the vessels.

532
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,856
Check the skin width again.

533
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:10,482
Warming.

534
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:37,402
Nick, you'll stitch the blood vessels together.

535
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,322
Will that be alright?

536
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:41,796
What? You're already in your fourth year.

537
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:43,362
What are you afraid of?

538
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,802
If you don't want to do it, I'll let Shoan do it.

539
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:47,882
I can do that.

540
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,442
I'll just do it myself.

541
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:55,002
This is the OR.

542
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:58,442
Professor, there's a third-degree burn patient in the ER.

543
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:00,922
- They would like your advice. - Nick.

544
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:03,522
- I'll leave this to you. - Of course.

545
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,122
Your hands are shaking.

546
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:18,202
No.

547
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:19,602
They're really shaking.

548
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:24,442
Go check her BP.

549
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,042
It's normal.

550
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:33,762
The end of her vessels isn't smooth.

551
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:35,962
I think it's fine. Em.

552
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,362
- Yes? - Please take a look.

553
00:38:37,452 --> 00:38:38,562
Of course.

554
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:41,082
It's normal, Doctor.

555
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:45,282
If it's not smooth, it can lead to a blocked vessel.

556
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:48,802
Close the wound, or we will increase the dose of anesthetic.

557
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,482
Shoan, we don't have time.

558
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:54,056
Cut it.

559
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:05,370
Please take Miss Suni's case data to my room.

560
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:12,602
Professor.

561
00:39:12,952 --> 00:39:13,952
Professor.

562
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:15,522
- That's mine. - Oh.

563
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,722
Thank you.

564
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:33,322
Where are you taking those?

565
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,650
I have to submit them.

566
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,482
What are you stressed about?

567
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:46,602
I was wondering

568
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,362
if Shoan can operate on a patient.

569
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,722
Of course, he can. He's a surgeon.

570
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,322
Are you worried about him?

571
00:39:59,882 --> 00:40:01,002
What?

572
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,242
Actually, Shoan is a little scared,

573
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,302
but it's not like he's scared that he can't do it.

574
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:10,722
He...

575
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:13,642
He's scared he couldn't save the patient.

576
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,802
Isn't it nice to have another good doctor

577
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:23,602
working with us?

578
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:26,122
Isn't it nice?

579
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:29,922
I have to go. Somrak is calling for me.

580
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:52,482
I really hate it when I have to be someone's mediator like this.

581
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:54,242
Win,

582
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,802
let me ask something.

583
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:58,042
You don't have something going on with Prim, right?

584
00:40:58,552 --> 00:40:59,962
Are you crazy?

585
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:02,913
Why would I feel that about Prim?

586
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:08,322
Lately, I've seen you and Prim together frequently.

587
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:11,537
- It's normal for anyone to think that. - What?

588
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:14,082
We've been together more often because of Shoan.

589
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:18,282
I'm still worried about Professor Suksan taking Shoan to the OR.

590
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:21,962
- Are you sure? - I'm sure, Rin.

591
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:26,535
If you're curious about Shoan,

592
00:41:26,655 --> 00:41:29,225
you can just ask him yourself. He's coming.

593
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,622
Good morning.

594
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,602
How was the operation yesterday?

595
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:35,202
It's alright.

596
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:37,242
The patient is safe now.

597
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,522
But if you're curious about Shoan,

598
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:41,842
he just watched from the sideline.

599
00:41:41,993 --> 00:41:43,922
Everything is normal.

600
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:47,509
See? You worried too much.

601
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:50,682
But you're wrong.

602
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:54,722
- You're even worse than me. - You're wrong about me.

603
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:07,042
After this, we can just check on her two times a day.

604
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:08,402
Yes.

605
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:20,362
Two-color skin.

606
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:22,160
What do you mean?

607
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,242
The outside and inside skin are different.

608
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:26,162
The flap is paler.

609
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:28,642
It's not like that the other day.

610
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:38,402
Blood vessels. It's because of the blood vessels. We have a problem!

611
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:41,202
What's the matter?

612
00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:43,082
Explain it to me.

613
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:46,145
The connection between the vessels isn't smooth.

614
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:47,522
The blood doesn't flow well.

615
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:53,602
I was the one who stitched it.

616
00:42:55,162 --> 00:42:58,562
Actually, Dr. Shoan has warned me.

617
00:42:58,962 --> 00:43:01,322
But when I saw she was running out of anesthetic,

618
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:05,682
I wanted to finish the operation as soon as I could.

619
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:09,002
Stitching.

620
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:18,362
It's good that you admit it yourself.

621
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:21,522
At least we'll know where to fix it.

622
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:25,442
Good job, Shoan.

623
00:43:26,162 --> 00:43:27,602
Thank you.

624
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:30,442
Cut it.

625
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:33,842
Cut it.

626
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:37,402
Shoan.

627
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,522
Do you want to close the skin for me?

628
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,962
Can I do that?

629
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,362
Sure.

630
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:48,242
I'll do it.

631
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:24,522
Have you heard the news

632
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:26,482
about Shoan?

633
00:44:26,787 --> 00:44:28,602
Professor Suksan was praising

634
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,162
that he did really well.

635
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:35,282
You even use Professor Suksan for this?

636
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:38,882
It's not like that. I just made a bet with him.

637
00:44:39,784 --> 00:44:42,082
He asked me to transfer Shoan to Pathology.

638
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:46,002
Win,

639
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,242
don't you think that

640
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:50,762
this is another opportunity

641
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:54,442
to make it different from what happened 10 years ago?

642
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:49,762
Why are you looking at her?

643
00:45:51,722 --> 00:45:53,162
Mascot.

644
00:45:55,024 --> 00:45:57,024
Everyone is like a mascot.

645
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,103
When you wear a mascot's head,

646
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:00,983
you'll be beautiful.

647
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:02,962
People will like you.

648
00:46:04,522 --> 00:46:06,722
But when you take off a mascot's head,

649
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:09,682
no one will care about you.

650
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:14,242
Are we afraid of not being loved by anyone?

651
00:46:17,162 --> 00:46:19,362
Well, it is...

652
00:46:20,282 --> 00:46:22,042
It's kind of scary.

653
00:46:26,403 --> 00:46:28,722
Would there be anyone who loves me?

654
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:36,162
Of course, there would be.

655
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,722
You're kind,

656
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,602
smart,

657
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:43,442
and a good guy.

658
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,962
Do you know that your face is pretty good?

659
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:51,602
You'll have one soon.

660
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:54,602
Dr. Prim.

661
00:46:57,904 --> 00:47:00,442
I got to stitch a wound in the OR today.

662
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:01,922
Really?

663
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:03,762
One stitch.

664
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:05,082
Did it go alright?

665
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:06,202
Yes.

666
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:08,002
Professor Suksan said

667
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:09,762
I could be a surgeon.

668
00:47:09,935 --> 00:47:12,482
Good for you. Good job.

669
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:15,338
When you do something good, you'll get a reward.

670
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,082
What...

671
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:24,602
Good job, Shoan.

672
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,722
Alright?

673
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:38,322
Alright.

674
00:47:54,851 --> 00:47:56,162
Sorry.

675
00:47:56,787 --> 00:47:58,162
Dr. Prapas?

676
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:00,482
Yen?

677
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,402
Wow, I haven't seen you in a long time.

678
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:11,002
How are you?

679
00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:16,242
I was working in the kitchen before. I just moved to this department.

680
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,442
Before that,

681
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:20,642
I had worked many odd jobs.

682
00:48:21,762 --> 00:48:24,922
So, we've already missed each other for some time.

683
00:48:25,688 --> 00:48:28,062
Well, have you met Shoan?

684
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,322
I have.

685
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:36,531
I've seen him a few times.

686
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:40,402
But it seems like my son couldn't recognize me.

687
00:48:42,581 --> 00:48:44,482
I'm a mother who left her own son.

688
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:47,442
No child would remember the mother who left him, right?

689
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:49,362
He couldn't recognize you?

690
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:51,922
Weird.

691
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:56,242
But I think you shouldn't think like that. It'll just trouble you.

692
00:48:57,441 --> 00:49:00,842
I can't believe that he has grown up well like this.

693
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:05,162
Thank you so much for your kindness, Doctor.

694
00:49:05,282 --> 00:49:06,802
If he's with me,

695
00:49:07,082 --> 00:49:09,122
he wouldn't have this kind of future.

696
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:10,482
Hey...

697
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,482
He'd be fine even if he's with you.

698
00:49:13,002 --> 00:49:15,122
Shoan is a determined kid.

699
00:49:16,051 --> 00:49:18,522
He has come this far because of himself.

700
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:22,922
Listen, I'll try to slowly tell him

701
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:24,618
- that... - Doctor.

702
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:29,162
Please don't tell Shoan about me.

703
00:49:40,364 --> 00:49:42,014
(Reception)

704
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:44,962
Your body has responded well to the treatment.

705
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:47,442
Your wound isn't infected,

706
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,362
but we still have to wait for the wound to get drier

707
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:51,962
before she can leave.

708
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,378
Thank you so much, Doctor.

709
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,922
You're welcome.

710
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:02,562
Oh, Doctor.

711
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:04,562
When Charm gets better,

712
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:09,059
- she still has to come back for the follow-up, right? - That's right.

713
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,202
You have to see Professor Suksan, who's the case doctor.

714
00:50:12,529 --> 00:50:16,442
It means that if Charm gets better after she gets home,

715
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,882
we won't be able to meet

716
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:21,362
you two again.

717
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:23,442
Such a shame.

718
00:50:24,915 --> 00:50:26,242
We shouldn't meet again.

719
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,682
I want her to be fully cured.

720
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:31,322
I see.

721
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:33,522
Dr. Shoan,

722
00:50:33,633 --> 00:50:36,322
I have some questions to ask you.

723
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,842
Of course.

724
00:50:37,923 --> 00:50:41,082
Can you come out with me to answer some questions?

725
00:50:41,842 --> 00:50:43,002
Let's go.

726
00:50:51,235 --> 00:50:54,722
Oh, I can just answer you here. It's fine.

727
00:50:58,712 --> 00:51:03,282
(Famous Internet Influencer is Beautiful Again Because of GMC)

728
00:51:03,377 --> 00:51:05,377
You and Nick are pretty famous now.

729
00:51:06,048 --> 00:51:08,048
I'll tag Nick on this photo

730
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:09,522
to let everyone know.

731
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:12,482
What are you looking at?

732
00:51:13,842 --> 00:51:15,242
It's a video about Nick and Shoan.

733
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:23,962
Why did Nick sit that close to the patient?

734
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:27,793
It's because Dr. Nick loves Miss Charm.

735
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:31,922
- Really? - Yeah.

736
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,202
Why did you lower your voice then?

737
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:35,922
Dr. Nick told me to.

738
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:37,522
And

739
00:51:39,202 --> 00:51:40,642
I only know that much.

740
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:45,562
Nick is hiding a secret now, huh?

741
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:47,922
I also know

742
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,482
who's in love with Dr. Prim.

743
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:51,162
- What? - What?

744
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,266
It's Professor Archawin.

745
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,259
Professor Archawin likes to be close to you.

746
00:51:55,339 --> 00:51:57,042
He likes to look at your face...

747
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:00,602
Shoan!

748
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:03,402
- Good morning. - Good morning.

749
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:05,922
Professor Archawin isn't here.

750
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,562
He's probably in an operation.

751
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:10,962
It's fine. I can wait. Win already told me about it.

752
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:12,362
Okay.

753
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:21,002
Dr. Shoan, you really seem cuter in person.

754
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:23,002
Thank you.

755
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:28,282
We might have a chance to see each other again.

756
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:35,002
Of course.

757
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:43,242
Yes, Professor?

758
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:47,082
(I've left the documents about A&R's imported medicine on your desk.)

759
00:52:47,272 --> 00:52:49,082
(Have you seen it?)

760
00:52:50,244 --> 00:52:51,322
Oh...

761
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:53,162
I saw it now, Professor.

762
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,442
What's the matter?

763
00:52:57,323 --> 00:53:00,042
(I'm not sure if you know about this.)

764
00:53:00,282 --> 00:53:04,642
(A&R has submitted this medicine for testing five times already.)

765
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:06,762
(If it's not been approved with that, )

766
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:10,842
(usually, the company has to check the results of the patients)

767
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:13,522
(as this medicine might not be appropriate to be imported.)

768
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:17,802
Five times, Professor?

769
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:23,202
Let me read the document thoroughly first, then.

770
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:28,842
(I believe if you know all the details, you won't support this.)

771
00:53:29,588 --> 00:53:32,282
(If I approve this medicine to be used in our hospital, )

772
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:35,562
(he'll probably use that to try to ask for approval again.)

773
00:53:36,097 --> 00:53:39,322
(I don't think I can let our patients be used for this.)

774
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:40,617
Yes, Professor.

775
00:53:54,242 --> 00:53:58,762
How is it? Overall, what do you think about this place?

776
00:53:59,398 --> 00:54:00,769
It's really beautiful.

777
00:54:00,952 --> 00:54:02,952
It's big and has modern aesthetics.

778
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:05,177
When a patient comes here,

779
00:54:05,682 --> 00:54:08,482
they'll surely feel comfortable.

780
00:54:08,987 --> 00:54:12,602
Are you going to have an opening ceremony?

781
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:14,943
We'll wait until it's ready first.

782
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,840
As for the date,

783
00:54:17,082 --> 00:54:19,082
I think we'll talk about that later.

784
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,426
So, are you going to

785
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:25,042
work here?

786
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,562
Dad,

787
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,482
I told you Win still wanted to be a professor.

788
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:34,802
Well, I still have to work on that for another year at least.

789
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:37,482
I'm really sorry about this.

790
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,242
You can call me if you change your mind.

791
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:43,802
As you know, good doctors are really hard to find now.

792
00:54:43,922 --> 00:54:44,922
Yes.

793
00:54:45,272 --> 00:54:46,842
Right, you've met

794
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:50,305
an autistic doctor. You even said he's cute.

795
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:52,922
Do you think you can convince him to work here?

796
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:55,442
It'll be good if we can get him.

797
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,522
Nowadays, we need to show more diversity and acceptance

798
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:03,282
so that our hospital will have a good reputation.

799
00:55:05,162 --> 00:55:07,002
I just ran into him.

800
00:55:07,192 --> 00:55:08,742
I didn't go there to talk to him.

801
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:11,634
Mr. Anat.

802
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:13,162
- Good evening. - Good evening.

803
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,882
Professor Ronnaphop.

804
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,362
Oh, Dr. Archawin.

805
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,762
Aren't you from GMC Medical Center?

806
00:55:19,882 --> 00:55:24,322
Yes. Aren't you Mr. Anat, the brother of Professor Phruek's wife?

807
00:55:24,642 --> 00:55:26,322
You two know each other?

808
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:32,042
Of course. Dr. Archawin is talented and handsome.

809
00:55:32,456 --> 00:55:35,282
Everyone in this circle knows about him.

810
00:55:35,568 --> 00:55:36,922
I knew it.

811
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:39,362
That hospital will probably

812
00:55:39,632 --> 00:55:43,562
make him the Head of Surgery so that he won't come here.

813
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,642
I'm just kidding.

814
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:51,522
GMC Medical Center has a lot of good doctors.

815
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,449
I heard that they just

816
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:56,769
- saved an internet influencer. - Yeah.

817
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:58,802
It made the hospital even more famous,

818
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:02,602
especially for the autistic doctor called Shoan.

819
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,162
Yeah.

820
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,882
But I would never think

821
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,329
that an inside story like this

822
00:56:12,617 --> 00:56:14,617
would be known by an outsider.

823
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:17,522
You have to hurry up soon with that autistic doctor.

824
00:56:17,802 --> 00:56:19,802
If he can't work there, take him here.

825
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:22,362
We can just let him do OPD first.

826
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:24,239
He wouldn't come.

827
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:28,602
I think Shoan is a better doctor than just a marketing tool.

828
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:36,905
Mr. Anat, let's continue our talk in my office.

829
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:39,922
May, I'll ask you to send Mr. Win off.

830
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,882
- Of course. - Let's go.

831
00:56:43,282 --> 00:56:46,322
Bye-bye, Dr. Archawin.

832
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:48,722
Long time no see. How are you?

833
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,002
I'm fine.

834
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:52,762
I have an important matter to tell you.

835
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,962
Weren't you too harsh?

836
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:03,442
Shoan isn't an object that can be given to anyone.

837
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,722
Did you forget about what you said?

838
00:57:08,882 --> 00:57:11,962
You said Shoan wouldn't get to be a doctor there anyway.

839
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:14,442
My dad just wants to give him an opportunity.

840
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:16,682
Why did you have to be angry with him today?

841
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:18,242
Give him an opportunity?

842
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:20,362
He wants to be a surgeon, May.

843
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:24,722
But you would never let him go into an operating room.

844
00:57:26,002 --> 00:57:27,002
And listen,

845
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:29,082
you also chose to believe that I already did that

846
00:57:29,131 --> 00:57:31,403
without asking me if I've really done that

847
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:32,722
or why I've done that.

848
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:34,019
You did it anyway, May.

849
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,482
I've done everything for you!

850
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:37,837
As for Shoan,

851
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,722
- it's just... - I can take care of myself.

852
00:57:54,473 --> 00:57:55,962
Since you said that,

853
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:59,122
is it because I'm not in your future anymore?

854
00:58:11,882 --> 00:58:13,762
I think we should stop this for now, May.

855
00:58:15,363 --> 00:58:17,242
We're thinking of different things.

856
00:58:21,242 --> 00:58:23,162
I want to organize my own thoughts first.

857
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:27,002
I don't want us to feel awkward like this every time we see each other.

858
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:36,242
I should go home by myself today.

Hey, calm down.
