(Finally touched the Five Lakes's core.
This Chief Protector's no pushover)

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Tianshuang,

5
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,120
you'll go to the general alliance?

6
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,519
Are you so excited?

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,840
Only the Chiefs can go there.

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,040
Xiu can't go.

9
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,760
But he

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,680
specifically chose you.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
What does this mean?

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,639
What does it mean?

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,879
It means that

14
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,319
you are his successor,

15
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,400
the future leader of Lian'an Town.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,959
You have been here not that long.

17
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,040
Super amazing!

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,439
Why don't you have any reaction?

19
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,879
What reaction should I have?

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,159
If I'm not here,

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,439
you're the one to rely on.

22
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,439
Isn't that obvious?

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,079
Be careful when you go there.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,120
Don't offend those you shouldn't.

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,640
Why are you so sentimental?

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,120
Do I still need your advice?

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,319
Visit home more often these days.

28
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,640
Talk to your dad more.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,680
Do you hear me?

30
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,639
Nonsense.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
I have nothing to say to him.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,200
What's with all the nonsense?

33
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,680
Can't you speak properly?

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,439
Alright.

35
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,640
I got it.

36
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,879
Take care of yourself.

37
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,120
Help me tidy up.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Can't manage self-pleasure by hand?

39
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,599
Tell me,

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
want fed by me,

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,639
or

42
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,520
a pretty nurse?

43
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,560
What do you think?

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,000
Find me a prettier one.

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Alright.

46
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,039
Xiu,

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,520
during this time,

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,719
thank you for caring of me.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Why be so sentimental?

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
Not coming back?

51
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,120
But what if it happens?

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Impossible.

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm seriously injured.

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,080
After that,

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,759
work hard for me.

56
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,319
I mean

57
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,159
if Ms. He takes a liking to me,

58
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,680
I wouldn't come back.

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
Wouldn't I just skyrocket immediately?

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
You mentioned this?

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
I've actually thought about it.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,240
You can get along so well with Ms. Jia.

63
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,560
Perhaps the world has really changed.

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,719
A toad

65
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,400
might actually eat swan meat.

66
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,280
Who are you calling a toad?

67
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,360
Are you jealous of me?

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,000
Of course.

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
Tianshuang,

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,639
be careful.

71
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,879
See you.

72
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,840
You're not saying goodbye to Qi?

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,639
Yes.

74
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,240
If I go, I won't want to leave.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,439
I sent her a message.

76
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,560
What did she reply?

77
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,559
She didn't reply.

78
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,199
She's angry.

79
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,599
So you must help me pacify her.

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
Right?

81
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,159
Alright,

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll get in the car.

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
I won't talk to you.

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Why are you here?

85
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,000
Why not say goodbye

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,919
before leaving?

87
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,960
What's so funny?

88
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,919
Drink on the road.

89
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,879
Specifically bring it for me?

90
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,159
Sure.

91
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,279
So stupid.

92
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,439
I still need to deliver to others.

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,519
Then I'll be leaving.

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Be careful.

95
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,239
Okay.

96
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,080
Mr. Zhang,

97
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,480
"Parrot" is in position.

98
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,399
Next,

99
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,519
time for the next scene.

100
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,199
Okay,

101
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,039
execute it.

102
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:13,024
Okay.

103
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:17,600
(Notice on Executing "Pushpin" Operation
to Stop "Odin's Eye" Plan)

104

(Tainan City, Taiwan, China)

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Hello, Mr. Huang.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Mr. Huang.

107
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,120
Call me.

108
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,399
I'll settle it for you.

109
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,359
Mr. Lv,

110
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,199
long time no see.

111
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,079
Huang Zhixing,

112
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,360
don't fake a smile

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,519
in front of me.

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,839
You secretly embezzled money

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,279
from the Straits Exchange Foundation.

116
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,879
Do you think I don't know?

117
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,720
It's just this look.

118
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
Always pretending to be calm.

119
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Huang Zhixing,

120
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,240
is it that everyone scolds you,

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,240
and you only smile like this?

122
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't underestimate him.

123
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
He is very capable.

124
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,000
He smiles like this every day,

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,319
sucking up to superiors.

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
And yet,

127
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,120
he climbed his way up
to become a director.

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
Mr. Lv,

129
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
if you're not satisfied with me,

130
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,439
you can file a complaint.

131
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,279
Complain?

132
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,079
In my opinion,

133
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,240
you took money from the gang.

134
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,720
I'm telling you today,

135
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,680
as long as I'm a director,

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,279
your project will never pass.

137
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,800
Then let's wait and see.

138
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,800
Why hit him?

139
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,600
He's too arrogant.

140
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,519
Courtesy wasted.

141
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,240
Told me to wait and see?

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,680
- Too bold.
- Mr. Huang,

143
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
are you okay?

144
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,960
- You're nobody.
- It's fine.

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
It's fine.

146
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
Go to the hospital to check?

147
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
No need.

148
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,000
I need to pick up

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,959
my daughter now.

150
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,120
This Mr. Lv is getting
more and more outrageous.

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
Usually just swearing everywhere.

152
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,519
Now he even dares to hit you.

153
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,079
I will complain about him.

154
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
Just a petty squabble.

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,480
Don't take it to heart.

156
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,560
Well,

157
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,800
your doormat attitude

158
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,319
is why people walk all over you.

159
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,879
It's nothing.

160
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,839
Go on with your work.

161
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:54,286
(Norman International School)

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
Xi,

163
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm here.

164
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,879
How is it?

165
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,720
Do you miss me?

166
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,799
Do you miss me?

167
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,600
Alright.

168
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:16,879
Dad,

169
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,000
can I have fried chicken?

170
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,439
Fried chicken is junk food.

171
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,240
What about milk tea?

172
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,399
It is even more unhealthy.

173
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,199
So annoying.

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Dad,

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,600
actually, it only takes me
a few minutes to walk home.

176
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
I don't even have to cross streets.

177
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,000
Didn't you say

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,399
that you're very busy,

179
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,120
yet you come to pick me up every day.

180
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,720
Because I

181
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,279
like to be with you.

182
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,639
Xi,

183
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,440
I'll answer a call.

184
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,360
It'll be quick.

185
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,559
Go ahead.

186
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes.

187
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,279
I added an order.

188
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,639
Help me handle it.

189
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
Dad,

190
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
what order?

191
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,759
Just cleaning.

192
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,720
It's a small matter.

193
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,919
Come on.

194
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,919
Here.

195
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,919
Put it here.

196
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,759
He still pretended to be civilized

197
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
and told me

198
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,120
"Then let's wait and see."

199
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,399
I would slap down with a hand

200
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,480
and knock him directly to the ground.

201
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,720
- Good.
- Good.

202
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
- Impressive.
- Good job!

203
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,679
But he was hit by you like this.

204
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,759
Will he complain about you?

205
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,080
Complain about me?

206
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,360
Does he have the courage?

207
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,600
You didn't see.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,559
After I knocked him to the ground,

209
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,960
he got up

210
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,159
and his face was bloodied.

211
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,159
But he still grinned at me.

212
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,559
That Huang Zhixing's nothing.

213
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,320
He,

214
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,360
in my eyes, is just a dog.

215
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,960
A dog without backbone.

216
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,720
At tomorrow's meeting,

217
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,919
watch how I deal with him.

218
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,759
Good.

219
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,600
- Alright, Mr. Lv.
- Cheers.

220
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,480
Cheers.

221
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,080
- Cheers.
- Drink.

222
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,920
Cheers.

223
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
Mom, I'm back.

224
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:26,799
Go inside.

225
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,840
The meal will be ready.

226
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,159
Alright, goodbye, Dad.

227
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,720
Goodbye, Xi.

228
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Come.

229
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
Remember to wash your hands.

230
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,399
You're not here this weekend?

231
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,120
Xi's piano lesson's teacher

232
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,600
is changed.

233
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,240
See if it's suitable.

234
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,879
If not, change it.

235
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,519
In her dance competition on Sunday,

236
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,440
there's a very impressive kid.

237
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,080
Remind her before the competition,

238
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,759
don't focus much on winning.

239
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,320
I promised her

240
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,159
to take her to a newly
opened fried chicken shop.

241
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll send the address to you.

242
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,559
I explained it clearly, right?

243
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,120
Do you want me to make a note?

244
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,879
You've been spoiling Xi too much lately.

245
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,120
I can't manage her anymore.

246
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,919
This isn't called spoiling.

247
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,759
I'm just being careful.

248
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,720
Do you think

249
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,200
if you had shown me half this concern,

250
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,799
we wouldn't have divorced.

251
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,639
After so long,

252
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,159
can you tell me now

253
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,559
why

254
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,639
you're so guarded to me
who grew up with you

255
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,399
and so unwilling

256
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,559
to say anything?

257
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,519
Why do you obviously
have so many secrets,

258
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,759
but just saying nothing's wrong?

259
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,200
These are all things of the past.

260
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, that's it.

261
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,600
No arguing, no explanation.

262
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,960
Polite and gentle.

263
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,039
It makes me feel like I'm the crazy one.

264
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,759
Even when I mentioned divorce,

265
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,679
you didn't save it.

266
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,159
Keep it down.

267
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,759
Xi will hear.

268
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,399
Huang Zhixing,

269
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,399
you're a workaholic,

270
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,639
and a good dad.

271
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,360
But do you know?

272
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,639
You're the worst husband.

273
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,279
The "cleaning matters"

274
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,559
are all arranged.

275
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,800
It must be "clean".

276
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:28,480
(Lv Minghui)

277
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:37,408
(Huang Zhixing)

278
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,519
About the proposal just now,

279
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,720
please raise your hand

280
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,960
(Straits Exchange Foundation)
to cast your vote.

281
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:02,688
(Huang Zhixing, Lv Minghui, Wu Yuxuan)

282
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,559
(After the formation
of Five Lakes Alliance,)

283
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,360
(it quickly became
one of the earliest gangs)

284
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,840
(in southern Taiwan, China.)

285
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,840
(In the late 1990s,)

286
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,960
(it was once glorious,)

287
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,879
(almost the top gang in Tainan.)

288
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,840
(But the larger the place,)

289
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,200
(the more troubles there are.)

290
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,679
(Fortunately, there was Mi)

291
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,840
(who became the spiritual leader.)

292
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,600
(But now,)

293
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,679
(he is going to step down.)

294
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,000
(What the Five Lakes Alliance
will be like)

295
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,879
(depends on who succeeds.)

296
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,919
Guang,

297
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,080
long time no see.

298
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,879
Yeah, long time no see.

299
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,960
Hai,

300
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,679
Xiu always mentions you.

301
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,239
Qiang.

302
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,159
Long time no see.

303
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,519
Long time no see.

304
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,120
You're here.

305
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,080
Please sit.

306
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,039
Have a seat.

307
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,799
Long time no see.

308
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:27,639
Please sit.

309
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,519
Mr. Gao is here.

310
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,359
Sit.

311
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,200
Qiang,

312
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,720
you look good.

313
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,799
Not

314
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,039
as rosy as you.

315
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:37,080
- Hao.
- Hao.

316
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,440
Hao.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,879
Jiahao.

318
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,639
Long time no see.

319
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,639
You've grown up.

320
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,639
Of course.

321
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,479
Good.

322
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,399
Long time no see.

323
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:47,679
Long time no see.

324
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,519
Hao.

325
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
That's great.

326
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,239
Qiang.

327
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Now it's up to you.

328
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,639
Jiahao.

329
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,680
Long!

330
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,320
It's so good to see you.

331
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,320
- Jiahao.
- Nan, long time no see.

332
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,360
Okay.

333
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,639
Everyone, please sit.

334
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,840
Make yourself.

335
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,479
Jiahao,

336
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,840
you have grown up

337
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,960
and become mature.

338
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,279
- Mi.
- Mi.

339
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,119
Dad.

340
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
Sit down.

341
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,759
Sit.

342
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,840
Today,

343
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,759
Chiefs,

344
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,799
thank you

345
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,120
for coming here.

346
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,240
- It's no trouble.
- It's no trouble.

347
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,000
- It's our duty.
- It's our duty.

348
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Not at all.

349
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,159
It's our duty.

350
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,080
Let me introduce

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,039
several distinguished guests here.

352
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,000
The Chief Protector of Tianhai Sect,

353
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,599
Anle.

354
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,559
Anle is waiting for them.

355
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,200
Why is he here?

356
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,519
What is he doing here?

357
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,728
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

358
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,244
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

359
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:21,202
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

360
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:27,535
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
