00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,672
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,712
(Anle from the Tianhai Sect
looks quite aggressive)

4
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,959
This is my daughter, Shuyi.

5
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,760
Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Welcome.

7
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
This is my son,

8
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,359
Jiahao.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's a private matter of our alliance.

10
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,200
Why are you here?

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,519
- Sure, why?
- Sure, why?

12
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,159
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

13
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,879
Jiahao, you got me wrong.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,079
Tianhai Sect has long
admired the Five Lakes Alliance.

15
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,840
I am an outsider.

16
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,040
I won't interfere with your matters.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,200
Today, I happened to visit Mi.

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,200
He has always been nice to me.

19
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,040
So, I'm here to say something.

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,719
I'll leave after I'm done.

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,000
We have come together

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,319
for Mi

23
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,680
and the Five Lakes Alliance.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,719
Take your words

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,040
and go home!

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Qiang is right.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,159
Exactly.

28
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,560
Don't think
that just because you made some money,

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,239
you can consider yourself a big shot.

30
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,920
When the Five Lakes Alliance was
at its peak back then,

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,519
the Tianhai Sect was nothing.

32
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:02,959
- Yes.
- Yes.

33
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,000
Qiang is right.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Shut up!

35
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,199
He's a guest.

36
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,879
Is this how we treat our guests?

37
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,520
What on earth do you want?

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,439
Speak up now.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,879
Make it clear

40
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,280
to everyone here.

41
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,240
Alright, Mi.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,520
Over these years,

43
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,360
your alliance has been coexisting

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,479
with the Tianhai Sect peacefully.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,879
However,

46
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,240
the chemical plant invested in
by the Tianhai Sect

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
is about to move into Lian'an Town.

48
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,840
What does that mean?

49
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,240
This plan

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,479
will bring Lian'an Town

51
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,560
many changes and business opportunities.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,800
However,

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,960
during the advancement of this plan,
we might encounter

54
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,240
some local obstacles.

55
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,560
In that case,

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,639
we hope the Five Lakes Alliance
in Lian'an Town

57
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,360
can lend us a helping hand.

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,560
Lian'an Town is our place.

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,680
You verbally say you want cooperation,

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,479
but what if you intend
to seize our place?

61
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,159
Exactly.

62
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,639
Who knows?

63
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,080
Sure.

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,159
They aim at our place.

65
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,159
Aim at our place.

66
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,919
That's right.

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
How could we?

68
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,639
As long as you cooperate,

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,960
in the future,

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,960
we can share

71
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,639
the fruits of success.

72
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,159
What if I don't cooperate?

73
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,919
I'll feel bad about it.

74
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,960
Bobo,

75
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,960
listen,

76
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,599
I'm just a businesswoman.

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,039
We don't have to make things ugly.

78
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,840
Whatever you want, I can satisfy you.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,159
Bobo, I've said all I know.

80
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,479
L-Let me go, please.

81
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,199
You don't want me to interfere,

82
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,080
and I won't.

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,840
Once I get out of here,

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,319
I swear I'll stay far away from here.

85
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,439
You haven't told your secret.

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,439
I told you

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,879
I'd only speak

88
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,879
in front of Anle.

89
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,199
Kill me.

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,279
Kill me!

91
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,920
If you kill me, you'll never

92
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
know my secret.

93
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,759
Shoot me!

94
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,120
Kill me!

95
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,399
I'm calling Anle now.

96
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,360
If Anle answers, you talk to him.

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,959
If he doesn't,

98
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,399
you'll be dead.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,399
Since we're talking about Lian'an Town,

100
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,000
why not let

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,480
the local branch chief

102
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,079
say something?

103
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,199
Exactly.

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
The local branch chief!

105
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,360
Where is Xiu?

106
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,079
Isn't he the Chief?

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,360
Why didn't he come?

108
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,680
Yes.

109
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,800
Where is he?

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,240
Where?

111
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,040
Who knows?

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,199
Xiu is injured.

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,040
I attended this meeting

114
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,800
on his behalf.

115
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Are you kidding?

116
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
Who are you?

117
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,399
My subordinate mentioned you.

118
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,319
You're Chen Tianshuang, right?

119
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,519
Alright, tell me.

120
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,079
Do you think we should cooperate?

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't feel pressured.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Just speak your mind.

123
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,759
I'm the acting Chief.

124
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm going to say something
on Xiu's behalf

125
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,360
about the current situation.

126
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,120
After Tianhai Sect came to Lian'an Town,

127
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,680
they didn't give us a hard time.

128
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,399
As for the cooperation,

129
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
the Lian'an branch

130
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,839
will do what Mi says.

131
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,720
Mi, what's your decision?

132
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,360
You're not lucky.

133
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
Wait.

134
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,279
Just one second.

135
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,800
Well...

136
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,680
Sorry,

137
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
I need to take this.

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,319
Hello?

139
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,639
Sorry, Anle.

140
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,560
It's me.

141
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,639
I'll only give you 30 seconds.

142
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,959
You promise me.

143
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,399
After I speak,

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
release me.

145
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
Got it.

146
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,639
Put Bobo on the phone.

147
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,759
Hello, Anle.

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,399
Okay.

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,319
Understood.

150
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,519
Sorry, Mi.

151
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,800
You can continue.

152
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,439
Well...

153
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,399
Long story short,

154
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,399
help me pass my message.

155
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,879
The Five Lakes Alliance

156
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,240
can't be bossed around.

157
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560
Exactly.

158
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,840
Understood.

159
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,080
However,

160
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,639
I know the chairman.

161
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
After hearing this,

162
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,639
he will feel disappointed.

163
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,039
The last gang
that disappointed Tianhai Sect

164
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,039
was Black Lotus.

165
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,960
It's in Lian'an Town too.

166
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,919
What happened to them?

167
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,960
Chen Tianshuang,

168
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,000
you know it, right?

169
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,799
The Black Lotus Gang is gone.

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
What do you mean?

171
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,720
Their leader was murdered.

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,639
The vice leader died
when he fought with the leader's son.

173
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,120
Leader's home

174
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,200
was burned down.

175
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,919
That's true.

176
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,799
I heard you were present

177
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,480
and saw it.

178
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,759
It's quite impressive for you, right?

179
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,279
I'll never forget it.

180
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,320
If you like,

181
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,799
share it with everyone.

182
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,720
Mi.

183
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,879
I've already disturbed you
for too long today.

184
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm leaving.

185
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,600
You're Qiang, right?

186
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,039
Yes.

187
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,720
What do you want?

188
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,639
I've long heard that you're very senior.

189
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,559
Seeing you today,

190
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,559
I realize you are.

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,639
If you're free,

192
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,399
let's have tea together.

193
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,840
Who do you think you are?

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,840
Have tea? Get lost!

195
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,759
That's alright.

196
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,200
Put it down!

197
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,960
Listen, put down the gun!

198
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
Where did you come from?

199
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,919
Trying to scare us?

200
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Fight them!

201
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,039
- Fight!
- Fight!

202
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,000
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

203
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,039
Stop it!

204
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,519
Whoever shoots

205
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,960
will be expelled from the alliance.

206
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
Put the guns away.

207
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:54,679
Gosh!

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,360
Shut up!

209
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,952
Do what I say!

210
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
Mi said put down the gun!

211
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,559
Put it down!

212
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,960
Mi.

213
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,919
I'll take him away.

214
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,559
Sorry.

215
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,840
M-Mi.

216
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,000
Mi.

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,720
Mi!

218
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:20,960
Mi!

219
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,320
Anle agreed

220
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,639
to let me go.

221
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,840
I know.

222
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,679
Anle told me.

223
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
L-Let me go now.

224
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,919
You are so beautiful.

225
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,039
It's a pity to let you go.

226
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,799
As the Chief Protector
of the Tianhai Sect,

227
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,039
is he going to go back on his word?

228
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,159
Of course not.

229
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
Anle always keeps his word.

230
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,120
As long as you let me go,

231
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,559
I'll listen to you.

232
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,519
You can ask me to do anything.

233
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,600
Really?

234
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,120
Sure.

235
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,399
I want you

236
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,080
to die.

237
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:55,840
Dad.

238
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
Why not call it a day?

239
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,759
You go back and rest.

240
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,559
It's not easy for everyone
to gather here.

241
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,960
If the meeting is over
just for such a small matter,

242
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,320
they will laugh at us.

243
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,200
Mi.

244
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,879
Why didn't you stop us just now?

245
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,679
Dad.

246
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,120
Let me speak.

247
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,320
Shoot them?

248
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,159
Didn't you see their submachine guns?

249
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,159
We have weapons too.

250
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,879
We have many men.

251
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,080
Can't we handle them?

252
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,000
- Yeah, exactly.
- Exactly.

253
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,159
We can win,

254
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,840
but at what cost?

255
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,639
Have you thought about it?

256
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm not afraid at all.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,080
You should be afraid.

258
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
Do you know what Anle did?

259
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,519
Do you?

260
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,240
I know.

261
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,960
I saw those who look down on him,

262
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,519
who think they can outsmart him,

263
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,080
and who want

264
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,919
to fight him.

265
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,360
What happened to them?

266
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,159
All of them lost.

267
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,840
They end up worse.

268
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,519
Do you mean

269
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,840
we have to watch them take Qiang away

270
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,519
from our place?

271
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,919
It's quite obvious

272
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,759
that Anle came prepared.

273
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,120
He's guessed

274
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,279
everyone's reactions.

275
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,200
Whether you endure or not,

276
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
you lose.

277
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,840
No matter what, you lost.

278
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,440
Which side are you on?

279
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,279
If you want to beat him,

280
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,440
you can't do what he wants.

281
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,159
You must take the initiative.

282
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,360
Only by catching him off guard

283
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
will you

284
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,159
have a slight chance to win.

285
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,320
So,

286
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,960
according to what you said,

287
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,919
even if everything goes smoothly,

288
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,559
we still only have

289
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,039
a slight chance to win.

290
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,919
Hao.

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,320
Do you have any good ideas?

292
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
In my opinion,

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,639
the road is right under the foot,

294
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,000
so why do we walk on the tightrope?

295
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,240
Hao,

296
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,639
you mean...

297
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,159
Anle is a smart person.

298
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,200
He took Qiang away,

299
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,360
but he

300
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,840
didn't shoot.

301
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,960
His implication is very clear.

302
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,279
He doesn't want to be our enemy.

303
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,519
In my view,

304
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,879
as long as we compromise first,

305
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
Qiang will naturally return safely.

306
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,879
Then we will follow the Tianhai Sect

307
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,960
and make big money.

308
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,360
Isn't this a win-win situation?

309
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,639
Compromise?

310
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,759
So, you'll follow Tianhai Sect
like a lackey?

311
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,639
Watch your words!

312
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,799
He just made it very clear.

313
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,919
It is cooperation.

314
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,559
Don't you understand cooperation?

315
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,559
He took a guy away in front of us.

316
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,440
You call this cooperation?

317
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,799
That's because Qiang was rude to him.

318
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,679
Didn't you just see it?

319
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,639
He was polite

320
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,320
to my dad and me.

321
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,200
When I take over the alliance,

322
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,000
I will first befriend him.

323
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,799
By then,

324
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,279
he will definitely go with the flow

325
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,000
and today's unpleasantness

326
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,159
will be forgotten.

327
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:07,919
Right?

328
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,480
No wonder

329
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
you're so proactive today.

330
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
Turns out you're trying to canvass.

331
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,320
Nonsense!

332
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm thinking about everyone here.

333
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,679
Understand?

334
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,000
Guys, think about it.

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,159
Our alliance is well-reputed
in the underworld.

336
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,159
We don't deal in drugs

337
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,240
or gambling.

338
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
We stay out of politics.

339
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,919
But others do
those profitable businesses.

340
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,360
That's why our reputation is good.

341
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,600
But the problem is,
can reputation put food on the table?

342
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,440
Can reputation be spent like money?

343
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,639
Some outdated rules

344
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,840
need to be changed.

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,559
We gathered everyone here today

346
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,720
for the election of the next head,

347
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,360
but now,

348
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,240
I think that choosing a new head

349
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,639
is not the most important thing.

350
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,279
The most important thing

351
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,039
is that our alliance needs

352
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,320
to be united right now

353
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,000
to face the current situation.

354
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,799
He Shuyi.

355
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,039
So, right now,

356
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,440
who will unite the alliance?

357
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,599
You?

358
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,640
A woman?

359
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,599
That's not the point right now.

360
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
Right now, we have to decide what to do.

361
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,519
After all, not everyone

362
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,599
is willing to be a lackey
for the Tianhai Sect.

363
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,720
I didn't think much of Tianhai Sect.

364
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,119
But given what happened today,

365
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,480
I changed my mind.

366
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,599
Anle has made it clear.

367
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,960
Whoever goes against them

368
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,200
will be doomed.

369
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,480
So,

370
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,039
our alliance shouldn't exist.

371
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,839
Let's just disband it right here

372
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,400
and join the Tianhai Sect.

373
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,079
- You...
- Enough.

374
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,480
Right now,

375
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,759
if we're not united,

376
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,480
our alliance might as well disband.

377
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,160
Mi, you make a decision.

378
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,440
I'm too old.

379
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,599
As for the way forward,

380
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,160
it's up to everyone to choose.

381
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,319
You go back and think it over carefully.

382
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,319
Tomorrow, we come here again.

383
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,119
Each Chief has one vote

384
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,960
to elect the next head.

385
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,480
I'll say one last thing.

386
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,519
Since it's your choice,

387
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,680
no matter who is finally elected,

388
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,359
the future of the alliance

389
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,119
will be handed to the winner.

390
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:38,535
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

391
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:42,010
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

392
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:46,202
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

393
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:52,550
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
