00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:58,704
=Episode 33=

3
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,746
(Anle always can grasp our weakness.
He is too scary!)

4
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,879
Hello.

5
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,079
They have signed

6
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,359
the agreement you gave me.

7
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,159
The other arrangements

8
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,040
are up to you now.

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,159
I heard you had a fallout

10
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,599
with Five Lakes Alliance.

11
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,040
I already stated my stance.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,040
I said our two sects

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,640
are all family.

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,239
But the Chief disagreed.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,560
What else could I do?

16
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,840
Was it your plan from the beginning?

17
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,640
Anle.

18
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,200
I have announced to everyone

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,519
that I'm with you now.

20
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,239
Isn't it a bit

21
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,879
inappropriate to doubt me?

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,879
I've left everything behind.

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,200
You won't go back on the position

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,680
you promised me, right?

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Once the chemical plant is established,

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,400
everything I promised you

27
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,840
will be fulfilled.

28
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,640
Alright.

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,120
Call me Tianshuang.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,639
And this matter will be over.

31
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,639
Why do you smell so good?

32
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,240
Did you wear perfume?

33
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,904
If I'm not here,

34
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:17,000
you're the one to rely on.

35
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,319
Come on, have a drink.

36
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,599
- Pay back the money!
- Pay back the money!

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,599
(Three days later)
Pay back the money!

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,919
- Pay back the money!
- Pay back the money!

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
- Pay back the money!
- Pay back the money!

40
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,560
- Pay back the money!
- Pay back the money!

41
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,599
Anle.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
Something happened.

43
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,639
What happened?

44
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,560
Didn't Tianshuang

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
guarantee my dad

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,719
that Tianhai Sect

47
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,479
would give every household compensation?

48
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,400
So they agreed to sign

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,639
to support the chemical plant.

50
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,520
These days,

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
they've been asking for the money.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,520
But they say

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,000
there is no such thing at all.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
No such thing?

55
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,639
Dad signed the agreement,

56
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,520
but they denied it.

57
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
They went to Tianshuang,

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
but Tianshuang

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
is gone now.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Doesn't this mean we've lost everything

61
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,039
and we've been played?

62
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,120
So today,

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,759
all of them went

64
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,520
to the construction site
for an explanation.

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,639
They even did a livestream.

66
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,360
Look.

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,280
Tianhai Sect

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,879
broke their promise

69
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,319
and wouldn't fulfill the agreement.

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,360
Still claiming to be
a legitimate company.

71
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,639
It's all a lie.

72
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah.

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
It's all a lie.

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,159
They are building a chemical plant here.

75
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,719
It's all a lie.

76
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,879
Using us to do experiments.

77
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,439
The people of Lian'an Town

78
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,039
will definitely resist to the end

79
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,919
and won't compromise.

80
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,800
- No compromise.
- No way!

81
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,719
They finally came.

82
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,039
Let's see if they give us
an explanation.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,960
Yes.

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,479
Everyone, take a look.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
Livestream.

86
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,840
What?

87
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,800
What are you doing?

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,319
You want to get physical?

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Stop it.

90
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm here to solve the problem.

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Alright.

92
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,639
Then let's talk.

93
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,560
Is this agreement yours?

94
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,639
Yes.

95
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,800
(Bonus: 800,000 per family. Pay 20,000
within 3 days. Chen Tianshuang)

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,439
The agreement was signed by us.

97
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,639
Did you hear that?

98
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,759
Still want to deny it?

99
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,879
But we didn't agree to

100
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,560
this handwritten term.

101
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,199
It has Chen Tianshuang's signature
on it.

102
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,279
Isn't he one of yours?

103
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,959
Yeah.

104
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,720
That day,

105
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,120
he signed it on my back.

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,439
How can you deny it?

107
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,399
I saw

108
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,800
he fought with Five Lakes Alliance

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,519
for the sake of Tianhai Sect.

110
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,519
Don't tell me that you don't know it.

111
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,120
I know who benefits

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,319
from this agreement.

113
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,279
We are

114
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,600
the main body of the agreement.

115
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,199
But he decided on this clause
on his own.

116
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,240
If you are not satisfied,

117
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,519
you should go to him.

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
What's the use of going to him?

119
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,240
He's not the boss.

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,759
How could he have so much money?

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,519
Stop passing the buck.

122
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,279
Anyway,

123
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,040
I'm making myself clear today.

124
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,279
If you don't pay, we'll make a fuss here

125
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,240
and livestream!

126
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,519
Let the netizens know

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,920
that Tianhai Sect doesn't keep
their word.

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,079
At that time,

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,879
you will lose your reputation

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,720
and can't build the chemical plant.

131
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,680
Anyway, the one who will be anxious
won't be me

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
or Chen Tianshuang,

133
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,079
but your boss.

134
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,519
Yeah.

135
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,480
Yes!

136
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,800
- Pay back the money!
- Pay back the money!

137
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,079
Xiu.

138
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,560
See?

139
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,639
People digging up dirt
on Tianhai Sect online

140
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,720
are increasing.

141
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,000
There's even dirt
on Black Lotus Gang and Heilun.

142
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,839
(Rumor Wall)
Lin Yongning was killed by Tianhai Sect

143
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,519
and then dismembered by horses.

144
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,000
This is too fake.

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,519
Where did the horses come from?

146
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,759
That's not the point.

147
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,480
The truth is also meaningless.

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
What matters now is

149
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,920
that no matter what happens

150
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,600
in Lian'an Town in the future,

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,040
everyone will think
Tianhai Sect has done it.

152
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,480
Makes sense.

153
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,519
But why?

154
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,079
So,

155
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,319
you and Tianshuang

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,759
planned it in advance?

157
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,720
Silly boy.

158
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,560
If we didn't plan it,

159
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,240
how could the coordination be so tacit?

160
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,000
I knew it.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,160
We happened to encounter his betrayal.

162
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,439
Then, after I hit him,

163
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,959
you had an argument with him.

164
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,040
Before I could react,

165
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,439
you had kicked him out.

166
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,160
Wait.

167
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,839
I was part of it too.

168
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,199
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

169
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,000
If I told you in advance,

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,560
could your reaction be so natural?

171
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,079
Isn't it just because you don't
trust me?

172
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,279
This has nothing to do with trust.

173
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
True or false.

174
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
Real or fake.

175
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,879
Don't care about these details.

176
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,079
The result is good.

177
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
That's true.

178
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,959
In that case,

179
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,720
Tianshuang only put on a show

180
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
to deal with them.

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,399
So he wasn't disloyal, right?

182
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,879
So, kicking him out was also fake?

183
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,040
That is real.

184
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,560
Why?

185
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,399
Although it was an act,

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,839
in front of everyone,

187
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,279
as the Chief,

188
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,360
I dismissed him.

189
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,120
If we say it's fake,

190
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,839
nobody can trust me from now on.

191
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,079
What about Tianshuang?

192
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,000
Tianshuang, in name,

193
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,360
is no longer with Lian'an branch
of Five Lakes Alliance.

194
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
This is his choice.

195
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,439
It's fine.

196
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,959
True buddies ride by feeling

197
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,959
and sincerity.

198
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,800
It doesn't matter if we are
in the same gang.

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,199
It's just that

200
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,040
since I knew him,

201
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,519
we were both in Five Lakes Alliance.

202
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,399
Thinking that his identity
has suddenly changed

203
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,639
still makes me

204
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,040
a bit unaccustomed.

205
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,759
Don't feel unaccustomed.

206
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,240
Trust me.

207
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,079
No matter how much time has passed,

208
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,120
or how people change,

209
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,439
as long as he needs,

210
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,360
I'll definitely go all out to help him.

211
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,480
I believe he will do the same for us.

212
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,759
Anle.

213
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,480
According to your instructions,

214
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,519
people from Aquatic Products Union
have gone home.

215
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,639
But after that,

216
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,039
we still need to take care of it.

217
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,200
I know.

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
Just stall them for now.

219
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Chen Tianshuang left no way out
for himself

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
to muddy the waters.

221
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,039
Why did he do that?

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,519
Maybe his way out

223
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,759
is not just Tianhai Sect
and Five Lakes Alliance.

224
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,679
You mean...

225
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,000
No matter what,

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,639
he managed to do it.

227
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,840
It was his lucky day.

228
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,960
This is too simple.

229
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,200
The more complicated,

230
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,320
the easier to go wrong.

231
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
As long as it works,

232
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,320
the process can be simple.

233
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,639
But

234
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,799
his good days

235
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,919
are probably coming to an end.

236
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,279
Taixiang.

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,279
Zhixing.

238
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,759
With high certainty.

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
Previously, you made this guarantee

240
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,919
to Mr. Cai, right?

241
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,759
Yes.

242
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,919
But what I saw online

243
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,279
doesn't seem to be the case.

244
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I see

245
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
it's getting increasingly complicated
online.

246
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,320
Ideally,

247
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,399
I hope the whole thing can be peaceful.

248
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,440
In that case,

249
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,279
there will be fewer troubles coming up.

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
You call this peaceful?

251
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:56,097
Still claiming to be
a legitimate company.

252
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,504
It's all a lie.

253
00:09:57,702 --> 00:09:58,016
Yeah.

254
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:58,919
It's all a lie.

255
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,200
They are building a chemical plant here.

256
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,759
It's all a lie.

257
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,639
Using us to do experiments.

258
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,320
The people of Lian'an Town

259
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,799
will definitely resist to the end

260
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,000
and won't compromise.

261
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,240
Since they are not smart enough,

262
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
I have no choice but to use other means.

263
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,799
Zhixing.

264
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,639
I hope this matter has been settled

265
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,279
when we meet next time.

266
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,200
Okay?

267
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
Sure.

268
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:36,039
(Ai Mo Li:
Full Body Massage, Foot Massage)

269
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,679
I'm leaving.

270
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,519
Okay.

271
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,279
Alright.

272
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,360
Tianshuang.

273
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,840
I've been dismissed.

274
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,720
Xiu still lets me sleep here.

275
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,559
Don't mind, right?

276
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm used to sleeping here.

277
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
Alright.

278
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Two grown men being so mushy.

279
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,960
Xiu said you wouldn't come back.

280
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,720
I thought...

281
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,159
Business is business.

282
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,039
I understand that.

283
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,960
Even if you've been dismissed,

284
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,279
you still have a chance to rejoin.

285
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,600
You hope I come back?

286
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,679
Of course.

287
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,960
We are buddies.

288
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,159
Ming, are you willing to trust me,

289
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,679
even if

290
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,960
I can't tell you everything?

291
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,200
Mmm.

292
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,679
Things are quite complex now.

293
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,039
My current identity

294
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,440
actually makes it easier to act.

295
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,759
It is all to deal with Tianhai Sect?

296
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,799
It's okay.

297
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,559
I understand.

298
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,360
Good.

299
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,200
Tianshuang.

300
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,399
For what happened,

301
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,039
sorry.

302
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,000
I didn't know anything

303
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,799
and hit you.

304
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,720
Did you have a problem with me?

305
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,840
You hit me so hard.

306
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,879
Then hit me back.

307
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,799
Alright.

308
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,120
Not a big deal.

309
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,919
I didn't hold back
when I hit you, either.

310
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,639
We have to really hit each other
to convince the audience.

311
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,960
Next time, I'll go to your home.

312
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Treat me to a meal.

313
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,679
Ming, Li was taken away.

314
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,360
What?

315
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,639
Li was taken away?

316
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,639
I'm going over now.

317
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,840
I'll go with you.

318
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,559
Ignore it.

319
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,519
Hurry up.

320
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,159
If I guess right,

321
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,960
this call will tell us

322
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
where Li is.

323
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,200
Li is with you, right?

324
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,759
Yes.

325
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,679
Tell me, what do you want?

326
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,480
Let's have a meal tomorrow.

327
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,039
As long as you don't act rashly,

328
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,720
I guarantee her safety.

329
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,279
Where?

330
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,840
The place where you often eat.

331
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,519
How is it?

332
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,840
Anle wants to meet me tomorrow.

333
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,120
Li is in his hands.

334
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,840
Don't act impulsively.

335
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,480
Tomorrow, stay here.

336
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,679
I'll tell you once I get news.

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
I get it.

338
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,039
We can't act impulsively at this time.

339
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,200
My dad's discharged tomorrow.

340
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,639
I...

341
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,919
Just listen to me.

342
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,960
You can't go anywhere.

343
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,840
Got it, Tianshuang.

344
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,279
Tomorrow, before I get your message,

345
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,320
I won't go anywhere.

346
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,919
Shuang.

347
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,879
Come on in.

348
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,879
Waiting for you.

349
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,639
You look so grumpy.

350
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,519
Do I?

351
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,840
I'm hungry.

352
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,320
I just need to eat something.

353
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,559
Then come in.

354
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
You're a guest.

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,759
Just ask Qi to do it.

356
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I'm one of you.

357
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,279
It's okay.

358
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,519
You go ahead first.

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,720
Chen Tianshuang.

360
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
I wondered when you would arrive.

361
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,519
Today,

362
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,480
Luo's discharge is a joyful event.

363
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,960
Whatever between you and me

364
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,399
should be after we leave here.

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,440
Now we are all the same,

366
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,679
guests to share in the joy.

367
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,240
Luo, am I right?

368
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,639
Alright.

369
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,399
Come on, sit.

370
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,559
Have a seat.

371
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,000
Sit.

372
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,919
Come on.

373
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,720
Luo.

374
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,559
I caused your sickness.

375
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,200
I need to apologize.

376
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,639
Don't say that.

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,679
I am

378
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,679
getting older

379
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,879
and in poor health.

380
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,120
Even if that's true,

381
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
I still feel very guilty.

382
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,360
Come on.

383
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,759
But, Luo,

384
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,559
rest assured.

385
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,360
In the future,

386
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,799
as long as it's within my ability,

387
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,200
I won't let anything

388
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,679
affect you and your family.

389
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,279
Okay.

390
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,200
I believe you.

391
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,840
Okay.

392
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,039
Then you have to keep your word.

393
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,720
Okay.

394
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Pinky swear.

395
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,639
No lying.

396
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,200
What about Ming?

397
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,559
He's with the Five Lakes Alliance.

398
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,399
I'll rely on you for that,

399
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,279
Chen Tianshuang.

400
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,960
If possible,

401
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,200
I hope you can persuade him.

402
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Young guys are impulsive.

403
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,919
I can understand that.

404
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,720
But he's not a child anymore.

405
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,639
He can't only think about himself.

406
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,279
He should also consider
those around him.

407
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,120
Ming should be mature.

408
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,440
Move the dishes.

409
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,799
Soup.

410
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,360
Come on.

411
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,799
Let me.

412
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,279
Let me.

413
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,360
Qi made this soup especially for you.

414
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,799
She...

415
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,200
Hui.

416
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Just whipped this up.

417
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,120
We have a guest.

418
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,600
Raise our glasses.

419
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,759
Come on.

420
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,279
Wishing Luo good health after discharge.

421
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,039
Thank you.

422
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,879
Come on.

423
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,679
It's best if everyone's healthy.

424
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,879
Cheers.

425
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,159
Join us.

426
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,399
Come on, drink up.

427
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,960
Come on.

428
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,960
Drink less. You've just been discharged.

429
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,799
I haven't drunk for days.

430
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:26,679
Alright.

431
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,519
Take care.

432
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,159
Come by when you have time.

433
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,759
Okay.

434
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:30,399
Okay.

435
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,039
Take care, Luo.

436
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,399
Okay.

437
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,200
Bye-bye.

438
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,159
Where is Li?

439
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
She's with others.

440
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,159
Everyone is safe.

441
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,159
Others?

442
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,480
It's not just Ming who needs

443
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
to be persuaded.

444
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,600
But don't worry.

445
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
Others are easy to persuade.

446
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,320
I know what you're planning.

447
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,519
But let me remind you.

448
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,559
My patience is limited.

449
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,079
This is the last warning.

450
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,759
If you obey,

451
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,440
everyone can

452
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
be as happy as inside the house

453
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,759
just now.

454
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,200
If you don't,

455
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,680
you'll be the next Lin Yongning.

456
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,160
And your alliance will be
the next Black Lotus.

457
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,799
When we meet again next time,

458
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,599
the conclusion of everything
will be clear.

459
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,079
Chen Tianshuang.

460
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,839
Think it over.

461
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
Don't choose wrong.

462
00:17:56,934 --> 00:18:00,869
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

463
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:04,261
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

464
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:08,352
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

465
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:14,542
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
