1
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
Wu,

2
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,439
how much money can we make

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,560
with these goods?

4
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,719
How would I know?

5
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
The money won't

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,200
end up in our pockets anyway.

7
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,640
That's weird.

8
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,599
Why do you think they want

9
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,760
the goods in the mainland?

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,280
Even Chief

11
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,719
might not know it.

12
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,840
Why ask so much?

13
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,120
You want to get in trouble?

14
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,000
This is Lian'an Town,

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,920
not Taipei, China.

16
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,959
How could it be so dangerous?

17
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,200
That's weird.

18
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,560
Black Lotus.

19
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,599
Rest in peace.

20
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,039
Heilun.

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
It's done.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,360
Clean up the mess.

23
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,479
Don't leave any traces.

24
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,479
What about the goods?

25
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,960
They're worth millions.

26
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Just leave them here.

27
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,599
But...

28
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,999
Got it.

29
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,000
I knew

30
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,759
this bit of money

31
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,240
wouldn't satisfy you.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Tomorrow morning,
the Intelligence Agency will know

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,520
what happened
to the Five Lakes Alliance.

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,120
We need to make a delivery soon

35
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,439
to show everyone

36
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,360
that Lian'an Town has a better option.

37
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Don't worry.

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,080
I've arranged everything for you
on the mainland side.

39
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,039
But recently, the inspections
have been strict.

40
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,080
Costs in all areas have to be raised.

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,080
I hate it when people change plans
at the last minute.

42
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,360
What are you doing?

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
You're hurting me.

44
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,479
Don't you love the thrill the most?

45
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,639
What are you doing?

46
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,240
There are dead bodies outside.

47
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:59,328
=Faith & Fire=

48
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:02,592
=Episode 1=

49
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:07,296
(Those dark rules in Lian'an Town
won't scare us)

50
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,759
My name is Chen Tianshuang.

51
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,519
I'm chivalrous and kind,

52
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,560
from Dongshan Island in Fujian Province,

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,160
a seafood merchant.

54
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:18,120
(Lian'an Town)
(I see people)

55
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,720
(from here and us as one.)

56
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,079
(I'm very happy to come
to Taiwan, China.)

57
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,839
The reason for my happiness

58
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,399
is that I can work

59
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,560
and strive together

60
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,480
with everyone.

61
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,360
Hold on.

62
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,039
Mr. Chen.

63
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,399
Please stop rhyming.

64
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,519
You're here for the case.

65
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
(Tainan City Police Department)
Get to the point.

66
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,199
In this case,

67
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,399
I'll be frank.

68
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,040
Everything

69
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,319
(started with Yu.)

70
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,560
(You don't know who Yu is, right?)

71
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,239
(Yu)

72
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,639
(is my supplier here.)

73
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,199
(If the last batch of seafood
he sent me hadn't spoiled,)

74
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,000
(I wouldn't have come personally.)

75
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,959
I just came to reason with him.

76
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,759
We had worked together
for such a long time.

77
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,560
I didn't ask for much,

78
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,959
just for him to apologize.

79
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,799
(But...)

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,560
You didn't even answer my call.

81
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,319
Yu, don't mess with me.

82
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,120
The last batch of seafood
you sent me spoiled.

83
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,480
I've lost my clients.

84
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,040
You must take the responsibility.

85
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,360
Don't talk nonsense.

86
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,160
How could there be a problem
with my goods?

87
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm talking nonsense?

88
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,959
I inspected the goods.

89
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,240
Do you think I'm stupid?

90
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,679
Well,

91
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,399
compensate me this much.

92
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,920
How could it be so much?

93
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,560
Losing clients costs me money, too.

94
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,199
I can't sleep every day

95
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,319
seeing your rotten seafood.

96
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,920
And the travel costs too.

97
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,240
Shouldn't you cover that?

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,399
It has nothing to do with me.

99
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,639
Shirking responsibility?

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
Well,

101
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,120
introduce me

102
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,959
to the seafood business here.

103
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,519
I want to develop here too.

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Then I'll ask for

105
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,519
only half of it.

106
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,359
Okay?

107
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,279
You

108
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,759
want to do business here?

109
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,920
Can't I?

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,160
I've already ruled
the seafood market in Dongshan.

111
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,399
I want to try a new market here.

112
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,560
Don't worry.

113
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,240
I won't steal your business.

114
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
Alright.

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,519
I'll introduce you
to a few brothers here.

116
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,519
Hurry up.

117
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,160
(I found out later)

118
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,759
(that the brothers he mentioned)

119
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,959
are the Black Lotus Gang.

120
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,240
Black Lotus Gang?

121
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,720
Bring them on.

122
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,480
I'll take them on.

123
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
Young man.

124
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,639
You're quite arrogant.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,399
So many people dealing in seafood?

126
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,919
They didn't pay and acted
as if they were right,

127
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,759
and even tried to threaten me.

128
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,960
It's the 21st century now.

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,279
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

130
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,360
How could I endure that?

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,159
So I said something to him on the spot.

132
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,239
Then what?

133
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,680
Then...

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,279
You mean,

135
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,559
you were beaten up.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,919
I know some kung fu.

137
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,399
But I was outnumbered.

138
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,039
They surrounded me at once

139
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,559
and then subdued me.

140
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,120
They wanted my apology.

141
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
What did I do wrong?

142
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,559
Why should I apologize?

143
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
As the saying goes,

144
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
one lives with dignity.

145
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
I was right.

146
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,160
So, why should I?

147
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,399
As a result...

148
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,399
You got beaten up again.

149
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,519
Do these people have any features?

150
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,240
Don't you know the Black Lotus Gang?

151
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,080
A bearded guy.

152
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,159
Are you talking about me?

153
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Right.

154
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
They hit me

155
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,639
and took my Travel Permit.

156
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,559
Arrest them, officer.

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,519
Young man.

158
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,759
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,200
I've never met you before.

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,399
- You're lying!
- Quit it.

161
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,999
Officer Jia.

162
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,519
I found an ID

163
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,559
on the road.

164
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,080
This photo looks

165
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,559
(Travel Permit Chen Tianshuang)
like you.

166
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
You were pointing at me just now.

167
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,960
You need evidence to file a report.

168
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,559
Do you have an audio recording,

169
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,720
a photo,

170
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
or a video?

171
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
There's surveillance.

172
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,159
The fish market must have surveillance.

173
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,759
It must have recorded them hitting me.

174
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,159
Sorry.

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
Our equipment is currently
under maintenance.

176
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,759
During that period,

177
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,960
the surveillance should not
be operational.

178
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,480
What a shame.

179
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,200
You can't prove your innocence.

180
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,999
Darn it!

181
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:33,257
Stop it!

182
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,720
Mr. Chen.

183
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,440
We are very busy here.

184
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,360
If you don't have anything else,

185
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,399
please go back first. Okay?

186
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,120
Fine.

187
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,320
I'll report to someone else.

188
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,720
Here.

189
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,039
Officer, I want to file a report.

190
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,879
I wanna report.

191
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,759
Mr. Chen.

192
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,159
I'm warning you,

193
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,399
if you keep making trouble,

194
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,000
I can sue you for obstructing our duty.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,840
Why on earth...?

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,879
Young man.

197
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,960
Go back to the mainland early.

198
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,200
Otherwise, if you lose something again,

199
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,240
you might not get it back.

200
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:09,919
(Half a month ago,
Dongshan Island, Fujian)

201
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,039
Yu.

202
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,360
As soon as I receive the money,

203
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,159
I'll transfer it
to you immediately, okay?

204
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,320
Please send me
the next batch of seafood first.

205
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,960
Got it.

206
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,720
Don't pull these tricks on me.

207
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,720
(Authentic Siu Mei)
Alas.

208
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,559
It's no use scolding me.

209
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,879
I'm working

210
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,440
on the breeding of yellow croaker.

211
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,559
Offer me three yuan off per pound.

212
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,159
We'll do a long-term partnership, okay?

213
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,879
Yu.

214
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't push your luck.

215
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,759
You scared him away.

216
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,759
You don't get it.

217
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,279
This is my strategy.

218
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,639
He'll call me back.

219
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,440
You can't be too greedy in business.

220
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,799
You were quite generous as a child.

221
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,080
Why are you becoming so stingy?

222
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,840
What do you mean by stingy?

223
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,399
I'm being mature, okay?

224
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,159
I have to support you in the future.

225
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,399
Forget it.

226
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,799
I can't count on you.

227
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,399
Always eating and drinking.

228
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,919
Zheng's kid next door is almost

229
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,799
ready for school.

230
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,639
What about you?

231
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,759
You can't even get a girlfriend.

232
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,160
You don't get it.

233
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,399
My ideal type is a girl

234
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,840
who's sweet

235
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,360
and bold,

236
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,759
and seems fierce but is actually
good at managing a home.

237
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,759
Son, what era are we in?

238
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,879
Still looking for

239
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,519
a girlfriend like your mom?

240
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,919
Where can you find one?

241
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,639
I'm telling you,

242
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,440
your dad could marry me

243
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,240
because God knows

244
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
where he got

245
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,919
such great luck.

246
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,519
You

247
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,159
should have some self-awareness, okay?

248
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,559
Mom, I won't be back for dinner.

249
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,720
I still have business to do.

250
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,559
Don't set such high standards.

251
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,080
Alright, alright.

252
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
I'm leaving.

253
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,720
Shuang, you're back?

254
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,039
What's good today?

255
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Same as usual.

256
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,200
Do some work.

257
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,000
That was too obvious.

258
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,039
Why did you follow me?

259
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,160
Am I handsome?

260
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,280
Tell me.

261
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,279
Chen Tianshuang.

262
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,119
Right?

263
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,519
Bro,

264
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,759
do I owe you money?

265
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,519
If I owe you money, I can pay you back.

266
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,919
Why did you tie me up?

267
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,399
Turn off the light.

268
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
Let's talk.

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,840
Bro.

270
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,799
You noticed being followed

271
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,440
and took down my man.

272
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,240
That was impressive.

273
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,600
No.

274
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,919
That was too obvious.

275
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,639
Who would follow someone so closely?

276
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,519
After graduating from sports school,

277
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,440
what did you do?

278
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,680
Do you remember?

279
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,759
I did some small business.

280
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,480
I'm dealing in seafood now.

281
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:05,679
Bro,

282
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,799
if you need seafood,
I'll send some to you.

283
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,879
But you need to let me know
who you are first.

284
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,479
I can't see.

285
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,360
Who I am is not important.

286
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,879
Chen Tianshuang.

287
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,639
Who are you?

288
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,159
Didn't you just call my name?

289
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,559
I am Chen Tianshuang.

290
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,799
Cicada

291
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,639
is you, right?

292
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,879
Cicada?

293
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,240
I never used this username.

294
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,000
My username is
Chen Tianshuang Tian Tian Shuang.

295
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,600
What is Cicada?

296
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,120
Zhang Tianliang

297
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,159
is your secret weapon.

298
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,359
Right?

299
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,519
Two years ago,

300
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,360
he died on a mission.

301
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
Since then, you left
the National Security Agency.

302
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,360
Am I right?

303
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,000
What agency?

304
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,320
What mission?

305
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,240
Do you know how Tianliang died?

306
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,679
Say it!

307
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,919
Tell me!

308
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,599
Still pretending?

309
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,759
Looks like

310
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,679
asking won't work.

311
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,280
It doesn't matter.

312
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080
Let's take it slow.

313
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,960
What?

314
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,479
Come over.

315
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,960
Now,

316
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,159
willing to speak?

317
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Speak about what?

318
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,200
I don't know anything.
What should I say?

319
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,759
Again.

320
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,319
Still won't talk?

321
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,039
What should I say?

322
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,880
Again.

323
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,440
Bro, I'm really not...

324
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,640
I'll talk, I'll talk.

325
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,960
I'll talk.

326
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:26,432
(Thursday)

327
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,319
Bro,

328
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,880
let me go.

329
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I...

330
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,079
I've said everything I know.

331
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,200
Why are you tying me up like this?

332
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,240
What are you doing?

333
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,240
You did talk,

334
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,799
but what you said was all lies.

335
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,599
If we investigate
based on what you said,

336
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,400
it's like alerting
National Security Agency.

337
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,759
No, I'm telling the truth.

338
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,119
I didn't lie.

339
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,839
They were talking nonsense.

340
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,279
They were lying to you.

341
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,240
You're the one who lied to me.

342
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,279
I'll give you one last chance.

343
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,960
Is Zhang Tianliang

344
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,880
your secret weapon?

345
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,279
Tianliang

346
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
was my childhood friend.

347
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,839
Nobody move.

348
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,359
Don't come closer.

349
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
Otherwise, I'll shoot him.

350
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,960
You enjoy messing with me, huh?

351
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,599
Who is it?

352
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,359
Don't come closer!

353
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:29,960
Alright.

354
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,759
I'll shoot him!

355
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,359
Alright.

356
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,199
Who is it?

357
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,359
Put the gun down first.

358
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,319
Chief Xu?
