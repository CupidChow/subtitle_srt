3
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,680
(Approaching Cai Desheng.
Success is within reach!)

4
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:09,664
(Shuyi)

5
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,400
You are still awake this late?

6
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,120
I heard Ming is getting married.

7
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,959
Nothing can be hidden from you.

8
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,079
Yes.

9
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,400
We're celebrating.

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,840
Take it slow. Don't drive.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Do you hear me?

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,280
Then give him the phone.

13
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,040
I want to say a few words to him.

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
Wait a second.

15
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,279
Ming.

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Ming.

17
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,159
Ming.

18
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,159
What's up, Tianshuang?

19
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,920
You're avoiding drinking.

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't drink anymore.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Hurry up.

22
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,519
Shuyi's call.

23
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,359
Shuyi?

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Hello?

25
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,919
Ming.

26
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,079
I wish you

27
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,319
happiness.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Thank you, Shuyi.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
I...

30
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,599
I-I...

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,520
I'll cherish her.

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,439
Okay, then

33
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,039
I'll give the phone to Tianshuang.

34
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,080
Don't drink too much.

35
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,840
Ming is drunk.

36
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,639
You won't forget
you're the Chief Protector, right?

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,560
I said you don't need to worry too much.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,199
But you don't really think

39
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,719
you're just a figurehead, right?

40
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,039
I just recovered from a work injury.

41
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,400
Give me some days off.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,800
How long do you plan to take off?

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
Let me take more time.

44
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,479
Shuang.

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you...?

46
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,999
Forget it.

47
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,800
I won't ask further.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,759
Anyway,

49
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,319
if you need help, just tell me.

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,400
I will.

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,639
No matter what you want to do,

52
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,280
be careful.

53
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,719
Okay.

54
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,279
Tianshuang.

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,599
You know?

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,759
I'm really happy.

57
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,639
I know.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,759
Why are you supporting me?

59
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,599
I'm not drunk.

60
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,479
Then walk by yourself.

61
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,360
I'll watch you walk.

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
Go.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
Go.

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,199
Go.

65
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,759
Why is this road so slanted?

66
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,599
Why didn't I notice it before?

67
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,319
Alright.

68
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,879
Tianshuang.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
You know what?

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm getting married.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,479
That's amazing.

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Do you remember?

73
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,159
Back then,

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
you encouraged me to confess to Li.

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,599
Of course, I remember.

76
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,599
Tianshuang.

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Tianshuang.

78
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,680
If it weren't for you,

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,120
I wouldn't be like this today.

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,120
Sometimes,

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
I really feel like

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,160
you're my brother.

83
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,319
I am your brother.

84
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
Tianshuang.

85
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,639
Tianshuang.

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,519
Tianshuang!

87
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,759
Stop it.

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm getting married.

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,079
Tianshuang, I'm getting married.

90
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm getting married.

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Got it!

92
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm happy.

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
I know.

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
We're home now.

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,600
I swear I'm not drunk.

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,639
I know you're not drunk.

97
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,680
Qi.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
So happy.

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Not drunk?

100
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:02,879
No.

101
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,399
Have a rest.

102
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,240
Do you hear me?

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
Tianshuang.

104
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,839
Go to sleep.

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,879
Ming is really something.

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,879
He was playing dumb before.

107
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,000
Now,

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,560
he's about to get married.

109
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,920
I know him.

110
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
He doesn't think before he does things.

111
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,560
But it's not bad.

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,240
Why think so much?

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,399
As long as he's happy, right?

114
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,879
You haven't been home for so long.

115
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,480
How is your mom?

116
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,759
She's even busier than I am.

117
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,920
She has no time for me.

118
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,879
Then,

119
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,759
did you...?

120
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,560
What?

121
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,960
Well...

122
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,639
Did you tell her about me?

123
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
Why talk about you?

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Why should I talk about you?

125
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,519
Seriously?

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
Teasing me?

127
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,959
Just kidding.

128
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,799
I told her.

129
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,399
I told her about you.

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,920
My mom wants to meet you.

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,079
She'd love for you

132
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,199
to visit with me.

133
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,959
As if I'd go with you.

134
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
What's wrong?

135
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Something on your mind?

136
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,279
The thing I have to do this time

137
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,279
may be quite...

138
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,240
Quite dangerous.

139
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,519
It's different.

140
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,639
This time...

141
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,479
Even more dangerous.

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,000
But I...

143
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
You still want to go, right?

144
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,480
Did you put a bug on me

145
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,199
or something?

146
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,399
How do you know everything?

147
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,039
So,

148
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,720
you are really lucky

149
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
to have such an understanding
girlfriend.

150
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,920
Aren't you going to persuade me?

151
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,759
Why?

152
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,240
You've already made your decision.

153
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,240
I don't want to be a burden to you.

154
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Just like I said before,

155
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,000
since I've decided to be with you,

156
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,480
I've mentally prepared myself for it.

157
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,839
I believe

158
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,519
you must know what you're doing.

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,319
Alright.

160
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,000
Why are you acting like you won't
come back?

161
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,359
I believe

162
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,399
you will definitely

163
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,480
handle everything.

164
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,639
Then come back here

165
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,240
and be with me.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Right?

167
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,919
I will.

168
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,000
Then don't make me wait too long.

169
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,639
I won't wait too long.

170
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,279
Then don't wait.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,279
Just kidding.

172
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,439
It's a deal.

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,399
Pinky swear.

174
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,080
Pinky swear.

175
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,480
Why did you come back so soon?

176
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,639
I thought you'd be away for three
to five days.

177
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,519
No need. I'll come back again.

178
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,000
Fools have their own fortune.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,759
Come over. I'll show you something good.

180
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,360
Just intercepted this news.

181
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,440
The expert in charge of Odin's Eye
will arrive soon.

182
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,480
(Radar technology expert)
This time,

183
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,200
(Odin's Eye Plan)
he'll bring technical keys

184
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,080
to the Odin's Eye.

185
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,239
Keys?

186
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,159
Can we get them?

187
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,559
If we get them,

188
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,240
the Odin's Eye will be exposed

189
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,159
in front of us.

190
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,720
But the Intelligence Agency
isn't stupid.

191
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,879
They'll surely double their precautions

192
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,279
to ensure the expert's safety.

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,240
We definitely can't go in hard.

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
One more thing.

195
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,159
Zheng Taixiang has discovered

196
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,720
the clues we intentionally left.

197
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
He is looking for you.

198
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
If we can

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,639
kill two birds with one stone...

200
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,599
Long.

201
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
After they land,

202
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,000
can you cut off

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,440
their communication network?

204
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,759
We'll have to contact the secret agents
on the other side.

205
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,159
If they can help me lock onto

206
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,759
this expert's communication device,

207
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,799
I can do it.

208
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,919
I think it's worth a try.

209
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,840
What do you want to do?

210
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,919
The Intelligence Agency

211
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,000
will be wary of us.

212
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,279
But what if

213
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,360
we go against the grain?

214
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,039
What about the airport?

215
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,359
Not landed yet.

216
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
We must remain low-key
on the Odin's Eye Plan.

217
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,200
Don't send too many people over.

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,679
Tell them to be careful.

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Don't worry.

220
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,720
Our people are already in position.

221
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
Long.

222
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,759
Can you see it?

223
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,599
Yes.

224
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,000
Get a little closer.

225
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,879
I'll hack their mobile phones.

226
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,479
Here we go.

227
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,639
Done.

228
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,679
Long.

229
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,519
They have left.

230
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,039
I've hacked into the Intelligence Agency

231
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,799
and told them that for safety reasons,

232
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,279
the plane's destination is changed.

233
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,000
But in reality,

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,559
the technical expert is coming out.

235
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,519
I've already told him

236
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,800
to meet up with you.

237
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,160
Impressive.

238
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,920
Next,

239
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,200
leave it to me.

240
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,719
Okay.

241
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,840
Listen to me carefully.

242
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,960
There's somebody coming to you.

243
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,240
You have to move quickly.

244
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,759
Follow my instructions,
and you'll find our man.

245
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,919
Christian?

246
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,119
Yes.

247
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,159
Are you the guy
who's going to protect me?

248
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,999
Yeah.

249
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:54,919
Nice to meet you.

250
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,879
Nice to meet you, too.

251
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,480
Thank you.

252
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,320
Let's go.

253
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,159
Thank you.

254
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,480
Okay, you are welcome.

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,919
Come in.

256
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,279
Mr. Cai.

257
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,119
Something happened.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,919
What happened?

259
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,960
Our people didn't

260
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
pick the technical expert up.

261
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,679
What do you mean?

262
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,119
He...

263
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,639
Someone else picked him up.

264
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,600
I don't care what method you use.

265
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,879
You must find him.

266
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,040
Got it.

267
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,279
I'm on it right away.

268
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:57,728
(Zheng Taixiang)

269
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,519
Taixiang.

270
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,600
Mr. Cai.

271
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,480
Don't worry.

272
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,840
My people

273
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,240
have already tracked their whereabouts.

274
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,119
Right.

275
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,600
Don't worry.

276
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,119
I know.

277
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,279
Hey, check my location.

278
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,720
The target is ahead.

279
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,239
Get out of the car.

280
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
I'm just driving a bit fast.

281
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,720
Well...

282
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,200
Seriously? So many people?

283
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,040
Get out of the car.

284
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,440
What?

285
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,359
What's wrong?

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,359
Chen Tianshuang.

287
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
We finally meet.

288
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,759
Who are you?

289
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,240
We are in the same business.

290
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,799
Gang or seafood?

291
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,559
You're looking for him?

292
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,680
I got a job

293
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,119
for airport pick-up.

294
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,640
Did I take your order?

295
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
You...

296
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,279
You also do airport pick-ups?

297
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,720
It's okay. You can take him away.

298
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,119
Not necessary, bro.

299
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,160
He just fell asleep.

300
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,200
We searched the car

301
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,160
but didn't find it.

302
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,920
Where is it?

303
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,880
What?

304
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,880
Playing dumb?

305
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,079
Bro, why would I play dumb?

306
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,680
This is really unnecessary.

307
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,879
Bro.

308
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,160
You're dressed formally.

309
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,359
Can I work for you?

310
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,119
You can take him.

311
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,480
I won't take the money.

312
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,200
Trying to fool me?

313
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,599
Bro, this is unnecessary.

314
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,160
I just took your order.

315
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,079
You really have guts.

316
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,920
Using yourself as the bait.

317
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,119
You're tough, huh?

318
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,439
Alright.

319
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,519
Let me see

320
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,079
how tough you really are.
