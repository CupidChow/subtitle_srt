May the future be all about clear skies)

4
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,560
To be honest with you,

5
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,359
I'm also scared in my heart.

6
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,560
I won't joke with my own life.

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,519
Look at this sunshine.

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
Look at these waves.

9
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,640
If my girlfriend is by my side,

10
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,760
I also want a stable life.

11
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,799
Look.

00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,680
This is the essay

Huang Zhixing's daughter recently posted

14
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,519

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,879
(he always overreacts.)

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,439
(But the childish one is not me,)

20
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,439
(but him.)

21
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,519
(At first, I didn't understand.)

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,920
(But later, I felt)

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,640
(he seemed to be saying goodbye to me.)

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,719
(Every day he is saying goodbye.)

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,840
(One time, I asked him...)

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,280
Dad.

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,520
Will you suddenly disappear one day?

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,960
(I thought he would say,)

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,159

00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,680
Maybe.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
But you must remember

33
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,199
that everything I'm doing

34
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,840
is to prepare a gift for you.

35
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,919
What gift?

36
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,639
A special gift.

37
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
Can't catch it or touch it.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,000
But maybe only in the far future

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
will you understand what it really is.

40
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,159
Can't catch it or touch it?

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,360
Blue sky and white clouds?

42
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,080
Pretty close.

43
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,879
So what is it?

Dad's gift

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
I think this gift

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,439
is worth

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
this trip.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
In fact, Long is already making

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
related preparations.

okay,

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,280
I'll leave it to you.

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
But remember,

00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120

00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,120

Xiu.

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,039
This has already cost a life.

74
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,719

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
Please remain calm.

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,399
I'm sorry about

83
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,720
this old man's passing.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,399
Of course, we also didn't wish

85
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,480
for such a tragedy to occur.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
But this matter

87
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,319
has nothing to do

88
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,199
with me

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,120
or our Tianhai Sect.

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
It's just that

91
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,720
this old man happened

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
to suffer a relapse.

93
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,839
If you hadn't gotten physical,
he wouldn't have died!

94
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,600
That's your excuse.

95
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,839
We don't believe it.

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,839
No matter what others say,

97
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,399
it doesn't matter.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,240
I want to thank

99
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,879
police officers from Lian'an Town

100
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,759
for proving my innocence.

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
I really appreciate it.

102
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,199
Everyone.

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,319
Please accept my condolences.

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
Just let him go?

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,759
Mom.

107
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,360
You're back.

108
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,920
Since you came back,

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
I've been busy
and haven't had time for you.

110
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,560
I'll make us dinner tonight.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,360
Keep you company.

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,639
Mom, I have to leave again.

113
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,920
When?

114
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,439
Tomorrow.

115
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
So suddenly?

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,839
I thought

117
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,959
this time you could stay at home
a bit longer.

118
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,120
Just started in Taiwan, China.

119
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,480
I need to keep an eye.

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,879
How long will you be gone?

121
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't know.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,519
Not sure.

123
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,600
You're doing business,

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,199
but I feel you're like in prison.

125
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,519
You can't even come home.

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
This is a special situation.
I have no choice.

127
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,439
Son.

128
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,639
What era is it now?

129
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,240
Can't tie yourself to one thing.

130
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,000
Listen.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,439
If your business is so tough,

132
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,560
then don't do it.

133
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,199
Just come back.

134
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,920
You can just stay at home.

135
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,000
I just need to make more food every day.

136
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,560
Three parts of fate

137
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
and seven parts of hard work.

138
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,199
How can I just easily quit?

139
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,439
If you want to do it, I'll support you.

140
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,240
Keep it up.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,079
Those who strive will win.

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,319
Alright.

143
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,839
Are you okay by yourself?

144
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,000
Of course, I'm okay.

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
Why am I not okay?

146
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,800
Do you know

147
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,079
that I skipped a few social activities

148
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,000
just to make this meal for you?

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,199
Come on.

150
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,040
Come on.

151
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,959
I need to tell you something.

152
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,199
What is it?

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,319
Do you remember Mr. Wang?

154
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Mr. Wang?

155
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,399
When you were little,

156
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,279
you wet him all over.

157
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,240
What is it? Tell me.

158
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm going to marry him.

159
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,560
Which Mr. Wang?

160
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,199
Why are you overreacting?

161
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:20,759
No.

162
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Which Mr. Wang?

163
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,240
Did you date him? Marriage?

164
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,560
Sit down.

165
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,120
Don't worry.

166
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,439
We've known each other for years.

167
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,519
Of course, we've dated.

168
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,199
Mr. Wang?

169
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm telling you,

170
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,600
he might be plain-looking,

171
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,879
but

172
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,480
he is very nice.

173
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,000
He treats me very well.

174
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
He is also very healthy.

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm telling you...

176
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,519
Alright, healthy.

177
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,040
S-Stop it.

178
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,160
Anyway,

179
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,519
the situation is just like this.

180
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,279
You don't object, do you?

181
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,480
You can't object.

182
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,439
Are you happy?

183
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,279
Yes.

184
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,639
Of course, I'm happy.

185
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,360
This matter

186
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
actually doesn't depend on age.

187
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,399
Anyway, I feel pretty good.

188
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,079
Good to know.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,920
But you're about to leave.

190
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
Seriously.

191
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,199
Otherwise, I'll call him over.

192
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,279
Let's have a simple ceremony

193
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,680
to make it look a bit formal.

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,240
It's fine, you go ahead first.

195
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
When the time comes,

196
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,480
let's do a video call.

197
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,759
That works too.

198
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,920
My son is understanding.

199
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,360
Let's make it clear first.

200
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,279
If you

201
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,039
get a girlfriend,

202
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,720
the kind you want to marry,

203
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,440
you have to tell me.

204
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,279
Do you hear me?

205
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,759
You want to check for me?

206
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,759
Of course.

207
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,399
What do you know?

208
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,759
At least I have more experience.

209
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,919
Actually,

210
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,840
I have a girlfriend.

211
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
Why are you so surprised?

212
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,519
You have a girlfriend?

213
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,360
What kind of girl would like you?

214
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,519
Don't say it yet.

215
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,559
I-I'll cook some dishes.

216
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,879
I'll cook some dishes.

217
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,200
Pour some wine in a while.

218
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,639
You can tell me then.

219
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,240
Oh my God.

220
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,200
My son has a girlfriend.

221
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,480
Oh my God.

222
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,559
How does she look?

223
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,879
Can she cook?

224
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,279
Can she make soup?

225
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,080
Is she tall?

226
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh my God.

227
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,799
Don't know if she eats spicy food.

228
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,279
It's not easy now.

229
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,279
It's really not easy, son.

230
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,919
What did I say?

231
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,480

You were so timid.

235
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,799
Why did you imitate me and stand up?

236
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,120
Can you learn it?

237
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,679
I'm coming for the last time.

238
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,039
I have business and friends now.

239
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm very busy.

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,159
I don't have time for you.

You are right.

242
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,200

(Tainan City, Taiwan, China)

257
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,960
Taixiang.

258
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,960
Don't worry about those people.

259
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,679
The police said

260
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,799
there's no problem with you.

261
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,559
I don't care about that old man.

262
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,440
Who cares about the dead?

263
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,759
I'm thinking about Cai Desheng.

264
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,759
But you're still

265
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,200
in charge of the chemical plant.

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
It shouldn't be too serious.

267
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,919
This is just on the surface.

268
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,039
He has never

269
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,440
given up his suspicion of me.

270
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,720
Let me tell you.

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,559
He is just testing.

272
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
He wants to know

273
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,759
what I will do next.

274
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,799
If you want to prove your innocence,

275
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,679
the most direct way

276
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,559
is to catch the gunman.

277
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,759
Yes.

278
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,720
Once it's proven that the gunman
has nothing to do with me,

279
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,559
Huang Zhixing's lie

280
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,000
will collapse on its own.

281
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,360
Taixiang.

282
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,720
What if it cannot be proven?

283
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,639
What do you mean?

284
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,159
Just discussing.

285
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Let's be cautious.

286
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,799
The gunman is a double-edged sword.

287
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
If not handled well,

288
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,240
it could be unfavorable.

289
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,679
How unfavorable?

290
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,559
I'm not sure.

291
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
But it's possible.

292
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,200
You are just guessing.

293
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,200
I'm telling you.

294
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
This gunman

295
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,320
will show up sooner or later.

296
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
By that time,

297
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
make sure to capture him alive.

298
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,279
Got it.

299
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,639
He.

300
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
Huang Zhixing is in trouble.

301
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,759
His position

302
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,000
is coveted by everyone.

303
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,639
But this time,

304
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,080
if you can achieve great merit,

305
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
this position

306
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,960
is likely yours.

307
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,279
Then I'll just

308
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,879
thank you, Taixiang.

309
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,919
I have a feeling

310
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,759
that this gunman

311
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,279
isn't a stranger.

312
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:42,368
(Lian'an Town)

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,679
Ming, tell us about it.

314
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,759
We are curious.

315
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,519
Tell us.

316
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,799
Alright.

317
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,440
Actually, the process was simple.

318
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,440
One day, she suddenly said

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
she had many more wrinkles.

320
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,840
- Wrinkles.
- Wrinkles.

321
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,759
She said that although we're happy now,

322
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,679
I'll no longer like her in ten years.

323
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,159
I said, "How's that possible?"

324
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,600
- How's that possible?
- Exactly.

325
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,759
But she wouldn't listen.

326
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,159
So I said, let's just...

327
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,519
You just proposed, then.

328
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,320
It was not really a proposal.

329
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
I just said,

330
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,519
"Why not get the marriage certificate?"

331
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,200
Ming, doesn't this count as a proposal?

332
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
Ming, you're so good.

333
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,799
You're quite something.

334
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,679
Better than me in this area.

335
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,559
Tianshuang, you're back.

336
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,328
- Tianshuang, you're back.
- Tianshuang!

337
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,519
Even you are getting married?

338
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,519
Why are you also saying this?

339
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,840
I admire you so much.

340
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,080
Let's drink.

341
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,960
Looking down on me?

342
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,600
No.

343
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,679
Drink. Keep drinking.

344
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,759
What are you doing?

345
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,679
What are you thinking about?

346
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,879
Thinking about you, Xiu.

347
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,360
Why did you suddenly return
to the Chinese mainland?

348
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,200
If I hadn't gone back,
my seafood would have spoiled.

349
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,159
When you and Ming first came,

350
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,639
Ming was still a reckless youth.

351
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,039
In the blink of an eye,

352
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
he's going to get married.

353
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,799
Look at him.

354
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,240
He'll still be a reckless youth.

355
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,559
- Happy wedding.
- Happy wedding.

356
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,159
While you were gone,

357
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,799
a lot happened in the Alliance.

358
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,080
I was planning to

359
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,600
discuss with you when you came back.

360
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,559
Look at this atmosphere.

361
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,519
I'm an outsider now.

362
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,399
Why discuss with me?

363
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,639
Wishful thinking.

364
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,440
Want to distance yourself from me?

365
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
No way.

366
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,679
Xiu.

367
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,519
You can believe in yourself.

368
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,159
You are a good chief

369
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,200
and my good big bro.

370
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,119
Why suddenly say that about me?

371
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,359
What do you mean?

372
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,000
Look, the atmosphere is so nice.

373
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,319
Just tell you about my feelings.

374
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,960
You think I can't do without you?

375
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,119
Of course, you can.

376
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,039
Actually, in the Alliance,

377
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
I'm like icing on the cake.

378
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,960
You're the pillar

379
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,200
of the branch in Lian'an Town.

380
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,519
That's right.

381
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,319
