00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:03,808
(Fix the snitch, not the snitch's story.
Anle, sorry)

4
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,072
(Papaya Milk Parlor)
I'm off to work.

5
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,079
Reluctant to let me go?

6
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,760
You can see me again.

7
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,599
Come back early.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,439
I'm leaving.

9
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,079
Alcohol with breakfast?

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,319
I drank too much last night.

11
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,560
Need some air.

12
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,159
Mr. Luo, Qi and I...

13
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,079
I knew it when she asked me yesterday.

14
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,840
My daughter's temper

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
is like her mom's,

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
and she's stubborn.

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,920
To be honest,

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,799
what happened yesterday

19
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,200
was beyond my expectations.

20
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,519
Since you two are already together,

21
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,479
cherish each other.

22
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,000
Understood?

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,439
The doctor said I'm unwell.

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,159
I won't worry about future matters.

25
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,240
You came over this morning.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,280
Seems like what's coming next
is troublesome, right?

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,120
A bit.

28
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,159
A bit?

29
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,680
If you make my daughter a widow,

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I'll chop off your head
and use it as a chair.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,560
Take this.

32
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,639
(Taji)
What's this?

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
If anything happens later,

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,199
give him a call.

35
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,039
He should be able to help you.

36
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,159
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

37
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,560
Brat.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,879
Spilled the alcohol.

39
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,520
(Huang Zhixing's timeline)
Timeline based

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,599
on Huang Zhixing's moves.

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,560
He should be back in the afternoon.

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,840
The security changes shift at 4 PM.

43
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,199
(Camera damaged)
I hacked the rooftop camera.

44
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,080
There's usually only one guard
at the entrance.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
Take him out, and you're in.

46
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,560
Long, it has to be you.

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,159
Once you're in, I can't help anymore.

48
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,840
You'll have to be on your own then.

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,719
I'm good at that.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
How's it going with the Alliance?

51
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,560
Almost ready.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,319
There's still an unstable factor.

53
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,199
I have to remind you.

54
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,919
What?

55
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,599
Bobo.

56
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,319
If he's around,

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,919
it'll be much more difficult.

58
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,639
Do you know his schedule?

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,479
He's not there in the morning.

60
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,080
It's hard to say after that.

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,039
It would be great if something could
hold him up.

62
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,560
Let a guy in the Alliance step in?

63
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,560
That's too obvious.

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
He'll suspect it.

65
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,199
How to hold him up?

66
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,960
Hello, Taji.

67
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,680
It's all

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,240
set up.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,360
Bobo

70
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,759
won't bother you all day.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,319
It has to be you, Taji.

72
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,319
I must thank you

73
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,560
in person another day.

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,680
No worries.

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,600
Too many people want to thank me.

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
The line is very long.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Since Luo asked me

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,839
to look out for you,

79
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,319
just call me if you need anything.

80
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,519
Alright.

81
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,439
We'll talk again then.

82
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,399
Okay.

83
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,199
Here you are.

84
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
You knew I was coming?

85
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,959
Someone in the Alliance

86
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,120
is still smart enough.

87
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,199
So there's an insider.

88
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,399
Peng, right?

89
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,079
Brought so many men here for me?

90
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,680
Anle.

91
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,559
Seems like I'm quite important to you.

92
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,240
You've even distracted Bobo.

93
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,799
Shouldn't I be cautious?

94
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
Chen Tianshuang, to be honest,

95
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,759
I really want you to work for me.

96
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
I have no choice.

97
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,559
I encountered Five Lakes Alliance first.

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,000
Wrong timing.

99
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,840
Don't worry. I'm not going to kill you.

100
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,519
But

101
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,039
I want everyone to know

102
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,240
the consequences of opposing us.

103
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,960
Wait.

104
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
No rush.

105
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,080
What act do you want to put on?

106
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,840
Anle.

107
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,440
This time I've staked my life.

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,279
Have you ever wondered why?

109
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,039
As the saying goes,

110
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,879
fix the snitch,

111
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,639
not the snitch's story.

112
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,799
If you are gone,

113
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
how can Tianhai Sect

114
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,120
make people in Lian'an Town listen?

115
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,360
I'd like to know

116
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,039
how you're going

117
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,120
to solve me.

118
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,759
Come on.

119
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,919
See if you are faster

120
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,240
or if my gun is faster.

121
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,480
I think it is faster.

122
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,679
Come on.

123
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,519
Come on.

124
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,559
Shoot me.

125
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,480
Come on!

126
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,960
Shoot me!

127
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,120
You're crazy.

128
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,000
To deal with someone like you,

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
I should be crazy.

130
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,399
Come on.

131
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,120
Shoot me.

132
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,279
You want everyone to die with you?

133
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,279
Take a gamble.

134
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
See if I dare.

135
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
You wouldn't dare.

136
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,679
Then have your men shoot me.

137
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,440
Come on!

138
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
Scared, aren't you?

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,960
I have another way.

140
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,799
No one has to die.

141
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,120
Want to hear it?

142
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,879
Come with me.

143
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,159
Threatening me at my place?

144
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,120
Can't I?

145
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,639
Then I'll press it.

146
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,039
Interesting.

147
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,080
Looks like I was faster.

148
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
If you can snatch it,

149
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,120
why bring so many people?

150
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
You're difficult to deal with.

151
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,799
Then I should reward you.

152
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,279
Don't worry.

153
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
I won't take your life.

154
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,960
I'll make you wish you were dead.

155
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
Tianshuang has fallen into Anle's hands.

156
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,960
We must go save him.

157
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,720
Stop fooling around, Ming.

158
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,399
How can we save him?

159
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,320
There must be a way.

160
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,440
It's all over.

161
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
Xiu, what do you say?

162
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,639
Peng is right.

163
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,399
Tianhai Sect just sent me a message.

164
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,279
They want to negotiate with us.

165
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
We have no other choice now.

166
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,080
Does that mean

167
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,000
we just admit defeat like this?

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,039
Then all our previous efforts

169
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,120
are meaningless?

170
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,480
It's not meaningless.

171
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,240
Shuyi.

172
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,440
Do you have any other ideas?

173
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,799
What other ideas could there be?

174
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,559
Actually, the current situation

175
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,279
is also within our expectations.

176
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,159
What do you mean?

177
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,080
This time, when Tianshuang
took a desperate gamble,

178
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,759
he didn't place the bet
on just one side.

179
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,159
As long as Anle feels he's in danger,

180
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,919
we can achieve our goal.

181
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,440
Qi.

182
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,879
The milk isn't ready.

183
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,759
Wait a moment.

184
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,039
It's not the milk.

185
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,679
It's you.

186
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,519
I'm alright.

187
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,600
Why do you keep looking out the window?

188
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,919
Shuang didn't say he would come today.

189
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,840
No, I'm just...

190
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,399
You're free now?

191
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,480
Then check your homework.

192
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
I don't want to.

193
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,679
Returning kindness with enmity.

194
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,120
How is it?

195
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,039
Comfortable?

196
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,559
It's just okay.

197
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,559
Nana is still the best.

198
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,279
Why not let her keep me company?

199
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,279
Unfortunately,

200
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,120
you'll never see her again.

201
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,639
Chen Tianshuang.

202
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,519
Who exactly are you?

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,120
Who am I?

204
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,480
I'm Chen Tianshuang.

205
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,679
Are you silly?

206
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Tell the truth.

207
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,360
Who sent you here?

208
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,120
We can also talk it over.

209
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,720
Very clever.

210
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,919
Anle.

211
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
How do you know I have another identity?

212
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,360
Today, you first acted like you didn't
care about your life.

213
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,120
Later on,

214
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,000
you were subdued so easily.

215
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,559
A strong start with a weak finish.

216
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,600
I was careless.

217
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,360
How about you let me go

218
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,480
and we do it again?

219
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,759
Either you were careless,

220
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,639
or

221
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,960
you did it on purpose.

222
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,720
Since you've figured it out,

223
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,360
I won't hide it from you.

224
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm an undercover agent
of the Intelligence Agency.

225
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,879
Codename,

226
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,399
Earthworm.

227
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,960
Earthworm.

228
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,240
My mission

229
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,400
is to assess you.

230
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,680
Assess what about me?

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,079
It's a secret.

232
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,319
I can't say.

233
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,319
You know it.

234
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,640
You are not Earthworm.

235
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,119
I've met Earthworm.

236
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,599
You've met Earthworm?

237
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,440
I made it up.

238
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,839
No matter who you are,

239
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,160
you might have to stay here for a while.

240
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,559
Have a good rest.

241
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,160
You won't keep me company?

242
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,039
Bro.

243
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,039
We have no grudge against each other.

244
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,839
How about letting it go?

245
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,759
Giving yourself a break, huh?

246
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,079
Come on!

247
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,119
Beat me up!

248
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:50,399
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

249
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:53,854
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

250
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,046
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

251
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:04,418
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
