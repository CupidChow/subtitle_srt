=Episode 16=

3
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:03,744
(Lin Pinghe issued a Feast of Peril invitation.
Be careful tonight.)

4
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,312
(Ming)

5
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,959
Baby,

6
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,280
what took you so long?

7
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,200
Don't you like following me?

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,359
Then stay here all night.

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,640
No, don't.

10
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,239
Let me go.

11
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,040
Every moment of night is priceless.

12
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,680
Let me perform well.

13
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,599
Is it okay?

14
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,159
It's late at night.

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
I hate noise the most.

16
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,840
I'll go take a shower first.

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
Wait for me, okay?

18
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,159
Okay.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,840
Peng,

20
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,319
what happened?

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,240
Lin Pinghe just assumed office.

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,159
Black Lotus invited us to attend

23
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,639
their annual gathering.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,439
The Black Lotus Gang

25
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,400
invites us?

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,479
Do we go every year?

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
Of course not.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,360
But he said Xiu would attend.

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
He also said

30
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,800
an important decision will be announced.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,840
Xiu is in the hands
of the Black Lotus Gang.

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,080
Is Tianshuang there too?

33
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,680
I don't know
the exact situation, either.

34
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,479
But judging from this,

35
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,840
this must be a Feast of Peril.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,159
Then we have to go.

37
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,039
That's right.

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,479
So, get a good rest tonight

39
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,759
and you can go all out.

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Childish.

41
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,759
He,

42
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,599
the Five Lakes Alliance replied,

43
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,520
saying that

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,479
they will attend.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
My dad has been at odds
with Five Lakes Alliance

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,120
for so many years.

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,039
But starting today,

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,919
at Lian'an Town,

49
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,159
only one gang will have the final say.

50
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,919
But even if Xiu is in our hands,

51
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,680
they wouldn't

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,159
follow whatever he says.

53
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,759
I... I'm afraid
there might be trouble tomorrow.

54
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,439
Afraid of trouble?

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,439
You're wrong.

56
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,560
What I want is exactly to cause trouble.

57
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,439
He,

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
you're not planning to...

59
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,120
Those members of the Five Lakes Alliance

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,159
won't cooperate.

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,560
In that case,

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,039
I'll send them all away.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,400
He,

64
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,039
you will have no way back.

65
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,719
I've had no way back for a long time.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,759
How did my dad die?

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,360
At the funeral,

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,720
how did I survive?

69
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,439
Only being more ruthless

70
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,879
can you survive.

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,400
No,

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,959
it wasn't like that.

73
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,439
You survived,

74
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,079
because I saved you.

75
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,720
I saved you

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,360
because you are my brother

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
not that you were ruthless.

78
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
He,

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
I will ask you one last time.

80
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,439
Do you really want to go down
this path of no return?

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,079
I have no choice.

82
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,719
No, no, no.

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,839
Are you scared?

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Baby.

85
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,319
Knife? Seriously?

86
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,240
What if you miss?

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,399
Then you can dodge.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,079
How can I dodge with my eyes covered?

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,000
Didn't you say

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,439
that whatever I do, you'd like it?

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
I do like it.

92
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,279
But you're tying me up
and throwing knives.

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,720
Can't we switch to

94
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,360
something gentle?

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,399
I promised Lin Pinghe

96
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,759
that I would give you to him tomorrow.

97
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,079
So how can we not enjoy ourselves?

98
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,079
What?

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
No!

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,759
I'm still waiting for you
to explore me more.

101
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,560
It'd be a shame if you stop here?

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,600
Right, baby?

103
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,120
Let's change to something else?

104
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,359
Okay,

105
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,360
let's have a change.

106
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,239
I'll do as you say.

107
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,879
What is this thing?

108
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,839
It's pink, so cute.

109
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,399
How to use it?

110
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,040
What exactly is this?

111
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Don't go to the back.

112
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,439
Come to the front.

113
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,040
What are you doing?

114
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,720
Feel its vibration.

115
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,040
Relax

116
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
to really enjoy it.

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,759
What is this?

118
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,199
Is it a fascia gun?

119
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,439
So nice.

120
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,600
It doesn't work over there.

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,240
Not there.

122
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,080
Well...

123
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,399
I've brought them here.

124
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,799
Don't forget

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,079
what you've promised me.

126
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,560
Long time no see.

127
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Mr. Lin.

128
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,240
Just saying hello to you.

129
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,000
When I finish my work,

130
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,879
I'll entertain you properly.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,399
Later,

132
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,720
you should know what to say, right?

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,400
I know.

134
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,120
Actually, I'm very curious

135
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,000
if your men

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,399
find out you plan to surrender,

137
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,720
what would their reaction be?

138
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Enough.

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
Angry?

140
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't reveal your hand too soon,

141
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,679
or you may regret it.

142
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Baby.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Goodbye.

144
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,559
You made me very happy yesterday.

145
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,719
Good boy.

146
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,559
What does she mean?

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,720
You've been having a lot of fun?

148
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,999
No.

149
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,360
Why are you squatting?

150
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,320
Why don't you sit?

151
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,759
I do want to.

152
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,479
Hui.

153
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,879
Mr. Lin.

154
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,960
Five Lakes haven't arrived?

155
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,039
I just called them.

156
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,879
They're almost here.

157
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
Tell our men to get ready.

158
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
Okay.

159
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Xiu,

160
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,279
what did Ms. Jia mean just now?

161
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,600
It didn't mean anything.

162
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm just pretending to join them

163
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,960
and betray the Five Lakes Alliance.

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,919
Pretending?

165
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,840
Of course.

166
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,320
Do you think I'd really betray our men?

167
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,559
I didn't mean that.

168
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,519
Do they have any leverage

169
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,600
over you?

170
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,120
What?

171
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,159
Didn't I tell you?

172
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,080
Just that thing between Ms. Jia and me.

173
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm not talking about that.

174
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,599
Which one then?

175
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,080
Are you hiding something from us?

176
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,679
Why would I hide anything from you?

177
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,519
I don't understand...

178
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,240
Alright.

179
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
I trust you, Xiu.

180
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,639
The most important thing now is

181
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,799
we must find a way to get out.

182
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,080
He, all set.

183
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,120
Who are you?

184
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,160
Bobo

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
from Tianhai Sect.

186
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,320
Don't be nervous.

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
I have no malice towards you.

188
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,519
At least not today.

189
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,840
We are here to meet
the Black Lotus Gang's invitation.

190
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,080
And you, Tianhai Sect, are interfering.

191
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
What do you mean?

192
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,440
Black Lotus Gang?

193
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,200
Where's the Black Lotus Gang?

194
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
It's here.

195
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,559
Is that so?

196
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
Who is he?

197
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,119
Don't move.

198
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
Sit down.

199
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,279
I said sit down.

200
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,279
What's going on?

201
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,119
Yes.

202
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,519
Alright, you can go now.

203
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,720
The Black Lotus Gang is gone now.

204
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,679
But our Chief

205
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,240
might still be inside.

206
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,960
If he's lucky,

207
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,120
he should be able to escape.

208
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,759
Peng.

209
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,840
Don't be impulsive.

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,559
If you go in now,

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,440
the people inside
can't tell who you are.

212
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,320
Just go.

213
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,160
Let's go.

214
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,039
Put the guns down.

215
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,519
Right.

216
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,560
Let's go.

217
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,280
Hui.

218
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,960
Hui.

219
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
He.

220
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:09,719
Sheng.

221
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,639
Run!

222
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,120
I told you to sit down.

223
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,879
It's all blown up outside.

224
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,639
Why are you still here? Run!

225
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,840
Sit down, you hear me?

226
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
Run!

227
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,519
No, no, no.

228
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,679
Mouth, mouth.

229
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,639
Quickly.

230
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
Don't move.

231
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,240
How is it?

232
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,920
Going smoothly?

233
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Perfect.

234
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,000
All thanks to your men

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,360
setting up the explosives,

236
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,240
saving me a lot of trouble.

237
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,320
Thanks.

238
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,159
Being able to cooperate
with Tianhai Sect

239
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,840
is my honor.

240
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,879
You've been working
with the Black Lotus for long.

241
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,679
To be honest,

242
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,919
you betraying them,

243
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,120
it's quite ruthless.

244
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,519
Will you also...

245
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm just worried.

246
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,279
I am

247
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,960
only driven by profits.

248
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,559
I run transport lines

249
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,399
primarily in order to

250
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,480
forge connections
with the Intelligence Agency.

251
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,399
Then why shouldn't I work

252
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,200
with Tianhai Sect, which is the closest?

253
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,360
To be honest,

254
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,559
when you contacted me,

255
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,519
I was very surprised.

256
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,600
I thought

257
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,639
you killed Lin Yongning

258
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,759
to establish authority.

259
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,480
But I didn't expect

260
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,480
you were businesspeople
behind the scenes.

261
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,759
As long as the price is higher,

262
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
you would even give up
building the chemical plant.

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,519
Who said that?

264
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,919
What do you mean?

265
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,639
Let go!

266
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,360
Let go of me.

267
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,159
The more one walks the night path,

268
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
the more likely one will meet ghosts.

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,039
We still have to thank you

270
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,440
for letting us handle them so easily.

271
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,000
Besides doing business,

272
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,920
I also know a critical secret.

273
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,200
When you deal with
the Five Lakes Alliance,

274
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,240
you will find it useful.

275
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,799
Speak.

276
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,920
Take me to see Anle.

277
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,960
Only in front of him

278
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,480
will I speak.

279
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:44,829
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

280
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:48,352
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

281
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:52,417
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

282
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:58,756
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
