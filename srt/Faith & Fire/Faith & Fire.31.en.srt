00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:58,752
=Episode 31=

3
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:03,952
(Seduction and bribery,
Anle's tricks are quite varied)

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,879
How is Luo doing?

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
Not awake yet.

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,840
Tianshuang.

7
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,000
Just you and me.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,200
Be honest with me.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,359
What are you planning to do next?

10
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,439
Fight them to the end.

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,879
That's not like you.

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,799
Peng said the same.

13
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,239
Why?

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,159
Lin Pinghe has a grudge against them.

15
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,200
But you came to this Town

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,400
not long ago.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,560
Yeah.

18
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm a businessman from Chinese mainland.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,319
What's the point of the struggle?

20
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,319
Why bother?

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,959
But I think we won't necessarily lose.

22
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,599
Although they are powerful,

23
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,000
we have

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
the most crucial thing.

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,000
What is it?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,959
People's support.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Are you serious?

28
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,879
Nice to meet you two again.

29
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,640
What are you doing here?

30
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,200
Luo is my senior.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,640
I came to visit him.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,239
If it hadn't been for you,

33
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,760
Luo wouldn't have been here.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm regretful, too.

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,560
But if peace could come here soon,

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,120
such things

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,039
would happen much less.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,240
At this point,

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,719
you're still being sarcastic?

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,479
It takes two to tango.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,879
What do you think, Tianshuang?

42
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,560
Xiu, Tianshuang.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,599
My dad is awake.

44
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,039
He is Huang Zhixing?

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,400
Ming!

46
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,599
Don't move.

47
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,599
It might break.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,759
Bobo.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,000
Xiu.

50
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,439
Take Ming away first.

51
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,240
What about you?

52
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,560
They're here to visit a patient.

53
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,960
They won't do anything to me.

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,719
Since I'm not welcome,

55
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,240
I won't ask for trouble.

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Bobo.

57
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,599
Can you help me check on Luo?

58
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,599
Just go.

59
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,439
Since we have to wait,

60
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,719
why not take a walk with me?

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,599
Okay.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,879
It seems the first time

63
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,159
we are alone like this.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Cut to the chase.

65
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,960
Okay.

66
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,800
I like you, Chen Tianshuang.

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,199
Putting aside our positions,

68
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,800
we might actually become friends.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,800
Sure.

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,639
Then stop with the chemical plant.

71
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,240
Take Tianhai Sect and head back.

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,639
I'll immediately accept
your friend request.

73
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,400
Many people get terribly afraid
when they

74
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
hear "chemical plant".

75
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,439
But they don't know

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,439
that many things they use regularly

77
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,879
also come from chemical plants.

78
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,920
One shouldn't easily dismiss

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,240
things they don't understand.

80
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,720
I also understand one thing.

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,680
One shouldn't easily believe

82
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
things they don't understand.

83
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
If the chemical plant

84
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,879
is as safe as you say,

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
why doesn't the government
take the lead,

86
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,680
but leave it to Tianhai Sect,

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,480
a company with a special background?

88
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,519
Looks like what happened these days

89
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,120
can't change your attitude.

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,319
I'm not that easy to fool.

91
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,319
Will it benefit you if you oppose us?

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
What's going on today?

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,800
Everyone is asking me this question.

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,439
Because everyone knows

95
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,519
this is a thankless task.

96
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,720
Moreover, you are an outsider.

97
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,920
We're all Chinese,

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
so how am I the outsider?

99
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,639
Do you know what happened to He Jiahao?

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
I heard he died.

101
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,079
You had someone do it?

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,759
Yes, I did.

103
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,279
He Jiahao.

104
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,600
Lin Yongning.

105
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,720
Ms. Jia.

106
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,920
They all thought they were special.

107
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,279
But in my eyes,

108
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,199
they were all the same.

109
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,560
Their fate was not in their own hands.

110
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
You are quite pretentious.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,639
You take yourself quite seriously.

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,399
You are like that, actually,
Chen Tianshuang.

113
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,839
I don't think so.

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Really?

115
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
How about now?

116
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,040
You're bluffing.

117
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,920
You are a smart person.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
Smart people have an advantage.

119
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,560
They don't do stupid things.

120
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,920
In broad daylight,

121
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,920
you'll shoot me?

122
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,839
I don't believe it.

123
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,000
You are right.

124
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,959
If I shoot now,

125
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,759
it will cause me trouble.

126
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,160
But letting you live

127
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,439
might give more trouble.

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,519
You are bragging.

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,360
Chen Tianshuang.

130
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,120
Don't take yourself too seriously.

131
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,439
How long you can live

132
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,720
depends on my mood.

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
See you another day.

134
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,460
(Radio)

135
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:40,576
(Loyalty)

136
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,960
Tianshuang.

137
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
Get up.

138
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,120
Hurry.

139
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,519
What's up?

140
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,879
Weren't you at the hospital?

141
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,960
Yes, I just got back

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,799
and saw Tianhai Sect

143
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,919
blocking the entrance.

144
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,879
What's going on?

145
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,879
No idea.

146
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,000
They asked for you.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,840
Said you're not free.

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
He said he'll wait.

149
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,480
Let's go.

150
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,399
Get in.

151
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,360
Where to?

152
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,120
Anle said

153
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,799
you made quite an impression yesterday

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,960
and wanted a chat.

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,720
What do you say?

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,159
Only a fool would fall for it.

157
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,519
We're not going.

158
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,120
Short-tempered.

159
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,639
Didn't scare you, right?

160
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,960
He's a big shot.

161
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,360
If he takes me away in front of you

162
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
and won't let me return,

163
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,159
he'll be embarrassed.

164
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,679
Right?

165
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,720
Let's go.

166
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,799
Tianshuang.

167
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,840
Thanks.

168
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,559
- Bobo.
- Bobo.

169
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,759
Bobo.

170
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,279
Wait here.

171
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Someone will come get you.

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
Cell phone.

173
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,559
Remember to give it back.

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,519
Mr. Chen.

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,240
I'll serve you today.

176
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,840
You can call me Nana.

177
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
Where's Anle?

178
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,440
After I've taken care of you,

179
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,639
you'll meet him.

180
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,080
Again?

181
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,559
Mr. Chen.

182
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,919
Is the temperature okay?

183
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
Quite comfortable.

184
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Don't stay too long.

185
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
You might get heatstroke.

186
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,440
You can drink this if you're thirsty.

187
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,240
It's chilled.

188
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,080
Okay.

189
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,840
Thanks.

190
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,960
I want to drink it now.

191
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,720
Mr. Chen.

192
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm coming up.

193
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,240
Alright.

194
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,360
Mr. Chen.

195
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,080
Is this pressure okay?

196
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,840
Okay.

197
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,360
It tickles.

198
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,519
Mr. Chen, your kidneys aren't good,
right?

199
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,159
Kidneys?

200
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,240
Kidneys.

201
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,159
My best part is my kidneys.

202
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,080
What technique is this?

203
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,360
Ant climbing a tree?

204
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,200
Sir, you're a bit tense.

205
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,440
Relax.

206
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,879
Mr. Chen.

207
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,919
Mr. Chen.

208
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,000
You can turn around now.

209
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Mr. Chen.

210
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,320
Mr. Chen.

211
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,639
Feel comfortable?

212
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,359
Mr. Chen.

213
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,880
Our boss is waiting for you.

214
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,000
How long did I sleep?

215
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,920
About an hour.

216
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,559
You must be too tired.

217
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,319
Who's your boss?

218
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,680
Anle.

219
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:34,281
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

220
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:37,656
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

221
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,693
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

222
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:48,032
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
