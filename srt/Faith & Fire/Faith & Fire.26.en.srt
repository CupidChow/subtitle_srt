30
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,759
But I ate it.

31
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,159
Too many popsicles

32
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,960

What happened today

82
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,120
was my fault.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,079
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,879
So you know why

85
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,160
I didn't let Ming join the gangs.

86
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,199
I thought

87
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,920
you were just worried about Ming.

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,760

Are you going to continue like this?

98
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,600
Alright, I get it.

99
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,720

right?

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,520

Luo.

210
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,000
What's going on with her?

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
How would I know?

212
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,279
You're acting strange, too.

213
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
Go cheer up your sister.

214
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
Qi.

215
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,639
Are you okay?

216
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
I'm fine, what's wrong?

217
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,200
Tianshuang

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,919
might seem

219
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,440
shameless and lecherous.

220
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
But actually,

221
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,200
he is a good person.

222
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,919
Besides,

223
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,240
you've known him for so long.

224
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,360
Isn't it just fine?

225
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,279
He suddenly said that.

226
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,559
It must not be his true feelings.

227
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,600
He must have his difficulties.

228
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,200
Qi.

229
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Are you okay?

230
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,840
It's okay. I'll be fine.

231
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,719
I know.

232
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,480
What he said may not be true.

233
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
Yeah.

234
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
Then why don't you talk to him?

235
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,679
If it were usual times,

236
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
I definitely wouldn't get over it.

237
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,840
I would definitely make him
explain it clearly.

238
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,039
But this time he looked so serious.

239
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,320
I could tell he had thought about it
for a long time.

240
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,840
You know, he might joke

241
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,559
about small matters,

242
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,080
but never

243
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,399
about serious matters.

244
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,679
So no matter what it is,

245
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,080
he must have his reasons.

246
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,879
But

247
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,600
I still feel a bit sad.

248
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,039
Alright.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
It's fine.

250
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,919
It's fine.

251
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,399
I'm your sister.

252
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll be fine in a while.

253
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
Don't worry.

254
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,440
I won't tell anyone

255
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,679
about you shedding tears.

256
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,279
I didn't.

257
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,200
Don't talk nonsense.

258
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,159
Wait for dinner.

259
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,399
Alright.

260
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,200
You hug behind my back.

261
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,879
Not at all.

262
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,840
We didn't.

263
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,360
Hui knows how to be jealous.

264
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,720
(Papaya Milk Parlor)
Like me the most?

265
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,559
Or do you like me the most?

266
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,279
I like you both.

267
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:50,272
(Lian'an Town)

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
Ming?

269
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,519
What are you doing?

270
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,359
Waiting for you.

271
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:57,999
Waiting for me?

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,120
Leaving so soon?

273
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,360
Yeah.

274
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
Shuyi promised me.

275
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,679
I need to find her to fulfill it.

276
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,039
So you and she are for real?

277
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,960
Then why did you say that to my sister?

278
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,960
What do you think?

279
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
This time it was Hui.

280
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,479
What about next time?

281
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
I understand that.

282
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
But is this really the only way?

283
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,200
Rip the band-aid off quickly.

284
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,599
I think

285
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
this is good for both of us.

286
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,600
Have you ever thought

287
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,080
this isn't what she wants?

288
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,919
Just consider me willful.

289
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,680
Tianshuang.

290
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,240
Will I

291
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,519
become like you someday?

292
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,879
You won't.

293
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,919
How do you know?

294
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,440
Because you have me.

295
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,320
Tianshuang.

296
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,120
I will protect you.

297
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,240
Alright.

298
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,159
Don't be so cheesy.

299
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,720
Go back.

300
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,560
I'm leaving.

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
Shuyi.

302
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,879
What's wrong?

303
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,960
Dad has passed away.

304
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,960
My condolences, Shuyi.

305
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:10,879
However,

306
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,480
before Mi passed away,

307
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
he could see you become the head.

308
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,279
He could rest

309
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,200
in peace then.

310
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,600
He didn't die of illness.

311
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,440
