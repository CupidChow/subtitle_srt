=Faith & Fire=

2
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:58,692
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:03,668
(Shameless and fake-hearted...
being in a gang is way tougher than selling fish)

4
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
Xiu,

5
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,920
this police officer friend of yours

6
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,760
won't

7
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,000
arrest us all together, right?

8
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,480
Did you break the law?

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,359
No, not really.

10
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,400
What are you afraid of?

11
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,519
After all, we are a gang.

12
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
Being with a police officer

13
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,920
feels a bit...

14
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,200
Not used to it?

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Tell me.

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,359
We don't get along with the Black Lotus,

17
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,879
we don't rely on the Tianhai Sect,

18
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,519
but we deal with Ms. Jia. Why is that?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,599
For Lian'an Town?

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,159
What do the police work for?

21
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,680
For Lian'an Town.

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,920
Yes.

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,959
So,

24
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,920
whether it's the police

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,879
or a gang,

26
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,000
you shouldn't care too much
about their identity.

27
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,400
You need to see the essence
through the phenomenon.

28
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,719
As long as there is a common desire,

29
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,000
we are family

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
and share the same destiny.

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,319
Do you remember?

32
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,560
You make a lot of sense.

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Listening to your words

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,800
feels like today wasn't wasted.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,919
Flatterer.

36
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,319
I'm ready.

37
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,280
Let's go.

38
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,800
Well,

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,639
how do I look?

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,800
It's alright.

41
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,560
Too, too, too...

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,479
Yeah!

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
Don't get arrested

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,360
by your own colleagues.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
I'll wait here for you.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
Contact me if there's any situation.

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,520
Be careful.

48
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,960
Understood.

49
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,080
Got it.

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,759
Let's go.

51
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,439
Is it here?

52
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Why is no one here?

53
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,560
It's not time yet.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,280
Just wait.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
Ms. Jia,

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
I've arrived.

57
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,919
Where are you?

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
It's 10:30.

59
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,000
They should be here soon.

60
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:40,576
(Ms. Jia)

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,759
No need to call.

62
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,680
They won't come.

63
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,839
Xiu,

64
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,439
did Ms. Jia

65
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,959
trick us from the start?

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,439
Or today

67
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
we slipped up?

68
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,959
What do you think?

69
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,759
Ms. Jia's call.

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,959
Pick it up.

71
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,519
Baby,

72
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,839
what are you doing?

73
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,600
I've waited for you all night.

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,720
I didn't sleep all night.

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,680
Where did you go?

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,920
Me?

77
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm on Baiwei Road now.

78
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,000
Where are you?

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,920
Get off the car.

80
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,879
You missed me, didn't you?

81
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,439
I missed you so much.

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,959
You brought so many friends here,

83
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,279
which really lets down my genuine heart.

84
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,439
Didn't you also bring new friends?

85
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
It's a pity they're gone.

86
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,800
When did you figure it out?

87
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,519
To be honest,

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,399
your acting is really good.

89
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,759
But similar tricks,

90
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,319
I've seen them once before.

91
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,240
From that old friend you mentioned?

92
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,399
The Chief, right?

93
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,560
I knew it.

94
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,839
Oh, you.

95
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,879
Traitor.

96
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,720
Traitor?

97
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,600
You know each other?

98
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,600
It's all blocked. We can't get out.

99
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
What to do, Xiu?

100
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
Xiu, I really admire you.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,560
Still combing your hair?

102
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,199
So be it.

103
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,360
What are you panicking about?

104
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,079
We were caught by the Black Lotus Gang.

105
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,759
You don't know how much
Lin Pinghe hates me.

106
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,160
He has a grudge against you.

107
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,439
Besides,

108
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,720
his real enemy is Tianhai Sect.

109
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
We won't be in life-threatening danger.

110
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,240
Even so,

111
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,839
he can torture us.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,600
It's okay.

113
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,680
He's not against me.

114
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,759
I was too arrogant before.

115
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,199
Don't worry.

116
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,519
Listen,

117
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,800
I am the Chief.

118
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,079
After catching me,

119
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,480
they must've got news by now.

120
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,319
By then,

121
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,279
it'll be more than just a problem here.

122
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,560
What do you mean?

123
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,960
Don't forget
that we are the Five Lakes Alliance.

124
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
Not the Lian'an Gang.

125
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,840
The thing you've seen,
there's much more to it.

126
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Much more?

127
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,960
Xiu,

128
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't quite understand something.

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
Our Five Lakes Alliance

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,559
is considered a big gang, right?

131
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,840
Well,

132
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
many matters in Lian'an Town

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,039
are all decided by you.

134
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,879
I haven't seen anyone else interfering.

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,000
You just came from the mainland.

136
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,519
Although there are many gangs
in Taiwan, China,

137
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,080
they are divided into several types.

138
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,759
Black Lotus Gang

139
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,519
is actually

140
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,759
a local boss.

141
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,519
Five Lakes Alliance is different.

142
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
Nominally, it's an organization.

143
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,879
But in reality,

144
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
It's a union of local gang bosses.

145
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,600
Back then, each of local bosses

146
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,879
had their own territory.

147
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,799
Later they became very close

148
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,360
and formed the alliance.

149
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,159
Sounds like a tribe.

150
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,840
Kind of.

151
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,000
Our branch usually

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,720
has its own way.

153
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,759
Only when facing a big problem,

154
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,000
will everyone gather together
to discuss and deliberate.

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,720
A big problem?

156
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:42,879
For example...

157
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
The Chief is caught?

158
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,120
That's right.

159
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,159
Great.

160
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,919
Xiu, thanks to you,

161
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,159
I won't be in life-threatening danger.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,399
What about Tianhai Sect?

163
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,919
Aren't they the largest gang
in Taiwan, China?

164
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,559
Tianhai Sect,
compared to traditional gangs,

165
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,519
is actually more like a company.

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,120
Because they have dealings

167
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,240
with various sectors,

168
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,960
forming their own network of resources.

169
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,519
Their leader is called Zheng Taixiang.

170
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,879
Nominally he is the leader,

171
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,840
but in reality,

172
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,519
he is like the chairman of Tianhai Sect.

173
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,679
And the Chief Protector
is equivalent to the general manager.

174
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,799
Yes.

175
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,919
The difference between
them and ordinary companies

176
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,720
lies in that

177
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,159
they have other ways to solve problems

178
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,720
that can't be solved by normal means.

179
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,600
I think they seem

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
more aligned with current trends.

181
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,879
We are a bit outdated.

182
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,279
How about I give you Bobo's
contact information.

183
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,159
You can join him.

184
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,600
I still prefer to be with you.

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
We're in this together now, aren't we?

186
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,519
Xiu,

187
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,120
I heard Ms. Jia calling you
a traitor, right?

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,799
Really?

189
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,639
Yes.

190
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,440
I heard it.

191
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,480
You know each other?

192
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:03,879
Well,

193
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,080
we've dealt with each other.

194
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,559
It was a long time ago.

195
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,039
"Traitor"

196
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,279
is your nickname?

197
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,200
It's all youthful entanglements.

198
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,519
Entanglement?

199
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,080
Your ex-girlfriend?

200
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,440
Don't ask for details.

201
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,840
She won't admit it.

202
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,600
When I was young,

203
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,879
I was too dashing.

204
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,720
It's all about grudges.

205
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,399
Listen.

206
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,600
Don't be fooled
by my thorough analysis just now.

207
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,000
Once there's an opportunity,

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,679
we must find a way to get out.

209
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,000
It's good if one of us

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,320
can escape and report the news.

211
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,279
My act has been exposed.

212
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,600
How will I continue?

213
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,519
Baby,

214
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,519
you finally came.

215
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,159
I thought you didn't want me.

216
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,000
What are you up to again?

217
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,759
I was wrong.

218
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,799
I was really wrong.

219
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,080
I'll do better next time.

220
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,399
I've been thinking these past few hours.

221
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,759
I've figured it out.

222
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,879
Five Lakes Alliance?

223
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,399
Even the Chief has been captured.

224
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,000
It has no future.

225
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,279
Baby,

226
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,480
let me join you, okay?

227
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,679
Your dangerous yet charming demeanor

228
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,080
makes me unable to extricate myself.

229
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,840
From now on,

230
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,879
I am yours.

231
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,639
I will do whatever you ask me to do

232
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,720
without a second thought.

233
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,879
Are you done talking?

234
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Yes.

235
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,080
Baby,

236
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,919
I love you so much.

237
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,519
What I just said doesn't even reach
one percent of what's in my heart.

238
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,399
Do you love me that much?

239
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,600
I love you so much.

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,799
Okay,

241
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,320
come back with me.

242
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,200
Tie his hands!

243
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
Do it.

244
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,240
Right now.

245
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,279
I just like being bound by you.

246
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
It makes me feel like you care about me.

247
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,360
Let me tell you.

248
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,279
After coming back,

249
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,120
you must listen to me.

250
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,159
If you make me unhappy,

251
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,840
in this lifetime,

252
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,720
don't even think about
peeing standing up.

253
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,360
Go.

254
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,360
I'll be waiting.

255
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,480
Be gentle.

256
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,799
The boss is waiting.

257
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,240
I'll meet her later.

258
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,759
It's a bit painful.

259
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,240
Traitor.

260
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,720
You wouldn't do business
with me back then.

261
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Now,

262
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
no matter what price I offer,

263
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,440
you cannot refuse.

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,639
The secrets behind you,

265
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
you don't want your men to know, right?

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,440
What...

267
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,240
What do you want?

268
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,759
I want you to fully cooperate.

269
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,720
No.

270
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,519
I want you to obey me.

271
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,960
I want you to announce

272
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,559
that you're joining Black Lotus.

273
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,120
Isn't that obvious

274
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,519
I'm being coerced by you?

275
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,840
So what?

276
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,559
I want them to obey.

277
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,440
They're not stupid.

278
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,519
It's impossible that

279
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,919
they'll just listen to me.

280
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,200
Then you'll have to think of a way.

281
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,440
Or do you want them to know

282
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,720
what you've done before?

283
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,919
Do you really think

284
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,200
if no one mentions the past,

285
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,159
it'll go away easily?

286
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,279
He agreed?

287
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,559
Yes.

288
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,240
The day after tomorrow,

289
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,600
at your Black Lotus Gang's
annual gathering,

290
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,519
he will publicly announce
he's joining you.

291
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,039
However, this is all he can do.

292
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,639
As for what others think afterward...

293
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,519
Leave it to me.

294
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,679
Chen Tianshuang is in your car, right?

295
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,919
My toy,

296
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,960
of course, is in my car.

297
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,919
His life is mine.

298
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,080
Don't look at me like that.

299
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,000
Think about it.

300
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,720
Without me, can you avenge this grudge?

301
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,679
When you are tired of playing,

302
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,279
hand him over to me.

303
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,720
You'd better think about

304
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,960
the things in front of you.

305
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,920
Hello.

306
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,319
Now everything

307
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,119
is ready.

308
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:25,573
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

309
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:29,017
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

310
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:33,285
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

311
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:39,489
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
