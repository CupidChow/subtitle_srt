=Episode 18=

3
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:03,754
(Chief Xu saw through my guilt.
Could it really not be my fault?)

4
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,439
You go take a rest.

5
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,959
I'll watch over here.

6
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Tianshuang,

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
have a bite.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't blame yourself.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,359
The doctor said

10
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,239
you brought him in time.

11
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,599
He is not life-threatening.

12
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,439
It's just unknown when he will wake up.

13
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,599
Tianhai Sect?

14
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,439
They think no one
dares to mess with them?

15
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:13,840
I'll go...

16
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,360
Ming!

17
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,039
Don't be impulsive.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,840
Tianshuang,

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
you were just silent.

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,199
I was worried
you might have mental issues.

21
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,439
There's no conclusion

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,439
about who did it.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
The Black Lotus Gang is gone.

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,479
It must be Tianhai Sect.

25
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,560
Do you have evidence?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,599
Even if so,

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
what can you do?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,159
Kill the head?

29
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,560
Or blow up Tianhai Sect?

30
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,240
I will find out

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,879
who did it.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,560
You mustn't act impulsively.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,039
You are a member of Five Lakes Alliance.

34
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
If there is anything,

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
discuss with everyone first.

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Did you hear that?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,199
I see.

38
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,479
You're right.

39
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,800
I should grab some food.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,159
This score

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,120
will be settled.

42
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,319
You stay here.

43
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,360
This was found on site.

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,399
I thought I hit him.

45
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,759
But this pendant saved him.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,759
Go where?

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,160
I'll go take a look

48
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,959
if there are any other clues.

49
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,519
You've been searching all night.

50
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,399
What if?

51
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,839
You should have a good sleep now.

52
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,759
I'm not tired.

53
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,920
That wasn't a request.

54
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,040
Never mind.

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,680
No.

56
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,759
Don't worry about it.

57
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,639
Tianshuang,

58
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,839
you can't act emotionally now.

59
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,519
I'm being emotional?

60
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,240
Right now, Xiu is lying in the hospital.

61
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,759
Might never wake up.

62
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Do you know why?

63
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,399
It was an attack.

64
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,319
He got shot. You...

65
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,399
Because of me!

66
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,319
Tianshuang,

67
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,240
it's already happened.

68
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,519
Calm down.

69
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,720
I can't calm down.

70
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,439
I was never worth saving.

71
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,560
Why?

72
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,800
Tell me why.

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
Why is it always me?

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,959
My oversight, my crime,

75
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,759
but they suffer?

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,199
Why not me?

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,199
Come for me!

78
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,759
I don't even know!

79
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,519
Long, I'm sorry.

80
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,279
It's okay.

81
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,279
It's okay.

82
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,920
I was excited.

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,399
Sorry.

84
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,000
It's okay.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,839
Tianshuang,

86
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,160
you really need to take a break.

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,399
I can't.

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,519
I can't rest.

89
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,639
I have to find the killer.

90
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,199
Long, don't worry.

91
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,720
I won't be found out.

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
It's reasonable for me
to investigate it.

93
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm not afraid you'll be exposed.

94
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm worried about you.

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
As your contact,

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,439
the mission matters,

97
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,480
but you matter more.

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,439
Totally no need!

99
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,079
Tianshuang,

100
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,600
the heart declares things finished

101
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,959
that the soul remembers.

102
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,279
Our scars aren't weakness.

103
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,959
Unless we face this,

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,759
it'll be too late.

105
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,199
I'm fine.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,920
Listen up.

107
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,240
I'll arrange it.

108
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,839
You go meet Chief Xu.

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
I have nothing to discuss with him.

110
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,480
Maybe he does.

111
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,920
About your situation,

112
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Long has told me.

113
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,000
He exaggerated.

114
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,360
It's not that serious.

115
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,399
(Min Dong Shan Jiao 5001)
I was a bit emotional.

116
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,120
I haven't done it for two years.

117
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,959
I'm somewhat of an outsider.

118
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,240
Please understand.

119
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,000
By your logic,

120
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,240
this meltdown

121
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,519
was a fluke?

122
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,840
Baby fluke.

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,799
Even the finest actors

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
must exit character

125
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,519
occasionally.

126
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,919
It's normal.

127
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,200
That's good.

128
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,279
Is it over?

129
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,759
Yes.

130
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,960
There's nothing else?

131
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,039
T-Then I'll...

132
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I'll leave.

133
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't rush.

134
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,639
This boat will take a while to go back.

135
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Long time no see.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,120
Let's just chat casually.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
About what?

138
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,720
Last time, it was too rushed.

139
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
So we only talked about tasks.

140
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
Tell me.

141
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,639
These two years,

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,360
how have you been?

143
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,480
Pretty great.

144
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
I've got the brains for anything.

145
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,799
Doing well in business?

146
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,759
I got into the industry late.

147
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,120
If only I'd started it sooner,

148
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
I'd be ruling the fish market today!

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,799
So,

150
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,559
I held you back.

151
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,600
Of course!

152
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,000
Forget the rest.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,039
You can ask Long

154
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,759
how I am doing in Lian'an Town.

155
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,200
Missions aside,

156
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
I'm the storm

157
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,840
that stirs the Lian'an Town.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So now,

159
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,960
do you still feel troubled?

160
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,399
Still?

161
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,039
I'm an optimist.

162
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,440
Would I feel troubled?

163
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,039
After the incident of Tianliang,

164
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,799
if you're not allowed to leave,

165
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,559
you'll plan

166
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,639
to do

167
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,039
the riskiest task,

168
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,919
right?

169
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,240
Actually,

170
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,679
a young key member like you

171
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,320
is a rare talent.

172
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,399
But you wanted to leave.

173
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,039
I didn't stop or persuade you.

174
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,879
You originally sensed

175
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
my change, huh?

176
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,200
The blow to you from Tianliang

177
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,559
perhaps

178
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,960
was bigger than you imagined.

179
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,879
I can tell you now.

180
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,639
Actually back then,

181
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,720
you were indeed a bit...

182
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,559
How should I put this?

183
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,559
Seeking release.

184
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,519
Not at that time,

185
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,360
but since that time,

186
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,639
I've been like this.

187
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,799
I told you I wanted to leave

188
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,120
and change my life.

189
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,840
It was a lie.

190
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,039
I just wish

191
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,559
it had been me

192
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,519
instead of Tianliang.

193
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,600
The bullet was coming at me.

194
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,399
Tianliang pushed me away

195
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,639
and took the bullet for me.

196
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,240
And then...

197
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,840
Sometimes I wonder

198
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,480
why fate is so unfair.

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,159
For what reason? Why?

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,320
You're right.

201
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,200
I was just seeking release.

202
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,440
And I wouldn't be painful.

203
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,840
But Tianliang was still gone.

204
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,120
So I changed my way of living.

205
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,320
Two years later,

206
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,840
I thought I'd grown used to it,

207
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
adapted,

208
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,480
and forgotten the past.

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,759
No, I haven't.

210
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,039
I've been lying to myself.

211
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,720
Now there's another time.

212
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,720
Someone

213
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,799
took a bullet

214
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,200
meant for me.

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,960
I can't endure it!

216
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,879
Why?

217
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,039
Why can't it be me for once?

218
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,000
Calm down.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,679
Maybe,

220
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,440
everyone still needs you.

221
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,440
Don't say this, Chief Xu.

222
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Everyone still needs me?

223
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,759
That's what I originally thought.

224
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,559
But now...

225
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,879
I tell you.

226
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,200
Look at my track record.

227
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,039
Barely settled in Lian'an Town,

228
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,840
right?

229
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,000
Ming got stabbed.

230
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,600
Long injured his leg.

231
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,080
Xiu got shot.

232
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,840
Even Lin Pinghe
and Black Lotus Gang suffered together.

233
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Am I not a jinx?

234
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,840
Wherever I go, I bring misfortune.

235
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,799
They all say Black Lotus Gang
is causing trouble.

236
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,240
I think

237
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
I'm much more formidable than they are.

238
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,600
What you're saying
is all discouraging talk.

239
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,000
I hope it's just discouraging talk.

240
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,159
But I feel

241
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,200
if I hadn't come,

242
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,879
they might be fine.

243
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,320
When young,

244
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,159
whether succeeded or not,

245
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,480
one always likes to add drama.

246
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,639
When you're my age,

247
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,919
you'll get it.

248
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,559
Life

249
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,600
isn't all roses,

250
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,919
but it's not all thorns.

251
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,039
I'm still young?

252
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,639
Even though this time
you're making a comeback,

253
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,559
seriously,

254
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,159
you haven't worked

255
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,840
for many years.

256
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,559
Actually,

257
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,240
you're still half a newbie.

258
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,559
Half an outsider,

259
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,720
and half a newbie.

260
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,679
Maybe the organization
should think again.

261
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,360
Can I

262
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,960
really pull this off?

263
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,720
On the bright side,

264
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,000
you're to have a promising future.

265
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,840
Since you're a newbie and an outsider,

266
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,360
being confused is quite normal.

267
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,879
But you must not go to extremes.

268
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,399
Tianshuang,

269
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,919
no matter what others think,

270
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,639
or even what you think,

271
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,879
here's the undeniable truth.

272
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,440
Our cause requires you.

273
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,440
I require you.

274
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,679
Every friend at your side
is counting on you.

275
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,960
Are you sure?

276
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,360
Because I know

277
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,240
that with you there,

278
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,799
whether it's Lian'an Town

279
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,159
or anywhere else,

280
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
it'll all be okay

281
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,440
in the end.

282
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,159
We're grown adults.

283
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,159
Still drop the pep talk?

284
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
Alright, stop coaxing me.

285
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm not quitting.

286
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm sincere.

287
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,320
Okay, sincere words.

288
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,519
When you came,

289
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,799
you didn't want to do it.

290
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,120
But after reading Tianliang's diary,

291
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,039
you changed your mind.

292
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,519
Tianliang was so timid,

293
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,159
yet stood his ground.

294
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,360
So I thought,

295
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,440
since I'm the one who lived,

296
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,320
I can't just be idle.

297
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,759
Otherwise, he'd definitely be angry.

298
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,240
Right?

299
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,759
Consider it as atonement.

300
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,679
This is not atonement.

301
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
It's a new beginning.

302
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,240
Tianshuang,

303
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,720
listen.

304
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,279
What happened back then,

305
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,039
it wasn't your fault.

306
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
I know.

307
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,240
I'll say it again.

308
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,440
It wasn't your fault.

309
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,679
I know.

310
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,960
You don't know!

311
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,559
It's really not your fault!

312
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
Really?

313
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:46,611
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

314
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:50,111
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

315
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:53,893
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

316
00:17:54,301 --> 00:18:00,278
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
