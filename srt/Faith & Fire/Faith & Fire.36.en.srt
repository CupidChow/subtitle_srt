3
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:03,672
("Parrot" isn't the only undercover.
Chief Xu is scheming)

4
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,239
Ming.

5
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,760
Wait for me here.

6
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,599
Welcome, Shuyi.

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,480
Have some tea.

8
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,239
No need.

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,719
Long story short.

10
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
The people in your hands

11
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,079
all want to go home early.

12
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,159
Alright.

13
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,079
You know my requirements.

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,120
The chemical plant

15
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,040
is the premise.

16
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,879
I promise you.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
Five Lakes Alliance

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
won't interfere in the chemical plant.

19
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,040
Besides, its grudge with Tianhai Sect

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,639
will also come to an end.

21
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,479
But?

22
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,159
But

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,319
I also have my requirements

24
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,960
about how to implement.

25
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,280
What requirements?

26
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,280
Be environmental-friendly.

27
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,639
Control its pollution.

28
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,960
The residents nearby

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,280
should receive compensation.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,400
Do you know how much funding is needed

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,039
according to your requirements?

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,319
It's a lot of money.

33
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,240
But I believe,

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,120
with the power of you and Mr. Huang,

35
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,439
settling this

36
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,639
shouldn't be a problem.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Shuyi.

38
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,280
You seem to have misunderstood.

39
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,319
The situation is now set.

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,759
I still have hostages in my hands.

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,400
You are raising the price.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
On what grounds?

43
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,159
Do you want

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,639
to give Bobo a call now?

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,439
He wants us to let his girlfriend go.

46
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,319
Otherwise...

47
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,039
Again?

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,439
He doesn't dare to do it.

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,719
I just met Ming.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,240
I'm not sure about his character.

51
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,960
But I heard

52
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,280
this kid is impulsive and loyal.

53
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,400
He's close to Chen Tianshuang.

54
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,120
And you

55
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,919
happened to catch his girlfriend.

56
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,840
What a mess.

57
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,159
That's right.

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,639
But to deal with you,

59
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,560
a little mess is necessary.

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
Turns out

61
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,000
this is Chen Tianshuang's real plan.

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,920
After so many years, Five Lakes Alliance

63
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,800
has quite a few men
who are not afraid of death.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,000
If we don't reach an agreement today,

65
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,480
plus the old scores,

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,920
we will truly be enemies.

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,959
It was Chen Tianshuang yesterday

68
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,639
and Ming Today.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
For every day to come,

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,720
can you truly sleep peacefully?

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,279
After today,

72
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,079
I'm afraid

73
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,600
it won't be so easy to find me.

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I believe that.

75
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,639
But your daughter...

76
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,959
You threaten me with my daughter?

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
Don't forget

78
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,959
that not long ago,

79
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,919
my dad

80
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,600
and my brother

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,399
were still alive.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,639
Who killed

83
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
them?

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,199
Calm down.

85
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,000
I've always been calm.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,399
Just like you.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
But I believe you know

88
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,439
that in the face
of a family member's life,

89
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
no one can remain calm.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,319
You want me to throw so much money

91
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
away in Lian'an Town.

92
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,959
What good does it do for you?

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,639
Respect.

94
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,800
From now on,

95
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
everyone will know

96
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,879
that though our alliance
is no longer glorious,

97
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,199
the Tianhai Sect

98
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,439
can't take down one of our branches.

99
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,800
What do you think?

100
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,879
Fight to the bitter end,

101
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,360
or agree to my requirements

102
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,959
and make peace?

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,520
Shuyi.

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,879
If Five Lakes Alliance is in your hands,

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
I believe that in the future

106
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,079
it'll achieve great things.

107
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,759
Is Chen Tianshuang okay?

108
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,159
Rest assured.

109
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,439
He's still alive.

110
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
Guys,

111
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,240
Shuyi just told me.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
Tianhai Sect agreed to our conditions.

113
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,439
From now on,

114
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,680
we'll make peace!

115
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,079
That means

116
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,319
it's finally over?

117
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,439
It's over.

118
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,279
No.

119
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
It's not just over.

120
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,279
It means we won!

121
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
- We won!
- We won!

122
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,759
We won!

123
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,439
Tianshuang.

124
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,279
Are you okay?

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
I'm fine.

126
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,240
Superficial injuries.

127
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,480
Won't affect my future.

128
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,800
See?

129
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
My idea

130
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,000
really worked.

131
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,960
With your bad idea,

132
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
ask someone else to try it.

133
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,480
See if he can make it.

134
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,279
We have you.

135
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,120
The process had its ups and downs,

136
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,639
but

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,039
we still made a triumph.

138
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,599
Get in the car.

139
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,120
Parrot has been safely evacuated.

140
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,519
Action canceled.

141
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,360
All units, dismiss.

142
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:05,536
Welcome, Tianshuang.

143
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:06,600
- Tianshuang.
- Tianshuang.

144
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,519
Welcome back.

145
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,519
(Loyalty)
Xiu.

146
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,480
The dinner is on me.

147
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
You've worked hard.

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,919
Ming.

149
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,759
Tianshuang.

150
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,559
Hurry up.

151
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
What's on you?

152
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,360
Why is it so hard?

153
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,720
What are you looking at?

154
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,799
It's dynamite.

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,440
You haven't disarmed it yet?

156
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,960
Xiu.

157
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
This is too dangerous.

158
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,840
Come on.

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
Someone, disarm it.

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,399
Tianshuang.

161
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,360
Tianshuang.

162
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,840
Go back for a rest.

163
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,039
Tianshuang, you're amazing

164
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,039
to handle Tianhai Sect.

165
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,600
Impressive?

166
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,080
Impressive.

167
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
Li returned safely, all thanks to you.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,399
Then stop charging me from now on.

169
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,000
Can't promise you that.

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,440
Discount.

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
A discount is okay.

172
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,120
Club card's on me.

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
- But you have to top it up.
- Make way!

174
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,200
Make way.

175
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,480
It's alright now.

176
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,600
Wasn't he

177
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,360
with He Shuyi before?

178
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,559
That was the previous version.

179
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,799
Now he's with Qi.

180
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,120
Chao, come on.

181
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,639
What is it?

182
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,679
Actually, I heard

183
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,639
that Tianshuang got both of them.

184
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
- Really?
- Really?

185
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,320
She's my mentor.

186
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,200
I dare not ask her.

187
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,639
I'm alright.

188
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,479
It's fine.

189
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,544
(Charitable Town)

190
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,679
So, the chemical plant will be built.

191
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,799
But Tianhai Sect also promised

192
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,039
not to pollute the environment.

193
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,080
In this way,

194
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
you guys can rest assured.

195
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Ming.

196
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,440
Although things have passed,

197
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,080
when you were strapped with dynamite,

198
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,559
you scared me, you know?

199
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,679
It's my fault for starting it.

200
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,480
It's definitely your fault.

201
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,799
If you hadn't reached an agreement
with Anle,

202
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,519
who would take the explosives next?

203
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,480
Me?

204
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,920
Tianshuang.

205
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,759
Now this matter has been settled.

206
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,480
You've gone through so much suffering.

207
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,879
We'll take care of the rest.

208
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,759
You should go back and rest.

209
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,879
Shuyi.

210
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,800
Tell you something.

211
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,360
It was Peng who tipped

212
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,080
off Huang Zhixing.

213
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,120
I'll take care of this.

214
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,279
Have a good rest.

215
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,239
Thank you.

216
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
What to eat for dinner?

217
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,799
What do you want to eat?

218
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,240
The food you cook.

219
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,759
Pinch me.

220
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,399
You're injured like this.

221
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,399
Why should I pinch you?

222
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,480
Come on, pinch me.

223
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,279
Turns out it's real.

224
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,480
I thought I was dreaming.

225
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm so happy.

226
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,960
Insane.

227
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,879
It hurts.

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Alright.

229
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,120
Ming.

230
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,360
Control your sister, okay?

231
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,279
I'm injured, and she's still hitting me.

232
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,879
Tianshuang.

233
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,320
What?

234
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
I can't hear you.

235
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,679
Keep it down.

236
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,679
Look at you.

237
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,960
If it were others,
they'd be crying out in pain.

238
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,679
Yet you can still smile.

239
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,480
It hurts,

240
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,279
but I'm happy inside.

241
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,240
The rock that's been pressing
has finally fallen.

242
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,399
The task

243
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
is finally complete.

244
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:19,296
♪Missing you keeps me up all night♪

245
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:25,705
♪We've been apart for two weeks♪

246
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,840
(Half a month ago)
Chief Xu.

247
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,159
Speak.

248
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,080
What's the next task?

249
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,240
The Intelligence Agency's Eye Plan.

250
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,799
I knew it.

251
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,320
What is meant to come will come.

252
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,120
But what exactly is it?

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,080
Let me check what Eye Plan is?

254
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,399
No.

255
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,480
Someone is already working on this.

256
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,399
There are others from our side?

257
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,679
He is not one of us.

258
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,559
He is a staunch supporter
of cross-strait reunification.

259
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,519
His codename is Pushpin.

260
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,679
But he has no organization

261
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,639
or any formal position.

262
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,440
He even has

263
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
no interest or dealings with us at all.

264
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,720
All his actions

265
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,080
are his personal conduct.

266
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,879
But now he

267
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,519
is our most important collaborator.

268
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,120
And your mission

269
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,000
is to assist him in completing
the operation.

270
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,480
Do I know this person?

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,039
You should know him.

272
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm listening.

273
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,799
There're agents
from National Security Agency.

274
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,440
Got it.

275
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,080
Put Bobo on the phone.

276
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,479
Anle.

277
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,840
Get rid of her.

278
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,280
Okay.

279
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,160
Got it.

280
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,008
(Three months ago)
We go first.

281
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,320
Zhixing.

282
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,080
I was just passing by,

283
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,279
so I could pick you up.

284
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,879
A couple of days ago,

285
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,039
Mr. Cai came to see me.

286
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
He asked me to do him a small favor

287
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,519
and find someone.

288
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,599
Who?

289
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,200
He said there's a spy

290
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
in our Tianhai Sect.

291
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,639
How could there be a spy
in Tianhai Sect?

292
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,159
You know it.

293
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,799
A couple of years ago,

294
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,960
the chemical plant was supposed
to start construction.

295
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,879
But suddenly, it was exposed

296
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,960
that there was a radiation problem.

297
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,200
So,

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,279
it was called off.

299
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,480
Mr. Cai

300
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,519
thought

301
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,679
that the incident

302
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,159
was not an accident,

303
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,720
but because that spy

304
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,320
wanted to stop

305
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,080
the proceedings of Eye Plan.

306
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,759
But

307
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,360
not many people have heard of Eye Plan.

308
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,679
Yeah.

309
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,519
So,

310
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,000
that spy

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
is among these people.

312
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,840
These people

313
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,080
include you as well?

314
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,519
Of course.

315
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,159
But

316
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,799
you're included, too.

317
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,440
What can I benefit

318
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,600
from stopping Eye Plan?

319
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,720
That's what I think, too.

320
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,759
Of course, you get no benefit.

321
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,919
But you also know

322
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,080
Mr. Cai is very suspicious.

323
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,759
No matter what,

324
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,120
we still need to investigate.

325
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,679
That will give him an explanation.

326
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,320
So, this matter

327
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,919
will be left for you to handle.

328
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,159
Okay, I'll handle it.

329
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,759
However,

330
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,960
there may not be a conclusion so soon.

331
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:55,759
That's okay.

332
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
Take your time investigating.

333
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,919
Even if you can't find out,

334
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,159
it's fine.

335
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,479
It's fine?

336
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,080
Yeah.

337
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,960
I'm still here.

338
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,439
I

339
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,480
have my own ways.

340
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,119
Mr. Huang.

341
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
It's me.

342
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
Hello.

343
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,000
I've waited ten years for this call.

344
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,440
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

345
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,039
