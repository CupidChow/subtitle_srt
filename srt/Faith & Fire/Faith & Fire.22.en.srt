=Episode 22=

3
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:03,776
(He Shuyi, I'm glad
to work with a smart person.)

4
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,519
Shuyi.

5
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,799
Chen Tianshuang.

6
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,680
Welcome.

7
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,799
I don't usually like drinking tea.

8
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
This tea is quite tasty.

9
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Sure.

10
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,680
What about the incense?

11
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,759
It smells

12
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
so familiar.

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
It's the smell of your pillow, isn't it?

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
How do you know
what my pillow smells like?

15
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,919
In fact,

16
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,319
I know you more

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,719
than you think.

18
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,439
What else?

19
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,000
I know you like beef noodles.

20
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,479
You had a feud with Black Lotus Gang.

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,639
I also know a girl

22
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,919
named Qi.

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,159
Don't be nervous.

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
This isn't a threat.

25
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,360
I want to know more about you

26
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,879
because I'm interested in you.

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,599
If we collaborate,

28
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,039
the information I have will be yours.

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,159
What do you say?

30
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,199
So,

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,479
that's what you offer me?

32
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,360
Everyone has something they want.

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
And we can

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
fulfill each other's wishes.

35
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,080
Do you usually win others over
like this?

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,639
Only you.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
I don't believe it.

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,159
You will.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,159
You're wrong about me.

40
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,680
Why did you say so?

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,159
Your information

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,039
can't satisfy me.

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
I want tangible benefits.

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,199
As long as you can meet my needs,

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,439
everything is negotiable.

46
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,639
What do you need?

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,039
What do you think tomorrow's vote

48
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,280
will be?

49
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,040
It will be a close call.

50
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
If you don't consider your position

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,920
and think about what happened today,

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,120
who will you vote for?

53
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,160
Of course, it is you.

54
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,120
I'm just very curious.

55
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,839
He Jiahao

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,199
is not capable.

57
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,759
Why do they still side with him?

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,360
Don't they want Five Lakes Alliance
to become better?

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,199
I was right about you.

60
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,319
You are exactly the person I need.

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,519
Five Lakes Alliance has been
on the decline these years.

62
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,800
Rather than doing a thankless job,

63
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,920
they will take the chance

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,879
to get some benefits.

65
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,639
What they want more

66
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,920
is a bombastic foolish head,

67
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,959
instead of a shrewd and capable head.

68
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,000
So, tomorrow,

69
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,199
they will vote for Jiahao.

70
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,600
And those who don't want
to give up on the Alliance

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
will vote for you.

72
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,480
If the vote count is close,

73
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,759
the new variables will matter.

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,839
For example,

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,879
my vote.

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,839
No.

77
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,519
No?

78
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,959
I want more than your vote.

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,399
I also want you.

80
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,720
So,

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,879
did you meet them all?

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,639
Sure.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,839
I did.

84
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,399
How's your throat?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,079
Got hurt?

86
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,040
I drank too much tea.

87
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,839
What?

88
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,000
Alright,

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,839
come to the point.

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,279
The good news is

91
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,000
I got them to outbid each other.

92
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,480
They said they could negotiate

93
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,279
about the business.

94
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:56,920
What about the bad news?

95
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,000
If I vote for He Jiahao tomorrow,

96
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
he will win

97
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
and it will make things much easier.

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,199
He wants me to take his side.

99
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,120
As for other matters, I don't care.

100
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
But you will choose He Shuyi.

101
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,879
That's right.

102
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,120
Hey.

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,920
Did you fall into a trap again?

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Why did you say so?

105
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,199
Anyway, she is capable.

106
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,560
Besides,

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
maybe she can help us in the future.

108
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,319
If I only think about myself,

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,959
I will vote for He Jiahao.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,360
But he plans to yield to Tianhai Sect.

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,959
What will happen to Lian'an Town?

112
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,680
Think about it.

113
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,600
Tianshuang.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
I knew it.

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
You're not just a businessman.

116
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,959
I joined the gang

117
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,480
just to make things easier.

118
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,000
Now, it's getting more complicated.

119
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,439
The more trouble there is,

120
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,120
the more men there are.

121
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,959
Once you get through this,

122
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,439
you'll be a hero in Lian'an Town.

123
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,920
Nowadays,

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
no one foolishly plays the hero,

125
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,800
right?

126
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,240
Now,

127
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,120
all the votes are in.

128
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,839
Four votes each.

129
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,959
It's a tie.

130
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,879
According to the tradition,

131
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
the current Chief Protector
has one vote.

132
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,920
If

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,519
nothing else,

134
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
the next head

135
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,879
will be...

136
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,920
Hold on.

137
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,160
There's one more vote.

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,519
Why rush?

139
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,839
Stop it, Jiahao.

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,879
Eight branches, eight votes.

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,959
That's all.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,199
It's my fault.

143
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,360
I made a mistake.

144
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
I forgot to introduce someone.

145
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,519
He's Lin Pinghe,
Chief of the Black Lotus Branch.

146
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,360
It's the ninth branch

147
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,759
Black Lotus Branch?

149
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,959
He is the leader
of the Black Lotus Gang.

150
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,079
Yes.

151
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,439
He was originally the leader
of the Black Lotus Gang.

152
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,680
Chen Tianshuang.

153
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,279
Yesterday,

154
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,800
in front of everyone, you said

155
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,720
the Black Lotus Gang

156
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,279
was already gone.

157
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,959
So, now,

158
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
he is the Chief

159
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,680
of the Black Lotus Branch.

160
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,800
Black Lotus Branch?

161
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,439
I've never heard of it.

162
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,399
Have you heard of it?

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:27,959
No.

164
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,560
No.

165
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,560
Me either.

166
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,159
Our alliance has a long history.

167
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,320
You haven't heard of it,
but that doesn't mean

168
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
it doesn't exist.

169
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,679
Moreover, we need
to develop the alliance.

170
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
Having a new branch

171
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,039
isn't a bad thing.

172
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,960
That's true.

173
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,759
Good point.

174
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,879
You should have all

175
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,639
heard of He's dad,

176
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,559
Heilun.

177
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,519
However,

178
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,000
very few people know

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,519
that 20 years ago,

180
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,600
Heilun was a member
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,639
Later on,

182
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,120
because of his good performance,

183
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,600
he became a Chief.

184
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,159
Not many people know about this.

185
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,960
Dad.

186
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,960
Why don't you tell everyone?

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,679
It's true.

188
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,840
He Shuyi.

189
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,000
You're well-informed,

190
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,600
but you don't know this,

191
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,799
right?

192
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,759
If he really was a Chief,

193
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,639
how come we haven't heard about it?

194
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,639
Exactly.

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,360
He left.

196
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,440
So, the position of Chief

197
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,039
was left vacant.

198
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,759
But today,

199
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,320
his son, He, has returned.

200
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,799
He takes his dad's position

201
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,360
as the Chief,

202
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,960
which is perfectly reasonable.

203
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
Even if what you said is true,

204
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,240
he has been away for so long.

205
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,519
There's no place for him.

206
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:02,919
Yeah.

207
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,879
Good point.

208
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,480
Dad.

209
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,000
What

210
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,399
do you say?

211
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,559
Lin Yongning left the alliance
for some reason.

212
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
So,

213
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,360
his son can take

214
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,480
his place.

215
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
So, he has the right to vote,

216
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
right?

217
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,399
Right.

218
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,240
Chief Lin.

219
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
Who will you vote for?

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,120
Speak!

221
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,879
He Jiahao.

222
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,559
Dad.

223
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,759
So, what's the final vote now?

224
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Five to five.

225
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,799
According to the rules,

226
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,840
if the votes are tied,

227
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,120
the head will decide the winner.

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
It's me or her?

229
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,320
Who is the next head?

230
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,360
He Jiahao.

231
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,480
You violated the alliance's rules,

232
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,840
so you're not qualified to run for head.

233
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,200
I violated rules?

234
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,960
What are you talking about?

235
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,919
Killing alliance members

236
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,919
is a major taboo in our alliance.

237
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,879
You broke that rule,

238
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,559
so you're not qualified to be the head.

239
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,399
I don't know what you're talking about.

240
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,080
Xiu, the Chief of the Lian'an Branch,

241
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,639
was attacked and nearly lost his life.

242
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,799
You're behind it,

243
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
right?

244
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,480
What nonsense!

245
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,720
Do you have evidence?

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,679
Jiahao.

247
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,559
Admit your mistake now.

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,480
There is room for redemption.

249
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,039
If the evidence is indeed conclusive,

250
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,120
we'll have to handle you
according to the rules.

251
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,159
Jiahao.

252
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,480
Is what Shuyi said

253
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,720
true?

254
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,159
Of course, it's false.

255
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,720
She framed me.

256
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,919
She lied.

257
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,240
She...

258
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
In front of so many people,

259
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,440
are you going to deny

260
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,320
what you've done?

261
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,360
He Shuyi, you...

262
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,440
Let go!

263
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,279
You injured Xiu?

264
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,200
Let go. How dare you!

265
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,480
Let go of him!

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,639
Go ahead!

267
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,360
Chen Tianshuang,

268
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,600
just now, you were irritated

269
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,759
and intended to hit me.

270
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,759
But Chen Tianshuang stopped you.

271
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,840
Is there a problem?

272
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,720
Enough.

273
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,120
Sit down.

274
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,240
Sit down.

275
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,639
It doesn't matter.

276
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Jiahao.

277
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,960
The votes are tied now.

278
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,240
Xiu was attacked,

279
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,759
which is a huge thing.

280
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,519
I don't know

281
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,159
if you did that.

282
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,000
Anyway,

283
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
we must find out the truth.

284
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,559
Dad, I've already said...

285
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,080
Shuyi.

286
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,720
You said Jiahao did that.

287
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,519
But you must

288
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,600
have evidence.

289
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,039
So,

290
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,639
I give you three days.

291
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,559
If you can't provide evidence
in three days,

292
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,200
it's just groundless slander.

293
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,759
Then the position of the head

294
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,840
will belong to Jiahao.

295
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,919
What if evidence is provided?

296
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,080
Are you willing to help me

297
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,679
find evidence?

298
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,600
You have informants everywhere.

299
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,320
Do you

300
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,720
need my help?

301
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,960
I do have some informants,

302
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,519
but it's not omnipotent.

303
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,080
He created Black Lotus Branch suddenly,

304
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,159
and I didn't even know that.

305
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,279
You got

306
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,840
all the information about me.

307
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,480
Yet you didn't know
Lin Pinghe would come.

308
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,159
I was abroad before

309
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,720
and returned a while ago.

310
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,679
Some of my men

311
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,919
are not reliable.

312
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,759
It seems your people

313
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,000
do not particularly favor you.

314
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,879
What about you?

315
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,879
Do the conditions we agreed on

316
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,279
still count?

317
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,799
Chen Tianshuang.

318
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,159
Are you willing to be my man?

319
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,320
You excel at planning behind the scenes.

320
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,480
But you need a disruptor

321
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,080
to fight for you, right?

322
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,559
Very clever.

323
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,159
I promise you

324
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,320
to help you become the head.

325
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,600
Even in the future,

326
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,120
I can be your right-hand man.

327
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,759
But you have to agree to two conditions.

328
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,240
I'm listening.

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,399
First,

330
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,240
you won't align with Tianhai Sect.

331
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,480
Then we're on the same page.

332
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,519
But one day,

333
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,519
if they cause trouble in Lian'an Town,

334
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,320
I need your help.

335
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,279
I will do my best.

336
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,679
Second,

337
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,200
you have channels
on the Chinese mainland.

338
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,360
I want a share

339
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,799
in your business.

340
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,279
This is your true purpose, isn't it?

341
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,799
I am a businessman.

342
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,159
You don't mind, do you?

343
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
I told you.

344
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,039
We can fulfill each other's wishes.

345
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,279
Starting now,

346
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
I am

347
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,039
your man.

348
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,119
Don't worry.

349
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm just cheeky,

350
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,599
but not bad.

351
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,079
We are in the same boat.

352
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,160
I'll just say it directly.

353
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,039
In fact,

354
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,319
I have no evidence of Jiahao

355
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,119
being involved in the attack on Xiu.

356
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:44,699
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

357
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,153
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

358
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,261
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

359
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:58,649
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
