=Episode 24=

3
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,520
(The infighting is over,
and the battle for the new head ends)

4
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,999
Evidence obtained.

5
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,079
Tomorrow,

6
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,480
I'll beat He Jiahao up.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,760
Be sure to stay safe.

8
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,079
Sure.

9
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,840
Before you leave,

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
you can see your girlfriend.

11
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,560
She's not my girlfriend yet.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,280
But according to my observation,

13
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,640
she seems to have fallen for you.

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
I know.

15
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,120
That's why I'm afraid she'll worry.

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Then you should definitely go see her.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,719
Chen Tianshuang.

18
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,120
Chen Tianshuang.

19
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,159
Where are you?

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
I'm here.

21
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,239
Why are you hiding there?

22
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,239
Don't run.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
Just say whatever you want.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
I need to tell you something.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
Go ahead.

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,079
Why are you running?

27
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,280
I'd rather not say it directly to you.

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,120
If you don't want to,

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,039
why ask me here?

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
I want to see you.

31
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,919
What's the matter?

32
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,759
Go ahead.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm leaving.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
How long will you be gone?

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,439
For a year?

36
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,680
Not that long.

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Is it dangerous?

38
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,319
Not really.

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,439
Then why are you so serious?

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,639
You may not want me to go.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,120
Don't flatter yourself.

42
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,560
What makes you say that?

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,719
Aren't you

44
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,960
getting along well

45
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,800
with Shuyi?

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
How do you know?

47
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,240
Don't you know me?

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,680
I know any gossip

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,759
in Lian'an Town.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,360
It's a rumor.

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,599
Don't listen to them.

52
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
A rumor?

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Where there's smoke, there is fire.

54
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,319
So,

55
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,120
why don't you hold me tight

56
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,759
right now?

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,919
Are you crazy?

58
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,960
That's disgusting.

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,199
Drop the act.

60
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,800
Look,

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,680
you just hit my chest.

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,936
- My chest...
- Drop the act.

63
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,159
I really feel stifled.

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,719
It's all red.

65
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,680
Right here.

66
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,559
Let me see.

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Did you hear that?

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Hear what?

69
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,479
My heart.

70
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,719
What's wrong?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,599
My heart is leaping like a deer.

72
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,039
That's tacky.

73
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,560
Really? I learned it from someone else.

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,960
Learn something useful, alright?

75
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,319
Qi.

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Your dad,

77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,439
your brother,

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
and your sister...

79
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,959
Get to the point.

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Qi.

81
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,639
After I'm back,

82
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,040
why don't we...

83
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,520
That's a line in movies.

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,879
If you say so, you won't be back.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
That's true.

86
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm leaving.

87
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,079
Chen Tianshuang.

88
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,759
If you want to say something,

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,839
come back and try.

90
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,439
We aren't characters in movie.

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,200
What if it happens?

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
I'm going back.

93
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Bye bye.

94
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,599
Bye bye.

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,439
I will be back!

96
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,439
Wait for me!

97
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,079
It doesn't suit your taste?

98
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,920
Jiahao.

99
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,319
Why are you staring at your sister?

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,439
Just eat.

101
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,360
My mom has only me.

102
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't have any sisters.

103
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,920
Say it again?

104
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,199
I don't have any sisters.

105
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,839
My mom has only me.

106
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,240
Dad.

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
Are you senile?

108
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,399
My mom is your wife.

109
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,279
Her mom is just your ex-girlfriend.

110
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,040
No matter how Jiahao thinks,

111
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,519
he is my brother.

112
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,839
Stop pretending.

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,879
He Jiahao.

114
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
What?

115
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,519
Did I say something wrong?

116
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
I really don't understand.

117
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,759
Why did you let an outsider

118
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,600
be the Chief Protector?

119
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,519
I am your only son.

120
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,360
I am the one who grew up here.

121
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,240
The Five Lakes Alliance should be mine.

122
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
You hit me.

123
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,720
You never hit me before.

124
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,519
You hit me today because of her.

125
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
I've spoiled you too much.

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,839
It's too late to hit you.

127
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,680
Is it too late?

128
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,039
How dare you!

129
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,959
You're done for.

130
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,400
Shuyi.

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,559
Sorry about this.

132
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,120
It's okay, Dad.

133
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,720
I came back to take care of you.

134
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,599
Promise me.

135
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,720
Later,

136
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,679
no matter what the final result is,

137
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,359
you still

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,759
treat him as your brother.

139
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,119
Okay?

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
I will.

141
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,320
Sometimes,

142
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
people ask for trouble.

143
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
The three-day period is up.

144
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,279
Does each of you

145
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,200
have anything to say?

146
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,800
Jiahao.

147
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,720
This is your last chance.

148
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,399
Confess now,

149
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,720
and we're still a family.

150
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,799
He Shuyi.

151
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,080
Thank you.

152
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
However,

153
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
I don't confess.

154
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Well,

155
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,320
you said I attempted
to kill a man of us.

156
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,559
This is a huge thing.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,480
If you have no evidence,

158
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,999
you are

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,919
done for.

160
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,799
This is the pendant

161
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,799
of the gunman who attacked Xiu.

162
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,479
That day,

163
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,159
I shot the gunman.

164
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,840
It was this pendant

165
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,159
that saved his life.

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,519
The owner of this pendant

167
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,879
is right here.

168
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,000
You?

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
You?

170
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,519
How could it be me?

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,639
It's just an ordinary pendant.

172
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,159
Can you prove whose item it is?

173
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
Lin Pinghe.

174
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,240
Is this your pendant?

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
Yes.

176
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,239
So, you admit

177
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,840
that you attacked Xiu?

178
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,679
It's my pendant.

179
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,039
But I lost it a while ago.

180
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,279
I didn't

181
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,719
attack Xiu.

182
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,440
Who did it?

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
How should I know?

184
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,759
Chen Tianshuang.

185
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,480
Are you

186
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,600
using a pendant to accuse me?

187
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,000
Show me the evidence.

188
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,080
Do you have a security video

189
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,200
or DNA sampling?

190
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
Sorry,

191
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,160
I have neither.

192
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,720
So, what are you trying to do?

193
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,320
Playing a guessing game?

194
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,479
He Shuyi.

195
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,279
Is this the evidence

196
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,039
you got?

197
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,159
Indeed, this is the only evidence

198
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,960
related to the attack.

199
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,960
So,

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,879
you have no solid evidence.

201
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,720
You're just trying to make up a story

202
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,799
to deceive everyone.

203
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,639
And then,

204
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,240
pin the crime on me?

205
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,080
That's right.

206
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,399
But,

207
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,639
I'm not going

208
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,519
to tell the story.

209
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,759
Then who?

210
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,440
(You'll become the new Chief.)

211
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,704
What?

212
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:29,984
(Considering your background,)

213
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,584
- (I have to test you.)
- How could you?

214
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
Wait.

215
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,560
Dad.

216
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,360
Dad.

217
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
This isn't true.

218
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,080
Don't believe the recording.

219
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
That's not me.

220
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,879
She made things up.

221
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,879
You have to believe me.

222
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,719
Dad.

223
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,120
He Shuyi, you...

224
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,359
Hao.

225
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,240
Calm down.

226
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,279
The best is yet to come.

227
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,279
What are you doing?

228
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,279
Go snatch it.

229
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
(You kill someone for me.)

230
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,519
(Who?)

231
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,679
(The Chief of Lian'an Branch.)

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
It's fake.

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,639
Guys,

234
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,879
it's all fake.

235
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,879
He Shuyi, you've got some nerve.

236
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,159
You even falsified recordings.

237
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,679
If it's really fake,

238
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,519
Hao,

239
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
why are you agitated?

240
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,159
I'm agitated

241
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,440
because she's framing me.

242
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,200
She's framing me.

243
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:36,999
Fine.

244
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,960
Let's take a step back.

245
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,480
Even if this recording is real,

246
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,879
it can only prove

247
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,080
that I said this to Lin Pinghe.

248
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,039
It can't prove that he killed Xiu,

249
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,879
right?

250
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,200
So, this recording

251
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,320
is not evidence at all.

252
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,080
Sure.

253
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,240
This is not solid evidence.

254
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Sure.

255
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,639
This is not solid evidence at all.

256
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,359
However,

257
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,519
look at them all.

258
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,679
What's that reaction?

259
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
No one believes me.

260
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,560
You don't believe me.

261
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,559
You don't believe me, either.

262
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,519
You don't believe me, either.

263
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,919
Did you really kill Xiu?

264
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,200
Qiang.

265
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,240
I've told you

266
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,480
I didn't kill Xiu.

267
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,679
I didn't kill Xiu.

268
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,320
I think it's necessary

269
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
to vote again.

270
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,679
Dad.

271
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,519
Mi,

272
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,239
what do you think?

273
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,519
Dad.

274
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,639
Dad.

275
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,879
You believe me, right?

276
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,080
I didn't kill Xiu.

277
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,480
I didn't kill Xiu.

278
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,519
Dad, you have to believe me.

279
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,679
Jiahao.

280
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,320
Okay.

281
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,399
Let's keep it simple.

282
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,239
Go to the side

283
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,559
you take.

284
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
Okay.

285
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,519
Vote.

286
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,480
Let them vote.

287
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,080
Let me see who they'll vote for.

288
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,600
Guang,

289
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,279
I promised you the benefits you wanted.

290
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,519
Hey,

291
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,840
don't forget your women.

292
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
And you.

293
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
You.

294
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,679
What are you all doing?

295
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,200
Mi,

296
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:49,440
no need to count the votes.

297
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,399
The result is obvious.

298
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,399
Qiang.

299
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,080
I trust you the most. You...

300
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,440
I trusted you so much.

301
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,039
I even voted for you.

302
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:03,999
Dad.

303
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,720
Aren't you going to intervene?

304
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,119
Dad.

305
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Dad.

306
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
Dad.

307
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,040
Dad.

308
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,960
Dad.

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Dad.

310
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,480
You believe me, right?

311
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,639
You have to believe me.

312
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,919
I really didn't kill Xiu.

313
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,080
- Dad.
- Take him away.

314
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,320
I am your only family.

315
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I am your only son,

316
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,519
your family.

317
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,840
You will all regret it.

318
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
He Shuyi, I hate you!

319
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,000
Everyone should just die.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I am the real heir.

321
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
Dad.

322
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,039
Shuyi.

323
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
Come over.

324
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,999
Sit.

325
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm asking you to sit.

326
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,439
Thank you, Dad.

327
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,200
This is the new head

328
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,160
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

329
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,039
He Shuyi.
