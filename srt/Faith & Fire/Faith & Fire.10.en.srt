00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:58,938
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,690
(Bobo, you're crazy.
This task is harder than imagined.)

4
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,200
I should have brought a bug spray.

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,120
So many mosquitoes.

6
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,280
You finally came.

7
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,519
Sheng,

8
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,120
Why are you here?

9
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,799
I'm worried about you.

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,159
It's a duel.

11
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,879
After he comes,

12
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,719
what will you do?

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
You're embarrassing me.

14
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,159
How about coming back with me?

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
If your dad knows

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,959
you sneaked out for a duel...

17
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,560
If you don't tell my dad, will he know?

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,120
Let's go back.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,799
Are you afraid I will lose?

20
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,400
I...

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,599
Mr. Lin.

22
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,280
It seems you didn't come alone.

23
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,199
He is leaving.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
He is leaving.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,159
Get lost!

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
He.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Get lost!

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,240
Good for you.

29
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,000
Can we start now?

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,120
Come on!

31
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,280
Wait!

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,479
You're holding a knife,

33
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,360
but will you suddenly

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,599
shoot me with a gun?

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,199
Am I such a despicable person?

36
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,960
Let me see.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,680
Lift up your shirt.

38
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,000
Turn around.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,400
What?

40
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,000
Good.

41
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,879
Come on!

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,439
Wait!

43
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,960
Don't

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,319
use a sprayer.

45
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,840
Sure, I won't.

46
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,120
Come on.

47
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:14,919
Come on.

48
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,599
You'll use that?

49
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,400
It's good.

50
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,639
Okay.

51
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,960
Count of three.

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,080
You count.

53
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,120
One.

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,719
Two.

55
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,960
Three.

56
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,479
It's a trap!

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,599
Didn't you say it was a duel?

58
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,560
Come on. Nobody wants a duel.

59
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,639
You have a gun?

60
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,519
That's not a cold weapon.

61
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,439
There's no gunpowder.

62
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,199
Don't be afraid.

63
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,199
Don't move.

64
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,920
Stop it!

65
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,160
Don't move.

66
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't move.

67
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,600
How can I not move?

68
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,839
Didn't you say it was a duel?

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
He really came to duel.

70
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,720
Peng.

71
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
Is it a bit too much?

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Not just a bit.

73
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,879
You've gone too far.

74
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,360
He is so arrogant.

75
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,480
I must teach him a lesson.

76
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,959
You're a despicable new guy.

77
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,000
Man,

78
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,920
I'm counting on you.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,079
You have a bright future.

80
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
This guy didn't leave.

81
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
He was hiding over there.

82
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,079
Do as you like with me.

83
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,120
Alright.

84
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,680
You're safe.

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,759
Go back and give his dad a message.

86
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,399
Tell him that his son is in our hands.

87
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,199
Did you hear that?

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,439
You may go.

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,839
He.

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
I'm leaving.

91
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
Remember to bring diapers.

92
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,759
He seems to be peeing in his pants.

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,240
Good morning.

94
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,720
You're already cursing
early in the morning?

95
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,279
Don't curse.

96
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,319
Be civilized.

97
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,240
Got it?

98
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,879
I even kindly bought you breakfast.

99
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,120
Xiu told me

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,240
not to bully you.

101
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,360
We'll use you for negotiation,
so you're safe.

102
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
But recently,

103
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,480
Ming and I

104
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,839
have received your care.

105
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,959
Out of courtesy,

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
I should return the favor,

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,720
right?

108
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
What are you going to do?

109
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,639
It's smelly.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,040
It's not the time.

111
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,519
Help me up.

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
Did you hear that?

113
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,079
Help me up.

114
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,120
Help me up.

115
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,240
But I have this.

116
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,839
Don't hide.

117
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,240
You watch that guy when I'm not here.

118
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,480
Tianshuang.

119
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,480
You were just going so far.

120
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,519
Was I?

121
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
Are you out of your mind

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,680
It's just tea.
What's there to be afraid of?

123
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:53,800
If so,

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,079
why did he react like that?

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,079
Because I previously...

126
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm not telling you.

127
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920
Tianshuang, you're really bad.

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,879
I even start to sympathize with him.

129
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,240
Why?

130
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,720
Do you want to try it?

131
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,399
It's still hot.

132
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,279
Get lost.

133
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,399
You're so bad.

134
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,000
Anyway, I didn't mistreat him.

135
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,680
You watch him.

136
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Keep him alive.

137
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,720
Got it?

138
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,839
Go have some fun.

139
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,039
Xiu.

140
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,200
Heilun contacted me.

141
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,360
What did he say?

142
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,799
He said he'd see us this afternoon.

143
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,759
He will come alone.

144
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,039
Prepare well.

145
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:56,960
Heilun,

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,080
are you going alone?

147
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,559
Sure, I need to show sincerity.

148
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,639
But what if they don't want
to negotiate?

149
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,639
If things really get ugly,

150
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,039
then we'll fight them.

151
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,840
But for now, I have to bring He back.

152
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,000
One hour.

153
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,120
If I don't come back in an hour,

154
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,840
you go to Five Lakes

155
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,080
and rescue He.

156
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,080
Then

157
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,200
kill them all.

158
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,600
Got it.

159
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,200
Xiu.

160
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,279
Black Lotus Gang
broke their word before.

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
What if they deceive us again?

162
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,799
Heilun cares about his son

163
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,279
very much.

164
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,000
As long as we have his son,

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,240
he will be reasonable.

166
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
You don't plan to let his son go?

167
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,240
Things are easier with him in our hands.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,559
But Heilun doesn't have to worry.

169
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,840
If he doesn't act recklessly,

170
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,519
we definitely won't torture his son.

171
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,759
A real gun, huh?

172
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,600
You've never seen a real gun?

173
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
What are you doing?

174
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,080
I'm trying it.

175
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,399
You're trying it in the car?

176
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm just aiming.

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,159
Relax.

178
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
Xiu.

179
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,200
In what situation can I fire?

180
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,080
Use your own judgment.

181
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,919
Tianshuang.

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,480
If more than one car comes,

183
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,360
we leave immediately.

184
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,559
Okay.

185
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,279
See how many people get out.

186
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,679
It should be just him.

187
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,399
But don't lower your guard.

188
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,720
Hold your gun.

189
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,759
Let's cut to the chase.

190
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,440
I want my son back.

191
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,120
You make conditions.

192
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,519
I'm warning you,

193
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,960
my patience is limited.

194
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
If we can't come to an agreement
in five minutes,

195
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
let's wait and see.

196
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,720
What do you mean?

197
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,279
Wait and see?

198
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
I would like to see

199
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,799
when it comes to a fight to the death,

200
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
what can you do

201
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
to fight me?

202
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,279
Watch your tone.

203
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,440
Stop pretending.

204
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,480
You think I am scared?

205
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,320
If you have the guts, aim here.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
Sorry about that.

207
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,759
I should have let him finish speaking.

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,639
But I don't want anyone smoking
in public.

209
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,919
You're from the Five Lakes?

210
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,840
Nice to meet you.

211
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm Bobo from Tianhai Sect.

212
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,480
Tianhai Sect?

213
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,120
It can't clean the blood off.

214
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,679
Do you have a wet wipe?

215
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,840
I don't have it.

216
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,720
Remember to bring it next time.

217
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,240
Okay.

218
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,320
The largest gang in Taiwan, China.

219
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,399
What are you doing in our small place?

220
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,200
We will meet again.

221
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:04,879
By then, I hope

222
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,440
you will help me.

223
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,000
I just already gave you my gift.

224
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,120
Are you putting his life

225
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,360
on us?

226
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,759
You got the wrong idea.

227
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,480
We admit we killed him.

228
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,440
A leader was killed.

229
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,840
The Black Lotus Gang won't let it go.

230
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,519
You mean they will retaliate?

231
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,360
Just tell them

232
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,159
that Anle is waiting for them.

233
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,440
Anle?

234
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,720
The Chief Protector of Tianhai Sect?

235
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,600
He is right.

236
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,440
He sent you here?

237
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
Leave the body alone.

238
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,679
Someone will handle it.

239
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,519
I'll stay in Lian'an Town for a while.

240
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
See you then.

241
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,200
You can't hold a gun
with a shaking hand.

242
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
It might go off.

243
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,840
Tianshuang.

244
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,600
Are you okay?

245
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm fine.

246
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
A living person

247
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,519
suddenly died in front of you.

248
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,519
It's normal to be scared.

249
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,159
Well,

250
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,559
in the afternoon,

251
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,799
you hang out

252
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,640
to relax yourself.

253
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Don't dwell on it.

254
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,279
Let's have a talk tonight.

255
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:14,920
Get in the car.

256
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:24,528
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

257
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:28,156
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

258
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,212
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

259
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:38,327
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
