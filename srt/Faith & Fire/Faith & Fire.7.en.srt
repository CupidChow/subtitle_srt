00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:58,848
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:03,712
(Shift the blame to Black Lotus Gang
and move into Qi's place. Perfect!)

4
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,719
Lean, fair-skinned, and rebellious
young handsome guys.

5
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,920
Chao,

6
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,840
what do you think of Ming?

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,040
He's good.

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,159
Is he as handsome as me?

9
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,959
He's handsomer than you.

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,719
Ming, you're super handsome.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,719
What are you gossiping about?

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,040
Ming.

13
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,959
It's gross.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,159
I'm warning you.

15
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,359
I don't like men.

16
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,359
Me neither.

17
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,480
I'm not hitting on you.

18
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,799
I just want to ask you

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,799
what kind of girls you like.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Right, Ming.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,920
Back in school,

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,079
many girls chased after you.

23
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,760
But you were very indifferent to them.

24
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,280
They were not my type.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,359
I like women a bit more mature.

26
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,719
He likes mature women.

27
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,560
Bingo!

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,840
That's easy then.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,760
Why?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,959
Tomorrow, I'll give you a good task.

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,280
She's definitely your type.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,719
Guaranteed mature.

33
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,719
What the heck?

34
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,439
Are you crazy?

35
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,040
So leisurely?

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
Haven't you opened for business today?

37
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,439
The news said a massage shop

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,319
got sued for giving

39
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,519
a customer a bone fracture.

40
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,519
It's your shop, right?

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,159
You only talk nonsense.

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,919
It's your shop, right?

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,919
Are you serious?

44
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,120
They had photos

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,360
to prove that.

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Du. Hua.

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,319
Li.

48
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,639
Li.

49
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,199
Ming, come here.

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,479
Do you have customers today?

51
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,560
Why don't you come with me?

52
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,479
I must go even if I do.

53
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,159
Tianshuang,

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,639
you guessed right.

55
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,400
The moment Ms. Li saw Ming,

56
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,800
her eyes lit up.

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,439
It'll be hard for Ming.

58
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,800
I think he wouldn't mind
working a bit harder.

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Let's go.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,919
Does it taste good?

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,639
I'll take a sip.

63
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:16,960
(Tiny but certain happiness)

64
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,479
It looks tasty.

65
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,960
Is it tasty?

66
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,360
Give it a try.

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,759
Tasty, right?

68
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,759
Are you okay?

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Sorry.

70
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,680
You have to act along with me.

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
Why are you apologizing?

72
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,600
Does going on a date with me
make you feel wronged?

73
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,639
Of course not.

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,839
I think you're great.

75
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,920
You're quite good at making women happy.

76
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,000
But I know you guys

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,759
always like young girls.

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,800
I won't allow you to say that.

79
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,279
I don't care about age at all.

80
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,879
Even if it's just acting,

81
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,000
hearing you say that
makes me very happy.

82
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,120
Let's go. We still have one last stop.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,959
Hua,

84
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,720
I have a bad feeling.

85
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,000
No way. They have such an age gap.

86
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,600
Didn't you notice?

87
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,120
On their dating route today,

88
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,720
the focus is only on this one place.

89
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:08,256
(MG Business Motel)

90
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,240
Hua,

91
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,040
it's been over ten years.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,879
Don't deceive yourself.

93
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,480
Li just likes the younger men.

94
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,720
I'm unwilling to accept it.

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,800
What's there to be unwilling about?

96
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,600
That little brat...

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,519
Who is it?

98
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,040
Don't move.

99
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,519
Your technique is not bad.

100
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,600
You're quite professional.

101
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,279
Where did you learn this?

102
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,079
We are kindred spirits.

103
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,560
Kindred spirits?

104
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,319
I used to give my girlfriend
massages every day.

105
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,000
She's run off with someone else,

106
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,600
saying millennials are outdated.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,519
She wants to find someone
born after 2005.

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,000
We are indeed kindred spirits.

109
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,439
All unfortunate people?

110
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,199
Unfortunate people.

111
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,319
Then let's drink.

112
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,240
Cheers!

113
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,360
I figured it out.

114
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,120
Love is just unreliable.

115
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,480
From now on, I will put

116
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
all my energy into work

117
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,879
to make her regret it.

118
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,399
You're different.

119
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,399
You're still young.

120
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,040
We are both old.

121
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,839
We have no hope.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
How are we different?

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
I think we are the same.

124
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,639
What's the saying again?

125
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,639
What are men until death?

126
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,800
Young boys!

127
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,319
- Right.
- Young boys!

128
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,040
Young boys.

129
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,519
Cheers to the young boys, okay?

130
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,279
Let's drink!

131
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,399
Given my big belly,

132
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,519
am I still a young boy?

133
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,439
A big-bellied young boy.

134
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,360
No wonder Li doesn't like you.

135
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,839
You're a big-bellied young boy.

136
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,279
Look at me.

137
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,800
A charming young boy.

138
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,399
A charming young boy.

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Your turn.

140
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,279
I'm a little young boy.

141
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,120
Cheers to the young boys.

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,319
Cheers to the young boys.

143
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,920
Cheers.

144
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,959
Cheers to the young boys!

145
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,079
Cheers.

146
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,959
Someone was constantly

147
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,319
defaming our street online.

148
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,680
I had someone investigate.

149
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,399
The internet trolls
are from Black Lotus Gang.

150
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Black Lotus Gang?

151
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,399
Why?

152
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,360
They wanted to ruin business here

153
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,959
to make it impossible for us to continue

154
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,399
and then take over our shops.

155
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,040
That's outrageous.

156
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,399
Yes.

157
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,720
We all have done business
on Yanjiao Road

158
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
for so many years.

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,399
At such time, shouldn't we

160
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,600
be united against outsiders

161
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,040
to maintain the reputation here?

162
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,000
Of course.

163
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,319
Then it's a deal.

164
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,360
From now on, no more conflicts
between you two.

165
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,160
We already agreed yesterday.

166
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
We're both so old.

167
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,279
We won't be that childish.

168
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,160
Li, be careful in the future.

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,800
Your business

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,120
might be taken by us.

171
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,639
You can dream on.

172
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Say it.

173
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,920
Well,

174
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,920
you and Ming...

175
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,279
Well...

176
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,920
Well,

177
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,160
are you really together?

178
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,319
A young body is still different.

179
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,279
Du,

180
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,200
let me sing a song for you, okay?

181
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,519
Okay.

182
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,559
The massage shops'
smearing incident is resolved.

183
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,720
And we blamed it on Black Lotus Gang.

184
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,000
What are you doing?

185
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,679
Chen Tianshuang,

186
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,639
thank you.

187
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,919
Are you alright?

188
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,480
Although it was unintentional,

189
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,840
thanks to you,

190
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,679
I fulfilled a childhood dream.

191
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,720
A dream? What dream?

192
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,720
Actually...

193
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,679
Actually, I've liked Li
since I was young.

194
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,639
I knew it.

195
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,679
As you know,

196
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,919
we're over ten years apart.

197
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,639
She might not even remember

198
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,320
that I said I liked her very early on.

199
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,000
She only saw me as a child back then.

200
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,840
But these past two days,

201
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
she and I

202
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,679
were able to be like a real couple,

203
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,759
holding hands and dating.

204
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
I am really happy.

205
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,039
When you went to the hotel, did you...?

206
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,399
That's a script.

207
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,120
Since you are so compatible,

208
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,080
why not go official?

209
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,159
Absolutely no.

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
What does being compatible mean?

211
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,279
Because I think she likes you too.

212
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,120
The conditions she set

213
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
are tailor-made for you.

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,440
I don't think so.

215
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,600
I told her during our date

216
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
that I don't care about age.

217
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,559
Saying more might lead
to misunderstandings.

218
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,200
Ming, why are you
afraid of misunderstandings?

219
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,120
What if it's true?

220
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,480
What if?

221
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,639
Yeah.

222
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,039
For an outsider like me,

223
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,080
it's not one-sided on your part.

224
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,519
It seems more like mutual affection.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,120
You should give it a try.

226
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,440
What if it succeeds?

227
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,080
Don't leave any regrets for yourself.

228
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,919
I've thought it through.

229
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,080
No matter the outcome,

230
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,399
I should have a go at it.

231
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,159
Like you said, it's okay

232
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,559
even if it's a misunderstanding.

233
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,159
Yeah.

234
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,679
What if it succeeds?

235
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't want to have any regrets.

236
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,159
Tianshuang, thank you!

237
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,200
You're going now?

238
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,799
Isn't it too late?

239
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,159
You're awake.

240
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,320
You don't have a fever.

241
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,080
Then have a good rest.

242
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,200
Don't rush to get up.

243
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,720
Balala Energy.

244
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,879
Wukaraka Makabaka.

245
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,759
What are you chanting?

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,879
Was your brain messed up?

247
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,840
It does feel a bit messed up.

248
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:51,720
I...

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
Where am I?

250
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,159
My place.

251
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,600
Your place?

252
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,360
I...

253
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,279
How did I end up at your place?

254
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,320
My younger brother said
you fell into the sea.

255
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,679
He fished you out.

256
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,000
Here was close.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
So I placed you here.

258
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,720
Your younger brother?

259
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,960
Tianshuang, you're awake.

260
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,600
You scared me.

261
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
What are you doing there?

262
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,799
I came to check on you.

263
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,919
I'm glad you're okay.

264
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,159
He often does this.

265
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,519
He's your younger brother?

266
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah.

267
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
Then you guys chat first.

268
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,639
I'll go to make breakfast.

269
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,519
If you have the energy,
come down and eat.

270
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,639
Okay.

271
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,440
Did you bring me here?

272
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,679
Did you climb up here?

273
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,720
Yeah.

274
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,279
How did I get up here?

275
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,080
My sister got you up here.

276
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
Your sister is really strong.

277
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Of course, she's my sister.

278
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,799
Isn't this your home?

279
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,639
What are you doing?

280
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,559
Come in.

281
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,960
I can't go in.

282
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,080
Why?

283
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,440
My sister will tell you later.

284
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,919
By the way,

285
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,039
what happened to you?

286
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,399
A van suddenly changed lanes

287
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,720
and hit me.

288
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,960
Could it be Black Lotus Gang?

289
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,559
Who else could it be but Mr. Lin?

290
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,000
Alright.

291
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Calm down a bit.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,200
What if it's a trap set by Mr. Lin,

293
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,399
wanting you to go to him?

294
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,600
You mean,

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,399
they did it on purpose

296
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,279
to provoke us into retaliation?

297
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,000
That's possible.

298
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
So calm down first.

299
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,759
Find evidence first, okay?

300
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,840
But we can't just leave it like this.

301
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,519
I can't swallow this.

302
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,799
Ming,

303
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
you treat me as an older brother.

304
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,320
I'm really glad about that.

305
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,559
Seriously?

306
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,879
Why so gross all of a sudden?

307
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,679
Go back and tell Xiu to conduct

308
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,320
a thorough investigation these days.

309
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,759
And I will recuperate

310
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,559
at your home for a bit.

311
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,960
I won't go back to the branch.

312
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,879
I'll see what Black Lotus Gang is up to.

313
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,399
I see.

314
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,240
I've informed my sister.

315
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,639
She'll take good care of you.

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,919
Come down to eat.

317
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,120
I'll come once I finish dressing.

318
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,720
Kid,

319
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,440
you are...?

320
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,919
I'm Chen Tianshuang.

321
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:19,879
What's your name?

322
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,679
Hui.

323
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,159
Hui.

324
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,720
How old are you?

325
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
Are you here to hit on my sister?

326
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,720
Don't speak nonsense.

327
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,120
We just met.

328
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,200
You came to my home right after meeting?

329
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,600
And you even took a nap.

330
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:38,879
Shameless.

331
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,440
There are reasons for that, okay?

332
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,879
I'm good friends with your brother.

333
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,559
Don't talk nonsense to your sister.

334
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,720
No?

335
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,600
So you don't like my sister?

336
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,759
About this question...

337
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,080
Y-You're a kid. You don't know.

338
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,639
All thief's heart but no thief's guts.

339
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,559
An awful man.

340
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,360
Hui,

341
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,279
why are you bullying him?

342
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,559
She's right.

343
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I am an awful man.

344
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,000
What is it?

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
Are you silly from hunger? Eat an egg.

346
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,440
It's tasty.

347
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,720
Slow down.

348
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,880
No one will take your food.

349
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,680
He eats so urgently.

350
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,319
Just like Ming.

351
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,480
Hui,

352
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,960
call him brother.

353
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,799
Why doesn't Ming come home?

354
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,400
He's sulking with Luo.

355
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,680
Luo?

356
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,279
Dad, did you stay up yesterday

357
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,440
to play cards all night?

358
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,880
No, I didn't.

359
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,200
No pocket money if you lie.

360
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
I went to play video games.

361
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,319
Drinking and playing video games?

362
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,079
As you can see,

363
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,400
that's how Luo is.

364
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
He and Ming never get along well.

365
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,160
Earlier, Ming said
he wanted to join a gang.

366
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,920
Luo said,

367
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,480
"If you dare to join a gang,

368
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
don't ever come back home."

369
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,799
Ming said,

370
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,680
"Alright."

371
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
Then they've never spoken
to each other again.

372
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,839
They act like strangers
when meeting on the street.

373
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,880
Even though they are family,

374
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,400
they just can't talk properly.

375
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,359
Men.

376
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,160
Hui,

377
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,559
where is your report card?

378
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,559
I-I'm full.

379
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,839
I'm off to school now.

380
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,839
You haven't even taken your backpack.

381
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,880
Wait.

382
