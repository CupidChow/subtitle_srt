3
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:03,023
(Mission accomplished.
Pushpin will take over!)

4
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,280
Hello, Mr. Huang.

5
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,799
Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,599
Let's talk in the car.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,879
Let me be clear first.

8
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,120
I won't do anything for you.

9
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,719
It's okay, Mr. Huang.

10
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,840
Ten years ago,

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
we already told you

12
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,920
that patriots like you

13
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,359
are always welcome.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,000
For you,

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,879
we don't have any demands.

16
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,120
But if you need help,

17
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,200
we'll do our best.

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,319
If you want me to trust you,

19
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,759
you need to help me
solve a problem first.

20
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,080
What problem?

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Intelligence Agency

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,159
is already suspecting me.

23
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,400
Don't worry.

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,520
We'll help clear your suspicion.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,400
How to clear it?

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,159
According to him,

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
although Eye Plan

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,520
is now in his hands again,

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,319
he still can't access

30
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,080
the inside story.

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
Only when the matter in Lian'an Town
is settled

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,520
can he prove his innocence
to Intelligence Agency.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,719
In other words,

34
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,680
only when he regains trust

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,360
will they

36
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,960
entrust the chemical plant
and the Eye Plan

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
to him.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,319
So,

39
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,319
you want me to put on an act with him?

40
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,039
That's right.

41
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,840
During the process,
you must resist hard.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Ultimately,

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,879
you'll need to concede imperceptibly,

44
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,080
and let him win.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,840
Only in this way

46
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,639
can Zheng Taixiang

47
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,919
and the Intelligence Agency believe

48
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,120
he

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,919
isn't a spy from Chinese mainland

50
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,759
to obstruct Eye Plan.

51
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,479
Resist hard?

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,520
Yes.

53
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,439
Use all your skills.

54
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,520
No problem.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,280
I've met him.

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,240
He is smart.

57
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,319
If I can cooperate with him,

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,080
we can make a good show.

59
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,159
You can't.

60
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,080
Can't?

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,840
He only made the request,

62
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,560
but no idea how we'll

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,240
handle it?

64
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,159
Right.

65
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,680
So,

66
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,680
he also doesn't know

67
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm the one who's putting
on this act with him?

68
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,960
That's right.

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,479
We need to help him,

70
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,879
but we'll keep the principle.

71
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,599
I won't let him know

72
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,840
who is one of us.

73
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,919
Otherwise, the risk is too great.

74
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,960
Well...

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,599
If he doesn't know I'm helping him,
he might take it seriously.

76
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,960
That's why I came to you.

77
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
Fight him,

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,759
lose believably,

79
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,759
survive,

80
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,839
and stay undercover?

81
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,879
Chief Xu,

82
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,480
that's a tall order.

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,360
Yes.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,120
No wonder you never told me.

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,519
What?

86
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,160
Got upset?

87
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,160
Since Tianliang left,

88
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,000
I've been thinking

89
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,120
that if I had acted differently
back then,

90
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,079
wouldn't he have survived?

91
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,600
This is also something

92
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
that I can't get over.

93
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
So I chose to leave back then.

94
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
What about now?

95
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,000
Have you got over it?

96
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,279
Tianliang can't come back anymore.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,480
If

98
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,360
I can stop others

99
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,120
from being the next Tianliang,

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,399
I believe I'll feel better.

101
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,759
I believe

102
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,839
Tianliang must think the same way.

103
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,040
Chief Xu.

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Rest assured.

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,319
I'll definitely do my best.

106
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,399
Chen Tianshuang.

107
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,920
You're injured and still running around?

108
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,600
It's really not reassuring.

109
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,800
If I run around,

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,279
you can bring me back.

111
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,439
Anyway, you're living at my home now.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
You must follow my rules.

113
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,879
Rules?

114
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,279
I never heard Ming mention this.

115
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,720
I just made them up.

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
Just made up?

117
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,639
It's not appropriate.

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,839
If not, you can leave.

119
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
You can't bear to leave me.

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,839
You're so disgusting.

121
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,519
Finally, we can have some peace.

122
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,040
You're the one who's too active.

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,720
I have no choice.

124
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,800
Once I take a rest,

125
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,240
I really feel

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,199
our life like this is quite nice.

127
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,360
It'll be great if it's always like this.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,879
Don't worry.

129
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
It will be.

130
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,560
Mm?

131
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,160
How do you know?

132
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,759
Because I'm the little
guardian angel here.

133
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,040
That's really disgusting.

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
If it's so disgusting,

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
can I get a kiss from you?

136
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,519
No.

137
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,560
Dream on.

138
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:12,920
How about it?

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,439
Right.

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,040
You know what?

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,519
That makes so much sense.

142
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,319
So,

143
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,360
Zhixing,

144
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,600
I knew from the start

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,879
that leaving this matter to you

146
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,319
would absolutely be no problem.

147
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,480
All the credit goes to you.

148
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,879
Sit down.

149
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,959
Why stand up?

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Yeah.

151
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Since Mr. Cai instructed,

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,600
our Tianhai Sect would definitely

153
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
try our best.

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,680
We can't really claim all the credit.

155
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,959
But we truly

156
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,519
worked hard.

157
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,600
Right, Zhixing?

158
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,399
Putting in so much effort

159
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,959
to finally get things done

160
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,079
is my incompetence.

161
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah.

162
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,759
We've spent so much money.

163
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,600
Don't even know when we'll break even.

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Don't put it that way.

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
Things that can be solved with money

166
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
are not really problems.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,759
Right?

168
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
But,

169
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,240
Taixiang,

170
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
there's something I need
to discuss with you.

171
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,480
It's inconvenient to process
the current expenses

172
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,839
of the chemical plant
through our accounts.

173
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:30,800
So,

174
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,120
I hope you can advance the money
for us first.

175
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,039
And I'll find a way

176
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,600
to return the money to you later.

177
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,440
Of course, I handled the matter.

178
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,279
I can advance the money first.

179
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,720
Loyalty.

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,279
See?

181
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,159
Loyalty.

182
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,799
Mr. Cai, rest assured.

183
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,320
When I take over the chemical plant,

184
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,679
I'll be more diligent and dedicated.

185
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,679
Mr. Cai, have you forgotten?

186
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,080
We already agreed on this here before.

187
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,120
How could I

188
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,639
possibly forget it?

189
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,720
Come on.

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,240
But I just discussed

191
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,639
with Taixiang.

192
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,440
We think that if we

193
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,600
insist on keeping you here,

194
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,879
it'll truly be

195
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,200
a waste of your talent.

196
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,039
Mr. Cai means

197
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,159
he hopes you can return to Taipei.

198
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,279
And, we need someone at the head office.

199
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,600
If you go there,

200
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,159
I'll feel more assured.

201
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,360
If I'm not around,

202
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,919
who'll be in charge of the plant?

203
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,720
You don't need to worry about that.

204
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,960
Taixiang has told me

205
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,279
that the chemical plant

206
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,679
can be left to him.

207
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,000
You

208
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,639
can feel at ease

209
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,440
and go to the company in Taipei

210
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,039
to complete your work.

211
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,240
This time,

212
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,440
take all your subordinates

213
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,799
with you.

214
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,399
I'll

215
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,480
send a few more buddies

216
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,200
who have been with me for years

217
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,600
to assist you.

218
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,840
They can help you anytime

219
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,480
in Taipei.

220
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
Taixiang, you're truly impressive.

221
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,399
You really don't miss

222
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,200
a detail.

223
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,120
Taixiang.

224
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,600
Come on.

225
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you.

226
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,399
Not at all.

227
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,360
Mr. Cai.

228
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,200
Cheers.

229
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,759
Drink it up.

230
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Okay.

231
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,399
Drink it up.

232
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,720
Anle.

233
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,279
Think positively.

234
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,799
After we arrive in Taipei,

235
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,600
there will be no one above you.

236
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,159
Zheng Taixiang's men

237
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,440
don't work for me, but for him.

238
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
They are in Tainan,

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,320
while we are in Taipei.

240
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,399
We'll be beyond his reach.

241
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,200
We have much room for development.

242
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
The Taipei headquarters
is full of his people.

243
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
What else can I do?

244
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,159
He says he wants to promote me,

245
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,240
but in reality, he just wants
to monitor me.

246
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,919
Actually, from the start,

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,559
they never planned to give you
the chemical plant,

248
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,120
right?

249
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,840
Now it seems

250
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,480
they are still cautious about me.

251
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,399
So, what should we do?

252
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,279
I understand the situation.

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
I'm leaving in three days.

254
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,200
Once I leave,

255
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
I won't have another chance

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,919
to get the details of Eye Plan.

257
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,519
Then what's your plan?

258
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,799
Chief Xu.

259
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,519
Tell me the truth.

260
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,759
If I'm not around,

261
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
do you have a way

262
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,679
to resolve this Eye Plan?

263
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,360
We will do our best.

264
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,159
Do your best?

265
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,759
But up to now,

266
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,720
we still can't figure out what it is.

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,440
We will figure it out.

268
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,440
I believe you.

269
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,399
But how long will it take?

270
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,600
They use the chemical plant as
the disguise of Eye Plan.

271
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,639
They're likely to be

272
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,600
related to radiation.

273
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,879
This time, from start to finish,

274
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,960
Cai Desheng is tight-lipped

275
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,240
and only discloses information
to Zheng Taixiang.

276
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,480
It must be complex.

277
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,039
So what do you think?

278
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,799
Take a gamble.

279
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,120
Before I leave,

280
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,799
I must figure out

281
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,279
what exactly Eye Plan is.

282
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,840
In this situation,

283
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,480
they'll strengthen their defenses.

284
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,240
I know.

285
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,759
Don't you think it's too risky?

286
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,559
Indeed.

287
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
It might also backfire.

288
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,960
If it were before,

289
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,679
I wouldn't do it.

290
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,279
But recently, a young man

291
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,440
changed my perspective.

292
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,679
Sometimes,

293
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,039
taking a desperate risk

294
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,840
is the only chance.

295
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,279
The radiation data
of the chemical plant.

296
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,159
It seems we can't go to Taipei.

297
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,759
Go contact Zheng Taixiang.

298
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,840
Tell him you've finally found evidence

299
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,759
that I'm a spy in contact
with Chinese mainland.

300
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,759
Bobo, what's wrong?

301
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,080
I have already obtained the evidence

302
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,159
that Anle is a spy.

303
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,240
What evidence?

304
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,720
But he is starting to suspect me.

305
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
To be on the safe side,

306
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
wait for my call.

307
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,679
I'll bring you the evidence tomorrow.

308
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,440
Okay.

309
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,799
When you meet up,

310
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,879
I'll go to his place to get something.

311
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,480
Anle.

312
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,200
If you do this,

313
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,679
there's no turning back.

314
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,559
I know.

315
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,799
Let's play a game.

316
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,519
Let's see who finishes this first.

317
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,039
Shuang.

318
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,159
I'm not a kid anymore.

319
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,360
You want to trick me into drinking milk?

320
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,960
It's not that easy.

321
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,960
Are you scared?

322
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,120
Yes.

323
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,960
I am scared.

324
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
You're the best.

325
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,000
Keep going and finish it.

326
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
Good night, bye-bye.

327
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,039
Why are kids now so difficult
to deal with?

328
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,840
I remember that I was easy to trick
when I was a kid.

329
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,039
So why did you become bad
as you grew up?

330
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,799
Nice guys don't get the girl, right?

331
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
But I like obedient guys.

332
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,799
I can be obedient, too.

333
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm pure at heart.

334
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
I find your skin really thick

335
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,879
enough to tile the floor.

336
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,960
Are you willing to

337
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,159
step on me hard?

338
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,759
You masochist. Stay away.

339
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,840
My...

340
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
My wound hasn't healed.

341
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,440
This...

342
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,279
This part hurts.

343
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,039
It hurts?

344
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
It really hurts.

345
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,960
Then you should rest well.

346
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,000
Tonight, I'll

347
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,480
sleep with someone else.

348
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,000
I've suddenly gotten better.

349
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,519
The human body is amazing.

350
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,159
Come on.

351
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,159
There is still someone single
in this house, alright?

352
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,200
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

353
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,559
Sorry?

354
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,279
You believe him?

355
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,639
He's flirting with several ladies
at the same time

356
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,919
and won't take responsibility.

357
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,360
I went there for you guys.

358
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,759
What do you do for us?

359
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,320
Drinking, fishing, and playing games?

360
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,960
Socializing.

361
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,320
(Long's Beef Noodles)
For you.

362
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,919
Mr. Luo.

363
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,639
Are you hungry?

364
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,679
Hello?

365
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,120
Come see me tomorrow morning.
