00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,778
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:03,712
(Gaining trust too quickly
makes me feel nervous)

4
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,799
Don't...

5
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,640
Don't shoot.

6
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,079
No.

7
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:26,919
Not Black Lotus.

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
Let's go.

9
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,999
Xiu,

10
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,599
we are not their target.

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,479
No need to run.

12
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Do you know

13
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
it was quite risky back then?

14
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,039
You almost

15
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,319
got yourself killed.

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,439
I didn't think much.

17
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,080
Don't be so impulsive next time.

18
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
Maybe not.

19
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,719
It's okay,

20
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,559
Xiu.

21
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,439
I'm fine, right?

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Alright, alright.

23
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,039
Did you see clearly the person

24
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,439
who saved us back there?

25
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,919
Wasn't he one of our men?

26
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,039
That was a sniper.

27
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,039
We don't have a sniper.

28
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,319
He's not one of us.

29
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,919
Then I don't know.

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,919
Is he an enemy of Tianhai Sect?

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Ignore him.

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Let's go back.

33
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,639
He,

34
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,479
are you okay?

35
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
Chen Tianshuang!

36
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:22,839
He,

37
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,759
He,

38
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,599
calm down.

39
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,239
He.

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
He.

41
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,479
He.

42
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,799
He.

43
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
He.

44
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,399
Please

45
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,439
let He go.

46
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
He has nothing left.

47
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,920
Let me go.

48
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,800
Tianshuang!

49
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,360
I want you all

50
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,839
to die!

51
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Xiu.

52
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,759
I let him go today.

53
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
Did I do the right thing?

54
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,600
Black Lotus is gone

55
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,959
and his father is dead.

56
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,639
He's all alone in the world now.

57
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,879
You're right.

58
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,480
Anle

59
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,879
is so ruthless

60
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,480
that he wiped out the Black Lotus Gang.

61
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
Now,

62
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
it has escalated.

63
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,184
The police won't just ignore.

64
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,120
Accidental fire.

65
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,519
Gang infighting.

66
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,519
Bombs self-ignited.

67
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,039
I guess

68
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
they had all their reasons
before taking action.

69
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,279
If all goes well,

70
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,759
all the cameras today

71
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,840
will all short-circuit.

72
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,759
Then there won't be any single clue.

73
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,720
But among so many people,

74
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
not one survived?

75
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,600
Even if with evidence,

76
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,679
will you call the police?

77
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,159
Even if you dare to,

78
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,120
what about your family

79
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,960
and friends?

80
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,759
Aren't you worried about them?

81
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,039
But...

82
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,879
Stop with the buts.

83
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,360
There is always a way through.

84
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,600
We will surely find a way.

85
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,799
We truly survived a disaster.

86
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,479
Have a good rest.

87
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,080
Let's worry about that later.

88
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,864
(Long's Beef Noodles)

89
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,840
Sorry, Long.

90
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,799
I got you injured.

91
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,799
Just a scratch.

92
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,639
I can do this.

93
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,879
But for now,

94
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,759
I can't move around easily.

95
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,440
You'll have to help me.

96
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,720
Well,

97
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,279
I don't like field work anyway.

98
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,960
I can use this excuse

99
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
to have a good rest.

100
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
That's a blessing to me.

101
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
Stop it.

102
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,240
Our work is risky.

103
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,879
Right?

104
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,720
Anyway, we're still considered

105
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,759
to survive the peril.

106
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,879
We're both safe.

107
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,239
Alright,

108
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,919
without you,

109
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,799
I might really have been done for.

110
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,720
That's a blessing

111
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
to me too.

112
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,559
But I didn't expect Tianhai Sect

113
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,320
to go this far.

114
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,200
What did the news say?

115
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,279
Unexpected explosion.

116
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,119
Unexpected?

117
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,679
Is that all?

118
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,919
The Intelligence Agency
must have given a heads-up.

119
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Against Tianhai Sect,

120
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720
you Five Lakes may have
no chance of winning.

121
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,320
What should we do?

122
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
I haven't figured out how to fight them.

123
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,440
You definitely can't do it on your own.

124
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
Let's see if the situation turns around.

125
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,679
But there is also good news.

126
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,679
Black Lotus Gang is gone.

127
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,000
Not only that,

128
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
after this,

129
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,320
Xiu really treats me wholeheartedly.

130
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,320
For the upcoming General Assembly,

131
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,240
if I want to,

132
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,720
he will surely bring me along.

133
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,639
This way, we'll get

134
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,279
closer to the transport lines.

135
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't get complacent.

136
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,240
I stand by what I said.

137
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,480
Don't reveal intentions,

138
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,000
and don't mind me nagging.

139
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Understood.

140
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,639
Why stand there?

141
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
Sit down.

142
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,679
What's wrong?

143
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you injured?

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,519
Show me.

145
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,120
It's inflamed.

146
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,960
It's fine.

147
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,280
Just a bit inflamed.

148
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
So sudden?

149
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,399
Maybe a bit tired.

150
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,039
Why did you put my popsicle
behind your butt?

151
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,039
This makes me comfy.

152
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,600
Take it slow.

153
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,519
Are you okay?

154
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,600
It's too cold.

155
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,599
It's fine.

156
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,519
Have you been quite busy lately?

157
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,639
I'm okay.

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,279
It's dangerous, right?

159
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,320
I've read the news.

160
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,600
I won't tell you what to do

161
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,159
or not to do

162
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,600
like my dad told Ming.

163
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,879
I don't think it helps.

164
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,960
Everyone's path

165
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,759
is chosen by themselves.

166
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,120
But I hope

167
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,840
you don't push yourself too hard.

168
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,840
I won't.

169
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm so adaptable.

170
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,720
It's okay to not be so strong sometimes.

171
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,759
Qi.

172
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,960
What is it?

173
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,279
You're so sweet.

174
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,679
I know.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,399
Chen Tianshuang,

176
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,600
a hickey again?

177
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,399
Not at all.

178
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,239
Let me see.

179
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,159
There's another one here.

180
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,080
No, no, no.

181
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,480
You had a lot of fun.

182
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,759
It's not what you think.

183
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,360
It...

184
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
It...

185
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,519
It...

186
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,120
It wasn't from that woman?

187
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,720
It is, but...

188
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,919
But you...

189
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,759
Let me see.

190
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,919
She even tied you?

191
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,399
What else to say?

192
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,399
It was from Black Lotus.

193
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,239
Nonsense.

194
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,159
They don't tie like this, okay?

195
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,840
You know how they tie?

196
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,919
Chen Tianshuang,

197
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,679
you're really having fun every day.

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,840
Qi,

199
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,879
I'm innocent.

200
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,359
Tianshuang,

201
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
I feel very sad to see

202
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,039
Lian'an Town

203
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,519
is like this now.

204
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,440
I know you haven't been here long.

205
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,039
So your mind is all on business.

206
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,320
Joining a gang

207
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,720
is just to build connections.

208
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,639
These days, I've been observing you

209
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
and testing you.

210
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,600
You've done a lot
for Five Lakes Alliance.

211
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,559
Thank you.

212
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,800
My pleasure.

213
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,600
Five Lakes Alliance

214
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
can't be without a leader.

215
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,119
If...

216
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,360
I said if...

217
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,120
If you are willing,

218
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,919
you will be a good Chief,

219
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,000
also a good leader.

220
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,519
If I'm no longer around some day,

221
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,519
I believe

222
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,720
you can take good care of our men

223
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,879
and can hold onto this town, right?

224
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,999
Xiu.

225
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,320
I can't say yes to you right now.

226
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,559
After all, I came here

227
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,879
to seek protection.

228
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,879
I don't want to stick to this path.

229
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,359
I understand.

230
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,560
It's okay.

231
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,120
Just kidding with you.

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
It's not that I'm quitting.

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,639
We've been through thick and thin

234
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
together, right?

235
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,919
You're still here, right?

236
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,000
With you here,

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,919
I'll stick with you.

238
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,320
Just like you said,

239
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,720
if the sky falls,
we'll bear it together.

240
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,599
Well said.

241
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,599
Bear it together!

242
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,600
However,

243
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll say it upfront.

244
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm a businessman with bottom lines.

245
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,799
The benefits...

246
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,720
Still...

247
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,200
I know what you're thinking.

248
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,080
The channels, right?

249
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,440
The Assembly is about to start.

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,200
I will take you to the headquarters.

251
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,679
Really?

252
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,799
You won't forget this

253
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,919
tomorrow, will you?

254
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,200
Don't worry.

255
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,879
But I'll just guide you there.

256
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Whether they

257
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,960
give you the business chances

258
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,440
is not guaranteed.

259
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,600
That depends on you.

260
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,519
Xiu, cheers.

261
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,279
Tomorrow,

262
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
until everyone arrives,

263
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,519
I'll officially announce you

264
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,960
as my heir.

265
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
No,

266
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,519
my successor.

267
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,639
Don't be so high-profile.

268
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,759
I'm a newcomer.

269
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,679
Not proper.

270
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,960
Stop pretending.

271
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,840
About what you are thinking,

272
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,320
you think I don't know?

273
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,480
You worked so hard,

274
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,559
didn't even manage your own business,

275
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,480
and risked your life many times.

276
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,279
Everyone sees it

277
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,800
and admires you.

278
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,759
Then I'll humbly accept.

279
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,519
Xiu, I'll drink it up.

280
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Start.

281
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,119
Last time,

282
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,640
it really scared me.

283
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,880
Xiu, have you drunk too much?

284
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,559
Take it easy.

285
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,759
You've got a slip of tongue.

286
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,559
What?

287
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,359
You shouldn't be too impulsive
in the future.

288
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,160
Okay.

289
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,119
You keep saying this.

290
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,279
Is it okay?

291
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,200
Alright.

292
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,079
Are you crazy?

293
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:30,880
Even kissing me.

294
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
It's so annoying.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Listen to me.

296
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,960
You need to remember what I tell you.

297
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,279
Did you hear me?

298
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Got it.

299
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,839
It's okay.

300
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,039
It's okay, it's okay.

301
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:15,879
Relax.

302
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,119
Let's go.

303
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,359
Go.

304
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,640
It's okay, hold on.

305
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,319
Is there anyone?

306
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,039
It's okay, it's okay.

307
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,359
It's okay.

308
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,799
Is there anyone?

309
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,960
Is there anyone?

310
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,720
It's okay, it's okay.

311
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,599
It's okay.

312
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,039
It's okay.

313
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,519
Is there anyone?

314
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:50,804
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

315
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:54,520
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪
