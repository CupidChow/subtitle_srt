=Episode 13=

3
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:03,645
(I underestimated Lin Pinghe.
Things are getting more complicated)

4
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,359
No mistakes.

5
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,279
My condolences.

6
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,279
Thank you.

7
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,680
Xiu.

8
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,519
Why is Lin Pinghe not around?

9
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,199
He.

10
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,519
The funeral is about to start.

11
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,400
You should show up.

12
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
I...

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,040
I know you're very sad.

14
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,840
But

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,680
he...

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
Sheng.

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
Go get Huan here.

18
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,879
Now?

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,080
I need to talk to him.

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,199
It'll be quick.

21
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,479
Okay.

22
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,800
Then you need to be quick.

23
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,759
He hasn't come over yet.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Huan.

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,479
He wanted to see you.

26
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,919
Take care of things here.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
He.

28
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,680
So many people outside are waiting.

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,639
Can't it wait until after the funeral?

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,639
You were there already.

31
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,759
Huan.

32
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,000
You're Heilun's only son.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,759
You have to show up.

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,840
I'll go over right away.

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,919
But before I go,

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
I have something to ask you.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,919
We're family.

38
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,000
Just say whatever you want.

39
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,719
I heard you want
to take over my dad's position

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
and be the leader of Black Lotus?

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,639
Who told you that?

42
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,999
Who?

43
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,240
I've thought about it too.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
Being the leader is too dangerous.

45
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,560
This position

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
doesn't necessarily have to be mine.

47
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,920
He.

48
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,360
You mean...

49
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,159
Huan,

50
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,159
how about you be the leader?

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,400
I...

52
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,159
That works too.

53
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,199
We are family.

54
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,159
It's the same.

55
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,560
But I have a condition.

56
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,960
Go ahead.

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,439
I must

58
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,639
avenge my dad.

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,319
Of course.

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
But, He,

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,360
you need evidence to find the murderer.

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,839
We need to take it slow.

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,319
Isn't it already clear

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,639
who the murderer is?

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,759
Tianhai Sect did it.

66
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,040
But they have so many people.

67
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,160
They can't all be murderers.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
We need to investigate

69
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,360
who exactly did it.

70
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,959
I'm not sure who did it.

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,160
But I've found the accomplice.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
Who?

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,800
Tell me.

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,279
I'll help you take care of it.

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
You.

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
He.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
Are you kidding me?

78
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,000
How could it be me?

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
What do you think?

80
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,639
Traitor.

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
I'll go take a look.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,600
Be careful.

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
Go.

84
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,399
You want to kill me?

85
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,039
Come on!

86
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,160
He,

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,319
there's already a funeral here.

88
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,439
I'll just send you

89
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,519
to accompany Heilun.

90
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,480
Sheng.

91
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,639
Sheng!

92
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,720
Sheng.

93
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,360
Lin Pinghe.

94
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,639
He.

95
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,839
Let's see what else you can do.

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,600
He.

97
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,959
You useless kid.

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
You traitor

99
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,120
caused my dad's death.

100
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,439
Today, I'll use your life
to send my dad off.

101
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,919
He was the first

102
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,840
but not the last.

103
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,879
Everyone related to my dad's death

104
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,399
will pay with their lives.

105
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,600
The last shot was fired by Ms. Jia?

106
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
Yes.

107
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,320
Huan wanted to be

108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,799
the leader and sold Lin Yongning out.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,840
So,

110
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,639
Black Lotus Gang is going
the old path again.

111
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,240
Not just that.

112
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Given today's situation,

113
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,919
Lin Pinghe wants to escalate it.

114
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Let's go

115
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
to meet Bobo.

116
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,919
Do you usually go fishing?

117
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,919
What kind of fishing?

118
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,919
What a shame.

119
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,559
About what?

120
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,440
If you want to fish, come quickly.

121
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,039
There won't be any fish here soon.

122
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,600
What do you mean?

123
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,759
Haven't you watched the news?

124
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,200
You mean that chemical plant?

125
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,320
So the pollution is serious.

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,840
The fish

127
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,039
can't stand it.

128
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,120
Humans might still do.

129
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,559
Turns out Tianhai Sect has come and made

130
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,159
a high-profile move

131
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,519
for this.

132
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,560
That's right.

133
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,960
We'll rely on you in the future.

134
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,000
For what?

135
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,360
The plan is approved,

136
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,639
but

137
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,879
the relocation and renovation

138
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,759
are very troublesome.

139
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,519
There are always people

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,600
who are not smart enough.

141
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,399
At such times,

142
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,320
someone needs to talk to them.

143
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,559
Like how you talked to Lin Yongning?

144
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,000
According to your plan,

145
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
in the future,

146
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,559
this place might be different.

147
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,600
Out with the old, in with the new.

148
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,559
If you're willing to cooperate,

149
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,919
I'll give you a big favor.

150
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,119
How does it sound?

151
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,600
Let's hear it.

152
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,559
What big favor?

153
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,240
Why did you come to see me today?

154
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,240
Business can wait.

155
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,399
If today is inconvenient for you,

156
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,159
I can come again tomorrow.

157
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,799
It's not necessary.

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
It's convenient right now.

159
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,559
He.

160
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,639
You guys can go out.

161
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,120
Actually,

162
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,279
we don't want to eliminate Black Lotus.

163
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,399
We just want the town

164
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,759
not to be messed up by them.

165
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,159
Say it however you want.

166
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,320
It's the same meaning.

167
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,720
Our Tianhai Sect is willing to help.

168
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
But there are conditions,

169
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,600
right?

170
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,600
What do you think?

171
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,639
That shot just now

172
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,399
was a welcome gift from me.

173
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,120
What do you want in return?

174
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,159
Did your dad tell you

175
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,840
what kind of business he and I were in?

176
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,159
No way.

177
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,120
Don't rush to refuse.

178
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,240
Think it over.

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
Tourism is the foundation
of Lian'an Town.

180
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Once the chemical plant

181
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,879
is built, as you say,

182
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,120
we'll have to change careers.

183
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,440
Do you think this is good?

184
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,600
Well, the world is changing.

185
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Changing the way we live
isn't necessarily bad.

186
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,879
Whether it's good or not
is not up to us.

187
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,279
You should ask

188
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,759
whether the people here agree.

189
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
As far as I know, it seems

190
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,479
they

191
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,000
are not too willing to change.

192
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,360
Then we have different opinions.

193
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,600
But it doesn't matter.

194
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,799
There's still plenty of time.

195
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Then,

196
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,039
I'll take my leave first.

197
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,639
Chen Tianshuang, right?

198
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,960
Am I that famous?

199
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,080
If you become the Chief,

200
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,519
will you be stubborn like this?

201
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,919
Someone like me

202
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,639
can't become a big boss.

203
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't say it like that.

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,559
Becoming a big boss isn't difficult.

205
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,039
When there's no one above you,

206
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,759
you'll be the big boss.

207
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,759
Just kidding.

208
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,240
Go fishing with me sometime.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Get it straight.

210
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,039
I'm the boss of Black Lotus Gang.

211
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,120
What price did you offer?

212
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,759
You get it straight.

213
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,759
Don't think you're really the big boss

214
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,799
just because of the way they call you.

215
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,200
There were so many here just now.

216
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,559
But only one person helped you

217
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,600
while the others were just onlookers.

218
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,559
If there are benefits,

219
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,480
others might see you as the boss.

220
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,519
But if there aren't any,

221
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,759
they'll fight to send you
to Tianhai Sect.

222
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,519
What about you?

223
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,159
I'm the last straw you can clutch at.

224
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,320
You have no choice.

225
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,359
Yes,

226
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,759
I have no choice.

227
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,120
But neither do you.

228
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,080
You have no choice, either.

229
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,879
Don't think you can keep up appearances,

230
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,279
and that I don't know what you are.

231
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,759
You could do nothing if no one

232
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,279
helped you in Taiwan, China.

233
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,759
If you could really handle everything,

234
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,120
why did you come to me?

235
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,320
So I'm the last straw you can clutch at.

236
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,159
You can't raise the price,

237
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,679
but you'll have to lower it.

238
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,080
You're insane.

239
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,240
If you don't work with me,

240
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,360
when Tianhai Sect comes,
you'll be doomed.

241
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,240
Tianhai Sect?

242
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,080
Yes.

243
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,159
I am insane.

244
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,000
But you're not.

245
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,600
You can't win against me now.

246
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,759
I can risk anything.

247
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,159
But can you?

248
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,519
I received news

249
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,320
that Ms. Jia wanted to work
with Lin Pinghe.

250
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,039
So we have to make a move soon.

251
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,279
What about Lin Pinghe?

252
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,319
Lin Pinghe has already asked
Tianhai Sect

253
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,960
to hand over the murderer.

254
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Or, he won't let them off.

255
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,440
Tianhai Sect hasn't responded.

256
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,559
Let them fight if they want to.

257
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
Can't we just sit back and watch?

258
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,759
The struggle and grudges

259
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,760
within the gangs

260
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,599
have nothing to do with us.

261
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,960
But if they involve the people
of Lian'an Town,

262
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
it'll be our business.

263
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,759
How powerful is Tianhai Sect?

264
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,359
We helplessly watched Lin Yongning

265
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,559
die in front of us.

266
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,519
Now Lin Pinghe is trying to fight them.

267
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,519
I guess it won't be long

268
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,039
before Black Lotus Gang is gone.

269
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,319
Why do we have to get involved
in this mess?

270
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,960
I always talk about

271
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,359
protecting the people of this town.

272
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,519
Actually, it's to protect

273
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,799
people I know and I don't.

274
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,039
Honestly, I've been here for six years,

275
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,720
and I care about them.

276
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,559
Do you know what I mean?

277
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,960
You've said so much.

278
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,240
You just want me to deal with Ms. Jia.

279
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,839
You finally got the point.

280
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,920
Tell me,

281
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,720
how to put on this act?

282
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,119
It's very simple.

283
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Pretend to cooperate

284
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,319
with them and then

285
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,359
catch them red-handed.

286
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,160
Any details?

287
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,200
Just tell her,

288
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,039
Five Lakes Alliance will help her

289
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,480
transport goods
and take care of the trouble.

290
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
But due to its reputation,

291
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,559
we can't let too many people show up,

292
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,440
and we need helpers.

293
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
Helpers?

294
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,920
The police who arrested her at the time.

295
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,839
Almost forgot about the police.

296
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,839
I can help you arrange

297
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,640
for the next two steps.

298
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,400
But whether you can gain her trust

299
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,079
is up to you.

300
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,799
Clearly, this is the hardest step.

301
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,079
Last time when you came back,

302
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,400
weren't you quite excited?

303
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,200
Wasn't that just putting on a show?

304
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,519
So,

305
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,720
Ms. Jia is an old hand.

306
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,200
You must make it convincing.

307
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,720
For the peace of Lian'an Town,

308
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,559
it seems I have to make a sacrifice.

♪When the name is buried in dust♪

00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,288
