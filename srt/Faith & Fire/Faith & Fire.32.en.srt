=Episode 32=

3
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:03,616
(Ming, Xiu, sorry,
this act is exhausting)

4
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,079
How is it?

5
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,480
Did Nana

6
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,120
take good care of you?

7
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,200
Sure.

8
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,560
I don't even want to leave.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Isn't that simple?

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,920
You're welcome to come anytime.

11
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,840
But there are conditions, huh?

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,560
Making peace

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,840
is good for everyone.

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,319
Moreover, in name,

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,719
Five Lakes Alliance can remain
independent.

16
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,439
In name, right?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Chen Tianshuang.

18
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,560
I'm quite curious about you.

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,040
I'm a simple person.

20
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,840
Why curious about me?

21
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,400
Every time, you left

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,519
a deep impression on me.

23
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,519
Do you know why?

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Because I'm handsome.

25
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,040
You're very rational.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
Rational?

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,280
You seem to act on impulse.

28
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,239
But,

29
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,800
in fact, you see through

30
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,479
the current situation.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,400
You may be talking nonsense,

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,560
but your purpose is clear.

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,479
That means the emotional appearance

34
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,680
is just your disguise.

35
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,759
Really?

36
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,120
Am I that amazing?

37
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,400
You know that yourself.

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,719
That's why I find it strange.

39
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,000
Why would a rational person

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,759
insist on fighting a losing battle?

41
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,879
Perhaps

42
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,120
it's not as complicated as you think.

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,159
I simply don't like you.

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Have a drink first.

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,879
Try our specialty dish.

46
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,560
Boiled yellow croaker with noodles.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,360
I specially invited a chef from Xiamen.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Really?

49
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,199
Then I'll try it.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Chen Tianshuang.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,240
You haven't been telling the truth.

52
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,719
It's a life-or-death struggle
between us.

53
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,360
You want me to tell you the truth?

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,960
Not to me.

55
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,599
You are hiding the truth

56
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,360
from people around you too, right?

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,840
Do you do everything

58
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,719
because

59
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,759
you really care about the people
in Lian'an Town?

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Or,

61
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,240
is this all your disguise?

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,400
And, the real you

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,080
has another purpose.

64
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,719
You are right.

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,519
Actually, I've been hiding my identity.

66
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,920
Actually,

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm from

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,959
Alpha Centauri,
the Centaurus constellation,

69
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,560
40,000 light-years away

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,639
from Earth.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What you see now

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is merely a humanoid shell.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,399
My real purpose

74
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,920
is to lock down
your technological development

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,079
and pave the way for my companions

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,760
heading to Earth.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,839
Your people

78
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,040
really are good at lying.

79
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,279
Came to Earth too early

80
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,199
and learned the bad ways
from your humans.

81
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,399
So you are determined

82
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,639
to oppose the chemical plant,

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,199
truly to stop

84
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,759
the progress of human technology?

85
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,519
Yeah.

86
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,480
No room for discussion?

87
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,199
Of course.

88
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,959
Then why did you still come?

89
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,079
I was going

90
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,639
to assassinate you.

91
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,959
But my weapon was confiscated.

92
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,000
I couldn't do it.

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,519
What a shame.

94
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,439
A small regret.

95
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,279
But fortunately,

96
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,800
other arrangements were quite nice.

97
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,760
Nice.

98
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,839
What's it called?

99
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120
Boiled yellow croaker with noodles,
right?

100
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,279
It's delicious.

101
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,159
I want some more.

102
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,560
Another possibility.

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
You're not from outer space,

104
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
and you don't intend to kill me.

105
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,439
You came today

106
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,480
just to see

107
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,039
how high a price

108
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,480
you could get from me.

109
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,759
But there's bad news.

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,639
Not long ago,

111
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,600
you lost an important bargaining chip.

112
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,879
Stop it.

113
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,279
It's been half a day.

114
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,360
But there's no news at all.

115
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,639
Did something really happen?

116
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,199
What could happen?

117
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,920
Everyone knows he went to meet Anle.

118
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,199
But when Anle killed Heilun,

119
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,480
he didn't keep it a secret.

120
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,160
It's different.

121
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,439
How is it different?

122
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,519
It is just different.

123
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,680
What's different?

124
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,439
What is different?

125
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,319
Tianshuang.

126
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,360
Are you okay?

127
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
What could happen to me?

128
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,720
What did you do there?

129
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,759
I just had a meal.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,840
Tianshuang.

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,800
You smell good.

132
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,720
Do I?

133
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,800
I also had a spa.

134
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,759
What spa?

135
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,240
In short,

136
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,920
he just gave me some incentive,

137
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
using threats and temptations.

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,080
Anle said

139
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,600
he wanted to settle things

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,120
with me in one go

141
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,319
and told us not to resist.

142
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Tianshuang won't fall for that.

143
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,719
I did.

144
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,399
You're joking, right?

145
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
Do I seem like I'm joking?

146
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,920
He agreed?

147
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,600
He said he would go back

148
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
and tell the others

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,160
that he was with me now.

150
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,079
He asked me to cool it

151
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,240
with the protesters.

152
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,160
He said he'd handle it well.

153
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,160
Starting today,

154
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,279
I, Chen Tianshuang,

155
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,120
officially join Tianhai Sect

156
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,879
and work for Anle.

157
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,319
But besides that,

158
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm still with Five Lakes Alliance.

159
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,360
We are still buddies.

160
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
Alright?

161
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
Okay.

162
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,919
Tianshuang.

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,560
What act are you putting on?

164
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,520
What act?

165
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,759
Wasn't it already obvious before?

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,079
We couldn't beat them.

167
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
So what can we do?

168
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,399
I'm doing this for everyone's good.

169
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,319
But you didn't have this attitude
yesterday.

170
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,759
That was yesterday.

171
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,720
Today is different.

172
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
Anle.

173
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,480
Starting today,

174
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
I, Chen Tianshuang,
officially join Tianhai Sect

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,720
and work for Anle.

176
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,240
But besides that,

177
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,799
I'm still with Five Lakes Alliance.

178
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,639
We are still buddies.

179
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,479
Alright?

180
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
He did it so soon?

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,720
Chen Tianshuang has been determined.

182
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,559
Why did he change his mind?

183
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,200
He Shuyi has already told me

184
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,519
she's willing to cooperate

185
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,639
with Tianhai Sect.

186
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
No wonder.

187
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,000
Chen Tianshuang is not a chief.

188
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,519
His prestige comes
from the headquarters.

189
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,799
Now, since the head has said that,

190
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,000
he has no choice.

191
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,680
Not necessarily.

192
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,519
The head wants to cooperate with Anle?

193
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,639
Did he lie to you?

194
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,840
He played the voice message.

195
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,279
If you don't believe it, call Shuyi.

196
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,960
She's just taken over
the Five Lakes Alliance

197
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,919
and has a lot of things to do.

198
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,919
She can only focus
on the big picture now.

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
Try to understand.

200
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,039
That might be true.

201
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,879
But

202
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,120
if I chose to give up,

203
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
I would let down my perseverance,

204
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,200
those who support me,

205
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Lian'an Town,

206
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,320
and those who protested.

207
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Joining Tianhai Sect

208
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,879
is my own choice.

209
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,719
Xiu.

210
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,960
You are the Chief of the Lian'an branch
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

211
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,840
The future here

212
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,359
depends on you.

213
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Tianshuang.

214
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,879
I see you as a buddy.

215
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,360
Since you came,

216
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
I've cared about every word you say

217
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,000
because you are right.

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
But this time...

219
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,239
I've decided.

220
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,320
Whether the head helps or not,

221
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,279
or whether others want to fight or not,

222
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,279
it doesn't matter.

223
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,480
As long as I'm the Chief here,

224
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,759
Lian'an branch
of the Five Lakes Alliance

225
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,600
will fight Tianhai Sect to the end

226
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,759
and never give up.

227
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
So this time,

228
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,639
you don't agree with me?

229
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Then you'll go against

230
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,080
the Chief Protector of the alliance?

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,960
I am the Chief here.

232
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,559
I don't care about Chief Protector

233
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,399
or the head.

234
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
In Lian'an Town,

235
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,879
I have the final say.

236
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
Is the current situation

237
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
not clear enough?

238
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,559
Even Chen Tianshuang,
who tried to persuade us,

239
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,080
has announced joining Tianhai Sect.

240
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,399
You're still jabbering here.

241
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,799
The overall situation is settled.

242
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,000
If the chemical plant comes,

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,480
who will buy my fish?

244
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
Will you?

245
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,559
So you mean

246
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,720
you will be as stubborn
as the Five Lakes Alliance

247
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,320
and have your house burned down?

248
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,879
I'll call the police.

249
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,840
Seriously.

250
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,639
They've done lots of these things.

251
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,279
Would they leave any evidence?

252
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,440
Just think about it.

253
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,600
Is the safety

254
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,080
of your family more important,

255
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,840
or is your lousy aquaculture business?

256
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,200
Didn't Luo say it?

257
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
As long as we are united,

258
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
we won't be afraid of them.

259
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,440
Luo?

260
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,399
Where is Luo now?

261
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,519
He's still in the hospital.

262
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,879
My way now is

263
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,720
that while there's room for negotiation,

264
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,000
get some compensation

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,600
and leave here.

266
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Otherwise, if this keeps up,

267
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,559
we won't get a penny.

268
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,519
Still arguing here.

269
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,360
What's the point?

270
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,479
Alright.

271
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,639
Is there any use in arguing?

272
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,519
Yu.

273
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,359
What should we do?

274
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,759
I...

275
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,600
I also think

276
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,919
that although Luo has his reasons,

277
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,120
given the situation now....

278
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
What situation?

279
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,720
Chen Tianshuang?

280
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,960
I didn't mean that.

281
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,600
Don't talk nonsense

282
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,799
in front of Luo.

283
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,879
I can't guarantee.

284
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,639
There's now a new way out.

285
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,639
Want to take a look?

286
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,399
A new way out?

287
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,840
Anle said

288
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,159
that as long as you

289
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,559
support the chemical plant,

290
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,120
everyone will have some extra

291
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,559
compensation.

292
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,960
Extra compensation?

293
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,840
So good?

294
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,720
How much money?

295
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,080
Really?

296
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,600
Of course.

297
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Otherwise, why would I

298
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
have joined Tianhai Sect?

299
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,320
It's not in the agreement.

300
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,840
Right.

301
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,799
If you don't write it,
we can't be relieved.

302
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,120
Then just write it down.

303
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,679
Why make it so complicated?

304
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,360
Right.

305
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Write it down.

306
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:39,840
(Bonus: 800,000 per family)

307
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:42,344
(Pay 20,000 within 3 days.
Chen Tianshuang)

308
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,479
Okay?

309
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,639
Right.

310
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,120
This is okay.

311
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,039
Sign it.

312
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,879
Tianshuang.

313
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
Are you being serious?

314
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
Give it to me.

315
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,720
When you said to join Tianhai Sect,

316
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,600
I even told myself

317
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,879
that things might not be what I thought.

318
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,320
You must have another way.

319
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,080
But just now....

320
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,039
Are you being serious?

321
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,120
Gave it to me.

322
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,000
What are you doing?

323
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
You once said

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,240
that you'd protect Lian'an Town

325
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,840
and its future.

326
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Is that all nonsense?

327
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,639
What do you know?

328
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,840
Do you know the situation?

329
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,759
Don't act like a child, alright?

330
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
You got my dad involved.

331
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,679
He's in the hospital now.

332
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,320
Can your conscience live with that?

333
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm telling you.

334
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,279
What happened to your dad

335
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,279
is not my fault.

336
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,399
His own health was not good.

337
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,519
Ming.

338
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,080
What are you doing?

339
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,840
You're going to hit me?

340
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,960
You had it coming.

341
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Have you forgotten

342
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
the rules?

343
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,039
No moves against Tianhai Sect.

344
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,759
Are you messing with me?

345
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,239
Enough!

346
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,560
Chen Tianshuang.

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,679
The rules of the Five Lakes Alliance.

348
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,720
No fighting with buddies.

349
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,679
Do you get it?

350
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,200
What do you mean?

351
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,039
I can't control others.

352
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,639
But this is

353
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,840
the Lian'an branch
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

354
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
When we are fighting with Tianhai Sect,

355
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,279
you choose to join them?

356
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,840
Spineless!

357
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,519
Who do you think you are?

358
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
I am now the Chief Protector.

359
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,159
What Chief Protector?

360
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:41,919
Here,

361
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,159
I have the final say.

362
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,039
I'm telling you,

363
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,600
from now on,

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,840
Five Lakes Alliance

365
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,320
has dismissed you.

366
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,799
You're not with Five Lakes Alliance.

367
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,159
Do you get it?

368
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
Is it up to you?

369
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,159
Did you ask Shuyi?

370
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,159
I don't need to tell you
whether I asked her.

371
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,240
None of your business.

372
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,559
Fine.

373
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,440
Are you sure?

374
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,840
Yes, sure.

375
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:06,999
Yu!

376
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,519
Do you agree to the terms?

377
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:10,879
This...

378
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,240
This is a serious matter.

379
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,919
Let's discuss it internally again?

380
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,000
I want your answer now!

381
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,639
If you agree now,

382
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,120
you can get one more bonus.

383
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,080
Double.

384
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,240
How...

385
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,120
How much?

386
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,159
Triple.

387
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,719
I agree.

388
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,759
- I also agree.
- I agree.

389
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,879
I can't hear you.

390
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,399
- I agree.
- I agree.

391
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,720
We agree.

392
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,479
Ming.

393
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,719
Let's go.

394
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,519
Go!

395
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,239
Ming.

396
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,600
Why aren't you going home yet?

397
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Qi.

398
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
I...

399
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,240
What kind of person

400
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,759
do you think Tianshuang is?

401
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,559
Still thinking about it?

402
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,879
When I first met him,

403
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,679
we had just joined
the Five Lakes Alliance.

404
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,840
He had all sorts of little tricks

405
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,320
which made me furious.

406
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,480
How could someone

407
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,360
be so shameless?

408
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,759
I could hardly believe it.

409
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,759
He was indeed like that.

410
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,360
But after getting along with him more,

411
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,799
I found him actually quite nice

412
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,480
and reliable in times of trouble.

413
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,519
Later on,

414
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,200
I started to see him as my buddy,

415
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,879
even my best buddy.

416
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,720
Because I believe

417
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,840
that no matter how critical
the situation,

418
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,759
as long as he is there,

419
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,879
things can be resolved.

420
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,559
But today he...

421
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,680
I don't know.

422
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,559
I'm not sure

423
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,360
what he's thinking, either.

424
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,360
But after knowing him,

425
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,519
what I can be sure of is

426
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,319
that he definitely

427
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,599
isn't an ungrateful person.

428
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,680
Since he did this,

429
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,960
there must be a reason.

430
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,960
What reason?

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,039
Anyway, you don't need

432
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,799
to regret seeing him as a buddy.

433
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,759
He's still reliable.

434
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,599
Really?

435
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,519
Now I really can't see through him,

436
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,079
though I couldn't originally.

437
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,200
He might be

438
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,720
a complicated person,

439
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,079
but he's also

440
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,599
quite simple.

441
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,799
But if,

442
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,880
I mean, if.

443
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,359
If one day I'm not with you

444
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,480
and I have to entrust you guys
to someone,

445
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,240
I'll still choose Chen Tianshuang.

446
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,519
Actually, Tianshuang knows Shuyi...

447
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,680
Alright.

448
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,519
I've already said

449
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,799
that no matter what he does,

450
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,680
I'll trust him.

♪When the name is buried in dust♪

452
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:18,628
