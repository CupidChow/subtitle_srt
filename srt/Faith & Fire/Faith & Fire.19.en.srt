2
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:58,983
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:03,648
(Terrible Tianhai Sect, terrible Bobo!)

4
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,799
I'm getting water.

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,079
Write two sheets.

6
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,959
Don't cheat.

7
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,919
Okay.

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
Young man.

9
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,879
How are you?

10
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,639
Are you getting used to being here?

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,879
It's okay.

12
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,719
Can you drink?

13
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
A little.

14
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you for taking care of Ming.

15
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,439
We take care of each other.

16
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,759
Hui said you're not bad.

17
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,960
Really?

18
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,240
So you're complimenting me.

19
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,319
Qi said you're a radish.

20
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,280
Radish?

21
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,000
Playboy.

22
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
How am I a playboy?

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
Being outside,

24
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,800
you should know your limits.

25
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,719
Got it?

26
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,680
Back in the day,

27
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
I also ran the streets.

28
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,840
In just a few years,
someone called me Boss.

29
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,840
Then the crackdown came.

30
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,560
There's no way.

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,240
Our boss said I have made a name

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,319
and profits too.

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,919
I should retire.

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,800
At that time, I was at my peak.

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,919
No way!

36
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,759
As a result...

37
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,879
Then what?

38
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,680
I regret it till now.

39
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
What I regret is not important.

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,639
What's important is you.

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Mr. Luo,

42
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,280
thank you for telling me this.

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm quite touched.

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
However,

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
I'm unfamiliar with my surroundings.

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,319
I've only half-stepped in.

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
Young man,

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,479
I've seen a lot of people.

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,439
You're not suited for this life.

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,519
Are you praising me or criticizing me?

51
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,120
When you're free,

52
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,639
come here.

53
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,040
Stay away from that shady business.

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Understood?

55
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,519
Why haven't you

56
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,000
come for dinner recently?

57
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,279
I don't mind imposing.

58
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,480
But I also have limits.

59
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,160
I can't mooch meals every day.

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,079
How inappropriate.

61
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,159
Inappropriate?

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,440
Is it appropriate?

63
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,960
Okay.

64
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,399
Then I'll go when I have time.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,439
Tell Ming about

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
what we're talking today.

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,279
Don't tell him I said it.

68
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,159
Got it?

69
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,439
Also,

70
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,680
don't let Qi know

71
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm drinking here.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,759
My name

73
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,279
gets you served.

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,839
How can I be so bold?

75
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't be shy.

76
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,200
Okay.

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,639
Come by for dinner anytime.

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Wait!

79
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
Did you sneak out to drink again?

80
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,480
(Because I know)

81
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,480
(that with you there,)

82
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,720
whether it's Lian'an Town

83
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,680
or anywhere else,

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,880
it'll all be okay

85
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,040
in the end.

86
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,279
(When you're free,)

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
come here.

88
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,920
Stay away from that shady business.

89
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
Understood?

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,520
Tianshuang,

91
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,639
I'm not asleep.

92
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:13,759
Go back and rest.

93
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,599
I'm watching.

94
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,439
I'm fine.

95
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,040
I can do it.

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,880
Go back, it's fine.

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,400
Okay.

98
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,119
Xiu.

99
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
Do you remember?

100
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,120
When we just escaped from
the Black Lotus Gang,

101
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,800
you pushed me.

102
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,199
You told me

103
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,519
not to do that.

104
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,439
Look at your current situation.

105
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,360
You are the Chief.

106
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
If you're like this,

107
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,840
what are we supposed to do?

108
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
So silly.

109
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,639
Silly person

110
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,159
has his own luck.

111
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,600
I was sleeping well.

112
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,840
Why do you talk so much?

113
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,279
So annoying.

114
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,279
Xiu, you're awake.

115
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,039
- You have great fortune.
- Death spits you back.

116
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,320
Close call, better luck ahead.

117
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,160
Xiu.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
You are all here.

119
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,679
Fruit.

120
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,519
Thank you.

121
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,120
I have received

122
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,360
your regards.

123
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
You all go back.

124
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,639
Don't stand in a row.

125
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,600
It looks quite scary.

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,399
When I go out,

127
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,039
I will meet you fans.

128
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360
Alright,

129
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,120
let's go.

130
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,679
Go.

131
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,759
We're leaving, Xiu.

132
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,720
Goodbye, Xiu.

133
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,040
You stay.

134
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,320
I didn't mean you.

135
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,239
Peng, you go back.

136
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
Have a good rest.

137
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,200
Hurry and take care of me.

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Alright.

139
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,480
Xiu, how do you feel?

140
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,759
I can't die.

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
But to recover fully,

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
it won't be quick.

143
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,320
Still joking with me.

144
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,799
It looks like there's no problem.

145
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,159
You may as well be discharged now.

146
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,240
Has the gunman been found?

147
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,759
Not yet.

148
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,879
But rest assured,

149
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,799
I will find him.

150
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,559
To be honest,

151
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,320
I don't know if it's a blessing or not

152
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
after he has been found.

153
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,679
Let's suppose

154
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,320
it was Tianhai Sect.

155
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,119
And then?

156
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,879
Turn against them?

157
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,440
Maybe they are waiting for this.

158
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,360
Shall we endure it like this?

159
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,399
I can't endure it.

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,159
Enduring once is possible.

161
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,399
What about next time?

162
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,879
The time after that?

163
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,840
If the Five Lakes Alliance
swallows their anger,

164
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,799
what about the other people?

165
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,240
After this,

166
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,320
what's everyone's reaction?

167
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,360
Ming was quite emotional.

168
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
He sought revenge.

169
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,119
But I held him back.

170
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,240
What about others?

171
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,200
The others...

172
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,519
Black Lotus Gang, gone.

173
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,639
Heilun, erased.

174
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,480
Now we stand alone.

175
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,159
If Anle comes tomorrow,

176
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,120
how many people will
be willing to fight?

177
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,040
Except for Ming,

178
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,879
I think the others

179
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,639
won't go.

180
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,240
If you were in my place,

181
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
what would you do?

182
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,720
Our crew's not enough.

183
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,399
We need to find a helper.

184
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,359
Tianshuang,

185
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,840
you need to make a trip for me

186
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,159
as the acting Chief
of the Lian'an branch

187
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,320
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

188
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,120
Why aren't you chewing gum today?

189
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Visit Xiu?

190
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,280
Give it to me.

191
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,840
Not at ease, huh?

192
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,240
You don't think it's done by us, huh?

193
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,359
Isn't it?

194
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,360
If it were me,

195
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,799
you should be visiting a grave now.

196
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,480
Besides, we are still friends for now.

197
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
Friends?

198
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,279
In Black Lotus Gang,

199
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,080
your people shot at us.

200
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,759
Do you know that?

201
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,960
An accident.

202
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,840
Is it just an accident?

203
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,719
What else?

204
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,240
We helped handle

205
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,879
your adversary.

206
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,159
Shouldn't you thank me?

207
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, thank you.

208
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,719
You're welcome.

209
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,320
Ridding the scourges

210
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,160
is justified.

211
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,799
And I've realized

212
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm growing fond of here.

213
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,799
The people here and I

214
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,080
have become more acquainted.

215
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,320
The little girl is really cute.

216
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
No wonder you always run to her house.

217
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't worry.

218
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,879
Everyone will be fine.

219
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
We're all friends.

220
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,359
Long,

221
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,639
is your leg injury okay?

222
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,320
Much better, let's talk business.

223
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,720
Xiu asked me

224
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,039
to attend League General Assembly

225
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,039
to seek support

226
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,000
for Lian'an Town.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
He made you acting chief?

228
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,519
The position is still his.

229
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm attending on his behalf.

230
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,799
That's fine too.

231
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,360
Though it took quite effort,

232
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,440
the outcome is quite satisfactory.

233
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
Yes.

234
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,279
I joined the Five Lakes

235
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
and got close to Xiu.

236
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,639
At first, it was purely tactical.

237
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,960
I slowly feel

238
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,799
I do care about them.

239
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,399
I just got established

240
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,720
in Lian'an Town.

241
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,120
And I have to leave here.

242
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,280
Long,

243
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,920
what should I do?

244
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
Over there,

245
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,919
you'll be all alone.

246
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,679
Be sure to stay safe.

247
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,080
Anyway, it's not too far?

248
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,200
I can just come back.

249
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,399
Have you figured out
the situation over there?

250
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,480
Xiu said

251
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,120
this is not a peaceful assembly

252
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,480
but rather a battle

253
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,600
for the next head.

254
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
According to Xiu,

255
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
the head, Mr. He,

256
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
has been seriously ill

257
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,200
and doesn't have much time.

258
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,559
His two children,

259
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,799
within the gang,

260
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,919
have their own factions.

261
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,039
When his children fight,

262
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,000
he hopes for a peaceful resolution.

263
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,519
So,

264
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,360
due to the succession,

265
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
he is convening all branches

266
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
to attend the General Assembly.

267
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,919
The mission is...

268
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,879
Position myself correctly
during this upheaval

269
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,279
and make a contribution,

270
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,440
so that I can become

271
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,120
the right-hand man of the future head.

272
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,399
By then,

273
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,200
I can use my business connections

274
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,279
to get what I want.

275
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,039
The intel on the transport line

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,840
would be in my hands.

277
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,240
It's easier said than done.

278
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,120
Everyone attending is a Chief.

279
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,279
To seize the opportunity to rise up,

280
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,080
you must make great achievements.

281
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,399
Yes.

282
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,879
Nothing is impossible.

283
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,440
There is always a way through.

284
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,639
But when Tianhai Sect arrives,

285
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,000
I won't be here.

286
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,360
With the influence
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

287
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,840
in any case,

288
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,480
you can't compete with Tianhai Sect.

289
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,240
But if you can gain support
from the general alliance,

290
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,759
it'll be a whole different story.

291
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,799
I think so.

292
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,480
It depends on your abilities.

293
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,160
Long,

294
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,279
I need to trouble you.

295
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,000
Go ahead.

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,759
You're always

297
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,159
troubling me.

298
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,919
I know your legs hurt.

299
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,360
But when I'm not around,

300
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,600
can you figure out

301
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,759
to keep an eye on Qi?

302
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,159
Worried about them?

303
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,039
Bobo today

304
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,480
has already threatened me.

305
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,800
Don't worry.

306
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,879
Protecting the folks

307
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,480
is also our duty.

308
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I will notify you

309
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,639
the situation at any time.

310
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,920
Luckily you are here.

311
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,519
Told you it had to be me.

312
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,440
Long,

313
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,159
I haven't been here long.

314
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,519
But you've been here

315
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,679
for quite some time, right?

316
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,119
Do you miss home?

317
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not like you.

318
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,679
You came

319
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,840
with a specific task.

320
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,480
When I came, Chief Xu said

321
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,799
the duration was unclear.

322
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,360
Maybe two or three years,

323
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,240
or maybe just

324
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,360
stay indefinitely.

325
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,800
Forever?

326
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,519
Not returning?

327
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,560
I don't know.

328
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,440
Initially, I opened this shop

329
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,759
for an identity.

330
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,279
Now I even feel

331
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,680
I'm just a restaurant owner.

332
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,279
When there's nothing to do,

333
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,079
I just watch food videos.

334
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,959
Sometimes,

335
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,519
if you stay

336
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,599
in the play for long,

337
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,000
you won't know if it's real.

338
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,919
Long,

339
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,759
it's not your first mission, is it?

340
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,840
Of course not.

341
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,839
When I was in public security...

342
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,039
There's no point telling you

343
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,039
these old stories.

344
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,240
What about you?

345
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,519
Secret agent

346
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,000
or merchant,

347
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,880
which one is the real you?

348
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:51,607
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

349
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:55,168
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

350
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:59,070
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

351
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:05,370
♪At least the shadow
