00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,752
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:03,680
(The person I least wanted to see
in the past two years is you, Chief Xu)

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Tianshuang.

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,120
Do you still remember the last time

6
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,519
we stood here?

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,240
Chief Xu.

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,400
You didn't go to such length

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,799
to reminisce with me, right?

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,159
It's been a while.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
Wanted to see how you're doing now.

12
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,079
Inspection is just for show, you know.

13
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,760
We're on the same side.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,560
The gun is one thing.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
Really have to torture me?

16
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,560
We had no choice.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,159
If we didn't do this,

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,599
how would we know your current quality,

19
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,439
right?

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I've already left.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,799
Why test me?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,079
Indeed,

23
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,719
you've changed a lot
these past two years.

24
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,239
But your core,

25
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,000
your loyalty, astuteness,

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,040
and willpower, are still there.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,680
Most importantly,

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,400
the fire in your heart is still there.

29
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,840
What fire?

30
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,159
I'm relying on water now.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm dealing in seafood.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,040
I never said you couldn't
deal in seafood.

33
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,000
About this mission,

34
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,840
the agency has decided

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,039
you're the most suitable.

36
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,759
Mission?

37
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,639
You have so many young talents.

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
Why me?

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,199
In terms of the mission's goal,

40
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,919
you meet the conditions best
to get close to them,

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,639
and are professionally trained.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,319
Plus, your test performance.

43
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,800
How about taking a trip?

44
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,759
For how long?

45
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,000
That's hard to say.

46
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,159
I get paid?

47
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,560
Out of your own pocket.

48
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,520
Is my safety guaranteed?

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,479
What do you think?

50
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,360
Chief Xu.

51
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,000
You won't even offer me anything
to make me work for you?

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
That may be necessary for others,

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,240
but not for you.

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,520
Because when you first came,

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,919
you weren't after these things.

56
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,199
It was still the same when you left.

57
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,039
Joining or not

58
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,879
is all up to your own thoughts.

59
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,919
Two years have passed.

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,639
The agency needs you now.

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
Do you still need to think about it?

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,759
I've changed over these years.

63
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,759
Not the same as before.

64
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,680
I was reckless

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
and feared nothing.

66
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,759
Now I realize

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,240
that I've become like Tianliang,

68
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,439
starting to be afraid.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,960
Afraid of what?

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,680
Everything.

71
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,360
Achieving nothing,

72
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,919
aging, illness, and death.

73
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,319
Being a nobody.

74
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,919
Afraid that one day, on impulse,

75
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,800
I would lose the life

76
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,800
that Tianliang gave me.

77
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,400
Do you know what I'm most afraid of?

78
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,080
You are afraid
that what happened that year

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
might happen again, right?

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
Tianshuang.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,840
How many times have I told you?

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,240
Zhang Tianliang's death
wasn't your fault.

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,599
I understand that.

84
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,159
But I don't want

85
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,319
to experience it again.

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
I think

87
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm doing fine here.

88
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,720
I've also gotten used to it.

89
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,320
Tianshuang.

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,199
You think you are more and more
like Tianliang.

91
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,720
Tell me,

92
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,519
do you know what kind of person

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,959
Tianliang is?

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
What kind of person?

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,279
Have you ever thought about it?

96
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,600
Tianliang was so cautious

97
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,079
and so passionate about life,

98
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,959
but why did he still join

99
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,439
such a dangerous mission?

100
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,799
Why?

101
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,239
What is this?

102
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,519
Tianliang's diary.

103
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,399
We only found it

104
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,319
after you left.

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,480
Tianshuang.

106
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,959
You may feel you are not
like you were back then.

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,839
But in my eyes,

108
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,560
you couldn't do this mission back then,

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
but now you can.

110
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,960
Why?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,840
How about this?

112
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,240
When you finish reading this diary,

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,480
no matter what choice you make,

114
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,639
I won't try to persuade you anymore.

115
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
No need.

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,000
I definitely won't go.

117
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:08,879
(Lian'an Town, Taiwan Province, China)

118
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,199
(In Taiwan, China?)

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,240
(Their Intelligence Agency's personnel)

120
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,720
(and goods coming to the mainland)

121
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,079
(need underground routes.)

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,959
(And like many things there,)

123
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,800
(these routes are inconvenient)

124
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
(for the Intelligence Agency to manage.)

125
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,480
(They are controlled by gangs.)

126
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,600
(So you need someone)

127
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,199
(to infiltrate the gangs)

128
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,279
(and gather intelligence on the routes.)

129
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,800
(One more thing.)

130
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,439
(That supplier of yours,)

131
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,399
(Yu,)

132
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,120
(actually is close to the local gangs.)

133
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,700
(Lian'an Town)

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
He, I'm going to drop it.

135
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Three, two, one.

136
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,160
Awesome, He.

137
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,800
A hero from martial arts films.

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
Change to that one.

139
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,759
This one? It's too short.

140
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,399
Too short.

141
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,239
Hold it.

142
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,199
Be careful.

143
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,759
Don't cut me.

144
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,599
Higher.

145
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,120
This is too short.

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,720
Come on.

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
Be careful.

148
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,279
We are gangsters.

149
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,600
Now everything seems fine.

150
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,839
But one day,

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,199
we may lose our lives.

152
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,360
Practice more.

153
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,240
Practice more.

154
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
The betel nuts?

155
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,039
Betel nuts.

156
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,479
Dude.

157
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,879
Cosplay huh?

158
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,319
This prop is so cool!

159
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
It's a real blade.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,240
I thought it was a toy.

161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
How to find Five Lakes?

162
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,039
Five Lakes Alliance?

163
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,959
Look, there's a road.

164
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,000
There's an intersection

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
ahead.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,959
Where are you from?

167
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm from the mainland,

168
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
coming here for a trip. Why?

169
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,360
What about Five Lakes?

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,040
Black Lotus messed with me.

171
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,319
What did you say?

172
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,000
He, don't.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,240
Don't talk like that.

174
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
Don't be mad.

175
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
What?

176
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,760
What's wrong?

177
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,800
Say it again.

178
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,439
You a Black Lotus?

179
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,439
What are you doing?

180
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,319
Why so agitated?

181
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,159
He.

182
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,439
Are you serious?

183
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,519
Is your buddy insane?

184
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,040
What are you doing?

185
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,040
Is your buddy nuts?

186
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:19,959
He, He.

187
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,799
Seriously?

188
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,359
Messing with me?

189
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,680
He.

190
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
Come on!

191
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,759
Don't play dirty!

192
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,759
I play dirty?

193
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,960
He messed with me first.

194
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,399
Are you okay?

195
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,159
Where's the water?

196
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,999
He.

197
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:38,720
It stings!

198
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,879
Is Black Lotus Gang so good?

199
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,240
Bro, be more civilized.

200
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,159
Don't use the spray.

201
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,159
He was using a blade.

202
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,240
Can't I use some tool?

203
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,919
You defamed us Black Lotus first.

204
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,399
Save your breath.

205
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,799
Didn't you learn karate?

206
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,720
Hit him.

207
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,879
I also know kung fu.

208
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Are you sure?

209
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm sure.

210
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,440
Come on!

211
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,960
Kid, don't be so arrogant, alright?

212
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
What exactly do you do?

213
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,679
Didn't I tell you?

214
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,039
I'm here for a trip.

215
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,759
Remember, my name is Chen Tianshuang.

216
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,159
Why so arrogant?

217
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,599
Chen Tianshuang.

218
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,960
Do you know Black Lotus Gang?

219
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,919
You're doomed.

220
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,399
Are you asking for trouble?

221
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,560
Get off me.

222
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,360
Stop spanking me.

223
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
It hurts a lot.

224
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,519
Black Lotus Gang is the boss?

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm telling you.

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,159
I'll show you who's the boss.

227
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,039
Get off me.

228
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,279
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

229
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,160
What?

230
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,399
Shut up.

231
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,280
Get lost.

232
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,720
What are you doing?

233
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,519
What are you doing?

234
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,960
You want the hard way?

235
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,519
Open your mouth.

236
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,999
Open up.

237
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,159
Stop swearing.

238
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,559
At such a young age,

239
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,200
watch your language, alright?

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,919
I'll ask you something.

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,519
How many gangs are in Lian'an Town?

242
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,559
Only two gangs now:
us and the Five Lakes Alliance.

243
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,440
Do you get along?

244
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,039
We are archenemies.

245
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,879
We have some differences
in philosophies.

246
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,080
So our relationship isn't very good.

247
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,559
How long have you joined the gang?

248
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,159
Why is the Black Lotus Gang so arrogant?

249
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,679
It's still...

250
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:41,679
Shut up.

251
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,600
It's still quite young.

252
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,159
It's expanded in the past few years.

253
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,120
He, don't speak anymore.

254
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
Can you be a little more detailed?

255
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,200
For example,

256
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,159
some insider information
known only by locals.

257
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,639
Locals?

258
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,159
Right.

259
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,360
The tourist guide in my bag

260
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,320
has annotations on it.

261
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,120
It will help you.

262
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,960
Really?

263
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
In the bag.

264
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,599
He.

265
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
Quiet.

266
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,200
- You can't beat him.
- This?

267
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes.

268
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,159
And that one, yes.

269
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,399
This one?

270
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,279
There are notes, too?

271
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,919
So detailed.

272
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,600
Right?

273
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,159
I originally wanted to be a tour guide.

274
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,159
But Five Lakes controls

275
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,120
the tourism industry.

276
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,639
So...

277
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,840
Can I borrow it?

278
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,919
Borrow? I'll give it to you.

279
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,919
Really?

280
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,399
By the way,

281
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,320
there's money in it.

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
It's yours too.

283
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,080
You're quite smart.

284
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,000
You should learn from him.

285
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Hear me?

286
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,240
After all, He started it first.

287
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,720
Just take it as an apology.

288
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,480
Shut up.

289
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,759
He, don't speak anymore.

290
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,080
You can't beat him anyway.

291
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,840
This one.

292
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,519
Don't speak.

293
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,840
I don't know where to put it.

294
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,680
This bag?

295
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,440
It's yours too.

296
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,559
This too?

297
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,759
Well, you're quite smart.

298
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,120
So, can you let me go?

299
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,679
For your sake.

300
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,280
I'll let you go.

301
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,080
And your buddy too.

302
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,200
Thank you, bro.

303
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Bro, hurry.

304
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,519
Let me wipe it.

305
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,359
Wipe it.

306
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,119
Wipe it clean.

307
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,039
Listen.

308
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,759
I was worried you couldn't
handle the beating.

309
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,919
What a coincidence.

310
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,799
I suddenly need to pee.

311
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,559
What are you doing?

312
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,399
What are you doing?

313
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,600
Bro, bro.

314
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,639
No, no, no!

315
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,479
Bro, bro.

316
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,000
Come on, bro.

317
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,600
Bro.

318
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,679
(Long's Beef Noodles)
What do you mean I'm sly?

319
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Mom, don't talk nonsense
if you don't understand.

320
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,559
I won't be going back for now.

321
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,879
Alright, you play mahjong.

322
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,679
Black Lotus Gang.

323
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,639
Son.

324
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,159
From the mainland?

325
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,480
Why? Am I not allowed to come?

326
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,840
You offended Black Lotus?

327
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,639
They messed with me, okay?

328
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,120
Bro.

329
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
The police here

330
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,679
are on the same side as Black Lotus?

331
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,639
Not exactly.

332
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,639
Everyone knows each other
in such a small place.

333
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,080
It's normal if they're familiar.

334
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,919
Then why are they so aggressive?

335
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,759
Aggressive?

336
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,119
Not really.

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,560
Bro.

338
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,320
Are there other gangs in Lian'an Town?

339
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,919
Five Lakes Alliance.

340
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,919
I heard they are recruiting.

341
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,359
Finished?

342
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,240
Five Lakes Alliance?

343
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,360
Young man.

344
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,840
Don't be so worked up.

345
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,919
Our place is different
from the mainland.

346
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,559
Suffering a little loss

347
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,879
might be a good thing.

348
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
You better go back early.

349
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,240
What's different?

350
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,519
I think it's the same.

351
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,679
Black Lotus Gang, right?

352
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,200
Watch how I'll deal with you.

353
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,799
Thank you, sir.

354
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,759
Come again next time.

355
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,720
That's a reckless young guy.

356
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,120
Well, he's young.

357
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,600
He'll learn it.

358
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,720
Every one of us has gone through this.

359
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,720
Why do I feel like

360
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,399
he won't stop until he hits a wall?

361
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,639
Let him hit the wall then.

362
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,799
It won't cause much trouble.

363
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,759
Lang, remember to collect the money.

364
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,440
He.

365
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,519
Come on, wipe it off.

366
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
You just gagged me.

367
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,399
You let him pee on me!

368
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,399
Well, just go home and take a shower.

369
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,240
Take a shower?

370
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
Take a shower?

371
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,600
Come on.

372
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,480
I'll pee on you.

373
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,440
- Come on.
- What then?

374
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,600
We can't beat him anyway.

375
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,120
Can't beat him?

376
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,080
I can't beat...

377
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,519
Chen Tianshuang.

378
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,159
Chen Tianshuang!

379
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,440
I won't let you off!

380
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:12,864
(International Trade Company Ltd.)

381
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:20,776
(Wenhe Chain Pharmacy)

382
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,480
Sir,

383
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
would you like to try
