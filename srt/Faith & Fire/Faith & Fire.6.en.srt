=Episode 6=

3
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,712
(Being too serious won't do.
They call me "greedy and lustful"? Yes!)

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,640
And then?

5
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,159
Actually, we both know in our hearts

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,480
if we continue to fight,
it's a lose-lose situation.

7
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,040
Even if we can't reach an agreement

8
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,599
but only a temporary truce,

9
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,239
it's beneficial for both of us.

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,599
Did Lin Yongning agree?

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,040
Of course, he didn't.

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,040
It's not that simple.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,959
I have to do a good gesture.

14
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,400
You're not selling me out, are you?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,079
Chen Tianshuang,

16
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,400
you're taking yourself too seriously.

17
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,920
Well,

18
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,120
I'm your most awesome buddy.

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,359
That's why I'm deserving of you,
the most handsome Xiu.

20
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,079
Tianshuang,

21
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,680
what do you value the most?

22
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,959
Me?

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,519
What do I value?

24
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,760
I'm very vulgar.

25
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,439
Between greed and lust,

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
I am torn equally.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,959
If that's true,

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,200
you should go hang out
with Lin Yongning.

29
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,280
I have a conflict with his son.

30
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,360
Conflicts are temporary.

31
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,879
What a person is like

32
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,919
depends on what he cares about the most.

33
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,240
Xiu, I don't like

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,479
hearing that.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,199
I am a vulgar person.

36
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,680
But I have an attitude

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,599
and dignity.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,199
Before I joined you people,

39
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,560
I might have considered that.

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,039
But since I joined you,

41
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,120
I won't regret it.

42
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,639
We businesspeople

43
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,719
also have principles.

44
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,960
People can have no money.

45
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,599
But they can't have no credit.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
I absolutely won't

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,280
be a person who breaks promises.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,879
Xiu,

49
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,719
if you don't believe me,

50
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,719
you can kick me out right now.

51
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,039
I didn't mean that.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,639
Otherwise, why would I
have brought you here?

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,919
Since I agreed to you joining us,

54
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,400
that means I trust you a lot.

55
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,520
After we go back,

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,919
I'll even assign tasks to you.

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,439
Tasks?

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,680
If you want to benefit
from being one of us, you have to work.

59
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,840
Sure, no problem.

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,599
Just leave it to me.

61
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:09,952
(Five Lakes Alliance Travel Agency)

62
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,120
Five Lakes Alliance Travel Agency?

63
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,039
That's right.

64
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,080
Our travel agency
also offers lodging, dining,

65
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,039
(This season is perfect for travel.)
and special souvenirs.

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,599
Look at this.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,280
All designed by us.

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,960
You've been to our spa, right?

69
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,240
The Gang Boss Bath
is our special service.

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,039
Once you become a platinum member,

71
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,719
you can even personally experience

72
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,639
the act of punishing a subordinate.

73
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,680
Of course, it's just for show.

74
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,840
There's no real punishment.

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,719
Our limits are well established.

76
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,080
I heard that Five Lakes Alliance

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
is in the tourism business.

78
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,960
I didn't expect it to be so...

79
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,719
Formal?

80
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,919
Ordinary.

81
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,680
You thought we were
like those in movies,

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,520
collecting protection fees
with machetes?

83
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,319
Well,

84
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,479
Black Lotus Gang is quite cinematic.

85
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,520
They have gatekeepers.

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
And they are even in suits.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,240
It's quite a big show.

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,439
Now look at ours...

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Here it's over 30 degrees every day.

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Wearing suits and sunglasses?
That's absurd.

91
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,199
What?

92
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,000
Want to guard the door in suits?

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,400
No.

94
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm new here. I just want to learn.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Peng,

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,079
Lian'an Town doesn't really count

97
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,639
as much as an internet-famous

98
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
check-in place, right?

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,079
In terms of reputation,

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
it's not as famous as Kenting or so.

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,360
How can we compete with Black Lotus Gang

102
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,800
if we rely solely on tourism?

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,399
We've been rooted here for so long.

104
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,639
Do we have...?

105
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,079
What?

106
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,959
Besides openly engaging in tourism,

107
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,199
is there any other channel?

108
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,680
Like what?

109
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,199
Smuggling.

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,360
Who told you that?

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,519
No one told me.

112
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,319
I think since we are
a long-established gang,

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,839
shouldn't there be some gray income?

114
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,480
Brat, you came to join us

115
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
for that?

116
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,240
No.

117
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,120
I am now a member
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

118
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,319
I am one of you now.

119
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,399
Peng,

120
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,360
just tell me.

121
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,720
Go ahead.

122
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,600
You've come this late.

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,639
Is there progress?

124
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,959
There's a clue about the underground

125
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,920
transport routes.

126
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,439
Simply put,

127
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
within Five Lakes Alliance,

128
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
there is related business.

129
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,199
But the people controlling the routes

130
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
are their executives.

131
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,680
You can see that Five Lakes Alliance

132
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,399
isn't like a corporatized organization
like Tianhai Sect.

133
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,160
It's more like a large tribe.

134
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,600
The local leaders

135
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,879
control their own turfs,

136
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,839
minding their own.

137
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,360
They only come together
when there's something big.

138
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,240
The channel you mentioned

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
is managed by the He family.

140
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,480
The He family?

141
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,639
Yes.

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
The head of Five Lakes Alliance

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,759
hasn't changed for over 20 years.

144
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,800
His name is Mi.

145
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,399
But I've only met him a few times.

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,879
As the head,

147
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,519
the He family indeed is not close

148
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,680
with other branches.

149
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,000
To get close to them

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
without being discovered,

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,240
I need a reason.

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,600
I heard that after a while,

153
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,399
Five Lakes Alliance HQ
will hold a meeting.

154
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,879
At that time,

155
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,480
each major branch will send people.

156
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,879
That is to say,

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,399
if you can climb up before then,

158
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,319
you may represent the Lian'an branch

159
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,279
to attend the meeting?

160
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,800
The Lian'an branch's structure
is very simple.

161
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,600
In short,

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,160
the chief has the final say.

163
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,839
So the urgent matter now

164
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,920
is for you to gain Xiu's trust.

165
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,000
But he is still observing me.

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,040
I can feel that he likes me a lot,

167
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,800
but he doesn't fully trust me.

168
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,519
Didn't he mention Wen and Wu?

169
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
No.

170
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,600
He said his conflicts
with Black Lotus Gang

171
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
are all business-related.

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,000
But I think he talked with Lin Yongning

173
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,279
about more.

174
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,120
Xiu,

175
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,800
you have been recruiting recently.

176
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,079
Where did Wen and Wu go?

177
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,720
Heilun,

178
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,800
what happened to them
wasn't related to you, right?

179
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,839
How could it be related to me?

180
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,560
These two buddies of mine

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,040
were a bit rash when doing things.

182
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,839
But in the face of major issues,

183
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,519
they wouldn't drop the ball.

184
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,040
I find it hard to believe that no one

185
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
was behind all that.

186
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
Then what do you want?

187
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
To avenge them?

188
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
I don't have any relatives
in Taiwan, China,

189
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
unlike you.

190
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
What do you mean?

191
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,040
We prosper through harmony,

192
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
but we aren't without temper.

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,839
Xiu, don't be so tense.

194
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,079
Harmony brings wealth.

195
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,160
I'll look into the matter

196
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,879
of Wen and Wu for you too.

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,480
We live in the same area.

198
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
We should look out for each other.

199
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,720
Let the past be in the past.

200
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,480
Look forward.

201
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,199
Heilun,

202
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,839
let's not forget

203
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,279
what we do on earth is seen by heaven.

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,639
Tianshuang,

205
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,639
this is just the beginning.

206
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,399
Don't be too eager for quick success.

207
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,240
Not revealing your identity
matters the most.

208
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,399
Understood.

209
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,600
I shouldn't aim too high

210
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,279
but take every step steadily.

211
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,040
I've made plans

212
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,759
for tomorrow.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,879
What will you do?

214
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,800
Which is the busiest street
in Lian'an Town?

215
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,519
Yanjiao Road.

216
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,279
Tomorrow, I will become

217
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,879
the spokesperson for that street.

218
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,000
Spokesperson?

219
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,319
How much for a day?

220
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
It's not even a person.

221
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,919
Ming.

222
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,480
You finally came.

223
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm almost getting heatstroke.

224
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,080
What is this thing?

225
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,679
You don't know Bobo Fish?

226
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,240
The mascot of Lian'an Town.

227
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,679
Five Lakes Alliance designed it.

228
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,240
It is too ugly.

229
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,399
You asked me to come here
to be a mascot?

230
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't think it's that simple.

231
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,600
Once you wear it,
you're not yourself anymore.

232
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,399
Who will I be?

233
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,639
A shabby salted fish?

234
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,080
This is hilarious.

235
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,639
What salted fish?

236
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,759
By wearing it,

237
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,720
you become the embodiment
of this street.

238
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,159
Your every move

239
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,279
will change people's attitude
toward this place.

240
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,159
I saw you dance pretty well.

241
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,320
Why don't you continue?

242
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,559
Come back.

243
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,120
I am out of energy.

244
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,240
But Bobo Fish

245
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,879
should always be full of vitality.

246
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,519
Later, you need to dance energetically.

247
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,639
Got it?

248
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,080
Here.

249
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,639
Don't forget who you are.

250
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,600
Got it.

251
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,399
The embodiment of this street.

252
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,559
Lady, shall we take a photo together?

253
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,919
A photo together?

254
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,600
Let's take a photo together.

255
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,559
Come on.

256
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,720
Look at this fish.

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
How can it be so ugly and miserable?

258
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,279
I really like it.

259
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,080
Yes.

260
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,120
It's too ugly.

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
Let's take a photo.

262
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
Hello, may we take a photo together?

263
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,080
- Okay.
- I want one too.

264
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,159
Let's do it together.

265
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,879
Take a photo.

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Come and take a photo.

267
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
Come over here.

268
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,799
Don't push.

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,679
Ming? Ming?

270
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,399
Here.

271
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,440
Ming,

272
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,919
I understand you now.

273
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,039
I am now the embodiment of this street.

274
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,600
You...

275
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,039
Don't come tomorrow.

276
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,000
Leave it to me.

277
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
I am now the very Bobo Fish.

278
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,080
Tianshuang.

279
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,120
What are you doing?

280
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Your dad

281
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,080
doesn't like others sitting
in his place.

282
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,639
None of your business.

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,919
He.

284
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,919
Being a fish for a day,

285
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,559
now I'm finally human again.

286
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,840
I said it would be tiring.

287
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,120
But you

288
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,399
did work hard today.

289
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
You didn't curse just now.

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm a bit unaccustomed.

291
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,799
It's really not easy
being a good mascot.

292
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,039
They must be pure-hearted like me.

293
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,039
Eat.

294
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,799
Even food won't shut your mouth.

295
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
Tianshuang, Ming.

296
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,320
I've finally found you.

297
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,440
Why are you here?

298
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,759
I helped my dad by the sea.

299
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,879
Done, then I rushed here.

300
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,159
Do you know?

301
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,200
Bobo Fish is trending on the forum.

302
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,200
Let me see.

303
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,840
Look.

304
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,600
Everyone is saying

305
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
that Bobo Fish was double-standard.

306
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
It chased after girls

307
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,039
but was rude to the guys and beat them.

308
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,200
So you've been
chasing after girls all day today

309
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,679
all for attention

310
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,840
intentionally?

311
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
You don't actually think
I'm just lustful, do you?

312
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,000
To get famous nowadays,
you need to be talked about.

313
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,200
Tianshuang, you're so good at this.

314
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,600
You get me.

315
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,799
That's just my first intention.

316
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,080
There's a second?

317
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,879
When we first came here,

318
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,120
they treated us like newbies.

319
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
They made us do this.

320
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,240
But if...

321
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,519
I mean, if

322
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,720
Yanjiao Road improves at all

323
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,879
because of people like us,

324
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,559
Xiu will definitely know

325
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,000
that we are reliable buddies

326
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
and promising talents.

327
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
So what should we do?

328
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,080
Chao,

329
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,639
what's Yanjiao Road's reputation online?

330
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,840
It's average.

331
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,480
Some say it's not bad.

332
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
Some advise caution with shady shops.

333
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,759
I've been running around today

334
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,840
just to find out

335
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,080
the real reason behind this.

336
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,519
(Three hours ago)
The skilled technicians

337
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
in his shop have long gone.

338
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm telling you.

339
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,120
If you go to his shop,

340
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
he might be the one massaging you.

341
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Listen to me.

342
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,360
You have many bad reviews.

343
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,080
How dare you say that?

344
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,519
How did I get those bad reviews?

345
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,000
It's because of your fake accounts!

346
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,120
Forget it. Let us go.

347
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,720
We're leaving.

348
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,399
Wait.

349
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,440
Don't leave.

350
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Slow down a bit.

351
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,799
Oh my.

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
It's because they shout
at each other on the street every day.

353
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,360
When tourists see it,

354
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,480
how will they feel?

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
They mess around like this every day.

356
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,879
Don't people around protest?

357
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,200
What's the use of that?

358
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,120
They might as well

359
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,919
get scolded too.

360
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,799
It's really upsetting.

361
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,200
I don't know why they act like this.

362
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,480
It's been so many years.

363
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,960
They'd rather ruin their own business

364
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,200
than let each other have peace.

365
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,440
Maybe it's not just because of business.

366
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,080
There must be other reasons
behind it, right?

367
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,519
I'll ask my master.

368
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,679
Master?

369
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,879
What master?

370
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,039
Bagua.

371
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,919
Bagua?

372
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,080
Like a Bagua Palm master?

373
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,639
It's the Bagua for gossip.

374
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,279
Done.

375
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,399
My master already told me

376
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,320
who we should go to.

377
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,519
Let's go tomorrow.

378
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,639
So soon?

379
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,279
Is your master that amazing?

380
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,639
Of course.

381
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,799
My master is super amazing.

382
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,200
He knows everything here.

383
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,320
Can you introduce me to him someday?

384
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,799
I'm quite a curious person.

385
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,720
I also like gossip.

386
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,120
Really?

387
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,519
No way.

388
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,399
My master is very low-key.

389
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,279
It's true.

390
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
I've never even met him.

391
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,840
Stingy.

392
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,919
Forget it.

393
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,480
Let's go to that person tomorrow.

394
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,840
Ming,

395
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,399
tomorrow...

396
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,440
Got it.

397
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,080
Leave Bobo Fish to me.

398
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,293
- Come on!
- Come on!

399
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,000
(Ai Mo Li: Full Body Massage, Foot Massage)
Here it is.

400
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,480
Sir,

401
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,879
you said last time you'd surely come.

402
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,039
So are you here to try it today?

403
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,399
Try it?

404
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,120
Is there any service?

405
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,799
Tianshuang.

406
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
I came to see your shop owner today.

407
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,720
She is inside.

408
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,519
So,

409
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,919
the service?

410
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,960
Next time.

411
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,919
I'll surely come.

412
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,039
What's with that? Next time?

413
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,159
It's hard for you to resist women?

414
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,120
My interests are still quite vulgar.

415
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,519
If I were Tang Monk,

416
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,200
the journey would end
in the Land of Women.

417
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,559
Sounds pretty good.

418
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,039
Ms. Li!

419
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,039
It's all my fault.

420
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,039
It's all your fault?

421
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,840
The three of us grew up together.

422
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
The two of them
have liked me since childhood.

423
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,519
But later I married another man.

424
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,320
However, I got divorced.

425
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,600
After the divorce, I set my ambition

426
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
to be the owner

427
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,919
of the top massage shop on Yanjiao Road.

428
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,039
They listened

429
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,600
and started massage shops too.

430
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,000
Ten years have passed just like that.

431
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,360
Ten years?

432
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
A-And

433
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
it's still unresolved?

434
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,960
Because they misunderstood
from the beginning.

435
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,240
I was talking about being the owner

436
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,879
of the NO.1 massage shop
on Yanjiao Road,

437
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,200
not marrying the owner of the NO.1.

438
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,919
Ms. Li,

439
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,639
your shop is now the NO.1.

440
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,840
The two of them combined can't compete.

441
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,039
Yes.

442
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,320
This is obviously a misunderstanding.

443
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,159
Didn't you explain it to them?

444
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,720
You know,

445
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
men value their dignity.

446
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,799
Moreover, I didn't get remarried later.

447
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,120
They might think

448
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,639
they still have a chance.

449
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,440
And they've been competing

450
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,600
for so long.

451
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
If they stop now,

452
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,399
won't it be embarrassing?

453
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,919
They won't change their bad tempers.

454
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,000
But if they continue like this,

455
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,519
it affects the whole street.

456
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,240
What can I do?

457
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,279
I can't just marry someone

458
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,839
because of that.

459
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,079
Maybe you can.

460
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,599
Can my life's big matter

461
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,079
be made lightly as a joke?

462
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,240
I don't mean you should actually marry.

463
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,400
But if it's fake dating,

464
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,880
would you mind?

465
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,960
Who would I be fake dating?

466
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,680
I now only like lean, fair-skinned,

467
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,200
and rebellious young handsome guys.

468
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,960
Ms. Li,

469
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,880
men

470
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,480
of different styles

471
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,240
have their own different flavors.

472
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,599
As I get older,
I now only like younger men.

473
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,119
Younger men?

474
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:46,626
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

475
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:50,126
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

476
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:54,038
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

477
00:17:54,237 --> 00:18:00,142
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
