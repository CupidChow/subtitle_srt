00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:03,712
(Some beliefs are not understood
by everyone!)

4
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Speak.

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,239
Speak?

6
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,560
Even if I tell you, you won't believe.

7
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,400
Alright.

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,480
I'll say it again.

9
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,760
I just took a job

10
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,680
to pick up someone at the airport.

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,959
Just to earn some money.

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,159
It's not easy to earn money nowadays.

13
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:29,879
I didn't know

14
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,959
he's a technical expert.

15
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,560
Right?

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,760
Or, I wouldn't have done it.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,519
There's no kidnapping.

18
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,719
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,120
You have my phone.

20
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,599
You can make a call

21
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,719
to check the person

22
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,079
who asked me to pick him up.

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,159
The chat log and the deposit.

24
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,519
I was paid this morning.

25
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,480
Go check it.

26
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,920
Don't believe?

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Then I'll say it again.

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,879
Mr. Cai.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,719
I think since he's willing
to be the bait,

30
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,840
he's definitely prepared

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,039
to be caught.

32
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,719
This interrogation

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,199
won't work.

34
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,759
Many people in despair

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
think they can hold out.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,960
I want to see

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,599
how long he can hang on.

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
Chen Tianshuang again?

39
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,039
He hasn't been confirmed
to be the gunman,

40
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,639
but it shouldn't be

41
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,439
someone else.

42
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,080
Great.

43
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,000
Now,

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,319
Cai Desheng

45
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,879
will never doubt me again.

46
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,080
Really?

47
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,199
What do you mean?

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,080
Nothing.

49
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,599
Taixiang.

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,199
Based on my understanding
of Chen Tianshuang,

51
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,879
I'm afraid of surprises.

52
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,000
He's been caught.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What else can he do?

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
Cai Desheng's place

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,159
is a one-way street.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Understood.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
Are you sleepy?

58
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,879
Do you want to sleep?

59
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,280
We're on the same side.

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
We don't want to torture you.

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
As long as you speak,

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,560
you can have whatever you want.

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,199
You've been here for quite a while.

64
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,120
Do you know Luo Yaqi?

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
She is

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
your girlfriend, right?

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,479
Or,

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,839
you already regard her as family?

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you want to see her?

70
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,959
I'll talk.

71
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,560
I'm Chen Tianshuang,

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
a former national security agent.

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,800
I retired years ago,

74
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,399
and was called back not long ago,

75
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,720
as a secret agent sent to Taiwan, China.

76
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,120
Codename,

77
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,720
Parrot.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,759
I was asked

79
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,920
to infiltrate the gang
as a seafood merchant,

80
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,759
to gain the trust of people around me,

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,680
and to make preparations

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,639
for my real mission.

83
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,240
What is your real mission?

84
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,040
Cooperate with our mole
hidden in Tianhai Sect

85
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,839
and help him clear the suspicion.

86
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,560
Go on.

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
To avoid his exposure,

88
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,759
when he was suspected again,

89
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,480
I received an order

90
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,079
to shoot him

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,079
to stage a self-sacrifice act.

92
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,360
Then

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,639
who is he?

94
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,959
Huang Zhixing.

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Did Mr. Cai find out the truth?

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,279
Mr. Cai.

97
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,160
Our people have verified it.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,079
Everything Chen Tianshuang said

99
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,240
is basically true.

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
That means

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,519
his story is the same
as Zheng Taixiang's.

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,920
Huang Zhixing

103
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,800
getting shot

104
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,360
was entirely

105
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,040
a self-sacrifice act from the beginning.

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
He first protected himself

107
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,839
and then

108
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,360
framed Zheng Taixiang.

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,879
Should be correct.

110
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,480
If Chen Tianshuang

111
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,639
really is a trained agent

112
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,240
from the Chinese mainland,

113
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,439
why did he tell everything

114
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
at the beginning?

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,240
Plus, we all know about his feud

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,120
with Huang Zhixing

117
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,199
in Lian'an Town.

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,079
When he was caught

119
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,439
and tortured badly,

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,519
he could endure it.

121
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
So, when he came to our place,

122
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,240
before we made a move,

123
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,879
why did he start talking

124
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,600
and tell everything at once?

125
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,160
Moreover,

126
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,439
does the process

127
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,759
of his capture

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,639
seem like it's planned?

129
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,360
You mean

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
he was lying to us?

131
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,319
With my years of experience
in interrogation,

132
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,079
I can tell whether a person

133
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,000
is telling the truth.

134
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
But about the things

135
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,879
Chen Tianshuang said,

136
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,199
I'm not sure

137
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
whether they are true or not.

138
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,600
Either

139
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,279
he's telling the truth,

140
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,559
or

141
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,399
he has an ulterior motive.

142
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,279
Then

143
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,440
what motive could it be?

144
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,440
A perfect lie

145
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,080
often contains

146
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,159
more than ninety percent truth.

147
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,559
Even if

148
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,559
one hundred percent of it is true,

149
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,440
as long as

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
he changes a name,

151
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,600
it'll become completely different.

152
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,159
Then,

153
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,159
how about we verify it?

154
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,080
Alright then.

155
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,919
Let the Pigeon fly.

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,799
Chief Xu.

157
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:34,560
(File Cover)

158
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,000
Chief Xu, shall we do it?

159
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,679
Don't rush yet.

160
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,440
Make sure he sends the message
before taking action.

161
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,120
Got it.

162
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,279
You said you have a way

163
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,159
to prove my identity to Cai Desheng.

164
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,360
How to prove it?

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,399
Tianshuang, think about it.

166
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,600
Since I can send you to Taiwan, China,

167
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,919
the Intelligence Agency

168
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,360
can also send people here.

169
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,240
Have we found out

170
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,039
the mole of the Intelligence Agency?

171
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,000
He's been undercover
as the supervisor of cleaners

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,240
for many years.

173
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,759
He's been cautious.

174
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,519
But he doesn't know

175
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,120
we've already confirmed
his real identity.

176
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,679
One won't believe

177
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,720
some intel,

178
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,799
no matter what others say.

179
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,279
But if it was uncovered by his own man,

180
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,559
who risked his life

181
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,080
to get the intel before he was caught,

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,879
will Cai Desheng

183
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,679
believe it?

184
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:39,776
(Chen Tianshuang, Top Secret Files)

185
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,768
(Codename, Pushpin)

186
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
You are the Pigeon, right?

187
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,000
It's just as I thought.

188
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,000
About his information,

189
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,120
Chen Tianshuang said the truth.

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,240
However, the mole

191
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,440
is not Huang Zhixing,

192
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,159
but

193
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,480
Zheng Taixiang.

194
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,200
Looks like you've
finally told the truth.

195
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,960
I've said everything I know.

196
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,240
Can you let me go now?

197
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,639
I'm of no use to you now.

198
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,480
I still need you to do one thing.

199
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,360
What?

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
Come with me to meet someone.

201
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,440
Who?

202
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,120
Chief Xu.

203
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,000
I understand the plan.

204
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,960
I have one last question.

205
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,080
Now all the arrangements

206
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,919
require a condition

207
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,480
that Cai Desheng

208
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,200
doesn't believe what I say.

209
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,240
But what if he believes?

210
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,480
That's impossible.

211
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,000
Because he's inherently suspicious?

212
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,480
Not only that.

213
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,519
Cai Desheng believes

214
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,440
that people always

215
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,960
seek benefits and avoid harm.

216
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,840
So there's one thing

217
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,240
that he'll never understand.

218
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,399
What could

219
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,440
Huang Zhixing gain from assisting

220
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,720
the Chinese mainland?

221
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,679
What could he gain?

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,639
Cai Desheng certainly knows

223
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,799
that in this world,

224
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,840
many people can be

225
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,919
bewitched

226
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,679
or instigated,

227
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,679
but that doesn't include Huang Zhixing.

228
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,399
He also knows

229
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,000
that in this world, some people

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
are devoted to their beliefs.

231
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,759
Sacrificing for their beliefs

232
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,559
is their lifelong pursuit.

233
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,080
But that also doesn't

234
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,879
include Huang Zhixing.

235
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,600
That's true.

236
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,200
He is born in Taiwan, China.

237
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,639
In his career,

238
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,960
he has great resources

239
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
and a bright future.

240
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,639
In life,

241
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,879
he's concerned about his daughter.

242
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,879
Everyone knows that.

243
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,320
In Cai Desheng's eyes,

244
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,840
Huang Zhixing

245
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,200
should be the same

246
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,039
as him,

247
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,440
stopping at nothing
to achieve his goals.

248
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,720
Morality is just rhetoric.

249
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,799
Interests

250
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,480
are the only standard
for measuring things.

251
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,759
Zheng Taixiang

252
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,879
might help Chinese mainland

253
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,759
for his child.

254
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,559
What about Huang Zhixing?

255
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:17,159
What can he get if he helps

256
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
the Chinese mainland?

257
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,440
Nothing.

258
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,200
But the cost

259
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,480
is risking his life.

260
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,720
Yes.

261
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,080
This doesn't make sense to Cai Desheng.

262
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,200
So,

263
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,879
he won't believe you.

264
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,919
You really are good
at making up stories.

265
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,440
But why does

266
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,399
Huang Zhixing

267
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,600
put in so much effort

268
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,159
to take this risk?

269
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,600
For the national reunification.

270
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
You are intelligence personnel

271
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,480
from the Chinese mainland.

272
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,159
You've long been

273
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,240
completely brainwashed.

274
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,799
But Huang Zhixing

275
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,120
is completely different from you.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,519
Do you think you know him well?

277
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,879
I know he's been hiding

278
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,200
something

279
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,720
from me.

280
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,639
I also won't rule out

281
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,519
that

282
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,480
I still have doubts about him.

283
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,120
But,

284
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,799
you tell me

285
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
that for

286
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,759
the national reunification,

287
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,399
he would sacrifice

288
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,159
his family

289
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,879
and himself?

290
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,759
Let me say something frank.

291
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,799
If we really

292
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,360
started a war one day,

293
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,519
for Huang Zhixing,

294
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,960
it wouldn't be difficult
to get wind of it

295
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,519
in advance.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,440
By then,

297
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,480
he could take his entire family

298
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,679
flee far away,

299
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,519
to America,

300
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,639
Europe,

301
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,519
or anywhere in the world.

302
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,240
Why can't he?

303
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,000
But you're telling me now

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,039
he's risking losing everything

305
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,120
just for that reason you mentioned?

306
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,639
Tell me,

307
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,240
does this make sense?

308
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,759
Do you have evidence?

309
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,519
We just confirmed

310
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,039
that in your so-called Pushpin Plan,

311
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,840
actually,

312
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,039
Huang Zhixing is just a decoy.

313
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,159
The real mole

314
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,919
is Zheng Taixiang.

315
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,480
Taixiang.

316
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,039
It's okay.

317
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,119
Let's go.

318
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,119
Where is Zheng Taixiang?

319
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,839
On the way to the chemical plant.

320
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,400
Catch him?

321
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,200
Yes.

322
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,599
He should be mentally prepared.

323
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Be careful.

324
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,119
Okay.

325
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,240
What about Huang Zhixing?

326
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,279
Release him?

327
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:57,920
No.

328
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,920
Zheng Taixiang's problem

329
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,519
doesn't mean Huang Zhixing

330
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,960
is absolutely innocent.

331
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,319
Got it.

00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:40,593
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:44,101
