3
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:03,294
(It's safe for you and Lian'an Town.
As for me... Goodbye...)

4
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,840
(Cai Desheng)
A call from Mr. Cai.

5
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,719
Mr. Cai.

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,280
What's the matter?

7
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,560
Taixiang.

8
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,159
Do you want to come to my office?

9
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,799
Your office?

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
It doesn't seem appropriate.

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,280
How about

12
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,239
we meet at the usual place?

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,400
We've already finished questioning
Chen Tianshuang.

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,719
Won't you come to take a look?

15
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,079
What did he say?

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,239
He admitted

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,599
that he shot Huang Zhixing.

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,079
He also said

19
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,680
he did that

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
because they want

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,000
to protect Huang Zhixing's identity

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,079
and make us suspicious of you.

23
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,879
You really have your ways.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,159
You made

25
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,439
him confess so soon.

26
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,879
That's also because

27
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,760
you've never had any problems.

28
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,960
Thank you.

29
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,039
Since

30
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,560
the truth has already come to light,

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,319
there's no rush.

32
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,280
I still have things to handle right now.

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,479
In a couple of days,

34
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,120
I'll visit your office

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
to thank you in person.

36
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,559
Okay?

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
You were wrongfully accused.

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
No need to thank me.

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, Mr. Cai,

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,719
if there's nothing else,

41
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,759
I'll hang up now.

42
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,800
Okay.

43
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,080
Go on and busy yourself.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,599
Mr. Cai's tone

45
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,840
seems a bit strange.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Xiang.

47
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,879
Are we still going?

48
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,039
He.

49
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,560
Later,

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,719
when we arrive at the chemical plant,

51
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,000
don't stop the car.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
You're afraid that Mr. Cai...

53
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,280
Anyway,

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,080
if you see his people,

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,680
drive away immediately.

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
Understood?

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,560
Xiang.

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,479
I'll go take a look.

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Xiang.

60
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Seems like no one's here.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,639
Hope I'm just being paranoid.

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
He.

63
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,479
Run!

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
Xiang.

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Hurry up and run!

66
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,399
Bobo.

67
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,239
Pick up the phone.

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,040
Pick up the phone.

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,279
Pick up the phone.

70
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
Bobo, pick up the phone.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
Hello?

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
Bobo.

73
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,519
You've prepared the things I mentioned

74
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,920
last time, right?

75
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,160
Documents.

76
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
Foreign bank credit card.

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,519
Dollars.

78
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,839
Everything is ready.

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Okay.

80
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,040
Take these things

81
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,240
and go

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,560
to the dock I mentioned last time.

83
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,199
Taixiang.

84
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,160
Has something happened?

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
Yes.

86
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,360
Where are you now?

87
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,199
I'm still in Lian'an Town.

88
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,680
Just came out of the chemical plant.

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,680
In about 40 minutes,

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,520
I'll be there.

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm already at the dock.

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,600
You're already at the dock?

93
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,599
Forget it.

94
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
I'll get there first.

95
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,079
But if you walk here,

96
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,839
you probably won't make it
in 40 minutes.

97
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,160
What do you mean?

98
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,399
Walk over?

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
Taixiang.

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,240
Will you check if you have enough fuel?

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
Even if you can make it here,

102
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,519
I will be gone already.

103
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,240
Bobo.

104
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,320
Bobo.

105
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
Do you know the consequences

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
if you do this?

107
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,279
Consequences?

108
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,360
You are now

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
unable to protect yourself.

110
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,439
Yet you still want to mess with me?

111
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,040
So you had colluded

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,319
with Huang Zhixing already.

113
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,759
The Agency is searching for spies.

114
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,199
He thinks it's better

115
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,279
to use this trick against them.

116
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,959
He'll deliberately fail to escape

117
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,199
and get caught.

118
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
Then he'll tell Cai Desheng

119
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,839
that Zheng Taixiang framed him

120
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,959
to hide his own identity.

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
The real mole

122
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,480
is Zheng Taixiang.

123
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,079
You'll shoot at this moment.

124
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
Is that Long?

125
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,399
Bobo from Tianhai Sect.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
It's okay if you don't know me.

127
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,079
I know you.

128
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,040
I've got all the information
on the Eye Plan.

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Let's meet up.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,319
Wait for my message.

131
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:42,368
(Secret key,
Technical specification of Odin's Eye)

132
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,279
You look so grim.

133
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,759
Don't give yourself away later.

134
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,839
Anle.

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
Don't look so worried.

136
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,279
Think of something happy.

137
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,279
If everything goes well,

138
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,639
on the day Zheng Taixiang
loses his power,

139
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,600
remember

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,600
to celebrate for me.

141
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,199
How do you want me to celebrate for you?

142
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,040
I know you only chew gum
and don't smoke.

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
But at that time,

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
smoke one for me.

145
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,120
Taixiang.

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
On behalf of Anle, I wish you

147
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,399
a good journey.

148
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,080
Wishing you a good journey.

149
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,840
I'll kill you.

150
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,039
According to reliable information,

151
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,519
Zheng Taixiang's car will soon

152
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,559
break down near the entrance
of Lian'an Town.

153
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,720
But he should have a gun on him.

154
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
So you need to be careful.

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Okay, Shuyi.

156
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,800
Don't worry.

157
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,679
Leave it to us.

158
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,759
Running out of gas.

159
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:33,888
(Lian'an Town)

160
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,320
Unbelievable.

161
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,960
Bro. Bro.

162
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,999
Bro.

163
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,120
Can I borrow your car?

164
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,799
Can I borrow your car?

165
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,200
I'll pay you, alright?

166
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,320
Bro.

167
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,320
Why ignore me?

168
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
Just borrow a car from you.

169
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,039
Why be so arrogant?

170
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,279
Alright?

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll run you over!

172
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,799
Run you over.

173
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,639
Excuse me.

174
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,559
Bro.

175
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,679
Can I

176
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,559
borrow your scooter?

177
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,759
Who are you?

178
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,679
I'll pay.

179
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,240
Okay?

180
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
Help me out.

181
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,679
Are you insane?

182
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,519
No, I...

183
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,440
I-I need to use this scooter.

184
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,840
I'll pay, okay?

185
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,759
Get lost.

186
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,600
Get lost.

187
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,519
I'm really giving you money.

188
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,799
I'm telling you to get lost.

189
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
Bro.

190
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,759
Why so angry?

191
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,600
So what?

192
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Nothing.

193
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,600
Nothing.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
Back off!

195
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,080
Zheng Taixiang.

196
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,440
Don't come over.

197
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,720
Don't come any closer.

198
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
What do you mean?

199
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,719
Stop.

200
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,080
Zheng Taixiang.

201
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,480
Today, we'll seek justice for Tu.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,159
Young man.

203
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,559
Trying to scare me?

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,440
If you dare come over,

205
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
I'll shoot you.

206
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,039
Ming.

207
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,200
No one comes over.

208
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,720
I'll kill whoever comes over.

209
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Come on!

210
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,080
I'll hit whoever dares to come over.

211
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,399
You dare hurt my son?

212
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,159
Old fool, I'll kill you.

213
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,919
Everyone, rest assured.

214
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,279
Last time, someone protected him.

215
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:22,960
But this time,

216
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,799
we'll make him receive his punishment.

217
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,120
- Great!
- Great!

218
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,519
Great!

219
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,919
Everyone, rest assured.

220
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,240
Lian'an Town is finally going
to be peaceful.

221
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,159
Thank you all.

222
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,799
Thank you.

223
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,720
Mr. Cai.

224
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm really innocent.

225
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,799
You

226
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,440
caught the wrong person.

227
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,239
Really?

228
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,440
Come in.

229
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,200
Do you know him?

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
I've never met him.

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,840
Mr. Cai.

232
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,360
This is all a setup by them.

233
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,559
They want to

234
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,120
blame what Huang Zhixing has done

235
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,159
on me.

236
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,600
Such a simple thing.

237
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,120
Why do you handle it like this?

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,159
Unbelievable.

239
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,559
(Recently,)

240
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,519
(Lotus News)
(Odin's Eye Plan of Intelligence Agency)

241
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,679
(has been exposed online,)

242
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,600
(triggering discussion
from all parties.)

243
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,080
Odin's Eye?

244
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,519
What are they doing?

245
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,399
For Chinese mainland,

246
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,960
that's a blatant provocation.

247
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,759
Have you ever thought about

248
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,000
the serious consequences?

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,360
But we also need our own defenses.

250
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,919
With Odin's Eye,

251
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
we can tell them

252
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,799
to watch it

253
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,240
and not to act rashly.

254
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,440
Tell me.

255
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,480
Have you been there?

256
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,799
No need.

257
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,679
The size of Taiwan, China is small,

258
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,919
but our weapons

259
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,519
are world-class.

260
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,840
If you don't believe it,

261
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,120
let's compare one by one.

262
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,080
How could you say so

263
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,360
if you haven't been there?

264
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm telling you,

265
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,720
I've been there.

266
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,320
You guys are always like this,

267
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,480
saying that you

268
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,440
have planes, radars, and missiles,

269
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,519
as if having these means you can fight.

270
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
But in an actual war,

271
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,600
what can you do?

272
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,919
Seriously.

273
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,080
Who will praise us then?

274
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,879
Who will help us?

275
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,119
The United States?

276
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,080
It will be us in trouble.

277
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,519
Then don't start a war!

278
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,320
Alright.

279
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Gentlemen.

280
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,519
Let's skip the military.

281
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,360
I'd like to ask

282
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
how much this Odin's Eye costs

283
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,240
and where the money

284
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,600
comes from?

285
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,080
Right.

286
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,279
I heard

287
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,320
the Intelligence Agency
has ties with the gang

288
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,159
and shady dealings.

289
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,480
How many people are filling
their own pockets?

290
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,120
How much space for corruption?

291
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,480
What is the most important now?

292
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,440
The financial transparency.

293
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,679
It must be transparent.

294
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,919
Who is in charge of this plan?

295
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,159
Let him explain it.

296
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,039
Let him explain it.

297
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,080
Don't talk nonsense!

298
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,840
(So that neither side will be hurt.)

299
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,600
(Don't change the subject.)

300
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,039
(Let's all be safe.)

301
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,240
(Why?)

302
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,559
(Just remain peaceful.)

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,879
Dear journalists,

304
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,320
thank you all for coming.

305
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,080
Today I'm here to claim

306
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,600
that the Odin's Eye Plan

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,240
doesn't exist.

308
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,960
My resignation

309
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,440
has nothing to do with this matter.

310
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,320
(As for)

311
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,759
(ties with the gang,)

312
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,320
(that's even more absurd.)

313
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,399
(Dear journalists,)

314
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,279
(please do not spread rumors.)

315
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,799
Xiu.

316
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,799
Turns out, behind the chemical plant
is the Odin's Eye Plan.

317
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,519
What did I say?

318
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,639
We must fight against the Tianhai Sect.

319
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,159
Now you understand it?

320
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,759
You are always impressive.

321
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,000
Keep studying.

322
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,040
Just the beginning.

323
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,479
Xiu.

324
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
What's

325
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,919
Tianshuang's condition?

326
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,960
You are still worried about him?

327
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,799
He always comes back safely.

328
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,279
This time he's just a bit late.

329
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,519
Don't worry.

330
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
Mom.

331
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
Did Dad mention to you recently

332
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,759
when he will come back?

333
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,639
He said he's still busy.

334
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't you still have me?

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,399
It's different.

336
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,759
That's okay.

337
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
Dad said he would give me a gift.

338
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,840
Give him some time.

339
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,359
A gift?

340
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,279
What gift?

341
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,159
It's a secret.

(that such tranquility was hard-won.)

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,720
(It needs to be cherished)

351
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,759
(and requires fighting.)

352
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,880
