00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:58,916
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,719
(The chemical plant is suspicious)

4
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:05,632
(Commemoration)

5
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,128
(May Heilun rest in peace,
sent by Tianhai Group)

6
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,599
Listen, guys.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,959
Heilun is dead.

8
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,959
But our gang still exists.

9
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,359
The gang cannot be without a leader.

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,959
We need to decide immediately

11
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,439
who will be the next leader.

12
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,159
Is it you?

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,359
Of course.

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,920
After Heilun's funeral,

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,040
I will be the new leader.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,959
I hear

17
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,879
many of Heilun's men want
to avenge his death.

18
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,359
They won't be on your side.

19
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,840
No one leads them.

20
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,760
They are a motley throng.

21
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,079
Heilun has a son.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,120
So what?

23
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,280
I heard
the Five Lakes Alliance released him.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Really?

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
How could they

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,200
release him?

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
Anyway,

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,000
He is just a loser.

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,080
He poses no threat.

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,759
Really?

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,840
Bobo, don't worry.

32
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,199
After the funeral,

33
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,360
the Black Lotus Gang will be mine.

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,520
Ming, what's wrong with you?

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,639
Why are you on my bed?

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,919
Tianshuang.

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,759
This is my bed.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,439
Well,

39
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,599
why am I on your bed?

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,639
How should I know?

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,759
That's disgusting.

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,199
You think about

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,159
what happened.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,319
I don't remember, either.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,439
Drank too much last night.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
I'll treat you to breakfast.

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,639
Don't be mad.

48
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,479
This is the last time.

49
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,080
(Tainan News)
(Yesterday, Zheng Taixiang,)

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,520
(chairman of Tianhai Group,)

51
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,680
(announced to build the chemical plant
which was put on hold two years ago.)

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,120
(And the new plant will be built)

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,000
(at Lian'an Town
in the suburbs of Tainan.)

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Long.

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,879
Get me some water.

56
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,360
Go get it yourself.

57
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,919
The news is all fake.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,479
None of our concern, anyway.

59
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,240
You'll know

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,560
if it concerns us or not.

61
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,719
Isn't it just a factory?

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,800
So, would you

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,039
visit a chemical plant as a tourist?

64
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,520
Probably not.

65
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,719
Exactly.

66
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,039
When the factory is built,

67
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,800
who will still visit Lian'an Town?

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,759
We all will have to change jobs.

69
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,080
Ming, Tianshuang,
Black Lotus is in trouble.

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,159
Did you hear of it?

71
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,240
How did you know?

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
I saw the news online.

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
It's spreading.

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,800
Lin Yongning is already dead.

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,159
Some say Five Lakes Alliance did it.

76
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,600
Some say one of his men

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,759
did it.

78
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,519
Some even say

79
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,759
his son

80
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,959
ruthlessly killed him

81
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,240
to establish power.

82
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,480
What the heck?

83
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,879
Nonsense.

84
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,279
So, who did it?

85
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,560
Tianhai Sect.

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
Tianhai Sect?

87
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,560
The purpose is obvious.

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,879
Tianhai Sect wants everyone to know

89
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,800
no matter how powerful Lin is,

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
in their eyes,

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,680
he's just an ant to be crushed at will.

92
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,160
But

93
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,240
they are already the biggest gang.

94
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,519
Why did they come here?

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,480
Yeah,

96
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
why did they come?

97
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,480
Maybe it's not that complicated.

98
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,279
Maybe they hold a grudge against Heilun.

99
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Right.

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,519
Is there anything special here?

101
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,079
For example,

102
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,120
Hsinchu has TSMC.

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
Lian'an Town has tourists.

104
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
There's nothing else.

105
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,680
Come in.

106
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,759
Xiu.

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,920
I got it.

108
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,680
What is it?

109
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,759
I know

110
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,120
why Lin Yongning was killed.

111
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,319
They intend to build a chemical plant.

112
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,240
They've tried a few times
in other places.

113
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
But they failed

114
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
because of pollution.

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,879
Now, they chose Lian'an Town.

116
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,560
You told me before

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
that Lin Yongning wanted
to transform this place

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,839
into an eco-tourism town.

119
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,839
It'll be at odds
with the chemical plant.

120
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,160
You mean,

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,439
Tianhai Sect realized
there was no negotiating with Heilun,

122
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,160
so they decided to kill him?

123
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,920
It's hard to say.

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,720
They might have grievances in private.

125
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,079
But that's not the point.

126
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,120
Go on.

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,920
The key point is our alliance

128
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,639
is engaged in tourism, right?

129
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
If the chemical plant is built

130
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,279
and pollution issues arise,

131
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,120
logically speaking,

132
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
we'll be in trouble.

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,079
Forget about tourism.

134
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,439
Even our lives will be affected.

135
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,839
Forget about life.

136
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,720
Even my seafood will be gone.

137
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,920
Bobo's attitude is relatively good now,

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
but who knows

139
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,839
what will happen?

140
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,800
Tianshuang.

141
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
I told you.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
You were born for this job.

143
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,879
I'm flattered, Xiu.

144
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,839
Well,

145
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,560
do we have any ties with Tianhai Sect?

146
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,000
Why?

147
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,199
Tianhai Sect is so powerful.

148
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,759
I don't want to fight them.

149
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,319
I don't want to, either.

150
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,279
But it's unpredictable.

151
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,120
We can only play it by ear.

152
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,839
Before Tianhai Sect arrives,

153
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,959
we have others to deal with.

154
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,399
Black Lotus Gang?

155
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,560
Heilun's death is a big deal

156
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,959
for the Black Lotus Gang.

157
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,759
It's not just that their leader is gone.

158
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Who's the new leader?

159
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,519
Seek revenge?

160
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,319
Who will do that?

161
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,160
I guess Heilun's men

162
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,839
have their own ideas.

163
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,800
But they won't act on them quickly.

164
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,720
You released Lin Pinghe.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,399
I think what you did was right.

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,199
It's to balance all parties.

167
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,000
Heilun's death

168
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,319
might be

169
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,839
a good opportunity for us.

170
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,319
We're no longer a thorn

171
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,639
in the Black Lotus Gang's side.

172
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,160
But how the result will be

173
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,279
still depends on today's meeting.

174
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,399
A meeting?

175
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,800
With whom?

176
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Someone like you.

177
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,839
She is a businesswoman.

178
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,600
We call her Ms. Jia.

179
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
A businesswoman?

180
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,439
What business?

181
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,199
Ms. Jia's business

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is the channels you've long wanted.

183
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,600
Channels?

184
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,199
That's good.

185
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,959
It's good to make more money.

186
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,040
The more money you make,

187
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,399
the greater the danger becomes.

188
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,439
Previously,

189
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,120
I told you I had two men

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,639
whose names were Wen and Wu, right?

191
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,680
Sure.

192
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,639
Did they have an accident?

193
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,279
An accident?

194
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,480
I have no evidence,

195
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,199
but everyone knows

196
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,639
the Black Lotus Gang killed them

197
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,000
because of the channels.

198
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,920
To make big money,

199
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,800
I can take any trouble.

200
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
The Black Lotus Gang
has always coveted our channels

201
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,839
and wanted to take them.

202
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,879
So, they secretly killed Wen and Wu.

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
On the surface,

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
they're involved
in real estate and land,

205
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,039
but in fact, they've been trying
to expand their channels.

206
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,919
Heilun was in charge of the channels
in Taiwan, China.

207
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,360
Ms. Jia is in charge of those
on the Chinese mainland.

208
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Now,

209
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,679
Heilun is dead,

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,240
which might be a good opportunity for us

211
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,720
to win over Ms. Jia,

212
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,799
so that the Black Lotus Gang
is unable to make channels.

213
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,360
Xiu.

214
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,519
It's such an important meeting.

215
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,960
I am a newcomer

216
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,000
and not yet familiar with the business.

217
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,000
Can I handle it?

218
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,600
You can do it.

219
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,120
You are

220
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,879
Ms. Jia's type.

221
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,879
(Xiu.)

222
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,080
(I can't play the seduction game.)

223
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,480
(I'm asking you to discuss business,
not to seduce her.)

224
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
(You just said)

225
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,919
(I was her type.)

226
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,440
(Play it by ear.)

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,240
(I have my principles.)

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,480
(In any case,)

229
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,559
(whether you can get the channels
you want)

230
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,759
(depends on yourself.)

231
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,720
Hello, Ms. Jia.

232
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,679
I'm Chen Tianshuang from the Five Lakes.

233
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,919
What a young man.

234
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,000
Very good.

235
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,399
So big.

236
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,399
This place is really big.

237
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,639
What is your name again?

238
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,360
Chen Tianshuang.

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,679
My name means a happy life.

240
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,679
Chen Tianshuang? Can you realize it?

241
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,639
Anyway,

242
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,600
my boss asked me to see you

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
to discuss future cooperation with you.

244
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,759
Cooperation?

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,879
I don't have a business to do
with the Five Lakes Alliance.

246
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,879
You didn't before,
but you will in the future.

247
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,320
In terms of channels,

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,799
we're much better
than the Black Lotus Gang.

249
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,320
Moreover, they have
an internal situation.

250
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,600
Things have changed.

251
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,799
Your alliance has your own principles.

252
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,559
Principles are fixed,

253
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,240
but we're flexible.

254
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,120
Today,

255
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,159
everyone wants

256
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,879
to make money,

257
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,639
right?

258
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,399
We have a reputation and resources.

259
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
Let's work together.

260
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,000
It's win-win.

261
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,039
Win-win?

262
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,360
Sit down.

263
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,159
At this sensitive point of time,

264
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,320
aren't you afraid

265
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
of offending the Tianhai Sect?

266
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,240
Two gangs can't coexist in one place.

267
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,960
As long as we have our own rules

268
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,360
and they have theirs,

269
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,399
there will eventually be a conflict.

270
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
But this day

271
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,240
will come sooner than everyone thinks.

272
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,960
You seem pretty clear-headed.

273
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,399
As a young man,

274
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,399
I'd keep up with the times.

275
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,480
Okay.

276
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,120
The place where we transport goods

277
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
has some eyesores.

278
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,519
Let's transport a batch of goods

279
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,559
and get rid of them.

280
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,960
Then I will agree to cooperate with you.

281
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Ms. Jia,

282
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,039
that will disobey our rule.

283
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,279
We can't casually kill someone.

284
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,879
That's our alliance's rule.

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,960
As long as there's profit,

286
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,159
why care so much?

287
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,919
We are principled.

288
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,759
Please understand.

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,960
What is that?

290
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,000
A gift for our first meeting.

291
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,679
Open it and see.

292
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,279
I'm not a snob about money.

293
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,399
How much is it?

294
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,480
You say you don't like it,

295
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,879
but inside you must be overjoyed, right?

296
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,600
I have my principles.

297
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,159
Your hand...

298
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm trying to push you away.

299
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,679
That's all.

300
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,320
Push me.

301
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,759
Go ahead.

302
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,600
Chen Tianshuang.

303
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,919
Live a happy life?

304
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,799
You're a coward, aren't you?

305
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,320
Are you scared?

306
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,279
What are you going to do?

307
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,320
Do I look like a coward now?

308
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,840
You look thin

309
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,480
yet quite strong.

310
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,879
You remind me

311
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,399
of an old friend of mine.

312
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,440
Old friend?

313
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,919
Who?

314
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll tell you after we finish talking.

315
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,039
You better think it through.

316
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,840
If you miss this chance,

317
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,000
it may not come again.

318
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,080
Have you been taken by Ms. Jia?

319
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,240
Are you being envious?

320
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,120
The process was so exciting.

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,799
Tell me more.

322
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,240
It's what I thought.

323
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Business,

324
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,360
bribery,

325
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,960
and seduction.

326
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,639
Although the process was exciting,

327
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,480
it was all under my control.

328
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,600
Well done.

329
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,279
That's alright.

330
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,320
Xiu.

331
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,480
Shouldn't you be the one to do this?

332
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,639
Are you afraid you can't handle it?

333
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,759
Are you joking?

334
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Back when I was young,

335
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,639
I flirted with many women.

336
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,360
I can do better than you.

337
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,159
I just want to test you.

338
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,559
Why don't I believe it?

339
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Tell me.

340
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Did you succeed?

341
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
Of course not.

342
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,480
What did she say?

343
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,772
The same as you said.

344
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:46,600
She wants to smuggle goods
and kill people.

345
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,480
After you refused her,

346
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
how did she react?

347
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,399
I think she won't give up.

348
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,240
Sure.

349
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,039
Someone like her

350
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,320
never gives up easily.

351
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,679
Do you know each other?

352
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,960
No.

353
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,879
I just heard about her before.

354
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,759
So, what should our attitude be now?

355
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,080
Just remember one thing.

356
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,759
No matter what,

357
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,360
do not disrupt the lives
of the people here.

358
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,879
Just try to negotiate.

359
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,320
If you can't,
you must resolutely stop her.

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,919
That's not hard.

361
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,360
Why?

362
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,799
We have a new helper.

363
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,480
Let them handle it.

364
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,120
You mean Tianhai Sect?

365
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,559
Isn't it possible?

366
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,960
It is possible.

367
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
However,

368
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,919
we don't need them for now.

369
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
Have a good rest.

370
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,200
In the afternoon, there is a main event.

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,639
Are you serious?

372
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,279
It's Heilun's funeral.

373
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
You've met Ms. Jia?

374
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,639
Did you find anything?

375
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,639
Black Lotus is involved
in the underground transport lines.

376
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,320
Ms. Jia is the key.

377
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,237
If I fail to handle her,
and Intelligence Agency

378
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:04,240
doesn't work with Five Lakes Alliance
anymore, I'll come here for nothing.

379
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,400
Besides,

380
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,880
this is also a good chance for me.

381
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,519
If I do a good job,

382
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll leave a good impression

383
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,240
on Xiu.

384
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,000
Killing two birds.

385
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,200
You've been through a lot together.

386
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,609
The more he trusts you, the closer
you get to the transport lines.

387
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,799
Surprisingly,

388
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,920
you climb up so fast.

389
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,359
What's the reason?

390
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,680
The leader of the Black Lotus Gang

391
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,119
was so easily killed
by the Tianhai Sect.

392
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,599
What if they target Five Lakes?

393
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,279
That's why he needs to hurry

394
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,839
to train the next successor.

395
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,079
He's afraid of accident?

396
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,640
It's not just that.

397
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,920
He has a tumor in his brain.

398
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,650
(Benign tumor)
But currently, it's benign.

399
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,160
Who knows what will happen?

400
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,799
Long.

401
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,480
Long.

402
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Regarding Tianhai Sect,

403
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,920
I have something to tell you.

404
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,839
Behind Tianhai Sect

405
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,319
is the Intelligence Agency.

406
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,079
I knew it.

407
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,079
The Intelligence Agency
has a secret plan underway.

408
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,160
Its code name is Eye Plan.

409
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,519
We don't know

410
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,559
about the details.

411
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,440
But the chemical plant we saw on TV

412
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,880
is prepared for the Eye Plan.

413
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,039
Eye Plan?

414
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,319
Shall we check it out?

415
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,079
No need.

416
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,720
Stick to the transport lines.

417
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,119
We have

418
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,480
other plans for that.

419
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
Understood.

420
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,640
I have to go.

421
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,559
This afternoon,

422
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,279
I have a funeral to attend.

423
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,240
Tianshuang.

424
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,079
Does Lin Yongning's death

425
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
affect you?

426
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,480
How does it affect me?

427
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,359
I'm good.

428
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,039
That's good.

429
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,599
I was overthinking it.

430
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:55,024
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

431
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:58,472
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

432
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:02,468
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

433
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:08,933
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
