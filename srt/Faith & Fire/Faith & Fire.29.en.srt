3
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:03,680
(Finally, don't need to put on an act
for the conflict with Tianhai Sect)

4
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,719
Do you remember?

5
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,159
You wanted to make me obey,

6
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,319
so you told me to attack Xiu

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,040
to ruin him.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,439
Making you the new Chief.

9
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,840
Anle's idea isn't bad.

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,680
Considering your background,

11
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,599
I still need time to check it.

12
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,680
What should I do?

13
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,079
Kill someone for me.

14
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,359
Sheng.

15
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,000
If one day there's no news from me,

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,799
give this away

17
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,359
and avenge me.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,480
Avenge what?

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,319
I don't want to.

20
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,000
Can't we just ignore these things

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,560
and live our lives?

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,480
You can,

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,719
but I can't.

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,480
He.

25
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,959
I...

26
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,319
Alright.

27
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,159
He.

28
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,960
No matter where you go, I'll follow you.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
We're brothers, right?

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,560
He, wait for me.

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,199
It's my own business.

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,919
I'll handle it myself.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
Don't follow me.

34
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,400
He.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,560
Get lost.

36
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,039
He, I...

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,039
Get lost.

38
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,360
Get lost!

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,439
Trying to join a gang?

40
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,800
What do you think you are?

41
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,280
Go back and stay with your girl.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,599
Get lost.

43
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,879
He.

44
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,120
I...

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,039
Get lost!

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,439
Right.

47
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,400
I wanted to keep leverage against you.

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,319
But you didn't kill Xiu.

49
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,120
You even left evidence.

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,159
Is that my fault?

51
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,360
Let's not talk about this first.

52
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,439
Let me out.

53
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,079
Hurry.

54
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,480
Otherwise, someone will come.

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,240
Hurry up.

56
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,040
Hurry.

57
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,680
What?

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,879
Who told you I was here to let you out?

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,079
What do you mean?

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,600
You were not elected

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,120
to be the head.

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,079
You failed to bring down

63
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,800
Five Lakes Alliance with you.

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,399
You even killed your dad.

65
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,279
That was your own dad.

66
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,959
What's the point of keeping

67
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,560
such a piece of trash like you?

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,199
So,

69
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,560
you are here to kill me.

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,439
Jiahao.

71
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,879
You know too much.

72
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,399
Leaving you to the police

73
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,600
will make things difficult.

74
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,519
Let go of me.

75
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,399
Don't come close.

76
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,759
Go away!

77
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,040
Weren't you unafraid of death?

78
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
Why are you now?

79
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
No, don't.

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm going to call for help.

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,319
Stay away from me!

82
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,160
Help!

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
I'll call for you.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,920
Help!

85
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,680
Come on.

86
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,680
Taixiang.

87
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,279
Our Eye Plan is now all set,

88
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,839
just the final step left.

89
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,360
Mr. Cai,

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,959
rest assured.

91
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,399
Our people

92
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,240
have already gone to Lian'an Town.

93
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,600
Everything is under control.

94
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,600
Will it go south?

95
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,399
Of course not.

96
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:48,879
Zhixing.

97
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,160
Will there be any unexpected situations?

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,959
No, rest assured.

99
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,759
Okay.

100
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,600
Now, because many people

101
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,160
see our Intelligence Agency
has gotten so much funding

102
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,040
because of the Eye Plan,

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
they are all envious.

104
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,720
For safety's sake,

105
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,720
we should try not to show up.

106
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,279
If things go smoothly,

107
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,480
the future work of the chemical plant

108
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,560
will have to be handed over to you.

109
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,399
This time,

110
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,079
I will definitely not let you down.

111
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:20,879
Good.

112
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,439
Come on.

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,160
Mr. Cai, take care.

114
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,600
Mr. Cai thinks highly of you.

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
This time, you can't let

116
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,480
the chemical plant

117
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
have another accident

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
like two years ago.

119
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,000
Of course.

120
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,879
You just heard it.

121
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,079
This time,

122
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,120
if it is done well,

123
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,160
you'll still be in charge of it
in the future.

124
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
If it's not done well...

125
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,240
It won't.

126
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,839
I heard

127
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,519
that show at the Five Lakes Alliance

128
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
didn't seem to have worked.

129
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,560
He Jiahao is a clown.

130
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,199
I'm not surprised he failed.

131
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,199
Won't affect what's in Lian'an Town.

132
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,000
I also heard

133
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
that this new Chief Protector

134
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,560
is from Lian'an Town.

135
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,959
I've seen that kid.

136
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,040
No big deal.

137
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
Even if he is, I can handle it.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,120
I promise to keep the plan.

139
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,480
Good.

140
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
With what you said,

141
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm relieved.

142
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,080
Just now,

143
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,080
I heard that He Jiahao is dead.

144
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,240
I didn't arrange it.

145
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,240
I did.

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,039
This might provoke

147
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,320
the Five Lakes Alliance.

148
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,440
Zhixing.

149
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,039
When doing something big,

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,960
you can't be soft-hearted.

151
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,399
Besides,

152
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,879
he knows too much.

153
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,679
I'm leaving.

154
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,039
Dad.

155
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,000
Didn't you say this is junk food?

156
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,679
Xi likes it so much.

157
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,360
It's okay to eat a little occasionally.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,879
Dad, you're so strange.

159
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,759
Xi.

160
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,200
I'll be quite busy coming up.

161
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,080
I can't pick you up from school
every day.

162
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,120
It's okay.

163
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
I could walk home by myself long ago.

164
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,240
When I'm not around,

165
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,559
you need to listen to your mom.

166
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,399
So nagging.

167
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,840
How long will you be gone?

168
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,559
Don't worry, I'll come back
as soon as I'm done.

169
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,039
Welcome, Xiu.

170
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,600
What's going on?

171
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm just leaving for a few days.

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
No need for this.

173
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,679
You guys

174
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,919
are really snobby.

175
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,720
You want to celebrate
because I've become

176
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,080
the Chief Protector?

177
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
It's unnecessary.

178
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,720
Shuyi didn't think my ability
was so strong.

179
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:40,720
Right?

180
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,960
Just giving me face.

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,039
Don't make it such a big deal.

182
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,960
Well,

183
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,080
that's also

184
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,200
worth celebrating.

185
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,600
Yes.

186
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,320
Let's go.

187
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,519
Let's go.

188
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,799
Go.

189
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,840
Was that

190
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,919
not prepared for me?

191
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:12,919
Of...

192
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,000
Of course, it was.

193
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,720
I'm back.

194
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,080
Xiu.

195
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,279
Congratulations on Xiu's recovery!

196
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,679
Congratulations on Xiu's recovery!

197
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,879
He's only left for a few days.

198
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,159
You prepared a surprise for him?

199
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,879
I was discharged,

200
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,960
but no one picked me up.

201
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,879
Xiu, you misunderstood.

202
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,679
They prepared a surprise for you,

203
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,879
but let go too early.

204
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,679
Should I believe it?

205
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,759
Whenever someone new comes,

206
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,360
the old guys will be forgotten.

207
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
No.

208
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,080
Clearly, someone new isn't
as good as the old one.

209
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,000
Give me a hug.

210
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,480
- Xiu.
- Xiu.

211
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,759
Go explain it.

212
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,879
Tianshuang.

213
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Is this

214
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,679
the legendary "protagonist halo"?

215
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,279
Whether it's yours or not,

216
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,639
in the end, it will be.

217
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,480
The blame is on me.

218
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,200
Xiu.

219
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,879
You got discharged
without saying a word.

220
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,000
I would have picked you up.

221
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,039
No need.

222
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,679
Whether I live or die

223
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,080
has nothing to do with you,

224
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,039
mainly not to trouble you.

225
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,879
You are my big brother.

226
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,720
We look after each other.

227
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,759
Don't.

228
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm just a small branch chief now.

229
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,799
You are now the Chief Protector,

230
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,080
a favorite of the head.

231
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,279
I'll call you my big brother.

232
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,240
Alright.

233
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,639
Let's do it this way.

234
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,600
Say it again.

235
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,039
Our alliance respects
the order of seniority.

236
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,159
If what you say makes sense,
I have to listen.

237
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,440
But

238
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,399
I can't just take advantage of you.

239
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,440
From now on,

240
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,480
I'll call you big brother.

241
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
You'll call me that, too.

242
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,039
Shameless, huh?

243
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,200
Be careful.

244
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,159
Your wound will open up.

245
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,799
Let me see.

246
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,799
Shameless.

247
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:22,879
Shameless, huh?

248
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,919
So shameless.

249
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,759
Today, I'll show you

250
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,240
"An old ox makes a straight furrow".

251
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,000
Playing tricks

252
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,440
with me, huh?

253
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,159
Playing tricks?

254
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,799
I was wrong.

255
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,360
Can you drink alcohol?

256
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,240
Just got discharged.

257
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,799
I also drank some in the hospital.

258
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,279
You are now the Chief Protector,

259
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,960
not a dormitory manager.

260
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,240
Why manage so many things?

261
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,200
Why laugh?

262
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,320
Why laugh?

263
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,039
Because the process was a bit torturous,

264
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
but we are all fine now.

265
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,840
Yeah.

266
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,080
I hope to remain fine in the future.

267
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,559
Did general alliance

268
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,240
agree to help?

269
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,440
They verbally agreed.

270
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,200
Isn't that just like not agreeing?

271
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,960
Well, not exactly.

272
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,200
There have been quite a few changes.

273
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,399
Shuyi has it tough.

274
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,159
Speaking up for her.

275
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,320
She's got you.

276
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,399
I also heard

277
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,879
that He Jiahao suddenly died.

278
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,120
He was killed.

279
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Shuyi said the same.

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I guess

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,320
she wants to handle it low-key.

282
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,759
No matter who says it,

283
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,360
since he was killed

284
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,559
right under our noses,

285
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,840
it must be an inside job.

286
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,080
Anyway,

287
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,679
Shuyi is busy enough.

288
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,360
During this time,

289
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
we have to be on our own.

290
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,840
If you need anything,

291
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,200
just tell me.

292
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,639
I'll go all out.

293
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,720
I really do.

294
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,720
Go ahead.

295
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,679
No matter what I do in the future,

296
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,879
try to ensure everyone's safety.

297
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,360
Isn't that what I've always been doing?

298
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,320
Me too.

299
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,600
The chemical plant's construction plan
is ready.

300
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,799
Do you know that?

301
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,720
Several businesses

302
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,279
have started organizing protests.

303
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,879
I heard about it.

304
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,639
What has Tianhai Sect done?

305
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,200
Bobo asked to meet me.

306
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,039
Tomorrow.

307
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,840
Aquatic Products Union?

308
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,960
You know them?

309
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,759
Had met them before.

310
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,600
But not familiar.

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,480
Once the chemical plant is built,

312
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,720
if its emissions are polluted,

313
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,279
the aquatic products will be affected.

314
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,440
So they are making a scene.

315
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,440
Aren't you in charge of this?

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
The ways have changed.

317
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
You didn't do anything?

318
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,919
Look at the mess now.

319
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,080
If the chat goes well,
no need to do anything.

320
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,240
Met again, Chen Tianshuang.

321
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,159
I saw that the Chief Protector
was impressive.

322
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,399
So now I've become one for fun.

323
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,679
Let me introduce you.

324
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,000
This is Anle.

325
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,120
Anle.

326
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,240
You know me?

327
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,879
Of course.

328
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,480
Straits Exchange Foundation.

329
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,039
Although it doesn't do much,

330
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,720
you look like a doer.

331
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,200
Although what you do seems to have

332
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,399
little to do with it.

333
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,039
Alright.

334
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,600
Then I'll be straightforward.

335
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,399
How is it?

336
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,279
How about cooperation?

337
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,600
Sure.

338
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,720
Great.

339
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,480
It's different being the Protector.

340
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
You were unwilling before.

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,279
Don't you just want

342
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,159
to have the chemical plant
built smoothly?

343
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,919
We can help you.

344
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,399
But when you come to Lian'an Town,

345
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,200
you have to

346
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,360
follow our rules.

347
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,679
I'm listening.

348
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,679
People are resistant when hearing

349
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,879
about the chemical plant.

350
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,879
In fact, it's quite simple to handle.

351
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,519
They're worried

352
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,600
about being polluted.

353
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Let them move out.

354
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,039
How is it?

355
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,119
Move out?

356
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,319
Demolition.

357
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,759
Many people in the Chinese mainland
wants it.

358
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,920
As long as the compensation is enough,

359
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,880
I'll immediately arrange it for you.

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,079
The demolition compensation is
not a small amount.

361
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,079
Think it over.

362
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,079
You're not just asking people to move.

363
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,599
You're essentially changing their life.

364
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,160
Mr. Huang, you're so influential

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,279
and have such a big reputation.

366
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
This kind of thing is

367
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,640
so easy.

368
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,480
I find you interesting.

369
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,839
I'll give you another chance.

370
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
Do you want to cooperate?

371
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,279
I already said yes.

372
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,680
As long as the compensation is enough.

373
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,960
Like to joke?

374
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,799
No.

375
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,319
I'm serious.

376
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,000
Looks like

377
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,559
even if I express my sincerity again,

378
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,400
you still don't want
to cooperate with me.

379
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,759
Let's end the negotiations here.

380
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,880
Starting tomorrow,

381
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,200
I'll use my own methods.

382
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,640
If there is any offense,

383
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,640
please forgive me.

384
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,000
It's been so long,

385
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,759
but finally it's still coming.

386
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,839
Think of a solution.

387
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,759
Give a suggestion.

388
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,519
We need the timing,
geographic advantages, and people.

389
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,559
For timing, I'm not sure.

390
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,559
But the rest

391
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,000
are definitely with us.

392
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,779
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

393
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,259
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

394
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:20,267
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

395
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:26,623
♪At least the shadow
still makes a person♪
