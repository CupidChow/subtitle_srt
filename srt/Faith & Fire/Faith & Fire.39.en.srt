=Episode 39=

3
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:03,744
(Sometimes to complete a mission,
we can only aim at our people)

4
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,519
Mr. Cai.

5
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,640
What's the situation now?

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,959
You guess.

7
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,680
Huang Zhixing resisted arrest.

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
He was very cooperative.

9
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,519
When he saw me, he didn't resist at all.

10
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Then,

11
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,319
Bobo?

12
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,560
Of course not.

13
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,280
When we arrived, he had

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,519
taken control of Huang Zhixing.

15
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,560
By the way,

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,719
he didn't tell you that
when he returned.

17
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,159
Don't blame him.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,760
That was my idea.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
Huang Zhixing turned on me.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,599
Right?

21
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,760
Mr. Cai.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
Someone desperate will spout nonsense.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,040
You won't believe him, right?

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Do you know who fired the shot?

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,560
It must be his man.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,120
This is

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,640
his self-directed deception.

28
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,480
It's possible.

29
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,319
There might be other possibilities,
right?

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,416
(In treatment, do not disturb)

31
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,280
We've already measured the ballistics.

32
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,719
(Huang Zhixing was shot in the shoulder)

33
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,039
(because of his good luck.)

34
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,039
- (If he hadn't fallen like that,)
- How is it?

35
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,039
(the bullet might have hit his head.)

36
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,840
Mr. Cai.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,680
Such things

38
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,800
can be pre-arranged.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
Right?

40
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,240
Isn't it

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,479
too big a risk to take?

42
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,439
Mr. Cai.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,120
Are you suspecting me?

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,879
Tianshuang.

45
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,039
You asked me before

46
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,039
about when the mission can be completed.

47
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,159
I didn't tell you.

48
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,800
Now I'll tell you.

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,840
The mission regarding Huang Zhixing

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,960
is already completed.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,879
I knew I'd

52
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,000
encounter many situations.

53
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,039
But I didn't expect

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,919
to shoot our people.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,840
Tianshuang.

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
You did very well.

57
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,120
But now we don't even know

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
if he's alive.

59
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,800
Don't worry.

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,360
He'll make it.

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
Shooting Huang Zhixing?

62
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,279
Chief Xu said

63
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,879
it was Huang Zhixing's own request.

64
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,680
But why?

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Zheng Taixiang was quite wary of him.

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,920
And the intel on the Eye Plan
isn't easy to get.

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
He'll put on a show.

68
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,199
He'll deliberately fall
into Zheng Taixiang's trap.

69
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,199
When Zheng Taixiang

70
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,600
thinks he is about to win,

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,399
he'll escape to attract attention

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,879
and buy some time.

73
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,199
Then others can obtain information
about the Eye Plan.

74
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,360
Others?

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,720
Even if it's to attract attention,

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,199
I don't need to shoot him.

77
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,000
The Agency is searching for spies.

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,519
He decided

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
to turn their game against them.

80
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,839
He'll deliberately fail to escape

81
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,079
and get caught by Cai Desheng.

82
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,879
Then he'll tell Cai Desheng

83
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,560
that Zheng Taixiang framed him

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,759
to hide his own identity.

85
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,040
The real mole

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
is Zheng Taixiang.

87
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,000
And then, you can shoot him.

88
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,360
So,

89
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,199
Cai Desheng believes

90
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,439
Taixiang wants Zhixing gone?

91
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,519
Yes.

92
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,600
That's too risky.

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
Complete the mission.

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,839
The gun is prepared for you.

95
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,439
The location is at the damaged railing.

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Huang Zhixing said

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
he'd pause here,

98
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,720
step forward,

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,879
and then fake a stumble.

100
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,079
You should shoot at this moment.

101
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,040
Ballistics will prove

102
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,360
you were shooting for the head.

103
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,759
No.

104
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,040
The distance is too far.

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,959
The wind is strong.

106
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
When he stumbles,

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,160
his posture is uncontrollable.

108
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,920
Who can guarantee

109
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,600
I'll hit his shoulder?

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,639
How can I be sure?

111
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,000
I know it's difficult.

112
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,920
But Huang Zhixing said,

113
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,560
if we back out,

114
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,040
he'll do it himself.

115
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,000
It's okay if I shoot crooked.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,079
But what if I really

117
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,279
hit his head?

118
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,800
Huang Zhixing said

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
that a young man's desperate venture

120
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,040
gave him such courage.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,279
Guess who he was talking about.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
If I really shot him dead tomorrow,

123
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,839
it would be a joke.

124
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,040
I heard you've broken shooting records.

125
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,519
It was long ago.

126
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,720
How can it be the same?

127
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
I think if Huang Zhixing knows

128
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,199
you'll be the one to fire,

129
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,399
no matter how big the risk,

130
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,399
he will be willing.

131
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,199
Someone has to fire this shot, right?

132
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,560
Alright then.

133
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,920
I won't be the target anyway.

134
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,399
Don't worry yet.

135
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,839
We will have a better way.

136
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,879
It's too late.

137
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,240
The risk is too great.

138
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,160
Only this way

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,519
can we convince Cai Desheng.

140
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,959
But I think...

141
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,040
If you back out,

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,199
I'll do it myself.

143
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,680
Have you thought

144
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,079
that even if you're shot,

145
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,920
the Intelligence Agency will suspect
you staged it?

146
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,480
I know.

147
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,040
So I don't just get shot.

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,399
You need

149
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,079
to shoot me in the head.

150
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,879
His efforts were not in vain.

151
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,079
We have successfully obtained

152
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,360
the intel on the Eye Plan.

153
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
At the appropriate time,

154
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,720
I'll tell you

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,839
the details.

156
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,600
Chief Xu.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
There is something I don't understand.

158
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,759
We are always prepared

159
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,079
to sacrifice for our country.

160
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,279
That is reasonable.

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
If someone from the Chinese mainland

162
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,199
is willing to risk their lives

163
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,519
for the unification,

164
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,800
that is understandable.

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
But Huang Zhixing
is born in Taiwan, China.

166
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,079
He seeks nothing.

167
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,439
Clearly, he has a great future,

168
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,240
yet he'll risk his life

169
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
to help us stop the Eye Plan.

170
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,799
Why?

171
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
What do you think?

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,759
I think there is a belief in his heart

173
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,639
that is different from ours.

174
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,000
Indeed, it is different.

175
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,679
In fact, he has only one purpose.

176
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,759
What is it?

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,279
The national reunification.

178
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,000
But we are not at war.

179
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,399
That's right.

180
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,679
His ambition stretches beyond now.

181
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
And the future.

182
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,879
He hopes the war

183
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,279
will never break out in his hometown.

184
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
But he understands better
than most people

185
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,440
that peace

186
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
is never taken for granted.

187
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:18,976
(In treatment, do not disturb)

188
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,320
(My name is Huang Zhixing.)

189
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,519
(I'm born in Taiwan, China.)

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,759
(I was born in a veterans' village,)

191
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,559
(but I'm unlike many people around me.)

(Jiangsu, Fujian, or Guangdong.)

195
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,600

196
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
(that I'm born in Taiwan, China,)

197
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,720
(and here is my home.)

198
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:22,432
- (I've never seen Chinese mainland.)
- Morning.

199
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,360
(Taiwan, China is my only home.)

200
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,360
(In this regard, my dad)

201
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,519
(was very rigid.)

202
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,559
(He always firmly believed)

203
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,200
(that he was displaced here.)

204
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,519
(Someday)

205
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,039

207
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,840
(But actually,)

208
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,279
(he was only five when he came
to Taiwan, China.)

209
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,960
(He didn't remember)

210
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,480
(what the Chinese mainland was like.)

211
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,600
(Those so-called memories)

212
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,360
(were just imagination
based on the stories)

213
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,200
(told by my grandpa.)

214
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,559
(Grandpa passed away early.)

215
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,000
(Those stories)

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,919
(became Dad's longing and solace.)

217
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,159
(Of course, Dad didn't agree
with my thoughts.)

218
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,120
(For that, I was beaten a lot
as a child.)

219
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,759
(But the more he beat me,
the more defiant I became.)

220
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,200
(I had another new idea)

221
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,480
(that the future of Taiwan, China,)

222
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,559
(needed to be shaped by people like me.)

223
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,240
(But my dad, who lived in the past,)

224
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,320
(would never understand this.)

225
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,840
(When I was in my teens,)

226
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,200
(my mom passed away.)

227
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,720
(Then I had no reason)

228
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,519
(to stay in this home anymore.)

229
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,120
(So after being admitted to college,)

230
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,159
(I completely left here.)

231
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,679
(In college,)

232
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,440
(I met more like-minded peers.)

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,240
(Communication with them)

234
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,559
(stimulated my desire to see
the outside world.)

235
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,768
(So I used the money I saved
from part-time jobs)

236
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:39,200
(Transportation tickets)
(to travel on a budget everywhere.)

237
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,639
(I thought)

238
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,039
(that if I went to various places,)

239
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,039
(maybe)

240
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,200

of the future of Taiwan, China.)

00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,960
(that I had been to Europe, America,
and Japan,)

245
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,759

the Chinese mainland.)

(is an illusion.)

375
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,799
(I won't let air raid sirens)

376
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,920
(War brings suffering to civilians)
(haunt Xi's childhood.)

377
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,359
(Her peace)

378
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,200
(is worth any sacrifice.)
