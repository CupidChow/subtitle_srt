00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,656
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,744
(Met a sweet Taiwanese girl.
Is my dream coming true?)

4
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
Come out!

5
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,079
I can see you.

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,600
Come out.

7
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,159
Well,

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,239
don't get me wrong.

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Someone's

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,000
after me.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,480
I just

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,200
came in to hide for a bit.

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,959
Well,

14
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,159
don't get it wrong.

15
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,999
I'm not a thief.

16
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,799
Why are you holding my clothes?

17
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,599
You freak!

18
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,599
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,400
There is

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,560
a gang chasing me.

21
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,599
Black Lotus Gang.

22
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,199
I'm sweating.

23
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,120
I grabbed it and wiped my sweat.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
I didn't mean it.

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
How would I know if you meant it?

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,039
Freak!

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
I'll call the police!

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,719
Don't!

29
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,360
Don't come over!

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
Okay, okay.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just a tourist.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,520
And then

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,599
I somehow

34
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,000
ended up in a dead end.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,520
Then I saw a window open over here,

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,719
so I climbed in.

37
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,680
I don't know

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
how I offended the gangsters.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,080
They kept chasing me, so I ran.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,319
I'm really not a bad guy.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,159
Could you let me hide here?

42
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,960
You don't believe me?

43
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,919
You're from the mainland.

44
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,280
Why are they chasing you?

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
I...

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Come out!

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
I know you're in there. Come out!

48
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm begging you, please.

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,439
I'm begging you.

50
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,080
Just to hide.

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,879
I'll leave soon.

52
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,680
Yes?

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
I'm begging you.

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
What are you doing?

55
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,280
(Papaya Milk)
Seriously?

56
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,680
(Papaya Milk Parlor)

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,439
Banging around here in broad daylight,

58
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,560
like your funeral.

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
Come on,

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,639
we're after someone.

61
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,520
Who?

62
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,759
Who else could be in my place?

63
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,439
A man in his twenties, mainland accent,

64
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,639
floral shirt, yellow shorts.

65
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,360
Do you have nothing to do?

66
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,360
Smashing my shop?

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,199
How dare you!

68
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,360
I wasn't smashing, just knocking.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
Knock what?

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,879
Black Lotus Gang, huh?

71
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,759
I'll contact your parents now.

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm taking pictures to show them.

73
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,840
Please, ma'am!

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,319
Don't worry, they all left.

75
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,000
Really impressive.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,840
Your scared them away immediately!

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,400
That's because I was dealing with them.

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,639
I'm usually nicer.

79
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,319
Thank you.

80
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,479
I won't disturb you.

81
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,280
I'll leave.

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,159
Why are they chasing you?

83
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,400
I came here for tourism, right?

84
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,199
I tried to ask for directions,

85
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,360
but ended up asking their leader's son.

86
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,680
And for no reason,
they drew a knife on me.

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,199
Could I tolerate them?

88
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,839
I beat him up.

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,279
Then I got

90
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,160
wanted by the gang.

91
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,800
You seem so tired.

92
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,199
Have a sip of milk.

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,640
Try it.

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,880
How is it?

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
It's delicious.

96
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Of course.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,439
Our papaya milk
is famous throughout the town.

98
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,680
I have to ride a bike every day

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,639
to deliver our milk.

100
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,599
What?

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,520
Oh, nothing.

102
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,279
Thank you for earlier.

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,680
Well,

104
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
I thought I didn't make it clear,

105
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,639
didn't expect you to believe it.

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,920
You don't look like a bad guy to me.

107
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,120
No? I can be very bad.

108
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,360
I understand.

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,040
You boys

110
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,759
always have to look bad, right?

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
I got a younger brother, I get it.

112
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,039
Right?

113
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,000
Besides,

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,639
the Black Lotus Gang?

115
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,639
I don't like them.

116
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,319
They don't follow the rules,

117
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
so disrespectful.

118
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,000
For gangs,

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,399
Five Lakes Alliance is better.

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
You know them?

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,360
Why do you want to know?

122
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,120
I offended the Black Lotus Gang, right?

123
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,480
I want a backer.

124
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,439
You came from the mainland

125
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,759
to mingle with gangs?

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
Does your mother know?

127
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,759
Come with me to the police.

128
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,199
No need.

129
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,319
I can handle it myself.

130
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,239
Let's go.

131
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,959
This is?

132
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,759
I still have fresh milk to deliver.

133
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,720
I just helped you
deal with the Black Lotus Gang.

134
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,800
Help me out too, will you?

135
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000

let's get them all at once

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,079
and find our guy!

173
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,279
We'll let them know

174
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,360
who's the boss here.

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,640
He,

176
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
have you thought about

177
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
how serious it may be,

178
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,240
and how many men may get hurt?

179
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,319
Are we letting this go?

180
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,639
Everyone knows

181
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,959
we issued a wanted notice.

182
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,639
If nothing comes of it,

183
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,160
who will take us seriously?

184
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,560
We must make him understand

185
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,120
the consequences of messing with us.

186
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,279
Did we pass by the Five Lakes Alliance?

187
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,600
How do you know?

188
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,679
I checked the map.

189
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,360
I think it should be around there.

190
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,039
You are quite good.

191
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,279
I could do more.

192
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,679
What are you doing?

193
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,639
I saw it.

194
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,600
Did you secretly cut my wires?

195
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,039
I've lived here all my life.

196
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,960
Want to drive me away?

197
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,519
You've got it wrong!

198
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,639
Let go, or it's gonna hurt!

199
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,600
What are you doing?

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
Bullying an old man?

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,919
Have you no shame?

202
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,519
Who are you?

203
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,320
What's it to you?

204
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,160
Shut up!

205
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,759
What do you want?

206
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,320
Shut up.

207
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,000
(Wanted Notice)
Get off!

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Is this him?

209
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:22,159
Yes, that's him.

210
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,999
That's him.

211
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,840
My name's Chen Tianshuang. Yours?

212
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,559
See you!

213
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,399
Stop!

214
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,359
What?

215
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,840
I'll come back and find you!

216
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
Stop!

217
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,759
Move!

218
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,679
Stop, don't run!

219
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Don't run.

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Stop!

221
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,479
Don't run.

222
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,239
Stop!

223
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,440
This guy runs really fast.

224
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,639
Come on, you three, over here.

225
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
You follow me!

226
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,479
Go!

227
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,159
Why block the door?

228
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,799
Go in.

229
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
After you.

230
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,039
After you?

231
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,600
What was that?

232
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,480
The Wanted One?

233
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,879
What Wanted One?

234
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,600
You don't know?

235
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
Today, Black Lotus Gang

236
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,159
(Find that man)
sent a wanted notice.

237
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,039
Floral shirt, yellow shorts,

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
white shoes, gray bag.

239
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,000
The man from the mainland, that's you!

240
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,200
I should change my outfit.

241
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,120
The forum said

242
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,519
you offended their leader's son.

243
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,919
This is serious.

244
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,440
We were just sparring.

245
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,919
No, it's not that serious.

246
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,799
The entire Black Lotus Gang
is after you.

247
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,320
They say they'll teach you a lesson.

248
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
This is awesome!

249
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,759
Is it?

250
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,519
Yes!

251
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,039
Here.

252
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,720
Really?

253
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,560
Let's take a photo.

254
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
Really awesome, huh?

255
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
Taking a photo here.

256
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,799
Why are you here?

257
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,399
The same reason

258
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,360
as you.

259
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,799
No wonder.

260
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,799
So you intentionally beat up
their leader's son

261
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,440
to help the Five Lakes Alliance?

262
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,799
I'm called Chao.

263
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,080
Ming.

264
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,920
Good to see you.

265
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,519
Chen Tianshuang.

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
Tianshuang.

267
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
I know you kind of guys

268
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,519
see Taiwan, China is a small place,

269
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,240
thinking you're great, aren't you?

270
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm warning you,

271
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
get back while you still can.

272
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
Five Lakes doesn't need you!

273
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,879
Lian'an Town doesn't welcome you!

274
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
When I first got here,

275
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,159
I found it mundane.

276
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,240
But after seeing you,

277
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,840
I don't want to leave anymore.

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
Then you better be careful.

279
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,399
There's no return.

280
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Chao,

281
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,040
let's go.

282
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,519
Wanted One, good wishes.

283
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,279
Chao!

284
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,119
Coming.

285
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,440
(One day ago)
Hello?

286
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,280
Hello.

287
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,200
Here's the menu.

288
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,759
What specialties do you have?

289
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,080
Everything here is a specialty.

290
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you keep parrots here?

291
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,440
We have pigeon soup.

292
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,960
Want some?

293
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,080
I am your contact in Taiwan, China.

294
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,159
Just call me Long.

295
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,080
I'm Chen Tianshuang.

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,519
Chief Xu has told me about you.

297
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,039
You were once a rising star,

298
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,080
but later you quitted.

299
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,120
Now you're back?

300
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,960
He entrapped me.

301
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:23,879
Same here.

302
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,240
When I first came to Lian'an Town,
I was all alone.

303
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,919
We're doing this
for the next generation.

304
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
Chief Xu specifically told me

305
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,399
that when I got here,

306
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,600
don't rush the investigation,

307
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,679
but try to learn from you,

308
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,039
to blend into the local life.

309
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,279
For people from the mainland,

310
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,039
the Intelligence Agency
will be on guard.

311
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,639
And you're even involved with gangs.

312
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,679
It sounds very suspicious.

313
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,200
If you are suspected,
it gets troublesome.

314
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,440
But Chief Xu told me

315
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,120
you have many virtues,

316
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,039
such as being greedy

317
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,840
and lecherous,

318
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,799
loving to play tricks.

319
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,919
So you just need to live as usual,

320
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,720
like a businessman.

321
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,879
It should be fine.

322
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,960
Remember,

323
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,440
don't make your intentions obvious.

324
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,519
Understood.

325
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,360
Also,

326
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
if you encounter danger...

327
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,039
I get it.

328
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,879
I'll try my best

329
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,519
to help my companions evacuate.

330
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,320
Don't tell anyone you know me.

331
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,600
But don't worry.

332
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,440
Once you encounter danger,

333
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,360
we will try every way to rescue you.

334
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,960
Got it.

335
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:17,948
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

336
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:21,472
