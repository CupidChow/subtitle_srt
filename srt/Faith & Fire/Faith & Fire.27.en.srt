2
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:58,845
=Episode 27=

3
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:03,583
(He Jiahao has completely gone insane.
What a waste of his handsome face)

4
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:08,736
(One hour ago)

5
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,120
Dad.

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,879
You're here.

7
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,040
Shuyi.

8
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,400
Get out first.

9
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,719
There's something

10
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,200
I want to talk to Jiahao alone.

11
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,280
Don't worry.

12
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,719
It's fine.

13
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:40,879
Go ahead.

14
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,280
Jiahao.

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Jiahao.

16
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,439
When you were little,

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,840
whenever you saw me sleeping,

18
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,400
you would jump onto the bed.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,199
Every time

20
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,439
I caught you,

21
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,719
I pretended to hit you.

22
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,400
You were never afraid

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560
but would laugh.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,520
You

25
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,240
probably don't remember it anymore.

26
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,800
I remember.

27
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,560
Really?

28
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,240
I knew

29
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,199
that you wouldn't really hit me.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,159
In the blink of an eye,

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,479
twenty years have passed.

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
You've grown up,

33
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,560
and I've grown old.

34
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,199
Looking back,

35
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm the one who's harmed you.

36
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,800
What do you mean?

37
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,319
Your mom

38
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,439
passed away early.

39
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,000
I was

40
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
always very busy

41
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,240
and inevitably spoiled you a bit.

42
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,000
The others in the alliance

43
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,360
saw how I treated you,

44
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,520
so they

45
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,599
naturally also pampered you.

46
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,199
You thought

47
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,759
that everybody loved you.

48
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,400
But

49
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,599
it was not true.

50
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,000
That's just your excuse.

51
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,360
If He Shuyi hadn't come back,

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,159
would it have turned out like this?

53
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,759
She returned to Taiwan, China,

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,719
not to join

55
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,800
the Five Lakes Alliance.

56
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,759
What?

57
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,079
She originally had her own plans.

58
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,879
She just came back

59
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,560
to see her own dad.

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,920
I made her stay.

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,920
It was you?

62
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,680
Why?

63
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,959
Jiahao.

64
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,879
Being the head

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,480
seems powerful.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,720
But in fact,

67
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,600
it's not as easy as you imagine.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,959
I'm doing this for your own good.

69
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,040
For my own good?

70
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,199
Do you even believe it?

71
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,120
Originally,

72
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,000
I hoped you two

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,160
could support each other.

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,759
But...

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,439
I originally thought

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,199
He Shuyi was too cunning.

77
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,519
But I didn't expect

78
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,959
the problem was not her,

79
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,120
but you.

80
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,480
Jiahao.

81
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,920
Since things have come to this stage,

82
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,040
you can't stay in the alliance anymore.

83
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,600
I've already arranged it.

84
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,319
Tomorrow,

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,600
someone will come to take you

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,519
to Kenting.

87
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,160
Why do you want to take me to Kenting?

88
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,079
I've already made arrangements.

89
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,800
My old buddies there

90
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,079
will take care of you.

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
In the future,

92
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,759
whether you want to run a small business

93
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,000
or just enjoy life,

94
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,399
it's up to you.

95
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,920
So this

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,120
is also for my own good?

97
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,759
Right?

98
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,079
Jiahao.

99
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,439
The path of being in a gang

100
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,639
is not for you.

101
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
You want to drive me away?

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,879
No way.

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,399
I've said the Five Lakes Alliance
is mine.

104
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,319
If I can't get it,

105
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,920
that woman won't, either!

106
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,959
Brat.

107
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,800
What do you want to do?

108
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,120
I'll take the Five Lakes Alliance

109
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,639
down with me!

110
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
Brat!

111
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,279
I'll beat you to death!

112
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,319
You dare hit me?

113
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,480
Old fool.

114
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,720
What did you say?

115
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,639
Hit me?

116
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,360
You should die!

117
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,759
Five Lakes Alliance is mine!

118
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,120
Five Lakes Alliance is mine!

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,959
You old fool!

120
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,040
Die!

121
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,279
Die!

122
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,000
Die!

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,519
It's your karma!

124
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:19,959
Dad!

125
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,279
This is your karma!

126
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,920
I tried to get someone,

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,839
but it was already too late.

128
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,519
It's fine now.

129
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,240
In front of outsiders,

130
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,160
I am the head.

131
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
At this time, I can't panic.

132
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,800
But after all, he's my dad.

133
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,560
Alright.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Now is not the time to be sad.

135
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,199
What I'm more worried about

136
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,879
is Jiahao.

137
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,839
He didn't run away, right?

138
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,439
He didn't.

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
When he was caught,

140
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,079
he didn't even fight back.

141
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,399
He voluntarily confessed

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
but requested that we handle him

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
according to the alliance rules.

144
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,040
The alliance rules?

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Just like when we chose the head,

146
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,399
his fate will be decided
by everyone together.

147
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,000
Then what are you worried about?

148
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,399
You don't know my brother.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
Jiahao

150
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
won't accept his fate.

151
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,080
After what happened,

152
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,600
it would be normal for him to run
or make a scene.

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,720
But he didn't struggle at all.

154
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,519
That made me scared.

155
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,639
Do you think

156
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,200
he has other plans?

157
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,080
Tianshuang/

158
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
I can only entrust this matter to you.

159
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,720
Help me check it out.

160
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,799
Help you check?

161
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,759
Why me?

162
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,679
I think

163
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,440
this is just the beginning
of Jiahao's madness.

164
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,039
I don't trust anyone else.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
How about

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
we go to the police?

167
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,480
Not yet.

168
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,639
If you do me this favor,

169
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,879
I'll never

170
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,720
forget your kindness.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,879
I'll do my best.

172
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,679
Thank you, Tianshuang.

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,759
Be careful.

174
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,080
Tianshuang.

175
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,960
Shuyi asked me to come over.

176
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
Your sister is quite nice to you.

177
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,039
It looks comfortable.

178
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,399
You couldn't be the head.

179
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,120
So you

180
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,960
targeted a terminally ill old man?

181
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,399
He Jiahao.

182
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,559
He's your dad.

183
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
Chen Tianshuang.

184
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,840
If it weren't for you,

185
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,840
I would've become the head.

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,559
Maybe.

187
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,960
But guess what?

188
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,200
I was here

189
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,039
and went against you.

190
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,799
Infuriating, huh?

191
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,519
Be pleased as you like.

192
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,159
I don't care.

193
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,480
In the end,

194
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,440
everyone will have their karma.

195
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,960
Karma?

196
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,799
That's right.

197
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,039
Karma.

198
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,440
What kind of karma can I have?

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,759
Everyone has karma.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
You killed your dad.

201
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,600
Is that karma, too?

202
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,960
Yes.

203
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,240
It's his,

204
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
and mine, too.

205
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,759
I had no choice.

206
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,679
As for you and the others,

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,799
don't worry.

208
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,080
It's coming.

209
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,039
Playing fortune-telling with me?

210
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,519
Sorry,

211
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,039
but I don't believe in this.

212
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,360
Shuyi.

213
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,480
How's it going?

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,879
He didn't talk.

215
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,480
But I think,

216
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,879
just like you said,

217
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,759
things are not that simple.

218
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,159
You think so, too?

219
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,519
He kept talking about karma,

220
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,080
saying everyone had karma.

221
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I think

222
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,240
he's planning something.

223
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,759
But what exactly is it?

224
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,080
It's Jiahao's.

225
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,399
What's inside it?

226
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,080
I didn't find anything.

227
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
But he usually likes to play with these

228
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,440
and also writes programs himself.

229
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,600
Check it again.

230
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,856
(Lian'an Town)

231
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,639
This kid is something.

232
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,799
He really hid something?

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,799
Yes.

234
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,240
But he designed an encryption program.

235
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,639
I have to crack it.

236
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,399
Thanks, Long.

237
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,399
Staying up all night at this age

238
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,799
is suffering.

239
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Give you a massage.

240
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,639
Be gentle.

241
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,879
Is this okay?

242
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,559
Okay.

243
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,360
How is it, Long?

244
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,679
Awake?

245
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,360
Almost there.

246
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,720
Still needs a while.

247
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,480
Qiang.

248
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,759
He Jiahao.

249
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,759
Anything else to say?

250
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,440
He Shuyi.

251
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,039
You want me to cry, admit my fault,

252
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,720
and beg for mercy?

253
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,440
Yes.

254
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,399
I killed him.

255
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,799
I admit it.

256
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,960
However,

257
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,600
no one can escape their karma.

258
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,840
You guys

259
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,159
are the same.

260
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,720
You killed your dad.

261
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,000
You are an animal.

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,320
You killed your own dad.

263
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,039
What's that sound?

264
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
On your side.

265
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,919
Try to find it.

266
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,320
Find it.

267
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,440
A bomb!

268
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,559
Run!

269
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,399
It will explode.

270
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,120
Run!

271
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,360
Tianshuang.

272
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,919
That program

273
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,279
is the countdown to detonation.

274
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,080
Detonation?

275
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,639
Open the door!

276
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,759
Is there anyone outside?

277
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,840
- Open the door.
- Open it!

278
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,600
Call someone here.

279
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,480
We are locked in.

280
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,240
He Jiahao.

281
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,799
What are you up to?

282
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,159
Anyway, it's all karma.

283
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,759
I just made it happen a bit earlier.

284
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,960
What's wrong with it?

285
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I felt something was wrong with you
these days.

286
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,600
The front door is locked.

287
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,639
The back door, too.

288
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,399
Let go!

289
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,279
Let us out now!

290
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,559
Or, I'll shoot you!

291
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,159
Qiang.

292
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,080
Calm down.

293
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,639
Killing him

294
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,039
won't help us at all.

295
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,600
Your brother

296
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,840
is still with Tianhai Sect.

297
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,159
Come on!

298
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Shoot me.

299
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,080
Didn't you want to shoot me dead?

300
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,159
Shoot me!

301
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,159
He Jiahao.

302
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,080
I'm giving you one last chance.

303
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,720
If you don't speak,

304
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,960
even I can't help you.

305
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,559
I don't need your help, He Shuyi.

306
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,159
Anyway, we're all going to die here.

307
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,279
Stop laughing!

308
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,039
Qiang, calm down.

309
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Give me a minute.

310
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
Don't act impulsively.

311
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,279
Tianshuang.

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,120
Tianshuang, listen to me.

313
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
We're now locked in the hall,

314
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,200
and there's a bomb countdown sound.

315
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,679
Shuyi, time is running out.

316
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,159
He Jiahao's phone is the bomb

317
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,960
(Enter the password)
control device.

318
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,319
Can you control it?

319
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,839
Just one step away.

320
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,039
We need a six-digit password now.

321
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,880
A six-digit password
that He Jiahao would use.

322
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,720
It's too late to crack the password.

323
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,400
Think about it.

324
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,640
What would he use?

325
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,000
Shut up!

326
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,880
981119.

327
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,839
His birthday.

328
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,480
981119.

329
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,656
(Incorrect password)

330
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,759
Wrong, there are two chances left.

331
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,079
71

332
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,400
0706.

333
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,559
His mom's birthday.

334
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:38,976
(Incorrect password)

335
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,720
Wrong.

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,880
One last chance.

337
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,279
Otherwise, the system will lock.

338
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,039
He Shuyi.

339
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,880
You're about to meet

340
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,440
your most beloved dad.
