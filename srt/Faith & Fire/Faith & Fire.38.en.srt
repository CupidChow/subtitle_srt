3
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:03,680
(I'm in the dark, and he's in the light.
Hope everything is fine with Pushpin)

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,159
Be faster.

5
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,159
We'll be late.

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,840
Mom.

7
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,120
What?

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,239
I forgot to bring the textbook.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Didn't I tell you

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,920
to check once more before leaving?

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
Why did you forget again?

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,680
Dad.

13
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:26,920
Xi.

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,319
Do you want to go

15
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,480
and get the textbook?

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,200
Hurry up.

17
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,000
Why did you come so early?

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,439
I need to do some things

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,079
and will be gone for a while.

20
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,640
So I want to say something to Xi.

21
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,959
She's going to be late.

22
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,200
This time I'll be gone longer.

23
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,200
How long?

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,319
A few years.

25
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,319
Maybe even longer.

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,599
Then,

27
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,080
what about the holidays?

28
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,439
I might not have holidays.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,919
So inhumane?

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Do you have to go?

31
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,120
There's no choice.

32
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,000
How could there be no choice?

33
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,039
There's always a choice.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
Why are you suddenly angry?

35
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,879
Right.

36
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,240
Why am I angry?

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,280
Xi's class on weekends...

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,080
No need.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
I've arranged it for her.

40
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,520
I saw the message you left before.

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,719
Thank you.

42
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,879
For what?

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
She's my daughter, too.

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,159
Sorry, Yingxuan.

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
Why suddenly apologize to me?

46
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,360
Nothing.

47
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,520
For bringing you trouble.

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,319
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,080
Xi.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,759
Dad.

51
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,360
Dad, you know,

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
I've already grown up.

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,639
Don't carry me like this.

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Alright, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Let me be a little willful, okay?

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,639
But I'm going to be late.

57
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,439
Then be late.

58
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,680
It's no big deal.

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,479
That's not what you said earlier.

60
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,599
Adults really

61
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,120
change all the time.

62
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,560
Xi.

63
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,599
I need to go out to do something

64
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,919
and will be away for a while.

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,000
Get along well with Mom.

66
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,840
How long will you be gone?

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,199
I have a choir performance next week.

68
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm afraid

69
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,159
I can't make it.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
What about the week after next?

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,800
Soccer game.

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,879
I'll try.

73
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,759
It won't be forever, right?

74
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,240
Don't talk nonsense.

75
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,160
How's that possible?

76
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,000
But you're hugging me so tight.

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,720
You were not like this usually.

78
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,439
Really?

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,879
Pretty sure it's just you getting bigger

80
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,160
and heavier.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
Don't say a girl gets heavier.

82
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,839
Okay.

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,279
I was wrong.

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll apologize.

85
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,319
Xi, I have to go.

86
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,079
Don't be angry, okay?

87
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,319
Give me a kiss.

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,480
Then you have to promise me one thing.

89
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,279
What is it?

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
You promise

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,319
that you'll come back.

92
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,639
I promise.

93
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,240
Alright.

94
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,600
It's been too long.

95
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,879
Why did you change again?

96
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,079
Bye, Dad.

97
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,839
You promised your daughter.

98
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,279
If you don't keep your word,

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,480
I won't forgive you.

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
- Anle.
- Anle.

101
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,120
How is it going?

102
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,839
I already saw Zheng Taixiang's car.

103
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Don't rush to show up.

104
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,800
Delay a bit more.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,360
Okay.

106
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,759
Anle.

107
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,000
Taixiang asked me to get him something.

108
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,680
Okay.

109
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:48,192
(Zheng)

110
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:57,472
(Odin's Eye)

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,480
Don't move.

112
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,199
You only have one chance.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,160
Zhixing.

114
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,439
You went through my computer.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,439
What are you trying to find?

116
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,560
Taixiang.

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,519
I wanted to surprise you.

118
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,759
Anle.

119
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,519
Put your hand up.

120
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,839
So it was you giving me a surprise.

121
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,439
Surprise?

122
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,720
Hello?

123
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,519
You caught Huang Zhixing?

124
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,879
Then come over to my place now.

125
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,240
Bobo.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,160
Such a loyal person

127
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,319
would also betray.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
This is not a betrayal.

129
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,079
He's been with me all along.

130
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,920
Ten years ago,

131
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,639
I saved his life.

132
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,920
Out of gratitude,

133
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,360
he gave me a promise.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,120
So I used this promise

135
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,399
to have him

136
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,959
watch over

137
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,000
Huang Zhixing for me.

138
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,559
Because of a promise,

139
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,360
he stayed with Anle for ten years?

140
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,480
People are different from each other.

141
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,240
Some people

142
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,639
value interests.

143
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
But some people

144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
value relationships.

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,960
I heard from Zhixing

146
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,279
that you worked for him

147
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,960
to avenge your dad

148
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,480
one day.

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,919
Yes.

150
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,639
If there are no surprises,

151
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,480
he should be under Bobo's control now

152
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,120
and

153
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,200
will be handed over to Cai Desheng.

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm afraid

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
you can't take your revenge

156
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,279
for now.

157
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,799
It doesn't matter.

158
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm not in a hurry.

159
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,519
Now our Tianhai Sect

160
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,440
is thriving.

161
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,200
But among my subordinates,

162
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,360
some

163
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,000
only know how to act recklessly,

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,879
and some

165
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,279
love to use schemes.

166
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,200
Those with better abilities

167
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,639
are too arrogant.

168
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,639
To be honest,

169
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,639
my most capable man

170
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,679
is Huang Zhixing.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,039
But today,

172
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
he's gone too.

173
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,240
Xiang.

174
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,440
What do you think of me?

175
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,360
You?

176
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
As long as you fulfill my wish,

177
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,799
I can do anything for you,

178
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,639
regardless of the cost.

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
Then tell me your wish.

180
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,039
Taking revenge

181
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,759
and restoring Black Lotus Gang.

182
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,600
But earlier, you didn't kill him.

183
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,679
That's different.

184
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,960
I know you still need him.

185
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,200
You are quite smart.

186
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,200
With my connections
to Intelligence Agency,

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
if Huang Zhixing

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,360
is released,

189
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,759
I'll inform you immediately.

190
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
As for what comes next...

191
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,120
It's not a problem.

192
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,879
I'm not in a hurry.

193
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,399
Alright.

194
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,039
He.

195
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
From now on,

196
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,519
you are one of us.

197
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,279
Thank you.

198
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,352
(Bobo)

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,360
Go ahead.

200
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
Taixiang.

201
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,679
Huang Zhixing escaped.

202
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,799
Escaped?

203
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
How did he escape?

204
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,759
I guess he knew this day might come

205
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,879
and had a plan B.

206
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,799
I'm not sure.

207
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,840
No matter what,

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,480
bring him back to me.

209
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,200
Don't worry.

210
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm already on the way.

211
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,480
Xiang.

212
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,159
How should we explain

213
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,559
to Mr. Cai?

214
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,799
That's not a problem.

215
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,240
As long as we can bring him back,

216
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,200
everything will be okay.

217
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,919
Pull over.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,679
Xiang.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,120
We can't make it.

220
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,080
I know.

221
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,279
So,

222
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,879
I gave Mr. Cai a call.

223
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
But even if they take action now,

224
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,679
it's still too late.

225
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,080
If there are no surprises,

226
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,279
it is indeed too late.

227
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,440
See me off for my final journey,

228
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,600
Bobo.

229
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,279
When passing through here,

230
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
I always thought
this coastline was ordinary.

231
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,799
Why's it hitting different today?

232
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,639
One reckless heist for Eye Plan

233
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,159
changed everything.

234
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,960
The Taipei extraction

235
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,519
would have kept our relationship.

236
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,759
Maybe.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,080
Many things happen in this world
every day.

238
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,240
Neither you nor I

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,679
is important.

240
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,639
Why do this

241
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,559
and get yourself involved?

242
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,840
Besides, you have a family.

243
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,840
Have you considered them?

244
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,120
Do you think I haven't?

245
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,399
I don't want my child

246
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,000
to never see their dad again.

247
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,480
I don't want that either.

248
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,399
Maybe you're right.

249
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,080
Maybe most people wouldn't choose
this way.

250
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,039
But I least want my daughter

251
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,960
to live in fear every day,

252
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,600
worrying that war might happen anytime.

253
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,879
I hope she can live

254
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,639
in a land of peace.

255
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,639
They're coming.

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,840
Zhixing.

257
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,159
You really disappointed me.

258
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,440
Mr. Cai, you misunderstood.

259
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,919
I was not avoiding you.

260
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,240
Exactly on the contrary,

261
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,799
I was going to find you.

262
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,240
I have evidence of Zheng Taixiang

263
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,200
contacting

264
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,600
Chinese mainland's
intelligence personnel.

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,919
Are you sure it's Zheng Taixiang?

266
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,840
That's right.

267
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,559
Shut up.

268
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,679
What are you doing?

269
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:08,840
Put the gun down.

270
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,559
Let him speak.

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,240
I discovered Zheng Taixiang's plot.

272
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
He suspected it.

273
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,720
So he accused me first

274
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,960
and framed me.

275
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,039
That doesn't make sense.

276
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,559
If Zheng Taixiang

277
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,480
was a traitor,

278
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,519
he wouldn't let you live to see me.

279
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
That's exactly his plan.

280
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,600
But

281
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,440
someone became soft-hearted.

282
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,840
I can only tell you the evidence
of Zheng Taixiang

283
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,279
contacting the Chinese mainland.

284
00:16:59,159 --> 00:16:59,799
Alright.

285
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,400
Hurry, take Mr. Cai away.

286
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,480
You can't die.

287
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,279
Anle.

288
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,359
You can't die.

289
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,680
Mr. Cai.

290
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,720
The bullet came from the opposite slope.

291
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
The shooter is gone.

292
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
How is Huang Zhixing?

293
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,519
He is injured.

294
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,559
His blood loss is severe.

295
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,240
He can't die.

296
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,720
You must catch the shooter.

297
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,319
Got it!

298
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,319
How is it?

299
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,480
Hit the target.

300
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,920
Don't worry.

301
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,319
I know what I'm doing.

302
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,519
Anle.

303
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,720
You can't die.

304
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,400
You can't die.
