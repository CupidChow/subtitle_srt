2
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:58,727
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:03,776
(I'll help He Shuyi, and I hope
Qi won't misunderstand me)

4
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,480
I have no evidence,

5
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,480
but I know my brother very well.

6
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,840
He just overreacted.

7
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,799
So, he must have been involved
in the attack.

8
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,400
And now,

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
we have bought some time.

10
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,840
So, you were bluffing him just now.

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,359
Shuyi.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,280
You acted so well.

13
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,959
I couldn't tell you were acting.

14
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,840
Did you notice

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,920
how Jiahao reacted
when he saw Anle yesterday?

16
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,719
As far as I know,

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,040
they knew each other before.

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,120
They knew each other?

19
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,599
Well,

20
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,319
he met Anle

21
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,159
right before Xiu

22
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,319
was attacked.

23
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,799
So,

24
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,519
He Jiahao attacked Xiu

25
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,359
for the Tianhai Sect?

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,079
That's strange.

27
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,959
If the Tianhai Sect tried to scare us,

28
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,319
why

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,759
didn't they do it themselves?

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,560
Why did they use Jiahao?

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
I guess Anle wants

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,120
to make our alliance surrender.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,159
So, he needs to make a move
for deterrence

34
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:22,000
without making enemies with us.

35
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,840
At this time,

36
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,520
an obedient guy

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,919
who can be discarded at any time

38
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,800
is a better choice.

39
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,199
Now they are
taking advantage of He Jiahao.

40
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,840
If we surrender,

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,039
they'll discard him at any time.

42
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,240
Anle

43
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,159
is pretty tricky.

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,199
That's why

45
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,479
we refuse to turn to Tianhai Sect.

46
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,439
Outsiders

47
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,919
can become sacrificial pawns
at any time.

48
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,319
But we need evidence now.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,919
The record,

50
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,159
footage,

51
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,319
or the culprit who attacked Xiu

52
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
to expose He Jiahao.

53
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,680
But we don't have a shred of proof.

54
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,919
Jiahao is my brother after all.

55
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,439
We are too familiar with each other.

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,919
Jiahao is

57
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,680
on guard against my people.

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,080
So, it's hard

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
to make any substantial progress.

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,360
But you can do something.

61
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,599
And I guess

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
you should already have clues,

63
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,719
right?

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,120
How do you know?

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm good at reading people.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
All I can say is

67
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,400
I can give it a try.

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,560
But I can't guarantee you.

69
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,120
But I can guarantee you.

70
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,960
If you can find the evidence

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,840
against Jiahao,

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,759
I'll meet your previous requirements

73
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,520
and you will

74
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,280
get everything

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,599
you want.

76
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,680
Okay.

77
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,560
(Lian'an Town)

78
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,039
Tianshuang.

79
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,520
You're back.

80
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,319
Ming.

81
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,159
Come and take a look.

82
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,039
What is this?

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
This item saved the guy

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,279
who attacked Xiu.

85
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,040
Well...

86
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,519
This is obviously custom-made.

87
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,160
Did you see something like this before?

88
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,879
Sir.

89
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,199
Do you remember me?

90
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,519
Yes, I do.

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,079
I know you.

92
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,000
You're that girl's friend,

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,759
aren't you?

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Who is that girl?

95
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,959
Your sister.

96
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,079
What brings you here?

97
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,800
Sir.

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,519
Take a look at this.

99
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,319
I won't look.

100
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,199
Go find someone else.

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,800
Sir, please just take a quick look.

102
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm old.

103
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Very busy.

104
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,240
Please.

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,279
No way.

106
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,519
It won't take too much time.

107
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,879
He overreacted.

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
I already told you.

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,360
It's okay.

110
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,439
I have another way.

111
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
What is it?

112
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,839
Shuyi gave me a secret tool.

113
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,959
Sir.

114
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,759
Sir.

115
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,279
It looks so beautiful.

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,839
Sir.

117
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,720
What do you want?

118
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,199
You know Shuyi?

119
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,480
(Please consider Chen Tianshuang
as my man and help him for my sake.)

120
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,519
What does the letter say?

121
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,279
I don't know.

122
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,160
Shuyi didn't tell me.

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,319
Shuyi is quite a nice girl,

124
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,319
but she has bad taste.

125
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,240
What does he mean?

126
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,000
He means you're ordinary.

127
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,759
Sir.

128
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,920
You don't know me.

129
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm great.

130
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,720
For Shuyi's sake,

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,040
I'll help you.

132
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,720
You must treat her well.

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,240
Take a look.

134
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,759
Tianshuang, you...

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,240
My man?

136
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,040
It's a misunderstanding.

137
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,279
She wrote it like this

138
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,399
for handling this.

139
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,216
I'll tell my sister about it.

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
Don't you know what kind of guy I am?

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,519
- What kind of guy?
- An honest guy.

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,120
Why does

143
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
every girl have a rumor with you?

144
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,920
You got me.

145
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,680
Done.

146
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,000
How is it?

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's bad.

148
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,160
The craftsmanship is bad.

149
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,759
Do you know who carved this?

150
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,600
I only know famous craftsmen.

151
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
I never saw

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,759
this kind of stuff.

153
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,160
Take a closer look, sir.

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,399
I know nothing about it.

155
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,439
Sir.

156
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,800
What should we do now?

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,199
Is there any other way?

158
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,680
No.

159
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,519
It's okay. Don't give up.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,920
I'm a bit hungry.

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,000
Well,

162
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,079
let's go eat something.

163
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,160
Then let's just go to my place.

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,319
Okay.

165
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,360
Please consider Chen Tianshuang
as my man.

166
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,360
I told you

167
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,639
it was to do my job.

168
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,639
The soup is ready.

169
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,720
I love soup.

170
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,040
You bad guy.

171
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,360
Is he

172
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,240
talking about you?

173
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,959
He was talking about my attitude
towards food.

174
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,199
I wanted buns this morning.

175
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,759
But now, I want to have soup.

176
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,120
I'm quite confused about my stomach.

177
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,079
Luo and Hui are not here today.

178
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,519
You must finish it all.

179
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,279
Why not have it?

180
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,560
You don't like it?

181
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,120
Sure.

182
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,472
We have trouble finding someone.

183
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,480
Who are you looking for?

184
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,240
You ask me.

185
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,399
Maybe I know.

186
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,600
It's useless telling you.

187
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,560
Did you ever see this?

188
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,199
Yes, I did.

189
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Where?

190
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,519
Tao had it.

191
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,839
Tao from Li's place?

192
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,959
Let's go.

193
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,759
Have your soup.

194
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,480
Drink it slowly. It's hot.

195
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,759
Let's talk later.

196
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,120
Come on.

197
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,759
Wait.

198
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,759
You don't happen to know

199
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,919
who carved this, do you?

200
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,679
Sheng made this.

201
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,320
He likes making this kind of stuff.

202
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,200
Sheng?

203
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,320
Qi, I love you.

204
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,120
See you.

205
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,960
Come on.

206
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,480
What?

207
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,279
Why are you in such a hurry?

208
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,919
Sheng made this item.

209
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,159
Who exactly is the murderer?

210
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,000
Lin Pinghe.

211
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,559
But there's more we shall do.

212
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,679
What else?

213
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,519
Sheng

214
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,600
will surprise us.

215
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,240
Long time no see, Sheng.

216
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,039
What are you doing here?

217
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,919
Sheng has already

218
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,320
left the gang.

219
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,960
Tao.

220
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,320
Don't be so nervous.

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,159
We're not giving Sheng trouble.

222
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,759
I'll just take a moment of his time.

223
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,799
Can I?

224
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,799
Tao.

225
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,480
Wait a moment.

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
It'll be quick.

227
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,639
I have to make things clear

228
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,000
to keep moving forward.

229
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
I promised you I would not get involved.

230
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,399
I will keep my promise.

231
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,039
Trust me.

232
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,360
Make it quick.

233
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,039
Just like Tao said,

234
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,000
I have nothing to do

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,399
with the Black Lotus Gang.

236
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,840
Whatever you want to ask,

237
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,919
I really don't know.

238
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,600
Are you in touch with Lin Pinghe?

239
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
He

240
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,120
chose his own path.

241
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,559
I couldn't stop him.

242
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,600
There's no way.

243
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,159
So, I really don't know where he is.

244
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,759
What a coincidence!

245
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,120
I know.

246
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
You know?

247
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,559
He's turned to He Jiahao
from the Five Lakes Alliance.

248
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,000
He Jiahao appointed him
as the new Chief.

249
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,879
Alright.

250
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,399
No matter what,

251
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,799
it's none of my business.

252
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,399
Really?

253
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,759
You gave him this, right?

254
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,879
Well,

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,039
how did you get this?

256
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,399
Do you know

257
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,519
Lin Pinghe attacked Xiu?

258
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,759
I don't know.

259
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,799
I really don't know.

260
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,840
I let you go back then.

261
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,519
Is this how you repay me?

262
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,519
I really don't know.

263
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,679
If I knew, I definitely...

264
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,559
I would stop him.

265
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,200
Alright.

266
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,679
I won't blame you

267
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,279
for how you treat us.

268
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Lin Pinghe is in trouble.

269
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,519
Will you help him?

270
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,399
But there's nothing I can do.

271
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,279
He is now caught between two gangs,

272
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:01,840
being taken

273
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
advantage of.

274
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,879
Do you know what will happen to him?

275
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
But I...

276
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,759
I know you are hesitant now.

277
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,879
It's not too late to help him.

278
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,279
There must be someone else
behind the attack on Xiu.

279
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,399
Now, Lin Pinghe is already targeted.

280
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,919
If the real culprit isn't found,

281
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,960
he will be doomed.

282
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,519
His life is now in your hands.

283
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,600
Are you going to let him die?

284
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,360
Alright.

285
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,759
I'll tell you all I know.

286
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,559
Before He left,

287
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,919
he gave me something.

288
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,919
Come on.

289
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,519
I'll show you something impressive.

290
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,720
Okay?

291
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,279
Impressive.

292
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,360
Boss, come on.

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
Awesome.

294
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,440
Boss, come on.

295
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Love you.

296
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,399
Boss, one more drink.

297
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,799
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

298
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,759
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

299
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,879
Come on.

300
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,759
Let's sing

301
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,399
and dance.

302
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,879
Come on.

303
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,080
You'll confront them tomorrow.

304
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,480
Don't you need to prepare for it?

305
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,120
What should I prepare?

306
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,559
What if they find evidence?

307
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,320
Whatever.

308
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't care.

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,440
I was just bluffed by her that day.

310
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,360
There's no evidence at all.

311
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,720
What am I afraid of?

312
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,320
Don't you take some?

313
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,279
No, I can't.

314
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,519
What?

315
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,559
You grew up in a gang.

316
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,080
Are you telling me you can't do this?

317
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,399
My dad told me

318
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,399
that drugs are for sale,

319
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,440
not for personal use.

320
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,799
You can't even know this.

321
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,039
How can you be the boss?

322
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,159
What do you mean?

323
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,480
Nothing.

324
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,840
Anyway, words of the dead

325
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,919
mean nothing.

326
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
Lin Pinghe.

327
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,919
You're kind of interesting.

328
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Usually, people come to me

329
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,960
because they want something.

330
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,240
But you are different.

331
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,080
You aren't involved
in gambling or drugs.

332
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,759
I told you before

333
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,000
I only want revenge.

334
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,399
I don't want anything else.

335
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,399
What if I want you

336
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,639
to do this with me?

337
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,000
Jiahao.

338
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,360
For the record,

339
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,519
we are using each other.

340
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
That's how we both win.

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,360
Using each other?

342
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,759
Stop flattering yourself.

343
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,879
You are just like a dog.

344
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,320
Just do whatever

345
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,519
I tell you to do.

346
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,080
Here you go.

347
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,559
Why were you putting on act?

348
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,320
Come on!

349
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,159
Guys,

350
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,080
get excited!

351
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,480
Boss.

352
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

353
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,320
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

354
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,480
Boss, come on.

355
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
Boss, you're amazing.
