3
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:03,712
(Tianliang, my buddy,
bless me to get it through smoothly.)

4
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,599
Tianshuang.

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,400
Go eat something.

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,280
You'll feel better.

7
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,239
Listen,

8
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,200
if one day

9
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,280
one of us is gone...

10
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,159
What's wrong with you?

11
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,000
How could one of us be gone?

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,840
I will

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,879
keep you safe.

14
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,680
But what if it happens?

15
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,280
Watch the road.

16
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,439
(Chen Tianshuang.)

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
Did you hear what I said to you?

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Chief Xu.

19
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
In my current situation,

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
I feel I can't work here anymore.

21
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,879
(Tianliang,)

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,840
(my buddy.)

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,719
(It's been two years.)

24
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,360
(I thought everything was over)

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,879
(and I could)

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,840
(live well for you.)

27
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,759
(But I'm really sorry.)

28
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,319
(In the end,)

29
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,639
(I messed up.)

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,560
(It's like a nightmare.)

31
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,159
(You think it's gone.)

32
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,319
(But inadvertently,)

33
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,080
(it attacks me from hidden places.)

34
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,560
(I realize)

35
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,479
(maybe I can't escape it)

36
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,960
(for the rest of my life.)

37
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,560
What's wrong?

38
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,599
I have a problem.

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
What problem?

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,599
Tell me about it,

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,479
or how can I help you?

42
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,479
Lin Yongning just died in front of me.

43
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,400
Who did it?

44
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,400
Bobo from the Tianhai Sect.

45
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,039
He did it under Anle's orders.

46
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,479
I'll find more details

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
after I return to Five Lakes Alliance.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,919
Got it.

49
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,439
Didn't you just do this yesterday?

50
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,319
You can't do it now?

51
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,120
And then?

52
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,480
It's okay.

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,279
Sorry.

54
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,920
You don't look well.

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,439
What's wrong with you?

56
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,759
Are you sick?

57
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,319
I'm fine.

58
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,000
Do you have a fever?

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Let me check.

60
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,720
You don't have a fever.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,959
What happened?

62
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,519
I'm just feeling a bit unwell.

63
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,480
Is there something bothering you?

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,759
Tell me about it.

65
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,639
Don't keep it inside.

66
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,680
Nothing.

67
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,959
Are you afraid I'll tell someone else?

68
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,439
Don't worry.

69
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,319
Whatever you tell me is our secret.

70
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:40,879
Pinky promise.

71
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,560
If you don't want to talk about it,

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,240
I'll be with you for a while.

73
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,279
I've been having a nightmare.

74
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,240
In the dream,

75
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm an all-powerful superhero,

76
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,439
catching bad guys,

77
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,720
and fighting villains.

78
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,360
And because of this,

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,480
I put myself and those around me

80
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
in danger.

81
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,319
Why do you have this kind of dream?

82
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,879
Did it happen before?

83
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,959
That was a long time ago.

84
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,240
But it happened again.

85
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,439
I'm really okay.

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,839
It's all my choice.

87
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,600
But at the end of my dream,

88
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,920
because of me,

89
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,079
my friends

90
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
and relatives...

91
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,560
Have you ever thought

92
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,240
about living a different life
in the dream?

93
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,839
For example,

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,680
not doing dangerous things.

95
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,319
That's what I did.

96
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,800
But...

97
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,920
Did something happen to you?

98
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,279
Nothing.

99
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,319
It's just a dream.

100
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,839
It's not a big deal.

101
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,319
It was due to low blood sugar.

102
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm feeling better now.

103
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,959
It's good.

104
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,279
But dreams are a person's subconscious.

105
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,240
You should treat it seriously.

106
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
Cheer up.

107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
If you have any concerns,

108
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
you can talk to me.

109
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,879
It doesn't matter.

110
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,399
I invite you over for dinner.

111
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,319
Why the long face?

112
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,759
Smile.

113
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
Look how cute you are now.

114
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,959
Smile.

115
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,839
Tianshuang.

116
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:14,208
(Charitable Town)

117
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:15,959
You're back.

118
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,920
Sure.

119
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,560
Let's go.

120
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,519
Cheers.

121
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,519
Tianshuang.

122
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,480
Guess what I told my friends about you

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,000
when you just came?

124
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,480
I think you were born for this job.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
Otherwise, why would you hire me?

126
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,799
In the gang world,

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,799
there are two kinds of people.

128
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,759
The first kind of people

129
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,440
are loyal and righteous,

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,440
willing to help their friends
at any cost.

131
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,919
However,

132
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,159
they're easily used,

133
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,159
just like Ming.

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,039
The other kind

135
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,840
is adaptable and clever.

136
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,799
When they encounter things,

137
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,279
they often seize the opportunity.

138
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,000
People

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,120
are willing to enjoy good times
with them instead of

140
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
getting through a hard time,

141
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,799
just like Heilun.

142
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,600
What kind of guy am I?

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,720
You're the third kind.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,440
Do you know which trait of yours

145
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,600
I really appreciate?

146
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
I know how to flatter.

147
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,399
When you first joined the alliance,

148
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,440
you made Ming

149
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,679
look like a fool.

150
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,799
I thought he would

151
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,120
be afraid of you.

152
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,360
As a result,

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
before too long,

154
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,879
he made friends with you.

155
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,480
It's rare to meet someone

156
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,840
like you.

157
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,840
I just can play some petty tricks.

158
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,639
But I can't

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,360
handle big things.

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,720
Cheers.

161
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,159
It's your first time

162
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,240
watching someone die, right?

163
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,919
Second time.

164
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,200
Second time?

165
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,679
Last time,

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,080
my best buddy died.

167
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Drink.

168
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,279
Here's to your buddy.

169
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,600
Tianshuang.

170
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
Given what happened today,

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,279
if you want to leave,

172
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,240
I can understand.

173
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,919
But what I want to tell you is

174
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
that the gang world

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,840
is not as scary as you imagine.

176
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,080
It's rare to see

177
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,399
what happened today.

178
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
Gangs know each other,

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,360
which is normal.

180
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,679
And we all do business.

181
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,960
It's rare to see someone kill a guy

182
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,360
without notice.

183
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,919
It's rare?

184
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,600
But I saw it today.

185
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,360
Because he offended Anle.

186
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,159
What kind of guy Anle is?

187
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,159
Tianhai Sect

188
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,639
is the largest gang here.

189
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,919
As the Chief Protector,

190
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,639
the actual second-in-command,

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,240
Anle is famous for his ruthlessness.

192
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,720
He always silences others
without notice.

193
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,480
I have indeed seen it many times.

194
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320
He acts like this.

195
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
Is he not afraid of retaliation?

196
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,440
Although Anle is ruthless,

197
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,360
he doesn't act recklessly.

198
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,039
Before any action,

199
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,279
he will let people know

200
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,440
why he does this.

201
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,399
He can also foresee others' reactions.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,919
Black Lotus Gang

203
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,559
appears fierce.

204
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,720
Actually, they're just
a motley crew of losers.

205
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,519
Since Heilun is dead,

206
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,320
they are nothing.

207
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,480
I mean it.

208
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,240
They want to seek revenge?

209
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,480
Who will do that?

210
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,600
Anle rarely shows up usually.

211
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,039
Very few people know him.

212
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,440
Even if they want revenge,

213
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,080
can they find him?

214
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,919
Anle is really not simple.

215
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,440
Xiu.

216
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,559
Does our alliance

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,519
have conflicts with him?

218
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,559
Not at the moment.

219
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
Today, Bobo even said

220
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,840
he wanted to cooperate with us.

221
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,240
But I can't

222
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,159
guess how.

223
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,240
I always feel it won't

224
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
be peaceful cooperation.

225
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,519
What should we do?

226
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,080
Anyway, we will get it through together.

227
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,679
It's a deal.

228
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,279
Take me under your wing.

229
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,519
So,

230
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
you want to stay, right?

231
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,480
I didn't say I wanted to leave.

232
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,000
Let's drink.

233
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,399
I didn't misjudge you.

234
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,840
Bottoms up.

235
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,799
Qi.

236
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,600
Why did you give Tianshuang a pillow?

237
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
I am your brother, alright?

238
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,679
Ming.

239
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,559
Why not drink with me?

240
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,799
Why do you smell so good?

241
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,639
Did you wear perfume?

242
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,519
What are you doing?

243
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,320
What?

244
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,399
Are you drunk?

245
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,360
You can't tell who I am?

246
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,519
Wait.

247
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,759
Come on.

248
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,039
You didn't notice
after coming in for a while?

249
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,120
You did it on purpose?

250
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,919
Just now,

251
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,519
well,

252
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,720
it was a bit dark.

253
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,120
Tianshuang, don't explain.

254
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,279
I won't believe it, anyway.

255
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,639
You just saw it and didn't stop me.

256
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,519
Don't yell at him.

257
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
Why?

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,919
It's for you.

259
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
I complained about you before.

260
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,039
When you sleep,

261
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,759
you snore and turn over.

262
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,519
My sister said

263
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,159
you slept quite well at my house.

264
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,840
So, she brought the pillow to you.

265
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,960
Listen,

266
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,879
take good care of the pillow.

267
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,519
Don't get it dirty.

268
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,879
Wash your hair.

269
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,919
I will treat it

270
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:13,679
like my girlfriend.

271
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,080
That's disgusting.

272
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,600
Can I hug you again?

273
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,519
You guys are so nice.

274
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,919
Tianshuang.

275
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,919
It's just a pillow.

276
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,799
No big deal.

277
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,679
It's a big deal.

278
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,799
Tianshuang.

279
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,919
I hear you're in a bad mood.

280
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,399
Here's some fruit for you.

281
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,519
Have fun, you guys.

282
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,799
Go on.

283
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,519
Continue.

284
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,360
I won't disturb you.

285
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,480
Peng.

286
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Don't get us wrong.

287
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,559
Just ignore him.

288
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,759
Let's keep hugging.

289
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,039
Mi.

290
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,600
It's me.

291
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,360
How have you been?

292
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,759
Tianhai Sect made a move.

293
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,879
They killed Heilun.

294
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,240
Understood.

295
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,159
I will be prepared.

296
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,919
Do you remember the guy

297
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,879
I mentioned to you?

298
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,720
He is indeed a good candidate.

299
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:14,799
Yes.

300
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,879
But I want to observe him a bit more.

301
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,840
Don't worry.

302
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,919
I can still handle it.

303
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,960
I won't die earlier than you.

304
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,039
Take care.

305
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,799
Good night.

306
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:41,856
(Diagnosis)

307
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,200
Well,

308
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,879
Bobo.

309
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,000
In public places,

310
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,240
don't smoke.

311
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,559
Speak.

312
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,399
After Heilun left,

313
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,639
I gathered those

314
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,360
who had a grievance against him.

315
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,039
(Black Lotus Karaoke)
(Of course,)

316
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,279
(they all don't know)

317
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,639
(Heilun will not come back.)

318
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,640
Have you ever thought about it?

319
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,279
Suppose...

320
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,039
I'm just supposing

321
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,359
that Heilun

322
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,079
suddenly died.

323
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,599
By then,

324
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,480
will you let his son take over

325
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,400
and boss you around like Heilun?

326
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,160
His son also has a bad temper

327
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,559
but he's not as capable as Heilun.

328
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,839
Anyway, he always makes trouble

329
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,279
and we have to clean up his mess.

330
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,000
Or would you prefer your leader

331
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,119
to be a trustworthy

332
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,000
and smart person?

333
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,119
Boss.

334
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,200
Heilun...

335
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,119
What happened?

336
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,037
♪When the name is buried in dust♪

337
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:09,553
♪There's still a heartbeat
piercing through dawn and dusk♪

338
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,780
♪If there's no applause for the ending♪

00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,736
