00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,759
=Faith & Fire=

2
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,911
=Episode 30=

3
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:03,762
(The conflict was exacerbated
by Tianhai Sect. What to do next?)

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,359
So,

5
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,120
we'll have a fallout with Tianhai Sect.

6
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,719
Although

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,359
fighting them head-on

8
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,799
is not a wise choice,

9
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,599
I have my persistence.

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,879
If you guys

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,159
feel it is dangerous

12
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,760
or have any thoughts

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,640
and want to quit

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,879
to lay low,

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
I won't stop you.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,920
But if you choose to stay,

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,879
you have to be with us

18
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,879
and defend Lian'an Town

19
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,719
against Tianhai Sect.

20
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,480
I've been fed up with them

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,719
and waiting for this day.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,319
Ming, think it over.

23
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,040
Fighting with them

24
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,560
will put you in danger,

25
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,840
and your family will also be implicated.

26
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,959
Right.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,159
But they are also from Lian'an Town.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,560
I stand up

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,799
to defend them, too,

30
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,519
right?

31
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,760
Yes.

32
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,159
Then let's do it.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Besides,

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,799
even if I don't do it,

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,280
they won't sit around doing nothing.

36
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,480
It's all the same.

37
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,719
Xiu.

38
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,439
Tianshuang is not even from our side.

39
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,280
If he's fighting,

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,159
what are we afraid of?

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,799
Let's do it!

42
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,400
Yes.

43
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,759
This is our own home.

44
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,120
If we don't do it, who will?

45
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,919
Let Tianhai Sect know

46
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,120
who owns Lian'an Town.

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,759
Alright.

48
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,120
You're courting death this way.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,120
We're not that stupid.

50
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,479
You must have a plan.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,439
Tianhai Sect is powerful.

52
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,840
But we won't be

53
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,039
fighting alone.

54
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,639
Anle thought

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,479
he was facing Five Lakes Alliance,

56
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,879
but in reality,

57
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,520
his opponent was
the entire Lian'an Town.

58
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,120
So,

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,960
we must mobilize everyone

60
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,919
and let them

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,719
defend their homes.

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,599
We must get everyone

63
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,919
to act together.

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
Ladies, have a look.

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,680
We'll make the town green.

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,240
We hope for your support.

67
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,639
Support a green Lian'an Town.

68
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,039
Here.

69
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,759
We hope for your support.

70
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,759
Come on.

71
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,879
No chemical plants.

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,800
Protect our homes.

73
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,319
Support us.

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,120
Support us.

75
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,719
Hello.

76
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,879
Support us.

77
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,080
Thank you.

78
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,319
Oppose the chemical plant.
Please support us.

79
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
Thank you, everyone.

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
Contribute your kindness

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,520
to protect our homes.

82
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,680
Be careful.

83
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,599
Tianshuang.

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,599
You want to see me?

85
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,840
I heard you argued with people

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,520
for eight hours
on the Lian'an Town forum.

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,479
Not that exaggerated.

88
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,080
Ming, you're kidding again.

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,240
Lian'an Town's public opinions
depend on you.

90
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:28,919
Ming.

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,319
Ming.

92
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,039
We are just shouting slogans,

93
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,240
but be careful.

94
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,000
No fighting.

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,719
Do you hear me?

96
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,879
Don't worry.

97
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,879
No problem.

98
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,520
Let's go.

99
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes.

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,719
Go.

101
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,319
Get the signs.

102
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,479
Let's go protest together.

103
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,280
Let's go together.

104
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
Everyone, hold the signs.

105
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,199
Take the signs.

106
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,039
The signs.

107
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,639
Hold the signs.

108
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,439
Give it to me.

109
00:03:48,479 --> 00:04:41,120
(Chemical pollution)
No chemical plants. Green Lian'an Town.

110
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,879
Step back.

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,279
Step back, step back.

112
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,000
Step back, step back.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
Step back.

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,000
No chemical plants. Green Lian'an Town.

115
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,199
They ignore the chemical plant

116
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,279
but are just watching us.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,959
Beat those police.

118
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Attacking the police!

119
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,959
What do you want?

120
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,079
Hello.

121
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Everything goes smoothly.

122
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,439
Xiu.

124
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,199
How is Ming?

125
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,920
He's okay.

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,920
He pulled them apart

127
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,279
and didn't attack.

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,319
We were still too careless

129
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,279
and fell into the trap.

130
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,600
Do you think

131
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,399
it's a trap by Tianhai Sect?

132
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,319
Definitely.

133
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,879
I was going to denounce

134
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,040
the chemical plant online.

135
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,839
But they took the initiative.

136
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,399
Someone guided the trend online.

137
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,600
When it happened,

138
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,879
I explained on the forum.

139
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,839
But someone claiming to be
a Lian'an Town netizen

140
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,680
swore at everyone,

141
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,480
making them

142
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,079
think I was like a lunatic.

143
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,519
If they cooperated so well,

144
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,360
it was definitely pre-arranged.

145
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
We focused on guarding against Anle

146
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,319
but didn't expect this move.

147
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,439
Now, people think

148
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,399
the chemical plant is

149
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,279
legal and compliant,

150
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,920
and instead,

151
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,360
Lian'an Town people are greedy

152
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
and want to make money.

153
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
Lian'an Town is famous now.

154
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
People say

155
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,519
that it's a bandit town.

156
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,399
Right.

157
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,560
They say we hit the police,

158
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,879
and everyone is in the gangs.

159
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,600
Bandit town?

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Maybe

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,639
this could be a tourism selling point.

162
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,759
At such a time,

163
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,000
are you kidding me?

164
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,839
Things are already like this.

165
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,199
We should move on.

166
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
Long is right.

167
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,759
Since we've suffered losses,

168
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,759
we should make up for them.

169
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,319
Other than Yanjiao Road,

170
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,560
is there

171
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
anywhere else we can strive for?

172
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,759
The most affected
by the chemical plant now

173
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,920
is the aquaculture industry.

174
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,600
Didn't they make a scene yesterday?

175
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,439
Should we go win them over today

176
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,160
and take a look?

177
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,439
Okay.

178
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,959
If someone can introduce us.

179
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,079
The one who was familiar with me before

180
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,399
has no good impression of me.

181
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,759
My dad is from Aquatic Products Union.

182
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
Want to get to know him?

183
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
Your dad?

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,959
Dad.

185
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,839
That's the one.

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,279
Dad.

187
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,399
What?

188
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,160
My friend wants to see you.

189
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,519
See me?

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,920
Yu.

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,240
Yu.

192
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Long time no see, Yu.

193
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,879
Chen Tianshuang?

194
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,920
Why are you still here?

195
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a long story.

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,639
No worries.

197
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm relieved as long as it's you.

198
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,480
I represent Five Lakes Alliance

199
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,160
to fight the same enemy with you.

200
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
Fight the same enemy?

201
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Who is the enemy?

202
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
Isn't there going to be
a chemical plant here?

203
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,199
Let's work together

204
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,040
to drive them away.

205
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,839
How is it?

206
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,079
Who told you

207
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't support the chemical plant?

208
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,919
Yes, we all support.

209
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,720
Who told you?

210
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,000
Dad.

211
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,279
Yesterday, you said we

212
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,759
couldn't forget traditions.

213
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,600
That was yesterday.

214
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,080
Today, I've thought it through.

215
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,919
If the chemical plant is built,

216
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,759
the aquatic products business here

217
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,279
will definitely be greatly affected.

218
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,960
But if we don't do this business,

219
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,679
there will be other new opportunities.

220
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,279
Yes.

221
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
How do you know it must be worse
than before?

222
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,519
People

223
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,080
need to keep up with the times.

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

225
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,320
Yu.

226
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,480
To make you think it through,

227
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,919
what did they offer you?

228
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,919
Don't slander me.

229
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,759
Don't slander us.

230
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,919
I said these words

231
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,320
from my heart

232
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,399
and for everyone's good.

233
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
You think this business is easy?

235
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Someone like you comes over
to make trouble

236
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,120
several times a year.

237
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,080
Who can bear that?

238
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,519
Yeah.

239
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,480
Besides,

240
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,120
when the plant is ready,

241
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,399
Lian'an Town

242
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,000
will definitely develop greatly.

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
Have a long-term perspective.

244
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,320
Got it?

245
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,320
Got it.

246
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,559
Long-term.

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,919
Okay.

248
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,559
Tianshuang.

249
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,480
They took the money.

250
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,480
Definitely.

251
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
Yu has influence in the union.

252
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,200
If he's surrendered,

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
things will be hard.

254
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,120
No worries.

255
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,360
I don't believe we can't find someone

256
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,679
more influential in Lian'an Town.

257
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,799
So,

258
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,519
you need to find someone

259
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,919
with enough influence.

260
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,879
Right?

261
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,960
Yes, Mr. Luo.

262
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,720
You know so many people.

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
You must know who to reach.

264
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,919
Introduce me to them, please.

265
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,360
Just let me get to know them.

266
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,080
I'll take care of the rest myself.

267
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,399
I won't trouble you.

268
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,320
You

269
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,080
don't get what I mean.

270
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,399
Then what do you mean?

271
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,639
Yu.

272
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,200
Why are you here again?

273
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,519
Didn't you get what I mean?

274
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,480
Exactly.

275
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,960
Yu.

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I heard you have great influence now.

277
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,639
Hello, Luo.

278
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,679
Good boy.

279
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,159
(Lian'an Aquatic Products Union)
You manage Aquatic Products Union?

280
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,279
No.

281
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,919
We just help each other.

282
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,919
No wonder everyone looks
so seafood-like.

283
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,480
Seafood-like?

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
So vigorous.

285
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,559
No, no, no.

286
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,679
Not vigorous.

287
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,639
Not vigorous?

288
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,360
As an ordinary person,

289
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,679
can I give you a suggestion?

290
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,200
Of course.

291
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,720
Luo.

292
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,679
I heard you also like fishing, right?

293
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,120
That's also fisheries.

294
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,919
Fishing.

295
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,879
Mr. Luo.

296
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,759
I didn't expect you to have

297
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,120
such a great influence.

298
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,480
It's nothing.

299
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
I've taught them a lesson before.

300
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,879
They all respect you.

301
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,000
You said they were like seafood,

302
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
but they were still so respectful.

303
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,919
That's all in the past.

304
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,960
Thanks to you.

305
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,840
This is my home.

306
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
If I don't stand up,

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,279
what will happen?

308
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,399
But

309
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,480
I've now become

310
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
a person who says one thing
and does another.

311
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,480
But earlier, you said that about Ming.

312
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,840
Double standards.

313
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,840
I've made my stance on this matter.

314
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Ming is in the Five Lakes Alliance.

315
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,480
Given Qi's personality,

316
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,879
she can't just ignore it.

317
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,399
Even without you,

318
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,080
our family is still involved.

319
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,440
It's better to make

320
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
the family have less risk.

321
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,279
Right?

322
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,159
Sorry.

323
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,519
Something happened?

324
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,919
Tianhai Sect made a move.

325
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,120
A few business owners

326
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,679
just got out of the police station

327
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,519
and found their store smashed.

328
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,320
Is it serious?

329
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,600
The others are okay,

330
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,480
but Li's place is the worst.

331
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,840
It was done by Tianhai Sect.

332
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,759
Li was the leader of the protest,

333
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,440
so they wanted to warn her.

334
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,279
And they've received
threatening messages,

335
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,399
saying if they don't cooperate,

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,639
more will happen tonight.

337
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,639
If we're panicked,

338
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,679
we won't have a shot.

339
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,720
We must show our stance

340
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,120
and show these stores

341
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
resisting the demolition

342
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,960
that they're under protection.

343
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,559
Tonight,

344
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,320
send all the brothers
from the alliance out.

345
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,600
We can't let them succeed.

346
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,879
Okay.

347
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,559
Let's go.

348
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,360
Send everyone out?

349
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,039
Is there a problem?

350
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,559
Let's do as you said.

351
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,360
There's no use in worrying.

352
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,480
At this moment,

353
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,159
we must be united.

354
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,799
Hurry, help everyone tidy up.

355
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,600
It's okay.

356
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,480
It's okay.

357
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,039
Hurry, hurry.

358
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,480
It's okay, we're here.

359
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,200
Don't worry.

360
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Hurry up.

361
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,399
It's okay, we're here.

362
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,360
You guys rest first.

363
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,799
We'll help you clean up.

364
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,279
I don't believe you.

365
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,840
You talk nonsense every time.

366
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,559
Yeah.

367
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,039
You pretended to be an innocent boy
back then,

368
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,360
but dated a pretty girl later on.

369
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,440
Not just once.

370
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,440
Do you believe me?

371
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
We help you watch the stores.

372
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,360
I'm serious.

373
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,519
Okay?

374
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,879
Okay?

375
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,639
Even he said so.

376
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,879
Then let's go back.

377
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,000
Go back.

378
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,399
Let's go home.

379
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,519
Go back to rest early.

380
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,279
Thank you.

381
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,440
We'll help you clean up.

382
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,120
Okay?

383
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,879
How is it?

384
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,039
At critical moments,

385
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,480
I have to step in.

386
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
It's great to have you.

387
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,440
Let's go.

388
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,879
What's wrong?

389
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,399
Wait.

390
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,360
What's wrong?

391
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,080
You're in charge here?

392
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,039
Yes.

393
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
Someone reported

394
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,799
there was a fire here.

395
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,600
Is it serious?

396
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,240
It caught fire at the back.

397
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,799
Now it's been extinguished.

398
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,639
No big problem.

399
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,799
Thank you.

400
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,399
Let's go take a look.

401
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,120
Why are you two here?

402
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,360
We were passing by

403
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,480
and saw a fire here.

404
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,399
You called the police?

405
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,159
Are you alright?

406
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,759
Yeah.

407
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,879
Thank you.

408
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,360
Actually, we didn't help much.

409
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,039
If you want to thank, you should...

410
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:36,720
Qi.

411
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
What are you doing here?

412
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,440
Why?

413
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,399
Putting out the fire.

414
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,919
Don't come for this again.

415
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,759
I'm not hurt.

416
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,399
What?

417
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,080
I got blackened
from putting out the fire.

418
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,639
It will wash off.

419
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,440
Qi started putting out the fire

420
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,080
before the firefighters came.

421
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,519
Even Sheng didn't dare to.

422
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,360
It's not that I didn't dare.

423
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,759
There was only one bucket.

424
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,639
It's good that no one got hurt.

425
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Be more careful from now on.

426
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,480
Be safe. Do you hear me?

427
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,120
I'll head back first.

428
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,159
Tao.

429
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,360
Go home.

430
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,559
Go home.

431
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,360
Go home.

432
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,399
We're leaving. Bye-bye.

433
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,720
Peng, what do you mean?

434
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,799
Just telling the truth.

435
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,559
We agreed to fight Tianhai Sect
to the end.

436
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,200
You're giving up after just a few days?

437
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,679
You're right.

438
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,320
It's been a few days,

439
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,080
but so many things have happened.

440
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,120
You just got released
after being caught.

441
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,320
Our place was burned.

442
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,799
If this continues,

443
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,159
who knows what will happen?

444
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,159
We can't admit defeat!

445
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,559
Alright.

446
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,200
Tell me,

447
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,679
how will you win?

448
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,159
What counts as winning?

449
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,400
What about you?

450
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,359
Do you have answers?

451
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,960
Peng.

452
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,240
I know it's difficult now.

453
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,160
You don't.

454
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,960
Tianshuang.

455
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,839
I always thought you were smart.

456
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,799
But this time,

457
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,839
I think you didn't think it through.

458
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,127
(Qi)

459
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,359
Hello, Qi, what's up?

460
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,880
I'm quite busy right now.

461
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,039
What?

462
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,359
Dad!

463
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,200
Qi.

464
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,279
What happened to Dad?

465
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,279
Ming.

466
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,359
Stay calm first.

467
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,480
Don't be anxious.

468
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,839
He's fine, right?

469
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:58,759
Dad.

470
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,240
Ming.

471
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,880
I know you are.

472
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,599
Ming, don't move.

473
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,480
Get up, Dad!

474
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,359
Ming, let go.

475
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:02,880
Dad!

476
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,839
The patient needs rest.
Please leave here first.

477
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,200
Is it Tianhai Sect?

478
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,519
People went to negotiate with them.

479
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,160
A conflict broke out.

480
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,839
Mr. Luo went to mediate.

481
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
There were quite a few people,

482
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,079
and they were quite agitated.

483
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,559
Mr. Luo had a heart attack.

484
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
That's because of them!

485
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,279
Do you think the hospital is too empty?

486
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,920
Be more mature, okay?

487
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,319
Luo is down now.

488
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,319
You are the only man in the family.

489
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,400
You should understand

490
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,000
what you need to do.

491
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,640
Do you hear me?

492
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,599
Keep your sister company.

493
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,200
Don't let her

494
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,599
take care of everything alone.

495
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,240
Go.

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,742
