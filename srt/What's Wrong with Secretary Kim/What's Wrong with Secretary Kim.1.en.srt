(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,153
Lee Young-joon,
Vice President of Yumyung Group.

8
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,953
Heard the company's revenue
doubled since he became the VP.

9
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,586
Thanks to that, he was voted
'Young CEO of the Year.'

10
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,453
Not only that he's smart,

11
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,153
but also he looks
stunning in a suit.

12
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,920
Man, he's sure got everything!

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,653
But the rumors say he won't let
the ladies lay a finger on him.

14
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:18,620
Right.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,586
No way!

16
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,600
See, I happen to be
dating him, you know.

17
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,033
Though he won't let me
lay a finger on him, of course.

18
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,566
- Hey, Young-joon!
- Vice President.

19
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,453
I wonder why...

20
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,766
What?

21
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,720
I wonder...

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,866
What's wrong with Secretary Kim?

23
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,220
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,966
(Episode 1)

25
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,586
Today, I picked
a monochromatic tie

26
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,600
that looks intellectual
and modern.

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,033
- Not bad.
- Thank you, sir.

28
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,133
Isn't it blinding?

29
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,353
You mean the sunlight?

30
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,566
No.

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,433
The aura...

32
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,666
...From me!

33
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,286
Yes, it is blinding.

34
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,366
Anyway, here's
your schedule for today.

35
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,166
(Director Kim Jung-jae)

36
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,253
It's Director Kim.
Should I take it?

37
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,553
No, it's probably about that
Vietnam deal that fell through.

38
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:51,320
I don't want to start my day with
a call from a sinner.

39
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,486
Sinner?

40
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,320
You don't necessarily have to kill
or steal to commit a sin.

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,253
It's called, "incompetence."

42
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,020
And failure to recognize
your incompetence is...

43
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,266
...Sin.

44
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,986
- Do you happen to know, Ms. Kim?
- Sorry?

45
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,720
How people can be "incompetent?"

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,020
I'd like to ask that, too.

47
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,186
Just put in the effort,
and make it yours. Simple!

48
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,500
Now why can't he do that?

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,266
Well... Not everyone is
like you, sir.

50
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,320
- No?
- Of course not.

51
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,700
Never in my life have I seen
someone so perfect like you, sir.

52
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,586
Who is it this time?

53
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,820
A big sinner.

54
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,233
How do you want me to
deal with him?

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,166
We're here, sir.

56
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,253
Mr. Lee, it's all
a big misunderstanding.

57
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,500
A misunderstanding!

58
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,886
Is "visiting massage parlors"
in your job description?

59
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,653
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You're an executive director.

60
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,053
Have you ever thought about
how this will affect our image?

61
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,233
(Board Member Spotted in Sexy Bar
During Working Hours)

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,086
This will never happen again.

64
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,153
- Ms. Kim.
- I am truly sorry, sir.

65
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,153
Yes.

66
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,386
- Please, just this once...
- What's after this?

67
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,466
A board meeting about
the new business, sir.

68
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,033
You know that
smoking isn't permitted in here.

69
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,920
Vice President. Vice President!

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,033
Vice President!

71
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,033
Vice President...

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,633
Vice President.

73
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,686
Mr. Cho.

74
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,186
Don't take it to heart.

75
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,653
A project that fell through and
now this news about the sexy bar...

76
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,386
The Vice President is
angry because

77
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,920
he had
high expectations to start with.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,353
You see, he went to all lengths to
try stop the media from

79
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,966
disclosing our company's name.

80
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,886
Secretary Kim.

81
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,786
Why did I do that?

82
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,653
Something must've gotten into me.

83
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,586
Don't forget your regrets now and

84
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,720
just try to live
a better life from now on.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,586
Mr. Cho.

86
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,833
Why don't you go home early today
and get some rest?

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,686
Should I?

88
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,100
Alright, then.

89
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,320
I...

90
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,766
I'll really watch myself
from tomorrow.

91
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,266
Ms. Lim.

92
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm off, then.

93
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:46,520
Uh...

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,900
Mr. Cho can come back, right?

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,366
Take all of Mr. Cho's belongings
out from his office, now.

96
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,366
Have you ever seen the VP
give second chances?

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,186
Our goal is to acquire Korea's
third largest airline,

98
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,220
and in five years,

99
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,386
see it rise to the top in Korea,
and into top 10 globally.

100
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,353
As soon as the acquisition of
Global Airlines is decided,

101
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,186
we'll start bidding for contracts
in the U.S., India and Vietnam to

102
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:21,253
give this project a push.

103
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,053
If you look at the current
fiscal accounts,

104
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,486
floating assets are $2.24 billion,

105
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,753
and floating liabilities are
$940 million.

106
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:33,966
That means
the liquidity ratio is 275%.

107
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:38,100
215.319149.

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,286
- Sorry?
- If the assets are $2.24 billion

109
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,253
and liabilities are $940 million...

110
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,853
Isn't the liquidity ratio
215.319149%?

111
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,300
Mr. Park?

112
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,820
Uh...

113
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,853
Right?

114
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,800
Well, why's the number...

115
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:00,053
It's a go on the acquisition.

116
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's round it up here.

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,086
Man, that was sheer torture.

118
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,886
Isn't the Vice President
being too hard on us?

119
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,620
He'll kill us at this rate.

120
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,266
I mean, how can he
expect us to breathe?

121
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,700
Ah, Vice President?

122
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,286
- Oh, it's not.
- Oh, what?

123
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:28,600
I agree with you.

124
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,553
Jesus, he scared us.

125
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:34,333
So he's telling us to
stop back-stabbing his friend, is he?

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,253
He's been invited to a private
party at the Spanish Embassor's housing. So...

127
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,033
Would it be okay if I call you
back tomorrow to re-schedule?

128
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,153
It has sure improved.

129
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,786
- Sorry?
- Your English.

130
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:01,486
On your first trip to the States
nine years ago,

131
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,653
you had trouble
talking to a foreigner.

132
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,753
I did, yes.

133
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,420
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Lee.

134
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,753
Yes, I'm sure it's all thanks to
my generous support.

135
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,086
And thanks to your
scolding and humiliation

136
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,020
every time I got my pronunciation
or my accent wrong.

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,853
That really motivated me.

138
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,466
Scolding and humiliation?

139
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,953
Well, if they can serve as
your source of motivation,

140
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,220
then I'll continue to be
generous with them, too.

141
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,366
- Thank you.
- By the way.

142
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,986
- You got it wrong again.
- Sorry?

143
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,220
It's not "accent."

144
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,566
It's "accent."

145
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,333
So I learn something again.

146
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,620
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,386
I have to be in a dress tonight...

148
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,053
Sir, I couldn't prepare you
snacks today

149
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:52,086
because of the meeting, too.
Will you be alright?

150
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,553
I'm perfectly fine!

151
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,553
You know me, and my concentration.

152
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,700
I don't even feel hunger
when I'm focused on work.

153
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,766
I'll get some snacks ready.

154
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,566
This is the Spanish Ambassador
who's been newly appointed.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,886
Good evening.

156
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,153
Congratulations on
your appointment.

157
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,020
I've heard much about you,
Mr. Lee Young-joon,

158
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,320
even from back in Spain.

159
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,366
A pleasure to meet you.

160
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,300
A pleasure to meet you.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,953
For the past four years,

162
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:46,220
Yumyung Group has been
named no. 1 in corporate image

163
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,153
Our bio business has recently
been approved by the U.S. FDA.

164
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,920
...Now turning profits.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,586
We are also collaborating with
China, with its wide networks...

166
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,133
For many other new projects.

167
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,486
He's so amazing.

168
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,486
Isn't he handsome?

169
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,386
- He is.
- Right? Right?

170
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:10,733
Look at that nose!

171
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,733
He looked this way.

172
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,153
Looks like he's headed for me.

173
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,220
Whatever!

174
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,866
He's coming for me.

175
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,753
- What?
- He just passed by?

176
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,920
- When I'm here?
- Hey, he's looking in the mirror.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,466
What the hell?

178
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,033
The Ambassador is waiting.

179
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,253
Ms. Kim.

180
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,553
Yes?

181
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,933
How do I look?

182
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,333
Perfect, sir.

183
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:48,933
Let's go, sir.

184
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,820
When did you learn Spanish?

185
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,920
Spanish?

186
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,820
You were chatting for
a long time with those

187
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,953
Spanish guys who were
trying to flirt with you.

188
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,420
Oh, that?

189
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,386
I only barely managed to learn
English and Chinese thanks to you,

190
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,053
so like I'd have time to
learn Spanish.

191
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,986
I was just reading their signs.

192
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,920
- Reading them?
- Yes.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
When they make eye contact by
handing me a glass of champagne,

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,820
they probably mean, 'Excuse me.'

195
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,020
Yes.

196
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,686
And what they say while looking at
you is probably a compliment,

197
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,920
so I can just smile and nod.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,053
Right.

199
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,653
And if it looks like
they're trying to flirt with me,

200
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,033
I just play with my earrings
with my left hand.

201
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,153
Why the left hand?

202
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,720
Just show them the ring,
and it's taken care of.

203
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,566
Here, the ring that I got from
Sports Day.

204
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,166
Splendid.

205
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,453
I never knew this day would come,
being complimented by you.

206
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:53,333
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

207
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,820
Anyway, good work tonight.

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,320
New clothes or bags,
just tell me the brand.

209
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,853
Sometimes you need carrots to
bring me results.

210
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:00,986
Oh, Vice President...

211
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,220
And I won't take no for an answer.

212
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,186
It's not about that.
I have something to tell you.

213
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't confess your feelings.
It's strictly business between us.

214
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,766
Don't worry about that.

215
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:12,786
Then what is it?

216
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:13,933
Well...

217
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,300
You'll have to get
a new secretary.

218
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm quitting.

219
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,786
But why, all of a sudden?

220
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:35,033
Personal reasons.

221
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,133
Then alright.

222
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,300
Why can't I fall asleep?

223
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,420
Come on, what is it again?

224
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,386
I got big news!

225
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,820
Big news? Whatever.

226
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,053
Bet it's just big rumors again.

227
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,900
Honey, this time,
it's for real. Alright?

228
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,000
Alright, gather around
if you think you can handle this.

229
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:39,066
- Come on.
- Well, I don't think I can!

230
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,053
Well...

231
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,420
It's about Secretary Kim.

232
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,653
What about Ms. Kim?

233
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:49,053
Ms. Kim, she's...

234
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:50,466
She's quitting!

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,486
What's with this reaction?

236
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,086
Don't you believe me?

237
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,686
Of course not!

238
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:03,786
Why would she quit?

239
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:05,653
Yes, when she's got the
Vice President doting on her.

240
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,020
Why would she quit, what for?

241
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,353
No way.

242
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,833
Yes, way!

243
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,820
Because I'm really quitting.

244
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,186
Really?

245
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,186
You're really quitting, Ms. Kim?

246
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,453
Yes, it looks like it.

247
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:18,786
See, see? I told you so!

248
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:20,886
But so all of a sudden...

249
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:21,986
But why?

250
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you getting married? Is it
a new job? Or to study abroad?

251
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,053
It's no to all of them.

252
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:30,053
Then is it because of the
Vice President bullying...

253
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,020
Not that, either.

254
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,053
- So it's not.
- Then why?

255
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,900
For personal reasons, really.

256
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,233
The Vice President is here.

257
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
You're here, sir.

258
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,700
Young-ok!

259
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,120
I can't imagine not seeing

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,653
you by the Vice President.

261
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,253
I still can't believe it myself.

262
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,520
I'm so sad to
hear you go, Ms. Kim.

263
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,766
I know, right?

264
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,653
So I just prepare the snacks
around this time, do I?

265
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,486
The Darjeeling tea must be
served in this tea cup,

266
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:15,120
along with three cookies
from the H Hotel...

267
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,620
Yes, well...

268
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,153
But why do you ask, Ms. Bong?

269
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,386
Why else?

270
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:22,386
Because it'll be my job
once Ms. Kim leaves.

271
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:24,453
- But why?
- When you look at Ms. Kim,

272
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,353
it's obvious the VP is
picky about looks.

273
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:29,820
So after Ms. Kim is gone,
that leaves just me to

274
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,133
take her job!

275
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:33,853
At times like these,

276
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:35,786
I envy you, Young-ok.

277
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:38,300
I wish I were as plain as you!

278
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:43,686
The VP gets here at 7, so that
means I have to come by 6:30.

279
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:46,066
What about my sleep
and my morning coffee?

280
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
What do I do now?

281
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,966
Hello.

282
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,333
Thinking of replacing the chair?

283
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:19,953
Well, you're truly amazing.

284
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,133
I can read what's inside
your head, you know.

285
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:29,986
You don't mean it, do you?
About you quitting.

286
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,766
I'm afraid you're wrong this time.

287
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Just what is your reason?

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,386
Is it because I made you work
overtime for a whole month?

289
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:40,320
I'll post the job opening
before lunch, then.

290
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,886
Leave it to us to
narrow down the candidates.

291
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:44,800
You just have to attend the
final interview, sir.

292
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,100
I'll leave it to you, then.

293
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:03,166
(Requirements: Candidates with
previous experience preferred)

294
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,266
There.

295
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:12,833
Mr. Lee, did you need something?

296
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,420
I'll be in Mr. Park's office.

297
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,286
Postpone the
conference call to afternoon.

298
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,986
- Yes, sir.
- Oh.

299
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,586
I'll be having lunch at home,

300
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,586
so you grab a bite to eat, too.

301
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,966
Yes, sir.

302
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,753
Ms. Kim!

303
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,520
Ms. Kim!

304
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,653
You're yet to have lunch, right?
How about you join me?

305
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm sorry, Ms. Bong,

306
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,953
but I have something on today.

307
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,020
You don't even have
time to have lunch?

308
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,220
Just have a bite!

309
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,866
Sorry, next time.

310
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,153
Oh, what?

311
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,653
I wanted to ask some questions
since I'll be taking over...

312
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:49,753
Ha!

313
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,233
Well, I'm busy too, you know!

314
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,000
Ugh!

315
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,653
What could be the reason?

316
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:02,586
What?

317
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,120
On why she's suddenly quitting.

318
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,353
Oh, you mean Secretary Kim?

319
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,586
Until now, there wasn't
a thing I didn't know.

320
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,320
But I'm clueless on this one.

321
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,553
It's so frustrating that
I'm almost at my wit's end.

322
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:15,433
Is that right?

323
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,500
Here.

324
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,866
When you're low on sugar,
red ginseng jelly's the best.

325
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,066
Want some?

326
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:41,353
You want me to eat
some lump of sugar that

327
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,686
probably only contains about
0.03% red ginseng?

328
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,786
Forget it.

329
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:47,833
Anyway, go on. What do you
think is wrong with her?

330
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,453
You still don't get it?

331
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,086
Nine years under you...
That's some perseverance!

332
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,253
In the East, we call
someone like her a living Buddha,

333
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,233
and in the West, they call her
a living saint...

334
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,033
Wait, what did I just say?

335
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,253
Nine years? Nine...

336
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,866
Nine years!

337
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,553
So it's finally here.

338
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:12,500
Three, six, nine...
So it's as they say.

339
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,020
Three, six, nine?

340
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,733
Those phases!

341
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,586
You know.

342
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,453
When my wife and I were
going out for a month,

343
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:24,886
we were like the
"match made in heaven."

344
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:25,653
I know very well.

345
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,920
And on your 10th
wedding anniversary,

346
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,253
instead of gifts,
you exchanged divorce papers.

347
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,100
Hey, that was not nice.
It wasn't nice at all!

348
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,953
Anyway, at first we were... Well!

349
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,400
We were like fire.

350
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:41,166
But on our third wedding
anniversary, she said to me...

351
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,653
Honey, I love you.

352
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:47,666
Why did I ever fall for
a guy like you?

353
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,233
And on our sixth anniversary...

354
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,800
Excuse me!

355
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,053
Sorry.

356
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,633
When I see the back of your head,
I just want to slap it good.

357
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,053
And on our ninth
wedding anniversary...

358
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,586
- Ah...
- Don't even breathe.

359
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:08,866
It's a waste of air, you bastard!

360
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,366
Don't tell me...

361
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,053
You're crying?

362
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:28,033
- May I?
- No.

363
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,020
Anyway, so looking back...

364
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,186
We had those dangerous moments
every third, sixth and ninth year.

365
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,586
Just like...

366
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,333
A bruised apple.

367
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,120
Bruised apple?

368
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes. Right here.

369
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,386
You can just cut out the
bruised parts and eat it,

370
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:51,153
but you just can't be bothered.

371
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,200
So you eat the
other fresh ones first.

372
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:56,586
But what happens if you
leave a bruised apple in there

373
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,120
with all the other apples?

374
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,366
Then all the others will
start to go bad...

375
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,933
Until they're all rotten.

376
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,086
Just what...

377
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,720
- What are you implying?
- Before it rots any more,

378
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,020
before the distance between
you and her grow farther,

379
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,333
talk it out and find a way out!

380
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:19,333
A way out...

381
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,400
Easy!

382
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,520
If you want advice on finding that
way out, come see me.

383
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,386
But didn't you get divorced
because you couldn't?

384
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:30,666
Right?

385
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,466
Ugh...

386
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,686
The loan repayment.

387
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:04,853
Today's the last, right?

388
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:05,966
Yes.

389
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,420
Are you Ms. Kim Bi-seo ?

390
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,166
Oh, no. No.

391
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,500
Kim Mi-so.

392
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,853
(Kim Bi-seo)

393
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,800
(Kim Mi-so)

394
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,400
Here.

395
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,900
Yes, Mr. Lee.

396
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,366
Now?

397
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:31,233
Me as well?

398
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,386
To the residence, then.

399
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:57,600
Yes.

400
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,220
I thought you meant
you'll go alone,

401
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,900
so why all of a sudden...

402
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:21,720
A way out...

403
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,866
Sorry?

404
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:42,086
I'm not the person to
give second chances.

405
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,920
- No, you're not.
- But for you especially,

406
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,620
- I'll give you another chance.
- Sorry?

407
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,720
You should be grateful, because
this won't come again.

408
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,620
I'll promote you to director.

409
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,853
- What? That's...
- If you have too much work,

410
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,920
I'll hire someone to help you,

411
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,353
and the company will
provide you a car, too.

412
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,953
If you want, I could even get
a house for you with my money.

413
00:24:58,033 --> 00:24:59,553
Or did you manage to
pay off all your debt?

414
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:02,253
How about I take care of
that debt, too?

415
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,620
Well, then.

416
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,920
Let's work hard from now on.

417
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,853
- Uh... Mr. Lee?
- I can confidently tell you

418
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,986
that you will never get this kind
of treatment elsewhere.

419
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:10,333
And...

420
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:15,166
You'll never get to work under
a boss who's as perfect as me.

421
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,153
I won't criticize you of
being materialistic,

422
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:19,453
so take the offer and
keep working for me.

423
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,420
- Well, uh...
- Young-joon!

424
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,300
Ms. Kim, you're here too!

425
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,386
- How have you been?
- Good, good.

426
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:29,000
My baby...

427
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:32,166
- Let's go in.
- Yes, let's.

428
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,586
I told you to visit often.

429
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,953
We're in the same building,

430
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:48,353
so why is it so hard to
get a glimpse of you?

431
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:50,053
I was busy, because of
that case with Mr. Cho.

432
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,253
Mr. Cho, that was
a waste of talent.

433
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,220
Did you have to...

434
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,653
It only takes a second to
ruin our image.

435
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:58,220
You left the company to me, so
please let me take care of it.

436
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,320
Yes, yes.
You're doing well, Young-joon.

437
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,200
Come on, like our son
won't do a good job!

438
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,353
Right.

439
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:10,200
I was being rash here.

440
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,733
I apologize.

441
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,700
Did you two...
Ever experience those?

442
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,633
Those phases.

443
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:24,366
Phases?

444
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:28,453
Why, how can we ever get
tired of each other?

445
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,653
We always talk it out,
and the matter's gone!

446
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:34,333
There's no man like
your father, you know.

447
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,353
Come on, let's eat now.

448
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,833
Alright?

449
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:47,353
Ms. Kim.

450
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,386
- Please help yourself.
- Thank you.

451
00:26:49,466 --> 00:26:52,433
Don't you think Young-joon's
gotten more handsome?

452
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:54,586
Please, mother.

453
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,253
It's all your work, you know.

454
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,333
And it's the reason why
I respect you so.

455
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:13,753
The bio business has been
approved by the FDA,

456
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,866
and we're onto
acquiring Global Airlines.

457
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:20,466
Father?

458
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,353
You must have something to say.

459
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:28,653
I can tell by that
awkward cough of yours.

460
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,520
Are you really
not going to get married?

461
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,733
No.

462
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,286
Oh man... Oh man!

463
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:38,286
Are you alright?

464
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,733
Do I look alright?

465
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,520
I don't think...

466
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,966
...I'll last long.

467
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,586
I saw your health report.

468
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,786
You're very healthy.

469
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,353
What do they know?

470
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,066
No one knows better than me
about my own body!

471
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,220
Before I die...
Before your father dies...

472
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
He wants to see a grandson!

473
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:07,100
I won't be picky about
who you bring.

474
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,066
And I heard Ms. Kim's quitting!

475
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,086
No, she won't.

476
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,500
I won't let her.

477
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:28,120
It's...

478
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,900
A nice day today, isn't it?

479
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,653
So about Young-joon...

480
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:43,620
I hear he brings girls to
parties here and there,

481
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,686
but that it doesn't last long.

482
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:49,420
That it's not ever serious and

483
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,366
that it's all just
a show for the public.

484
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,233
Is this true?

485
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,053
Yes, well...

486
00:28:57,133 --> 00:29:00,066
I heard he doesn't even let
girls lay a finger on him.

487
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:02,633
Is this really true?

488
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:05,100
Yes.

489
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So...

490
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,100
Young-joon is...

491
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:11,833
really...

492
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:14,333
Ga,

493
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:16,433
ga...

494
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,200
ga...

495
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:22,066
Ga, ga

496
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,286
ga,

497
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:27,733
gay?

498
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,100
No he’s not!

499
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:31,653
Are you sure?

500
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:32,620
Yeah, Of course.

501
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,220
I’ve been knowing him for long time.

502
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,633
I know more than anyone else.

503
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,966
That’s a relief

504
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,253
To be honest,

505
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,853
CEO and I never mentioned about it.

506
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,366
But, we were very worried.

507
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,020
That Young-joon never let his guard down to any girls

508
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,433
except Secretary Kim

509
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:52,120
So was wondering if the rumor was true!

510
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,166
Oh okay.

511
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,220
So...

512
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,253
About Young-joon...

513
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,333
How is he,
from a woman's perspective?

514
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:01,720
I guess simply the best.

515
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,000
His abilities, charms,
and personality...

516
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:09,253
He's just perfect in every field.

517
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,253
Right?

518
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,966
You know how to tell
if a man's good or not!

519
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,486
I really do wish...

520
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,233
...Someone will snatch him up.

521
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,820
Someone like...

522
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,533
You, Ms. Kim!

523
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:29,066
Just kidding!

524
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,633
But I'd really marry him off now,
to a girl like you...

525
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:41,966
Just kidding!

526
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:46,686
Ms. Kim, let's go.

527
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:47,833
Yes, sir.

528
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,666
Then please excuse me, ma'am...

529
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:56,586
Did my mother make you
feel uncomfortable?

530
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,453
Well, uh...

531
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:02,520
It seemed like she was trying to
set me up with you.

532
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,800
And?

533
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,286
Did you secretly
have your hopes up?

534
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,253
No.

535
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,286
I only reassured myself that
I should really quit

536
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:11,786
before the misunderstandings grow.

537
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,033
What?

538
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,486
But I thought we
already talked that out.

539
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:19,386
You know that's an offer
you can't pass up on.

540
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:20,386
I know.

541
00:31:20,466 --> 00:31:23,186
I know that the conditions you're
offering are extraordinary,

542
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:25,586
but I'm still quitting.

543
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,853
I'm sorry.

544
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,566
But you can't convince me.

545
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:37,200
Don't get me fired up now.

546
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:53,220
Come on, I said I'll do it!

547
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,486
Sorry, it's from my job.

548
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:57,320
I feel like I have to
lay everything myself.

549
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,000
Mi-so, you eat too.

550
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,700
Just enjoy yourselves.

551
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:06,153
You two look worn out.

552
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,566
Is the hospital
working you that much?

553
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,886
Mi-so,

554
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:12,253
you don't have to mind us now.

555
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,686
As your eldest sister,
I should've looked after you

556
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,253
but instead I was selfish

557
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,420
and I ended up troubling you.

558
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,486
Troubles? No!

559
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:23,820
You worked too,
to pay off all that debt.

560
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,386
And it's not like you caused
real trouble like Dad.

561
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:28,420
Dad?

562
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,786
What did Dad do again?

563
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,253
To be honest...

564
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,620
He got a private loan
early this year.

565
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,586
Oh man...

566
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,453
Around about $30,000?

567
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:38,453
About $30,000?

568
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,453
Why are you only
telling us this now?

569
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,320
But it'd only add to your worries.

570
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,853
So what did you do?

571
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,220
I sold the car and paid it off.

572
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,766
You had a car?

573
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:51,520
I was late 10 minutes
because I missed the bus,

574
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,853
and the VP bought it for me.

575
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:53,653
Whoa!

576
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,566
But that only lasted a week.

577
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,486
All the debt's been paid off,

578
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,933
so now I feel liberated!

579
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:20,300
That laugh of yours
really pisses me off.

580
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,600
But it's just too funny.

581
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,966
What's so funny?

582
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Actually, now I think about it,
it's not so funny.

583
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,886
After all these years,

584
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:37,053
how could she be so cold about it?

585
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:40,453
You told her yourself that
it's strictly business.

586
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,420
What could be her reason?

587
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,853
Like this is so she could
squeeze out those offers.

588
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,120
Think about it.

589
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,353
I'm sure there was
something on that day

590
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:50,500
that triggered her to say it.

591
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,466
That day...

592
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:57,700
Mirror, mirror.

593
00:33:58,633 --> 00:33:59,700
Accent.

594
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:02,066
I'm quitting.

595
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,200
Young-joon!

596
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,666
Oh Ji-ran?

597
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,333
Oh man, this is driving me crazy.

598
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,920
I told you to take those pills.

599
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,233
How come you're the only one
with hay fever in our family?

600
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,220
Thanks.

601
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,266
So it was worth it,
paying for your college.

602
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,166
We really don't know what to say...

603
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,066
Oh my goodness!

604
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,420
Ouch!

605
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,853
Sorry.

606
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,300
But it was burning.

607
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,620
So why were you
handling flowers again

608
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,220
when you have hay fever?

609
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,433
Did that VP tell you to again?

610
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,466
Young-joon!

611
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,766
How did you come here?

612
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,020
I got invited as a celebrity.

613
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,520
I checked the guest list,
and your name was there!

614
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,033
So I came here to surprise you.

615
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:11,953
You should've called me.

616
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,900
But you came with Ms. Kim,
thinking I was busy, huh?

617
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,953
So, Young-joon...

618
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,933
Did you notice anything?

619
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:30,953
That necklace suits you.

620
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:34,000
It's what you got me!

621
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,053
Oh, and...

622
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:40,633
Do you know what day it is today?

623
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:46,066
It's my birthday!

624
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:52,166
You know, flowers would just do.

625
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:05,586
Welcome.

626
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,720
Can I have some flowers?

627
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,553
What flowers would you like?

628
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,900
Any flowers.
A big bouquet will do.

629
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:29,086
Thanks, Young-joon!

630
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,133
You're the best!

631
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,866
They're so pretty.

632
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,153
What, Ms. Kim was crying?

633
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,420
I thought I'd mistaken it,

634
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,333
but her eyes were...

635
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,186
They were teary.

636
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:50,053
You mean her eyes were
"moisturizing?"

637
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:52,233
Hmmm? Then...

638
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:56,020
'Do I really have to get
flowers for other girls now?'

639
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,920
'I can't take this anymore,
I'm quitting!'

640
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,686
Did she say that?

641
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:03,100
No, no. It's not that.

642
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:06,520
Now I get it.
Why she's quitting, that is.

643
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,433
Why don't I have
a good feeling about this?

644
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:13,366
Of course,
why didn't I know it sooner?

645
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:18,333
Young-joon, you!

646
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:21,420
Young-joon, you!

647
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,686
Why, what is it?

648
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:24,853
Those personal reasons.

649
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,020
Those reasons she can't tell me!

650
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,533
Those eyes...

651
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:32,753
- Ms. Kim, she...
- Ms. Kim, she?

652
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,000
She...

653
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,266
She likes me!

654
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,333
Like me? Whatever!

655
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,286
Why not?

656
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,953
You said he buys you
clothes and shoes!

657
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,853
Though he says it's for
your grooming costs,

658
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,686
- isn't that a bit too much?
- Right!

659
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:57,053
Hey, he is so into you.

660
00:37:57,133 --> 00:38:00,020
No, never!

661
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,086
He loves himself too much that
others just won't do.

662
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,420
Has he ever fallen in love or
liked someone, you ask?

663
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,586
Never, not once!

664
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,353
Come on, like that makes sense!

665
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:09,320
I mean it!

666
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,186
How can someone at that age
never fallen in love?

667
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:14,233
Why? Mi-so's one of them.

668
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:16,866
You crazy?

669
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,633
- Want some?
- No, it's alright.

670
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:30,366
I was being so careful in case
she'd fall for me...

671
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:33,933
Some consideration, that is.

672
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,086
But then...

673
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,553
She's been next to me for 9 years,

674
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,386
so she's a robot if
she didn't fall for me already.

675
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:43,033
Uh, let's not be so
sure about this now.

676
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,486
That Ms. Kim...

677
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:47,533
But we're strictly business!

678
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,753
But of course...

679
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,466
So she fell for me.

680
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,600
Uh...

681
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,386
Do I like him?
What kind of a question is that?

682
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,520
It's really not like that
between us.

683
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,066
It's strictly business.

684
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:12,020
Besides, I'll be quitting soon.

685
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,953
You're quitting?

686
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,186
But why, all of a sudden?

687
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:15,620
Did he bully you again?

688
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,053
Ugh, that bastard...!

689
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:18,853
No, it's not like that.

690
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,800
You and Dad are finally settled,

691
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:24,253
and the debt's been paid off, so...

692
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,686
So I thought I should quit.

693
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,753
And do what?

694
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,553
I'm not too sure.

695
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,520
Of course, where else would I be

696
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,853
treated like this at this age
and with my resume too,

697
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:36,253
but I've been too busy and...

698
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,300
I feel like it's now or never.
And...

699
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,433
(Vice President)

700
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:47,566
(Vice President)

701
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,986
It's the VP, right?

702
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:52,353
- Don't take it.
- Don't you take it!

703
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,553
- Don't take it.
- Don't take it!

704
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,566
Oh, come on!

705
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,486
Yes, Mr. Lee.

706
00:39:58,566 --> 00:39:59,853
You know where I am, right?

707
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:01,086
Then come.

708
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,086
Uh, Mr. Lee.
But I have something today,

709
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,053
so just for today,

710
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:07,520
can I call some other secretary
or a private chauffeur?

711
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,686
But how can I trust them?

712
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:11,053
He wants you to come?

713
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,986
Hey, give me the phone.

714
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:14,520
Then call Ms. Ji-ran!

715
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,053
Just for one day...

716
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,500
Come here, right this minute!

717
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,586
Mr. Lee?

718
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,033
Hello?

719
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:25,300
He told you to come now?
To drive his car?

720
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,053
Today's the one day
he doesn't have to go home

721
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,220
because no one will
nag him for it,

722
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,286
so I don't know why
he insists on going home.

723
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:33,620
I know, right?

724
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,466
God, I'm actually relieved to
hear you're quitting!

725
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,533
Now where was that spare key?

726
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:44,433
Argh!

727
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:46,220
Mi-so, let me do it.

728
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,133
Mal-hee, kill it!

729
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,233
You! It's dead.

730
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,986
Mi-so, are you alright?

731
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:56,266
You still have arachnophobia?

732
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:03,153
Pil-nam, are you sure I never got
lost when I was a child?

733
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:04,986
When I was about 4 or 5?

734
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,520
You're still going on about that?

735
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,933
We told you, no!

736
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:29,586
I didn't know
you liked me that much.

737
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:32,086
I guess then, that
buying flowers for another girl

738
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,700
hurt you greatly.

739
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:38,333
I'll dump Oh Ji-ran. Happy?

740
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:40,853
Young-joon, you...

741
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,266
You're right on it!

742
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:46,720
What's he doing?

743
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,533
Is he talking to Young-joon,
himself, again?

744
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,333
Mr. Lee, I'm here.

745
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,986
Crying again, are you? Don't
make this awkward for me now.

746
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:15,066
Did you like it that much?

747
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:19,100
I'm so sorry!

748
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,600
Throw it away.

749
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,286
I'm sorry.

750
00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:26,933
And I'll put these flowers
in the trunk.

751
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,000
Did that touch her that much?

752
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:36,466
Well, I can't help myself.

753
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,066
I'm sorry.

754
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,853
Who were you with?

755
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:06,433
It's a secret.

756
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,920
I'll break up with Oh Ji-ran.
Happy now?

757
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,053
Got someone else again?

758
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,853
I won't be seeing anyone for
a while. Happy?

759
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:20,620
Why do you keep on asking me
whether I'm happy?

760
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,753
I didn't sleep with her. Happy?

761
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,420
- Sorry?
- I didn't sleep with Ji-ran.

762
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,953
You know it's strictly business
between her and me.

763
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:29,086
Yes, I know.

764
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,320
I think I now finally understand
how hard it must've

765
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,886
been for you, just a little.

766
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:33,986
That's why...

767
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:36,520
Take the day off tomorrow,
and think over it again.

768
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,653
That's a special leave.

769
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:39,220
Really?

770
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,686
Oh, but wait.
The interviews are tomorrow...

771
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:43,753
Then just drop by in
for the interview.

772
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,800
Yes, thank you.

773
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:51,786
Did you find a new place?

774
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:53,486
Not yet.

775
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:55,120
Will you at least be in Seoul?

776
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,800
I'm not too
sure about that, either.

777
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:04,020
What, then why are you quitting
without any plans?

778
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,820
Well, I need to
go find my life now.

779
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,220
What are you talking about?

780
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,086
A life that's not as
someone's secretary,

781
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,166
nor as a breadwinner.

782
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,133
Just a life as me, Kim Mi-so.

783
00:44:33,866 --> 00:44:36,186
What, then is she saying
all the times spent with me

784
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:37,866
weren't part of her life?

785
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,966
A pimple?

786
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:16,633
How dare you, on my face...

787
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:59,466
How long has it been,
sleeping in again?

788
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,300
Ah, it feels so good!

789
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,800
I should get up.

790
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,400
(Mr. Lee Young-joon's Schedule)

791
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:42,966
I slept too much.

792
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:48,953
The investment report, and...

793
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:50,233
Thank you.

794
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,633
Good morning.

795
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,500
I need some fresh air.

796
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:21,866
(Resignation Letter
Kim Mi-so)

797
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:43,266
How long has it been,
going to work so late again?

798
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,266
It feels so good!

799
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,366
Hello?

800
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,053
Ji-hyun, want to
meet up for dinner?

801
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:57,300
Who? It's me, Secretary Kim...

802
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,853
I mean, Kim Mi-so.

803
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,900
What, did you delete my number?

804
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:12,286
Oh, what?

805
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:16,666
Didn't you say it was just a lump
of sugar with 0.03% red ginseng?

806
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,153
Just what the hell is

807
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,286
finding her own life?

808
00:48:25,366 --> 00:48:29,520
8 hours a day for 9 years,
that's 18,000 hours.

809
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,553
But Ms. Kim also worked on the
weekends and on holidays,

810
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:34,400
so that's 59,130 hours...

811
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:38,653
That's a longer time than
some marriages,

812
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,253
so how can she just
brush them off as meaningless?

813
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,753
Did she say
they were meaningless? Oh man...

814
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,433
Did she get hurt,
because she liked me too much?

815
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:51,053
Alright, so she's competent and
you got used to her.

816
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:52,886
But aren't you
a bit obsessed with her?

817
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:55,653
- Do you perhaps, like her?
- You crazy?

818
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,033
Then why are you
mulling over it then?

819
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:02,853
Not only that, you don't let
any other girls touch you.

820
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:05,220
Let's be honest, you've tons of
girls who are after you,

821
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,033
but I've never seen you get
close with any one of them.

822
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:11,120
Were you traumatized by
an experience in the past?

823
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,653
No, I just don't care for women.

824
00:49:12,733 --> 00:49:13,986
- Then what about Ms. Kim?
- She's different.

825
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:15,720
How is she different from
all the other women?

826
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,300
Ms. Kim is just...

827
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:21,520
Ms. Kim.

828
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,900
Whatever, I'm going now.

829
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:28,033
What is he on about?

830
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:33,120
Here's the weekly report.

831
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,353
Oh, you're just going to
have it like that?

832
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,286
- Let me warm it up for you.
- No, it's fine.

833
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:39,420
But they say it's better to
have red ginseng warm.

834
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,420
It's alright, I'll just drink as is.

835
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,153
Well, it's better for you
if it's warmed up.

836
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:43,766
Give it to me here.

837
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:45,253
Um, I'm so sorry...

838
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:48,233
I only wanted to heat it up...

839
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:51,453
Well, though you failed at
heating it up,

840
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,020
you sure fired up my temper.

841
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,453
So...

842
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,953
Don't you have any plans to quit?

843
00:49:58,033 --> 00:49:58,953
No.

844
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:01,586
I will always be
by your side, Mr. Park.

845
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,920
Always?

846
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,533
- Well, back to work.
- Yes, sir.

847
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,053
(Meeting preparations
/Meeting minutes)

848
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:18,166
(Scheduling
/Check with officers)

849
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:23,900
You know the
Code of Secretarial Work, right?

850
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,933
(Duties and Responsibilities)

851
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:27,100
Always seal your lips
and be on your feet.

852
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,666
Even I've managed it fine
without any qualifications...

853
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,100
(Your head should be cool, your
heart warm, and your feet burning)

854
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,600
So I'm sure you'll do great.

855
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,333
And what I'd like to
warn our new secretary is...

856
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:46,353
The biggest reason
why I'm quitting is...

857
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:49,386
What's most important is...

858
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:50,933
It is...

859
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:58,000
Vice President!

860
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,853
You don't look so good.
Are you alright?

861
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:04,153
I couldn't get much sleep.

862
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,753
But you look refreshed.

863
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:09,133
It's thanks to sleeping in
in a long while.

864
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,786
Oh my goodness!

865
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:14,433
Is that a pimple on your forehead?

866
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,886
Should I call your dermatologist?

867
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:18,286
- It's alright.
- Or how about Dr. Jung?

868
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,300
How about
some sedatives, at least?

869
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,320
Are you...

870
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,853
...Worrying about me?

871
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:31,286
Sorry?

872
00:51:31,366 --> 00:51:33,066
Of course I am.

873
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:38,486
As Secretary Kim, or as Kim Mi-so?

874
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:40,686
What are you...

875
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,053
Mr. Lee.

876
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,720
The interviewee is here.

877
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,920
Will you see her now?

878
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,020
Tell her to come in.

879
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,986
You come in for
the interview, too.

880
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:48,133
She'll be
replacing you, after all.

881
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,600
Yes, sir.

882
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:58,866
Mr. Lee, I got the
questionnaires for you.

883
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:11,186
Ms. Kim Ji-ah, how will you live
your life as my secretary?

884
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:13,186
As Secretary Kim, or as Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

885
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:15,020
As Secretary Kim Ji-ah, of course.

886
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,400
Because I'll be both Kim Ji-ah,
and Secretary Kim.

887
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,320
How about you ask her a question?

888
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,566
Sure.

889
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:26,586
What qualities should
a secretary harness?

890
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,786
To care for your boss,
like caring for your own child...

891
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:29,920
What if you were to
work with a boss

892
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,586
who's already 100% perfect?

893
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,786
It just excites me to
think about that!

894
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:38,653
Do you think you can meet his
expectations, 100%?

895
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:40,620
Do you think he'll be satisfied?

896
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,786
Well, that may be a little hard.

897
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:45,486
Are you responsible enough to
not call it quits with

898
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:46,853
with a vague excuse like

899
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:48,353
- "personal reasons?"
- Yes.

900
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:50,153
I'm going to bury my bones here.

901
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,153
What if you really do
end up burying your bones?

902
00:52:52,233 --> 00:52:53,853
Huh? Is work here that tough?

903
00:52:53,933 --> 00:52:56,286
But in terms of renumeration,
it'll be the industry's top.

904
00:52:56,366 --> 00:52:58,853
Renumeration is guaranteed,
but there won't be a Kim Ji-ah.

905
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:00,300
Only Secretary Kim.

906
00:53:01,033 --> 00:53:03,220
What, are you saying the time you
spent here isn't a part of you?

907
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,366
Ms. Kim Mi-so?

908
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,286
If you'll hire me,
I'll do my very best.

909
00:53:11,366 --> 00:53:12,920
You're hired!

910
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,353
- Really?
- Mr. Park.

911
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:16,053
- Yes.
- Show Secretary Kim Ji-ah around.

912
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:18,586
She's our new "Secretary Kim."

913
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,053
Ms. Kim, make sure to train her

914
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:23,233
so she's like your clone
before you leave.

915
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:25,233
Yes, sir.

916
00:53:26,766 --> 00:53:28,133
Thank you!

917
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:34,066
Wait.

918
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:36,833
You said you were going to
"go find your life."

919
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,353
What do you exactly mean by that?

920
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:41,520
Until now, I've just been
too busy with work

921
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,720
so I wanted some time for
myself, and...

922
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,900
And?

923
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:50,600
And I'm already twenty-nine,

924
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,566
so I should find a boyfriend
and get married.

925
00:53:58,433 --> 00:53:59,733
What?

926
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,933
Right?

927
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,153
But what's gotten into you?

928
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:13,653
Secretary Kim, meeting up with us?

929
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:15,286
Sorry. So don't leave me out
from now on, right?

930
00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:17,053
I've lots of free time now!

931
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:18,686
You were even on the news, too!

932
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:20,853
Standing right next to
that vice president!

933
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:23,153
Wow, you were amazing!

934
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:25,886
Right. But then again,
she had the best grades,

935
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:27,320
and she lived her life
to the fullest.

936
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,720
Yes, she's our working girl.

937
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,253
I'm so jealous!

938
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,820
When I'm just an old lady now...

939
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,153
It's so hard,
looking after a child!

940
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:34,853
At least you're
a full-time homemaker.

941
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:35,986
Look at me.

942
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:37,900
Raising a kid, and earning money...

943
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:40,520
Mi-so, don't ever get married.

944
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,953
- Don't! Don't!
- Why not?

945
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,186
All the girls who got married
say that, don't they?

946
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:45,300
Right!

947
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,166
Off to the loo!

948
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,100
Oops, sorry!

949
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,120
Oh, what?

950
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,286
A handkerchief for men, a tie,

951
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:55,666
and a lighter...

952
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:57,153
Whose bag is this?

953
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:58,353
Oh, it's mine.

954
00:54:58,433 --> 00:55:00,700
Who knows when the
VP may need them?

955
00:55:09,066 --> 00:55:10,300
Well...

956
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,033
This is how working girls have it.

957
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:47,586
Are you Ms. Secretary Kim?

958
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:49,266
Oh, no. No.

959
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:51,433
Kim Mi-so.

960
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,186
(Secretary Kim)

961
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,233
(Kim Mi-so)

962
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,233
Here.

963
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:27,620
What's most important is...

964
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,766
It is...

965
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:35,353
To have time for yourself.

966
00:57:35,433 --> 00:57:36,933
From your predecessor, Kim Mi-so.

967
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
(Duties and Responsibilities)

968
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,666
All done!

969
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:06,366
Time for myself. "My life."
"A boyfriend." "Marriage?"

970
00:58:07,966 --> 00:58:09,686
How can she say that to me,

971
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:12,420
like she's talking about
someone else altogether?

972
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,420
Who?

973
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,886
What do you think about me?

974
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:16,000
Hmmm?

975
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:19,053
What do you think about me?

976
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:21,786
Why do you even ask?

977
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:24,186
You're perfect, Young-joon!

978
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:27,686
You're talented, handsome,
tall, and a gentleman.

979
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:28,900
And...

980
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:31,166
...Sexy.

981
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:36,386
Then, what's wrong with
Secretary Kim?

982
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:37,886
Huh?

983
00:58:37,966 --> 00:58:39,333
What about Secretary Kim?

984
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:42,033
Are you talking about some other
girl when you're with me?

985
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:06,766
(Kim Mi-so)

986
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:16,500
(To Oppa)

987
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,800
Who is it?

988
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,866
Oh, what?

989
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,566
What brings you here
at this hour, sir?

990
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:29,286
Well, come in.

991
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:30,553
Don't order me.

992
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,586
I'm going to say it here.

993
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:35,100
Well, alright then.

994
00:59:43,533 --> 00:59:45,186
Were you serious about

995
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:46,500
your talks of
relationship and marriage?

996
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,053
You came here at this hour,

997
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:53,520
just to ask me that?

998
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,920
So why, all of a sudden?

999
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,853
Were you dating someone
secretly behind my back?

1000
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:58,953
Mr. Lee.

1001
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,386
Are you perhaps, mad?

1002
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:03,120
No. Like I'd care
who you date or not.

1003
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,253
Why would I get mad?

1004
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,253
I know, right?

1005
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,753
Just answer my question.

1006
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,353
I'm not dating anyone in secret.

1007
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:10,320
Of course you shouldn't.

1008
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,000
- Sorry?
- Well.

1009
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,520
I wouldn't have reasons to
keep it a secret from you.

1010
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,253
And like I had time to!

1011
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,620
I'd come into work
6 a.m. every morning,

1012
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,853
and I'd never finish on time.

1013
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:22,953
And when you call me,

1014
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:26,153
I have to spring out of bed
and head over to you.

1015
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:27,453
And?

1016
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:29,000
You're not being very convincing.

1017
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,053
It's just that at this rate,
working all day next to you,

1018
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:35,400
I'll just grow old without
getting married.

1019
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,020
That's your reason?

1020
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,200
That's your reason?

1021
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,353
Who's going to take care of me
once I grow old,

1022
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:49,066
and you fire me because
you're not happy with me?

1023
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,920
Alright.

1024
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,553
I'll offer you a life contract.

1025
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:55,353
Oh, that's even worse.

1026
01:00:55,433 --> 01:00:57,820
You're telling me to
grow old and lonely,

1027
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,900
taking care of you my entire life.

1028
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:05,586
So...

1029
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:08,320
You want to quit the company,

1030
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,086
so you can try and get married?

1031
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,120
Yes.

1032
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,886
You want to get married that bad?

1033
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:17,333
Yes.

1034
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:24,233
Then just keep working for me.

1035
01:01:25,633 --> 01:01:28,220
Because I, Lee Young-joon,

1036
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,000
will marry you.

1037
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,466
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

1038
01:02:08,466 --> 01:02:10,320
I'm going to
get myself a boyfriend.

1039
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,653
What, is clutching onto Ms. Kim

1040
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:13,486
on the same level as an M&A?

1041
01:02:13,566 --> 01:02:15,120
Write down the place
you've always wanted to go

1042
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,586
with someone you're interested in.

1043
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:17,853
What about the galbi place?

1044
01:02:17,933 --> 01:02:19,333
Yes!

1045
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:24,820
Wine and liquor aren't
doing so well in our...

1046
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,653
Uh, talking about work
over drinks is a bit...

1047
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:28,933
Ms. Kim, about this karaoke place...

1048
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:31,853
Why not just go home?

1049
01:02:31,933 --> 01:02:33,020
Alright, alright!

1050
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:33,886
Why are you pecking me about it?

1051
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:36,286
I was only answering your question.

1052
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:37,753
See? You're talking back again.

1053
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:39,033
- Ms. Kim!
- Yes?

1054
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,886
I'll make sure that
every day from now on

1055
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:45,333
will be a happy one, filled with
romance like today.
