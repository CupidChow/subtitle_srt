00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,300
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,253
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:36,866
Ms. Kim.

8
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:38,866
Yes?

9
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:41,166
Before...

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,200
You told me not to
shake you up anymore.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,133
Yes, well...

12
00:00:58,866 --> 00:00:59,966
Well...

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,100
I want to shake you up.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,900
What? But...

15
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,166
Please, don't!

16
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:03,186
Then you watch my end.

17
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,866
No!

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,020
Ah...

19
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,300
Ms. Kim!

20
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,053
Ms. Kim.

21
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,286
I can explain.

22
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,586
Let me explain.

23
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,666
- This is..
- Now I remember.

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,353
About what kind of a person
you really are.

25
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,120
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,986
A narcissist who can
only love his reflection.

27
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,420
Everyone else is
just an extra in your movie.

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,486
'How dare you even
dream about me?'

29
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:52,486
That's what's in
your head right now, huh?

30
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,966
Is that why you pushed me away?

31
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,320
Ms. Kim, this is
a big misunderstanding.

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,286
It's not like that at all.

33
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,720
But you know something, Mr. Lee?

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,553
If someone asks me
when I had my first kiss,

35
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,120
now I'll have to contemplate
whether to answer with

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,220
that time with Sang-chul from the
class next-door in kindergarten

37
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,566
and right now.

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,266
Ms. Kim...

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,820
Mr. Lee?

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,786
Hmmm?

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,866
I'm going to take tomorrow off.

42
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,600
- What?
- I don't know how to face you.

43
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,466
Then...

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,933
Just wait there, Ms. Kim!

45
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,053
Oh, and...

46
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,900
I'm going to
get off work this minute.

47
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,253
Don't...

48
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,566
...Ever follow me.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,453
Still...

50
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,253
It's a good thing that
she didn't realize...

51
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,986
...Whatever.

52
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,186
This is not
how it was meant to turn out!

53
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,366
Ha...

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,433
(Episode 6)

55
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,386
Ha...

56
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,553
And?

57
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,853
So he pushed her chair away
as soon as their lips touched?

58
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:24,920
Yes.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,333
So I...

60
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,386
I mean, this was
a story I read online,

61
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,586
and even I was enraged!

62
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,586
Do you have any ideas why?

63
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,053
Why he had to do that?

64
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,286
It sounds like
sexual desire disorder.

65
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,453
What? Sexual... what?

66
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,320
No need to be shocked.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,586
We get many young patients for
that these days.

68
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,120
It's because they're so stressed,

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,086
that their body just rejects
any stimulus.

70
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,286
Hey, that's ridiculous.

71
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,553
Why?

72
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,466
It's not like
sexual dysfunction is a crime.

73
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:04,220
I think it's
something psychological.

74
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,986
What?

75
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:08,753
To go to such extremes
right before a kiss...

76
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,286
Seems like a traumatic experience
with women or kissing.

77
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,100
Thus his reaction.

78
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,500
Trauma?

79
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,586
Shall we go for round 2, then?

80
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,666
Let's go!

81
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,853
No, stop!

82
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:29,486
This is where I'm going home.

83
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:30,520
Oh what?

84
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,253
Come on, just one more glass!

85
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,853
Please. I just said
I have my day off tomorrow.

86
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,420
That's why you should drink!

87
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,786
To your death!

88
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,733
When else will you
get this chance?

89
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,153
No!

90
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,586
I don't want to waste my
precious break with a hangover.

91
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,553
I'm going to spend
a fun-filled day tomorrow.

92
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,966
Alright, I'm off, then.

93
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,566
Take care!

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,966
You know, that online story
Mi-so just mentioned...

95
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,153
No matter how I think...

96
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,586
I think it's actually about her
and Mr. Lee.

97
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,000
Mi-so and Mr. Lee?

98
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:16,153
What, you mean a chaebol with
sexual dysfunction?

99
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,033
Why, can't a chaebol have
sexual dysfunction?

100
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,986
But, ugh!

101
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,520
Is that what's
important here anyway?

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,733
What's important is that there's
something between those two.

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,900
Oh.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,320
To go to such extremes
right before a kiss...

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,433
Seems like a traumatic experience
with women or kissing.

106
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,120
Just maybe,

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
he might have his reasons.

108
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,286
Well, what if he did?

109
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:01,533
Ha... I can't believe this.

110
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,453
Ms. Kim,

111
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,866
I know you were looking forward to
that kiss with me.

112
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,820
And the bigger the expectation,
the bigger the disappointment.

113
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,933
Oh, I understand.

114
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,053
(Ms. Kim,)

115
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,086
(I know you were looking forward to
that kiss with me)

116
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,086
(And the bigger the expectation,
the bigger the disappointment)

117
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:20,966
(Oh, I understand)

118
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,920
(Ms. Kim,)

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,920
Ms. Kim,

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,233
(I'm sorry)

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,966
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,700
Simple is best!

123
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,520
The first time is
always the hardest.

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,386
After that, it's nothing!

125
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:41,486
Saying "Sorry..."

126
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,866
Why, it's not hard at all.

127
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,800
Ha...

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,266
(Mr. Lee/Ms. Kim, I'm sorry)

129
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:27,853
Oh!

130
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,966
Eh-hem.

131
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:29,453
(Ms. Kim)

132
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:29,920
(Sorry?)

133
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,820
'Sorry?'

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
(What, was there even
anything between us?)

135
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,653
'What, was there even
anything between us?

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
(I'm not quite sure what you mean.)

137
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,533
I'm not quite sure what you mean.'

138
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,486
What do you mean,
was there anything between us?

139
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,153
Are you going to
deny that sweet yet

140
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,753
dynamic moment between us?

141
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,000
That sentence isn't
quite comprehensible...

142
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,766
What do I do?

143
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,733
Your secretary is here.

144
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,386
What? But why, when
she's having her day off?

145
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,966
Ah, I bet she felt bad about
what she said, too.

146
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,500
Mr. Yang, what brings you here
so early...

147
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,353
Didn't you always
wait for me outside?

148
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:42,953
Ah, yes, sir.

149
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,053
But Ms. Kim said
she can't come in today, so...

150
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,433
So she asked me to...

151
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,500
...Tie your tie, sir.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,586
What?

153
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,620
She said there's no one to do that

154
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,266
in her absence.

155
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,486
N-no! Stop!

156
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,853
Don't come close.

157
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:05,786
I can tie it very well, sir.

158
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,466
No!

159
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,500
Stop.

160
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,700
Let me tie it, sir.

161
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,733
(Additions to my bucket list)

162
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,086
I'm going to plan
my schedule out every minute

163
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,020
and have the time of my life!

164
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,886
My first destination is...

165
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,433
...The theme park.

166
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,433
Mr. Lee!

167
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,200
It's a gift from me to you, for
working you like a cow.

168
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,700
The name's 'Thank-cow.'

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,986
Thank-cow,

170
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,186
let's stay out of
each other's way today.

171
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,153
Because every time I see you,
you remind me of someone.

172
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,333
Alright?

173
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,833
Ah...

174
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,800
Argh!

175
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,633
Why did I close my eyes? Why!

176
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,700
Oh... I could die right now!

177
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,453
I'm sorry I'm late!

178
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:00,920
Tsk, tsk.

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,720
Ms. Ji-ah, you're
as much as 14 minutes late!

180
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,220
- I'm sorry.
- Sweetie!

181
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,653
Are you being slack because
Ms. Kim isn't in today?

182
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,186
It's not that...

183
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,186
We moved to Yangpyeong last week,

184
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:13,453
so my commuting time has
become longer.

185
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,886
Uh,

186
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,953
enough with your new place
which we don't want to know about.

187
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,466
Let's start already.

188
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,266
Alright.

189
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:25,320
I'm going to the
real estate later on.

190
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,186
I'm thinking of getting
my own place near here.

191
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,886
Then I won't ever be late again.

192
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:32,286
Again, enough with your new place
which I'm not interested in.

193
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,320
Let's start already!

194
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,700
Yes, Ms. Bong.

195
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,486
So, uh...

196
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:43,853
Why did Ms. Kim
apply for leave today?

197
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:44,986
Who knows.

198
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,553
Maybe something's up?

199
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,966
Nothing's up.

200
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,333
Good morning, sir.

201
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,286
Don't talk about your colleague
who's absent,

202
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,820
and instead, try to
fill in for her absence.

203
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,086
Don't worry, sir.

204
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,100
- I'll be back.
- Don't worry.

205
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,233
Ugh, move!

206
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,666
Good morning, sir.

207
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,200
Ha...

208
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,366
I'm so bored.

209
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,186
Hey, Ji-eun.
What are you up to?

210
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,753
If you're free,
do you want to meet up?

211
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,553
Oh, a mom-gathering?

212
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,553
Hey, Eun-min.
What are you up to? If you're...

213
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,186
Oh, you're getting
filler injection?

214
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:02,133
Alright, good luck with those.

215
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,220
After I quit the company,

216
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,866
how am I going to use up my time?

217
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,720
(journalist Park)

218
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:16,220
Hello,

219
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,720
(Hello,)

220
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,886
this is Kim Mi-so,
your blind date.

221
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,086
(this is Kim Mi-so,
your blind date.)

222
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,753
Sorry to interrupt you,
but may I ask

223
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,853
(Sorry to interrupt you,
but may I ask)

224
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:24,453
(whether you've found anything
about that kidnapping case)

225
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,086
whether you've found anything
about that kidnapping case

226
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,533
I asked you to look into?

227
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,200
(I asked you to look into?)

228
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,986
That's right.

229
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,600
Let's first focus on finding oppa.

230
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,733
Good morning.

231
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,420
May I ask who...

232
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,486
Oh, you're Mr. Lee's guest from
last time, aren't you?

233
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:47,633
Yes.

234
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,166
(Lee Sung-yeon, author
Book Concert Proposal)

235
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,166
Are you the author for
our book concert?

236
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,366
Ah. Yes.

237
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,320
...Morpheus?

238
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,366
Oh my goodness!

239
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,820
Yes, well...

240
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,486
Hello.

241
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,586
I'm your fan, Morpheus!

242
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,953
Kyah! Hahaha!

243
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,966
It's such an honor to
see you for real!

244
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:10,966
What's going on?

245
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,533
Then, please excuse me.

246
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,733
Ah, yes.

247
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,886
Oh my goodness!

248
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:38,553
Now I see why he's refused to
make media appearances.

249
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,586
In case all the attention goes to
his face, and not his writing!

250
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,020
The moment he
stepped into my life!

251
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,420
Ha... He should've given me
a warning for heart attack!

252
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,986
He was so dazzling.

253
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,520
He had that aura of
a bestselling novelist.

254
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,720
Didn't you feel it, too?

255
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,286
Oh, but his novels
aren't to my taste.

256
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,886
Aren't his readers all women?

257
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,086
What are you talking about?

258
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,620
He's a bestselling author,
because everyone loves him!

259
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,186
Yes!

260
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,820
Just open the first page,
and in no time, the end!

261
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,153
Your time will have flashed past.

262
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,720
By the way, Morpheus...

263
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,886
He visited last time,
and came today, too.

264
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:08,120
Is he an acquaintance of Mr. Lee?

265
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,420
It doesn't look like it.

266
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,520
Didn't you feel that
tension between them?

267
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,186
Now that you mention it, yes.

268
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,066
So how do they know each other?

269
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,186
I know.

270
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:21,233
The shocking secret
between those two.

271
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,666
Alright, here it is. Those two...

272
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:27,520
...They're brothers.

273
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,520
- What?
- What?

274
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,166
Morpheus is the eldest son of
Yumyung Group!

275
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,786
I'm just dropping by after
a meeting with Planning.

276
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:49,566
Their proposal
wasn't all that bad.

277
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,920
You don't have to go over
every detail with me.

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,533
It's just one of the projects
at our company.

279
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,453
Must you put it that way?

280
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,766
Well, it's the truth.

281
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,720
Yes, well...

282
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm sure it's nothing for
the big shot you are.

283
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,900
But it didn't seem like that was
the case with Mom and Dad.

284
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:12,486
They're extremely delighted.

285
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,166
To see us working together.

286
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,420
That's why I'm here.

287
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,853
They're ecstatic,
thinking that we made up.

288
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,666
So let's avoid
unnecessary trouble, if we can.

289
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,966
Shouldn't you say that
to yourself?

290
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,520
What?

291
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,700
Because I'm not the one
who's caused trouble.

292
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,053
Is Ms. Kim Mi-so out somewhere?

293
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,253
Oh.

294
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,333
She's on leave today.

295
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,966
Oh.

296
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:02,620
Um... I'm your big fan, and
I'm even in your fan club.

297
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,420
My ID is 'Morpheus for Ji-ah.'

298
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,386
Maybe you remember me?

299
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,820
I wrote so many posts
on your fan club page.

300
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,186
Sorry, but I'll remember you
from now on.

301
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,953
I'll remember you too, forever!

302
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,720
Um, Mr. Morpheus?

303
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,086
May we have your autograph?

304
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,786
- I'm Bong Se-ra.
- I'm Lee Young-ok.

305
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,320
May I, as well?

306
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,700
May I?

307
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,833
Your autograph, please.

308
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:29,886
Oh my goodness!

309
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,253
When did you get that?

310
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,053
Ha! You didn't even
take the plastic off.

311
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,053
Ha...

312
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,220
'Bong Se-ra...'

313
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,520
'Lee Young-ok...'

314
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,253
'Morpheus for Ji-ah...'

315
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,786
Oh my.

316
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,366
- May I ask for your autograph?
- Oh.

317
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,133
Thank you.

318
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,533
Good thing she asked for
leave today.

319
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,853
Hey.

320
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,586
Yes, Ms. Kim.

321
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,686
Oh.

322
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:09,920
Sure, I'll adjust the schedule.

323
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,033
Alright.

324
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:15,020
So what are you up to
on your day off?

325
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,986
What?

326
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:18,486
Why are you at home?

327
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,153
Anyway, alright.

328
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,153
Call me if you need anything else.

329
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:23,653
Alright.

330
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:27,066
Hmmm. She should go somewhere...

331
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,333
Did you need anything, sir?

332
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,320
Cancel all my appointments today.

333
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,566
Something urgent has come up.

334
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,900
Yes, sir.

335
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,986
Ha... No replies,

336
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,866
and I have no plans.

337
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,553
Come to think of it,
isn't it all Mr. Lee's fault

338
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:54,953
that there's no one
I can call out or

339
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,433
even make plans for myself?

340
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,753
It's because I've been
sacrificing my life for him!

341
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,420
Ugh... That Mr. Lee!

342
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,800
Did you call for me?

343
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:06,786
Oh my God! Uh... Mr. Lee?

344
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:09,466
I mean... How...
Why are you here?

345
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,553
I thought you might be
thinking about me right now,

346
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:20,686
so I paraded over here.

347
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,066
Me, the vice-president.

348
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:26,600
Why don't we spend
the day together today?

349
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,953
- Sorry?
- I asked for leave, too.

350
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,420
So I can spend time with you.

351
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,920
Ha!

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,820
No need to spend time with me.

353
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,266
I'm busy!

354
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,453
It looks like all you're up to is
strolling the neighborhood.

355
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,900
How is this busy?

356
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,553
I'm busy,
strolling the neighborhood.

357
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,733
What?

358
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,586
How did you know I was home?

359
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,720
I overheard your conversation with
Ms. Kim Ji-ah over the phone.

360
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,233
You were secretly hoping
I'd come over, weren't you?

361
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:57,753
Mr. Lee, who excels in all fields!

362
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,520
Sadly, I guess that includes
deluding yourself.

363
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,220
Just leave it to me,
the man who excels in all fields.

364
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,433
I'll make sure to
entertain you for the day.

365
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,386
I'm really busy.

366
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:11,733
See, I'm thinking of
going much farther from now on.

367
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,133
What, dressed like that?

368
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,866
Give me a chance to
make it up to you.

369
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,766
Just for you, Ms. Kim,

370
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:32,520
I even drew up this itinerary.

371
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,420
Alright. Dinner at
a premium lounge restaurant,

372
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,286
with the company of
a chamber orchestra.

373
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:38,753
Followed by
a cruise on a private yacht.

374
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,620
Then we'll take the helicopter and
make way to the airport,

375
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,853
where we'll head off for
Japan on my private jet.

376
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:45,020
After having sushi for
a late-night snack, we'll return.

377
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,886
Hold on.

378
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:49,066
I'm not up for any of that, ever.

379
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,153
Why not?

380
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,820
Because this is my holiday.

381
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,020
I'm going to spend it
however I want to.

382
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,086
I'm never,

383
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,086
going to follow your schedule.

384
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,166
Then allow me to
follow yours for today.

385
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:05,353
- You won't be able to.
- I can.

386
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,100
- You can't.
- I said, I will.

387
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,533
Then...

388
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,220
What? A bus trip?

389
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,186
Yes.

390
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:28,986
What, we're not in Europe

391
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,520
or the Mediterranean, yet...

392
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,620
You want to catch just any bus

393
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,320
and go around the city?
Is that what you mean?

394
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,366
Yes.

395
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,186
Ms. Kim,

396
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,886
no need to rebel.

397
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,886
Please do what you truly desire.

398
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:45,053
This is what I truly desire.

399
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:47,353
Whenever I'm on a rush-hour bus,

400
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,953
I always dream about
not getting off and

401
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,933
going to the very last stop.

402
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,133
Ha...

403
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,553
But I guess this is
too hard for you, right?

404
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,153
To ride in a vehicle that
a stranger is driving.

405
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:01,386
You're very particular about that.

406
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,853
That's why you always
make me drive for you.

407
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,666
On second thought,
it's impossible, right?

408
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,200
The next bus is...

409
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,986
Let's go.

410
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,586
You're really getting on?

411
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,320
I told you, today it's
all about what you want to do.

412
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
Really?

413
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,520
Oh, let me treat you today.

414
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,900
Two, please.

415
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,900
Your balance is low.

416
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:40,633
What, they even have a function to
embarrass you like that?

417
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:42,533
I'll pay.

418
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,100
Here.

419
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,033
This is definitely not designed for
someone of my height.

420
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,720
Hold onto this.

421
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,220
Oh.

422
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,333
Hmpf.

423
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,420
Ms. Kim, you should sit.

424
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,600
No, Mr. Lee, you should...

425
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,033
...Actually, no. I'll sit.

426
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:36,920
Hey, did you just see that? Ha!

427
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,033
Must have no muscles
on his thighs.

428
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,400
Why couldn't you have
just sat down?

429
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,033
Looks like his legs are jelly.

430
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,120
Wow, the sun's still out.

431
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,086
- You're right.
- Yes, haha!

432
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,520
Since it's getting hot and all,

433
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,186
how about we all go for
chicken and beer together?

434
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:11,386
Oh, sorry. Leave me out.

435
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,353
I have to go look at
some properties.

436
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:14,653
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

437
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,286
Alright, bye.

438
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:17,920
Then how about just us?

439
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,066
Whatever. Forget it.

440
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:22,220
My! Mr. Koh!

441
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,486
We're all going for
some chicken and beer.

442
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,720
Would you like to join us?

443
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,753
Huh? Didn't you say
you're not having any?

444
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,786
When did I? Ha!

445
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:30,886
You're coming, right?

446
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:34,253
It's a great way to de-stress
at the end of your day!

447
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,153
I believe the best way to
de-stress is through work.

448
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,653
Because nothing beats
stress more than

449
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:41,153
completing
your work to perfection.

450
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,233
Then... Please enjoy.

451
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,220
Then what about next time?

452
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,486
Too bad, then.

453
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:48,920
Alright, let's go for
that chicken and beer!

454
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,886
Forget it!

455
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,020
Hey, you just said
we should have some beer to

456
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,220
cool ourselves off.

457
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,853
Me? When?

458
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,253
I meant with Mr. Koh,

459
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,086
not with you, Mr. Jung.

460
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,053
Ha! You're really clueless.

461
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:01,620
Ugh!

462
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,520
Why, that Ms. Bong...

463
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,366
It's not like I can...
Do this to her.

464
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:13,620
Wow, this place is nice.

465
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,753
Is it available right now?

466
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:15,786
Of course.

467
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,220
Oh, did you also want to
check out the rooftop?

468
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,286
Great views.

469
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:20,886
Oh, I'll have access to
the rooftop?

470
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:23,753
Of course.
The rooftop's shared space.

471
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,586
The guy who lives up
on the rooftop

472
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,720
even built himself
a vegetable garden,

473
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,086
and even grows lettuce
and cherry tomatoes.

474
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,486
Wow, sound like
a hardworking person.

475
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:34,153
Hardworking,

476
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:35,553
and thrifty, too.

477
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,220
He does so well on his own.

478
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,120
The rent for that place was
$500 a month,

479
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,153
but he struck a deal for
$420, too.

480
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:44,433
Oh, really?

481
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,686
Let me just take this call.

482
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:48,586
Go ahead and take a look around.

483
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:49,766
I will.

484
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,253
Ah, it's loose again.

485
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,520
Guess I can't help it,

486
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,386
when I have just one suit.

487
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:07,933
You've got it hard, too.

488
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,033
- Huh?
- Eh!

489
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,200
Mr. Koh... Koh Gui...

490
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:22,386
I can't believe this!

491
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:25,686
What's this? Did you stalk me?

492
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:26,586
What?

493
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:27,553
It's not like that...

494
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:29,120
Alright, so I have just one suit.

495
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,320
Were you that curious?

496
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,753
Is that why you followed me
all the way here?

497
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,453
No, no. I didn't follow after you.

498
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,920
I only came to check a room out.

499
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,600
I'm going to be moving here.

500
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:39,933
What?

501
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,866
Then... bye.

502
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:48,766
Wait.

503
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,320
If you ever try to taint my image

504
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,820
as the workaholic hottie,

505
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,853
voted the most eligible bachelor
in Yumyung Group...

506
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:01,600
You have been warned!

507
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,786
Oh, don't worry.

508
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:08,333
Mmmm-hmmm?

509
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,333
So, I had a question.

510
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,320
How did you
manage that with the buttons?

511
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,686
You surely dropped it then...

512
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,186
The buttons!

513
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:24,566
To prepare for emergencies,

514
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:29,400
I stocked up on them.

515
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,266
Oh. Oh...

516
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:49,720
This place must be very good

517
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,266
for you to take me
all the way out here.

518
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,753
It's my favorite place.

519
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,000
Over there.

520
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,333
(Bye to Rinds)

521
00:29:00,366 --> 00:29:02,300
'Bye to Rinds...'

522
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,953
Yes, it does make you
want to say bye.

523
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:07,220
Then go home already.

524
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,486
I'm going to follow
wherever you're going.

525
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:11,500
I told you already, that
today's all about you.

526
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,320
Excuse me, can we have
two servings here, please?

527
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,700
Coming right up!

528
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,300
Go on.

529
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,100
Oh, what?

530
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:18,366
Did you just kick
because I didn't serve you any?

531
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:21,320
You... You must be mistaken.

532
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,733
It's a misunderstanding!

533
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:30,486
So... This is your favorite place?

534
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:31,720
Rather than my favorite,

535
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,320
this is where Dad would always
take my sisters and me for dinner.

536
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,086
With debt up to his neck,
we can't all go have

537
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,866
A-grade beef now, can we?

538
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,186
You're right.

539
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,553
What's your father like?

540
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:50,133
You're full of
questions today, aren't you?

541
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:52,500
He's a rock artist.

542
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:54,733
What?

543
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,286
A guitarist of a band.

544
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:01,553
I told you the story of
how he was swindled while

545
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:04,266
running a shop at the
Nakwon Instrument Arcade, right?

546
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,120
Yes, you did.

547
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,353
That was the reason why
you started working pretty early.

548
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,986
Yes.

549
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,220
After that, he even tried
his hand at hard labor to

550
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,753
pay for my sister's tuition,
but ended up hurting himself.

551
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,486
Then he took out private loans,

552
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:21,486
hoping to hit a jack pot.

553
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:23,766
Though he did hit a jack pot
in another sense.

554
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,620
But that's all because
he was forcing himself to

555
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,233
do things that weren't for him.

556
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:34,386
At least he's doing
what he wants to now,

557
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:37,133
and my sisters have
all realized their dreams.

558
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:43,020
Didn't you ever
hate your family for all this?

559
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,286
No.

560
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:46,266
It's not like
they meant it on purpose.

561
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,553
People talk about
life at a losing end

562
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:57,220
as a beautiful, worthy sacrifice.

563
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,700
But the reality is, it's not.

564
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:02,153
You're only losing out.

565
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:05,900
Losing out by losing yourself,
by sacrificing yourself.

566
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,753
In whatever situation,
you are the most important.

567
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:16,486
You are the most important,
so you should prioritize yourself.

568
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,966
Don't forget.

569
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:26,433
What's with that laugh?

570
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:31,186
Looks like nine years are
a long time, after all.

571
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:34,620
To be comforted by
your words which are

572
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,220
the epitome of narcissism...

573
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,720
Epitome of narcissism?

574
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,100
Excuse me!

575
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:43,966
Go on.

576
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,253
Give that to me,
let me grill them.

577
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,686
What?

578
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:51,686
This is your holiday.

579
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:53,553
We agreed this would be about you,

580
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,966
so why don't I try
my hand at this?

581
00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:59,200
Oh.

582
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:15,520
Alright, then. What's the
next thing you'd like to do?

583
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,933
Well...

584
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,566
Hey!

585
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,800
Ah, so cute.

586
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,986
You're still into
stuffed toys, are you?

587
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,053
I even mentioned that to you?

588
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,686
There was that questionnaire.

589
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,920
You said you wanted a big
stuffed toy from an opposite sex.

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,053
Oh, that's right.
There was that, too.

591
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,853
Can I play just one game?

592
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:42,100
Of course.

593
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,666
Here we go!

594
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,120
- Alright! Ah...
- Ah...

595
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,400
That was my first game, so...

596
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,200
You're my target today!

597
00:33:58,133 --> 00:33:59,886
Ah!

598
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:00,920
- That was so close.
- Ha...

599
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,900
My hand won't listen to me today.

600
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,433
This time, for sure!

601
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:10,886
- Ugh.
- Ugh...

602
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,153
Ms. Kim, step aside.

603
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:15,686
Just watching you is
making me frustrated.

604
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:17,820
This is quite tricky, you know.

605
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,286
It's not all that easy to
actually win something.

606
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:20,920
While watching,
I grasped the mechanism.

607
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,233
What's important is the angle...

608
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:26,986
...And the timing.

609
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,333
Just like this.

610
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,720
Hahaha!

611
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,120
Looks like that and the reality are
two different things.

612
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,133
It was because I was talking,
that I couldn't concentrate.

613
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,086
The right angle,
and that precise timing...

614
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,300
...Which is right now!

615
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:55,766
Ha! Ugh...

616
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,820
Ugh.

617
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,986
- Hahaha!
- Hahaha!

618
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,100
Here we go.

619
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:06,466
Pick it... Ah!

620
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,700
Ah...

621
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,720
Ugh, please!

622
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,100
Ah!

623
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,366
Just one more game, Ms. Kim.

624
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,186
Please work.

625
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:29,120
Please work!

626
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,366
- Come on!
- Ah...

627
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,153
How much is this machine?

628
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,233
Mr. Lee?

629
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,320
We should go now.

630
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,466
How much is this machine?

631
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,186
I think we should get more change
and try once more...

632
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:47,633
No, I don't think that's smart.

633
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:51,200
Ha...

634
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,520
So you are coming to
work tomorrow?

635
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,020
Of course.

636
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,700
Tomorrow, it will be back to
being all about you.

637
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,420
Then see you tomorrow.

638
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,766
Alright, bye.

639
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,066
Thank-cow, make sure to
watch the house.

640
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:22,120
How have you been?

641
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,220
Good, Mi-so.

642
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,853
I managed just fine,

643
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,953
- in my good spirits.
- Oh.

644
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:29,220
Sorry to get back to you so late,

645
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,453
I was out on the field yesterday.

646
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:34,020
Now, about that kidnapping case
you mentioned last time.

647
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,020
Yes?

648
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,686
I don't think
it's the case you're after,

649
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:40,386
but in 1994, the son of the
CEO of Yumyung Group was

650
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,786
kidnapped and
held hostage for 3 days.

651
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:45,800
On a re-development site which is
now Yumyung Land.

652
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,766
On a re-development site?

653
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,020
Yes. The group shielded the
case from media, so there was

654
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,586
no other info other than that
he was in grade 4 at the time.

655
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,386
And it just turns out,

656
00:37:56,466 --> 00:38:00,233
that their eldest son
happened to be in grade 4, then.

657
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,333
It wasn't all that fun.
When I was in 4th grade, I mean.

658
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:08,086
Mr. Lee, at nine years old,
you're in grade 2.

659
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,220
I was in grade 4.

660
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,586
I was too smart, so
they moved me up two years.

661
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:17,353
I was in the
same class as my brother.

662
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:21,233
No, our VP was also in
4th grade back then, too.

663
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,700
Ms. Kim!

664
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:42,786
What's on your mind?

665
00:38:42,866 --> 00:38:44,653
Oh, hello.

666
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:45,900
Get in!

667
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,086
Alright, here we go!

668
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,900
Uh, Mr. Park?

669
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,533
What? Kidnapping?

670
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:06,633
Yes.

671
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:10,033
I wondered if you had
heard anything from him.

672
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:15,620
Well, we've been friends for
a long time now,

673
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,853
but Young-joon has
never said anything about it.

674
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:20,520
In fact, he's hardly
mentioned his childhood.

675
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,086
In other words, you don't know.

676
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,466
No.

677
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:31,220
So, uh... May I ask why you started

678
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,400
looking into this case?

679
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:37,653
I don't quite remember,

680
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:42,900
but I think I was locked inside
an empty house for a whole day.

681
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,366
Huh?

682
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:50,866
And there was a boy next to me.

683
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:55,933
I think that
might've been Mr. Lee.

684
00:39:57,266 --> 00:40:01,300
But... You said both Young-joon and
his brother were in 4th grade.

685
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,853
You didn't get his name?

686
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,553
I did.

687
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,033
But I don't quite remember...

688
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:11,966
So what makes you think
that's Young-joon?

689
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,100
Ms. Kim Mi-so?

690
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:20,800
Yes.

691
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:25,053
You said spiders scare you the
most in this world, right?

692
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,366
To me, it's the cable ties.

693
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:32,786
So from now on,
don't use them.

694
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:33,853
Please.

695
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,166
Don't say you're fine, when...

696
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,020
Just.

697
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,666
My intuition's telling me so.

698
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,086
Uh, what about...

699
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,966
...Asking Young-joon directly?

700
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,886
I considered that option too,

701
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,000
but...

702
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:00,253
There must be a reason

703
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,933
why he didn't say anything
until now.

704
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:06,086
It might be a bad memory for him,

705
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,620
or an old scar.

706
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,500
So I just can't bring myself to.

707
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,166
I'd rather just sit satisfied for
having found that boy.

708
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,086
Oh, and...

709
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,300
Please pretend
we didn't have this talk today.

710
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:30,000
Hey, don't you worry!

711
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:31,886
Like you said,

712
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:35,386
if Young-joon didn't say anything
about it these last 9 years,

713
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,333
he must've had his reason.

714
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,720
Huh? Ms. Kim!

715
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,320
Did you enjoy your holiday?

716
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,833
Yes, well...

717
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:58,020
Oh, Mr. Lee was in early today.

718
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,066
Said he had lots to take care of,
after taking the day off yesterday.

719
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:27,700
Why is she staring
at me like that?

720
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:31,820
My handsome face will wear off.

721
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,220
Then again, if all those
people's stares did wear it off,

722
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,800
then my face would be long gone.

723
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:05,786
Did you call for me, Mr. Lee?

724
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:06,853
Yes, Ms. Kim.

725
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:08,620
My study's overflowing with books.

726
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,553
I want to dispose the ones
I no longer read.

727
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:11,720
Will you help me?

728
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,253
Of course, sir.

729
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,720
When would you be free?

730
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,266
Any time.

731
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,620
What about tonight?

732
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,233
Sounds good.

733
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:27,386
Why are you...

734
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:28,866
...So cooperative?

735
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:32,920
I wanted to do
all I can to help you,

736
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,766
as you have helped me so far.

737
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:37,766
What?

738
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:40,700
Mr. Lee.

739
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,066
Yes? Did you have
something to say?

740
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm so happy...

741
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,066
...That we could meet again.

742
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,800
Me, too.

743
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,800
Then...

744
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,220
We only last saw each other
last night.

745
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,220
Did she fall for me that hard,

746
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,966
to be so ecstatic about
seeing me again?

747
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:53,266
- Oh, what?
- Really? Hahaha!

748
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,386
- I can't believe this!
- What's this?

749
00:44:56,466 --> 00:44:57,986
Why are they laughing?

750
00:44:58,066 --> 00:44:59,953
Ugh, please!

751
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,333
Don't tell me...
Are they talking about me?

752
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,953
I know this will be
hard to believe,

753
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,753
but there's just one!

754
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,566
- Ms. Kim Ji-ah?
- What... Ah!

755
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,853
Can I see you for a minute?

756
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:12,886
Uh... What?

757
00:45:12,966 --> 00:45:14,566
Why do you...

758
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:19,933
Why, those two...

759
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,353
You were just talking about me,
weren't you?

760
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:30,286
Huh? No.

761
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:31,186
Don't lie to me.

762
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:32,853
I heard you clearly.

763
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:34,186
'I know this will be
hard to believe,

764
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:35,620
but there's just one!'

765
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,586
That's what you said!

766
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,353
Weren't you talking about
my one suit?

767
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:39,753
No!

768
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:41,420
Oh, that was about
one of our interns being

769
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,620
so surprised about
how delicious the food is here.

770
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,886
So I told that
'This will be hard to believe,

771
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:48,320
but there's just one company that
hires a professional chef

772
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,820
for its cafeteria,
and that's us, Yumyung Group!'

773
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,353
Then...

774
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:55,253
Why did you laugh like that,
when you saw me?

775
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:58,000
That's just my default expression.

776
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:00,366
Ha....

777
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,620
Anyway, you better watch it.

778
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,700
Because I've got my eyes on you!

779
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,366
What...

780
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:12,386
What's this?

781
00:46:12,466 --> 00:46:13,933
What was that about just now?

782
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:17,253
It's nothing.

783
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,786
How is this nothing?

784
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:22,253
Don't tell me...

785
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,666
There's something going on
between you two?

786
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:27,020
More like, I'm so frustrated!

787
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,066
Oh what? That should be my line
after seeing you two!

788
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:34,900
Ha!

789
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,033
What was that just now?

790
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:46,920
Are you heading for the luncheon?

791
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,653
Your car is ready.

792
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:49,953
Since it's a private luncheon,

793
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:52,620
no need to accompany me.
Enjoy your lunch.

794
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,153
Yes, sir.

795
00:46:54,233 --> 00:46:55,166
Hold on.

796
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,466
Your tie's crooked.

797
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,666
I'm sorry to realize it so late.

798
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:18,500
What?

799
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:23,600
I mean the tie.

800
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,986
What is with Ms. Kim today?

801
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:37,920
Something's definitely up.

802
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,333
It's like her affection for me has
deepened by 3-fold.

803
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:44,720
Was it because I did a superb job,

804
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,066
following her schedule?

805
00:48:01,566 --> 00:48:02,800
This time for sure!

806
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:05,633
- Ah...
- Ah!

807
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:09,186
If I had gotten that toy,
then she'd have fainted.

808
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:11,633
Because then it wouldn't be
just 3-fold, but 10-fold!

809
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:31,466
Almost there! Ugh...

810
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:34,333
Almost there!

811
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,966
Gosh, you suck!

812
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:47,953
What did you just say?

813
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:49,453
That you suck.

814
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:51,953
So move it already,
Mr. Good-for-nothing.

815
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,486
What? "Good-for-nothing?"

816
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:56,220
Yeah! That's what mom calls
those people who

817
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,500
don't go to work.

818
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,020
You kids may not know who I am,

819
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,020
but you know the
electronics in your homes

820
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,586
and the toys you play with?

821
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,020
At least one or two of those
in your house is

822
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,686
our company's product.

823
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:09,820
To put it simply,

824
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,920
I'm a chaebol!

825
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,786
Then why would a chaebol
try to win toys?

826
00:49:13,866 --> 00:49:15,920
Right! When you could just
buy them with your money.

827
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,486
Mmmm, not quite.

828
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:19,453
That's not fair play.

829
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:22,520
This only has value
when it's won by hard sweat.

830
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,453
So kids, shhh!

831
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:26,966
It's time to focus.

832
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:39,466
Alright, alright, alright!

833
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:48,166
Hey... Hey... Hey!

834
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:13,566
Ms. Kim.

835
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,786
You have a guest
you might be happy to see.

836
00:50:16,866 --> 00:50:17,720
Sorry?

837
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,166
This is to thank you for
our enjoyable holiday yesterday.

838
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,933
Its name is... 'Remember-dog.'

839
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,566
Huh? This is...

840
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,500
I'm sorry I didn't remember.

841
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,820
I know you're touched, yes,

842
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,033
but no need to cry over
a stuffed toy!

843
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,466
Ms. Kim!

844
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,820
We're going to grab some coffee.

845
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,766
Would you like one?

846
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:08,986
Uh... Yes, I do.

847
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,853
Actually, let me grab it.

848
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:12,733
Then... I'll be right back!

849
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:25,666
Was she that touched to
break into tears like that?

850
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,720
Three lattes and
four Americanos, please.

851
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,833
Alright.

852
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:57,153
Oppa, I want to go home.

853
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:59,320
Mi-so, stop crying.

854
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,353
If you do,
I'll give you something yummy.

855
00:52:01,433 --> 00:52:03,420
Something yummy?

856
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,186
Here. Caramel.

857
00:52:06,266 --> 00:52:10,966
Eat this, and
promise me you won't cry.

858
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:13,600
Enjoy.

859
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,186
Ah, Ms. Kim.

860
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:42,966
I should've been the
one to grab them for you.

861
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:46,786
Hey, you even bought caramel?

862
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:49,420
Oh, it's for someone.

863
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,720
Who? Your crush?

864
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,320
Still going on about that?

865
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,600
Just... Someone I want to thank.

866
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:01,500
...Though he won't remember me.

867
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:05,553
By the way, did you know?

868
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:08,886
I got a text from a friend who's
also in Morpheus' fan club.

869
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:12,300
Apparently, Morpheus was
abducted when he was little!

870
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:14,486
What?

871
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,653
Before he became famous,

872
00:53:15,733 --> 00:53:18,286
that's what he had
written on his blog.

873
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:19,920
He deleted it right away,

874
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,166
but many of his fans
have a copy of it.

875
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,000
No way.

876
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:31,800
Do you think... I can see it?

I'm not stupid.

Really?

898
00:54:33,466 --> 00:54:37,053
- You'll really come see me?
- Yeah.

899
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:38,986
I won't ever forget
your name, then!

900
00:54:39,066 --> 00:54:42,453
Your name was... Lee...

901

Dummy, there you go again.

902
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,586
That's not what my name is.

903
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,766
It's Lee Sung...

904

Lee Sung...

906
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,066
His name was Lee Sung-yeon.

907
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:27,766
That's right.
It was my brother.

908
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:32,886
It was my brother...

909
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:34,166
...Who was kidnapped.

910
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:42,353
Then...

911
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:44,166
May I ask just one thing?

912
00:55:47,466 --> 00:55:50,833
How did you come to have
that scar on your ankle?

913
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:55,200
Why are you asking me,
all of a sudden?

914
00:55:57,433 --> 00:56:00,720
I thought it was you,
because you're also

915
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,953
haunted by memories,

916
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,420
and there's that scar, so...

917
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,800
That scar's...

918
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,433
...From a childhood accident.

919
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:15,566
Oh.

920
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:18,500
Was that why?

921
00:56:20,366 --> 00:56:21,466
Sorry?

922
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,486
Because you thought I was
that boy you were looking for?

923
00:56:26,566 --> 00:56:28,553
Is that why you were staring at me

924
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,433
all day, with those eyes?

925
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,366
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

926
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,533
Have you been well?

927
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,366
I came to sign my contract
and dropped by.

928
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:20,166
I came yesterday too,
but didn't find you here.

929
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,586
I was on leave.

930
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:26,286
Oh, I see.

931
00:57:26,366 --> 00:57:27,786
I thought about calling you,

932
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:29,586
but thought it might be
best to talk to you in person.

933
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,433
So here I am.

934
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,153
Here to apologize about

935
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:36,466
not telling you sooner that
Young-joon and I are brothers.

936
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,886
What's wrong, Mi-so?

937
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:48,266
Something wrong?

938
00:57:58,566 --> 00:58:00,120
So you're saying,

939
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,033
we were both locked up
in there, were we?

940
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:11,286
Don't you remember
being with me at all?

941
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:15,853
To be honest,
my memories are in pieces

942
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:18,100
from the shock of being abducted.

943
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,666
Then how much do you remember?

944
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,866
Do you want me to tell you
even just what I remember?

945
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:34,166
Yes.

946
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,586
That guy...

947
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:40,200
He and I never got along,
even when we were little.

948
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:42,986
Sorry?

949
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:44,800
Young-joon.

950
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:49,366
Just like now, he was
a narcissist back then, too.

951
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:53,686
He learned fast and was
better than me at everything,

952
00:58:53,766 --> 00:58:55,866
so all my life, I've grown up
being compared to him.

953
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:59,953
Then in fourth grade,

954
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:03,133
he skipped class and
we ended up in the same class.

955
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:09,920
And Young-joon, with that
smart head of his,

956
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,620
snatched all my friends from me
and started bullying me.

957
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,000
While looking down and
laughing at me.

958
00:59:17,566 --> 00:59:18,666
Sorry?

959
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:23,420
I quarreled a lot
with my brother's friends.

960
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,200
They'd pick on me,
saying I was an arrogant brat.

961
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:31,220
But at least you were with
your brother, thank goodness!

962
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:31,966
No.

963
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:35,520
He was worse.

964
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,200
A total jerk, he was.

965
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,186
One day,

966
00:59:43,266 --> 00:59:45,700
he took me to an area
that was being redeveloped.

967
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:49,933
He said to wait while he was
getting some drinks for us.

968
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,253
But Young-joon didn't come back,

969
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:58,420
and while waiting...

970

01:03:08,066 --> 01:03:08,986
(Resume)

989
01:03:09,066 --> 01:03:11,533
(Certified Secretary
Certified Global Seller)

990
01:03:14,733 --> 01:03:16,653
(Certified Secretary
MCSE Certification)

991
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:20,033
(Resume)

992
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:25,766
(Resume)

993
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,433
(Certified Secretary
CCIE Certification)

994
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:38,400
Why did he hire me,
over all these candidates?

995
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:42,400
Why did I hire you?

996
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:45,853
Are you curious?

997
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:47,133
Sorry?

998
01:03:53,766 --> 01:03:54,766
Yes.

999
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:15,900
Because you were Mi-so.

1000
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,666
Kim Mi-so.

1001
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,466
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

1002
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,233
Did you have an appointment?

1003
01:05:18,966 --> 01:05:20,453
Guess who!

1004
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,200
What are you doing?

1005
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,486
Flirting?

1006
01:05:26,566 --> 01:05:29,133
When you're both interested,
but not dating yet.

1007
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:29,933
(To Oppa)

1008
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,286
Instead of memory searching,

1009
01:05:31,366 --> 01:05:33,366
she should focus on
making them, with me!

1010
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,620
The reason why I'm here is...

1011
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,486
...To emphasize
solidarity and cooperation?

1012
01:05:38,566 --> 01:05:40,953
No, to call it an end to flirting,

1013
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:43,000
- and to move onto dating.
- Sorry?
