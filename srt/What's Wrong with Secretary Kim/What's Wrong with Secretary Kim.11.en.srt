00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,300
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,267
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,100
How did you...

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,733
They told me
my memories aren't real.

9
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,500
Is that what you think, too?

10
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,700
You can't even give me
a straight answer to

11
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,333
my question, can you?

12
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:09,067
Alright, then. Introducing our
special guest for this evening,

13
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,800
Ms. Kim Na-yeon, who is
also a professional model.

14
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:35,966
Does that mean
my memories are all wrong?

15
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,800
Sometimes...

16
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:50,866
I dream about my childhood
which I can't quite understand.

17
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,500
If...

18
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,966
If really...

19
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,300
...Those dreams are...

20
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,167
Daddy's gone to work!

21
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,934
What nonsense are
you talking about?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,366
Auntie's gone weird, oppa.

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,134
No, Mi-so. That's not Auntie.

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,867
That's a spider. A huge spider.

25
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,434
Oppa, I'm scared.

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,167
Mi-so, stay right there.
Don't come here.

27
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:19,434
No, oppa!
Don't leave me here!

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,200
Don't come here, dummy!

29
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,500
I remembered.

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Mi-so! Mi-so!

31
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,800
Mi-so, wake up! Mi-so!

32
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,066
Kim Mi-so!

33
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,934
Ms. Kim, can you hear me?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,233
Kim Mi-so!

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,266
Kim Mi-so!

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,033
(Episode 11)

37
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,733
Mommy?

38
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,600
Mommy!

39
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,700
Mommy?

40
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,533
Mommy!

41
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,200
It's not Mommy.

42
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,067
Hey, are you
looking for your mommy?

43
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,300
Yes.

44
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,934
Do you want me to
take you to your mommy?

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,767
Really?

46
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,200
My mommy's in hospital.
Can you really take me to her?

47
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,400
Of course.

48
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,434
I'll take you.

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,366
Let's go.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,533
(Danger)

51
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,734
Auntie, if I really spend
one night here,

52
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,500
will you take me to Mommy?

53
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,133
Auntie! I want the
same bracelet as him.

54
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,367
Sung-hyeon. Lee Sung-hyeon.

55
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,134
Seong-nyun?

56
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,434
It's Sung-hyeon.

57
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,634
Seong-nyun!

58
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,433
Seong-nyun oppa.

59
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,434
You're really stupid, aren't you?

60
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,467
I'm not stupid.

61
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,367
I'm five years old already,

62
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,566
And I can even read better than
my sister, Mal-hee.

63
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,400
By the way, oppa. What's dying?

64
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:09,767
Daddy said Mommy's too sick
and she might die.

65
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,733
What happens if Mommy dies?

66
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,134
I don't know.

67
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,100
- Are you stupid?
- What?

68
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,267
Pil-nam said if Mom dies,

69
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,500
that means we can't
ever see her again.

70
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,434
You're 9 years old,
and you don't even know that?

71
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,900
You're stupid! Stupid!

72
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,900
Who are you calling stupid?

73
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,833
Of course you can't meet her
once she dies, stupid.

74
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:43,667
Then does that mean
I can't see her either?

75
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,400
No, I meant...

76
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,500
Wait. That's not what I meant.

77
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Shhh. Alright,
so just be quiet, alright?

78
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,134
Be quiet.

79
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,534
Daddy will be here soon.

80
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,267
I'm sorry, we'll be quiet.

81
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:06,634
Daddy? But Daddy's at
the hospital right now.

82
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,333
No, Daddy's at work!

83
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:13,734
He'll be back soon,
so let's wait for him with Mommy.

84
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,534
- But my mommy's also in...
- Mi-so, shhh.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,666
What nonsense are
you talking about?

86
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,134
I think she's still
half-awake, Mom.

87
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,634
I'll calm her down,
so don't worry.

88
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,166
We'll be quiet.

89
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,434
Oppa, Auntie's strange.

90
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,534
I want to go home.

91
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Mi-so, stop crying.

92
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,600
If you do,
I'll give you something yummy.

93
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,266
- Something yummy?
- Yeah.

94
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,500
Here. Caramel.

95
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,633
Eat this, and
promise me you won't cry.

96
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:14,600
Yummy?

97
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:17,633
Enjoy.

98
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,833
Auntie...

99
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,234
...Mom.

100
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,333
Shhh.

101
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:59,167
Your sister's asleep.
You should be quiet.

102
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,700
Yes, Mom.

103
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:02,834
I'll be quiet,

104
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,134
until Dad comes.

105
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,100
No.

106
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,734
Dad won't be coming.

107
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Because...

108
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,866
...I'm not your mother.

109
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,433
I gave him my everything,

110
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,333
but he didn't.

111
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,766
I even aborted my child for him...

112
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,300
Right now, I bet...

113
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:48,400
...He's in bed sleeping peacefully
with his kids, who are at your age.

114
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:53,134
Why am I the only one
who's suffering?

115
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
My only sin is
that I loved him...

116
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,000
If I die...

117
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:07,266
Will he feel any remorse?

118
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,133
Come with me.

119
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,200
I don't want to go alone.

120
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,200
You come with me.

121
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:22,334
Just forget about that coward

122
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,800
and start again.

123
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,134
Please just stop,

124
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
and let us go.

125
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:33,833
We won't ever report you. Please?

126
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:50,966
It's too late.

127
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,866
I've already come too far.

128
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,366
Thanks for
your words of comfort, kiddo.

129
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,667
No...

130
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,300
No, you can't.

131
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,500
No, please. Don't!

132
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,033
Help us!

133
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,634
I caused you nothing but trouble...

134
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,367
No...

135
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:45,667
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:48,600
No, please. Don't!

137
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,934
In his place,

138
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,034
you watch my last for me.

139
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,400
Somebody...

140
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,734
Somebody, please help us!

141
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,066
Help us, please!

142
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,600
Help us!

143
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,600
No...

144
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,667
Oppa, what are you
doing over there?

145
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,900
Mi-so, stay there.

146
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:28,967
Don't come here.

147
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,167
Hmmm?

148
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,100
What is that?

149
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,666
Auntie?

150
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,267
Auntie's gone weird, oppa.

151
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm scared.

152
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:43,100
Mi-so's mother might pass away.

153
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,934
I can't let her learn
about death, like this.

154
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,800
No, Mi-so.

155
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,700
That's not Auntie.

156
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:50,900
That's...

157
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,833
...A spider. A giant spider.

158
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,733
That spider's scary!

159
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,667
It's alright, Mi-so.

160
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,866
The spider won't come to you,
so don't cry.

161
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,734
Oppa, my feet...

162
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,500
My feet hurt so much.

163
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:29,966
I'll grab scissors
and let you free.

164
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,967
She's here.

165
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:44,666
The dead woman. She's up here.

166
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,867
Mi-so.

167
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,000
Mi-so, you're still there, right?

168
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,900
Oppa, why are you crying?

169
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:02,134
Did the spider bite you? Oh no...

170
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,300
I'm alright.

171
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,167
Mi-so's here with me.

172
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,266
She's in there, with me.

173
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,267
Mi-so, listen to me.

174
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,667
Yes?

175
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:37,367
There are these spiders in Africa
which are the size of grown-ups.

176
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,667
And they're really feisty that

177
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,366
if someone looks at them,
they'll bite them.

178
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

179
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,234
And I think one of these
spiders is outside.

180
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,100
So close your eyes
and don't look, alright?

181
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,534
Alright.

182
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,134
Let's go home now.

183
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,533
Hold my hand, and follow me.

184
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,633
Yes, oppa.

185
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,400
This is my house.

186
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,600
You really do live near here.

187
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,167
From now on,

188
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,000
don't ever go out alone.

189
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:32,934
Alright?

190
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,634
Alright. By the way, oppa.

191
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,900
I want to marry you
when I get older.

192
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:40,200
M-marry me?

193
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,766
Yes, you're like a prince.

194
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,000
By the way, are you rich, too?

195
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,500
Rich? Yeah.

196
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:52,167
Daddy told me to
marry a rich guy, no matter what!

197
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:55,567
Well... My dad's rich,

198
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,134
so I guess that makes me rich.

199
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,700
How rich are you?

200
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:01,400
Rich enough to buy
Nana's Sweet Home?

201
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,067
You mean Nana Dolls?

202
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,534
Yes, Yumyung Inc. makes them.

203
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,100
Yumyung Inc. is
one of our affiliates.

204
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:12,400
Affiliate? What's that?
Is that food?

205
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:16,400
The factory that makes Nana's
Sweet Home is all ours.

206
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:19,900
Promise me, quick.
That you'll marry me!

207
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,500
- I can't.
- Why not?

208
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,934
Because you should only marry
your love once you're an adult.

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,366
Then once you're an adult,
you could love me!

210
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,233
Alright, I'll marry you.

211
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,134
Then it's a promise!

212
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,367
I'll come back to see you again.

213
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,633
With that, we were able to
return home safely.

214
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,733
(Police)

215
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,366
(Police)

216
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:50,966
Sung-hyeon?

217
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,633
- Sung-hyeon!
- Sung-hyeon.

218
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,333
Sung-hyeon, are you alright?

219
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,533
Sung-hyeon.

220
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,467
Come with me.

221
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:04,900
Come here. Come here.

222
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,400
No, no!

223
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,934
Mom! No, no!

224
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,167
- Sung-hyeon, what's wrong?
- No, no!

225
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,000
- Sung-hyeon.
- What is it?

226
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,666
Can you call the doctor?

227
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,333
No, no!

228
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,000
However...

229
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,866
It was hard to pretend
that nothing had happened.

230
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,433
And every time,

231
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:31,433
I wondered
how you were doing, and...

232
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,500
I...

233
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,666
I want to go see
that neighborhood again.

234
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,500
I won't stay long, can I?

235
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:51,600
And I wanted to keep my promise
that I'll see you again.

236
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:59,133
(Construction site for Yumyung Land)

237
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,800
I told you there'd be nothing.

238
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,633
But I promised to
come see her again.

239
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,966
Good morning, sir.

240
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,467
Ever since then,

241
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,434
I found it hard being with
young women

242
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
around her age...

243
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,733
I got rid of them all, sir.

244
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,233
...And cable ties reminded me
of that traumatic experience, but...

245
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,566
It was bearable.

246
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,900
Still, once in a while,

247
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,600
I wondered how you were doing.

248
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,900
Then one day,

249
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,233
just like a dream...
I met you again.

250
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,100
Ah, nice!

251
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:55,866
What's your name?

252
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,433
Oh, it's Kim Mi-so, sir.

253
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,300
- Ms. Kim Mi-so.
- Yes?

254
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,233
Do you know who I am?

255
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,966
Yes. You're the President's son.

256
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,233
Was I wrong?

257
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,533
No, you're right.

258
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,600
- Mi-so, cheers!
- Cheers.

259
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,334
- I'll be in your care!
- Let me pour it for you.

260
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
I was a bit disappointed,

261
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,466
but at the same time,
I thought, thank goodness.

262
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,833
Because it was
enough with just me,

263
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,100
being tied down by those
memories from that day.

264
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:44,600
Good morning, sir.

265
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:50,467
My name is Kim Mi-so, and I am
your PA from today onward.

266
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,800
I'll do my best, sir.
I'll be in your care.

267
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,266
What was I thinking?

268
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,366
Wanting to...

269
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,766
...Keep you by my side.

270
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,134
Hello, this is the
General Affairs at Yumyung.

271
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm Hiyoshi from Nassan Motors.

272
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:27,800
I wanted to confirm something.

273
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,866
I'm really sorry,
can you speak English?

274
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,800
What are you doing?

275
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,634
I answered the phone because
no one else was here

276
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,367
and it looks like he's Japanese.

277
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,066
But I can't speak Japanese...

278
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,433
Give it to me.

279
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,400
Hello?

280
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm sorry, but the person-in-charge
has just left his seat.

281
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:48,933
Yes, I'm very sorry.

282
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,334
Thank you.

283
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,967
What, you're the
Executive Director's PA,

284
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,866
and you can't even do this?

285
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,966
Is it because
you never went to university?

286
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,400
Sis?

287
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,400
Me?

288
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:11,700
I'm doing well.

289
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,100
By the way, you know what?

290
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,233
There are so many
smart people here.

291
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:23,433
We get a lot of calls from
overseas clients,

292
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:27,633
and I'm the only one
who doesn't understand anything.

293
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
No, I'm fine.

294
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,266
You know me. I'm quick to adapt.

295
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,066
I can do this.

296
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,533
Sis?

297
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,500
I better get back.

298
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,600
Bye.

299
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
(Japanese for Beginners)

300
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:12,834
I want you to do 30 pages a day.

301
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,300
I, myself will be
testing you every day.

302
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:16,700
Every day?

303
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,233
How's the weather today?

304
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:31,866
Today's weather is...

305
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,266
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:50,833
Please tell me about
your future goals.

307
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:58,433
My goal is to
be a perfect support to...

308
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:06,366
- I'm sorry.
- Is 'sorry' all you can say?

309
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,433
Learn it off by heart,
and just remember it.

310
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,533
Why can't you do that?

311
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:38,000
(Homework: Remember it,
with all your heart)

312
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:47,367
I'm going to master Japanese

313
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:49,333
and prove him otherwise!

314

(Executive Director Lee
is a big snob)

315
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,667
How's my schedule today?

316
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:06,900
You have a meeting with
the board this morning,

317
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:10,566
and in the afternoon, there's
an economic forum.

318
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:19,766
Here, a present for you.

319
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:21,367
A present?

320
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:24,367
It's your reward for improving
so much in such a short time.

321
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,634
Sometimes you need
carrots to bring me results.

322
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,767
You're the first employee here to
ever receive a present from me,

323
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,500
so you should remember this
honor as long as you can.

324
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:32,800
Yes, sir.

325
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,100
(Chinese for Beginners)

326
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,466
You can do it.

327
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,066
Ms. Kim?

328
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,466
Ms. Kim!

329
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,033
Ms...

330
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,300
I'm sorry, sir.

331
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,167
You stayed up for three nights,
no wonder you're tired.

332
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,400
You should go home.

333
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,100
No, I promised to
sort this data and

334
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,833
send it by tomorrow morning.

335
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
That...

336
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,966
- ...Has been postponed.
- What?

337
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,367
But I heard nothing about that.

338
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,834
I just got the call.

339
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,700
So go home, now.

340
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,367
Yes, Mr. Park.

341
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,567
About the M&A deal with
the department store...

342
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,766
Why not postpone the schedule?

343
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,100
This is a little something to
congratulate you on your promotion.

344
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,433
Please open it, Executive...

345
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,200
I mean, Senior Executive.

346
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:48,233
(Senior Executive Director
Lee Young-joon)

347
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,267
It looks like there isn't
anything you need,

348
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,267
and even if you did, it'll be
something costly.

349
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:58,366
So I tried at least to
show that I cared.

350
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,533
It's not really to my taste.

351
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:09,900
Then please give it back.

352
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:12,100
But then, I'm all about the
process than the results,

353
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,433
so I'll accept it,
seeing your efforts.

354
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,633
Thank you.

355
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,900
Please excuse me then, sir.

356
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:39,400
(Senior Executive Director
Lee Young-joon)

357
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:44,900
I'll wear it for just a week,
since she went to all this effort.

358
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,400
Wow, thank you.

359
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:53,567
I've never received
such a pretty cake in my life.

360
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:54,567
It's really nothing.

361
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,400
Though I did ask
a famous patissier for this.

362
00:28:57,466 --> 00:28:58,933
But it's not like
it was worth a fortune.

363
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,667
Can I take a picture?

364
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:02,966
Of course.

365
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:06,833
Oh my gosh!

366
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,333
Guess it fell.

367
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,400
Oh no.

368
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,700
I'm sorry, sir.

369
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,866
It's alright, it's nothing.

370
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,633
So don't make that face
on your birthday.

371
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:38,800
I thought...

372
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:39,900
It fell very nicely, though.

373
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:42,100
...We'd always be together.

374
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,166
You'll have to get
a new secretary.

375
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,533
Because I'm quitting.

376
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,866
That's when I realized,

377
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:58,566
that I could never let you go.

378
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:01,467
Because...

379
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,366
From the start, it had to be
no one else but you.

380
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:10,133
So...

381
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,766
Please wake up, Mi-so.

382
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,034
What did you say to Mi-so?

383
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,733
What did you say to her that
she fainted like that?

384
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,300
You told her about
that time again, didn't you?

385
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:42,600
How long must you
keep on torturing us

386
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,833
with those stories?

387
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,433
The person who was kidnapped...

388
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:50,666
It wasn't me,

389
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,700
but you, wasn't it?

390
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,266
What?

391
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,200
You...

392
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,500
You remember
everything, don't you?

393
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,966
So it must be true,

394
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:14,033
for you to look that flustered.

395
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,200
Yes, I thought it was strange.

396
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:22,700
Because I didn't
understand it at all.

397
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,133
On why you didn't show
an ounce of guilt,

398
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,466
seeing me suffer so much.

399
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:32,800
It was because it wasn't me,

400
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,266
but you, who was kidnapped.

401
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,000
Are you awake?

402
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:18,933
How are you feeling?

403
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:25,866
Let me get you something to drink.

404
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,167
We'll have to let Ms. Kim Ji-ah

405
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,500
take on more of your work.

406
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,700
Because it seems like
you've been overworking.

407
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,400
Mr. Lee.

408
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,833
You didn't lose
your memories, right?

409
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,766
You were just
pretending to, right?

410
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,666
I don't know
what you're talking about.

411
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:00,700
Sung-hyeon.

412
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,033
I remember everything now.

413
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:16,266
About what happened that day,

414
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,966
and that woman, too.

415
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,966
And now I know.

416
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,333
Why I'd been wanting to
find you all this time.

417
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,433
To thank you.

418
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:50,000
It must've been
tough on you that day too,

419
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,166
so thank you for protecting me.

420
00:33:58,366 --> 00:34:00,600
I guess those are the words
I've been wanting to say.

421
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:18,600
If not me,

422
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,566
who else would've
protected you like that?

423
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,500
It was only possible because
it was me, Lee Young-joon.

424
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:36,866
I was sure I could keep it from you
until the end, but I failed.

425
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't cry.
You need to get some rest.

426
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,433
Do you think I can?

427
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,967
How could you?

428
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:55,533
I mean, why did you keep it
a secret for so long? Why?

429
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,933
I couldn't forget it,
not even for a day.

430
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,100
What happened that day...

431
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
...That sight...

432
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:15,400
...And that sound...

433
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,766
Every time I closed my eyes,

434
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,333
it'd all come back so vividly,
like it had only happened yesterday.

435
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,366
That terrible day...

436
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:40,133
So I was glad that
you didn't remember.

437
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:45,500
There's nothing you can hide
forever in this world.

438
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,100
I know.

439
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,166
Even so, I wanted to,
for as long as I could.

440
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:54,933
Because I didn't want you to
share that pain with me.

441
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:03,933
It would've been better for you to
not remember it, ever.

442
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,133
Don't say that.

443
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,134
If I had felt the
same amount of pain that you did

444
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,567
and shared your load of suffering...

445
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,666
Then I wouldn't be feeling
as bad as I am now.

446
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,900
This person who's so considerate...

447
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:24,666
It's not really you, Mr. Lee.

448
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,467
Why can't you just be

449
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,933
the same egoistic person you are?

450
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,667
Is that a compliment or criticism?

451
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:37,166
Just stick to one.

452
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,933
From now on...

453
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,166
...Don't keep anything from me.
Promise me.

454
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,766
I promise.

455
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,700
Tonight, I'll be by your side.

456
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,266
Just like that day.

457
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,066
Please step out!

458
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:53,266
(DANGER
UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

459
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,466
Was Sung-hyeon really...

460
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:06,366
...Locked up in here?

461
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:11,633
Because I left him there?

462
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,666
It's all because of me?

463
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,000
No.

464
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,967
No, it can't be.

465
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,500
No...

466
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:36,300
Hey! Don't jump
in front of my car like that!

467
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,700
Ma'am.

468
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:58,666
We need you.

469
00:38:59,433 --> 00:39:00,566
What is it?

470
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,000
Sung-yeon...

471
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:13,133
Why did you tell me the truth?

472
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,033
Why did you tell me the truth,
after all this time?

473
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:22,266
Sung-yeon...

474
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,734
It may have been
my fault to start,

475
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,166
but not now.

476
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,966
Why...

477
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,500
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

478
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,033
That my memories aren't true!

479
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm sorry.

480
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:51,567
I really am.

481
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,834
Imagine what he'd have
thought of me.

482
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,834
Imagine what Young-joon would've

483
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,466
thought of me, all this time!

484
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:58,967
No, Sung-yeon.

485
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,400
Young-joon still doesn't know.

486
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:01,567
He lost his memories.

487
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,066
Young-joon never
lost his memories.

488
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,766
What are you...

489
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,866
He remembers everything.

490
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,966
What?

491
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,867
Her BP and pulse are normal.

492
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,400
It was just a temporary anemia,

493
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:52,633
so you don't have to
worry too much, sir.

494
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,866
I see. Thank you.

495
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:11,366
Then the pin...

496
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,300
You said you were off to
talk to the doctor.

497
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:26,233
What took you so long?

498
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:29,033
I bumped into a VIP
and had to escort her.

499
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,500
A VIP?

500
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:33,334
A little girl who
travelled in time from

501
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,333
1994 to 2018.

502
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:37,167
What?

503
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,967
You'll be able to
recognize her right away, too.

504
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:41,833
Because she hasn't
changed one bit.

505
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,200
(Nana's Sweet Home)

506
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,466
Hey, this is Nana's Sweet Home!

507
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,367
We had to fold that business
straight after that incident,

508
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:56,900
so I could only just get one.

509
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,366
And I kept it with me
all this time, just in case.

510
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:01,333
Wow!

511
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:02,866
With that,

512
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,300
have I assured you
that I'm husband material?

513
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,433
Husband material?

514
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:10,266
Just what are you...

515
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,533
Don't you remember?

516
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:17,067
You asked me
if I was rich enough to

517
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,267
buy you Nana's Sweet Home,

518
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,567
then almost forced me to
promise that I'll marry you,

519
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:20,966
leaving me speechless!

520
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:24,000
Did I?

521
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,300
I don't really remember...

522
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,200
Alright, that can happen.

523
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,567
But there I was,
a nine-year-old boy

524
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,067
asking his parents if they can
buy him Nana's Sweet Home.

525
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:35,933
The whole family was shocked!

526
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:38,034
Did he regress back to
infancy after that incident,

527
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,634
or is he having
an identity crisis?'

528
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,334
I troubled them so much to
get this doll,

529
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,467
but it's okay.

530
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,833
Even if you don't remember,
I'll still give it to you.

531
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,366
Thank you.

532
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,134
I really wanted this
when I was little.

533
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,167
She looked so pretty and

534
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:57,800
I thought this dress
with this big ribbon

535
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,300
was so pretty, too...

536
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:02,566
But you don't think
they're pretty now?

537
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:06,700
Just a little.

538
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:12,733
You know what, Mr. Lee?

539
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,200
Doggy chews are usually
made out of cow hide.

540
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:19,834
- Really?
- So if you bury them,

541
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,866
they'll rot and be gone
without a trace.

542
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:28,233
Big Bang's chew toys are probably
gone without a trace, too.

543
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,767
And just like Big Bang's chew toys

544
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:36,066
memories too,
can disappear without a trace.

545
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,400
So why don't we...

546
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:44,800
...Bury those unpleasant memories
deep down?

547
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:14,633
I'm glad you're the boy
I'd been searching for, Mr. Lee.

548
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:18,100
I'm glad, too.

549
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:20,366
To meet you again, Mi-so.

550
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:24,800
I'd been dying to
make myself obvious.

551
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:32,433
(Hospital)

552
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm really alright!

553
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:35,933
I'm telling you, I'm fine!

554
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:37,900
Still, no. You have to.

555
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:43,434
A full check-up for
just passing out briefly?

556
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Passing out even briefly means
you're not all that well.

557
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,767
So listen to me.

558
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,633
I can't. I need to go into work.

559
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,834
Just take a day off.

560
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,834
I can't.

561
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,266
I have tons to get through today.

562
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,700
I have to admit, I valued your
sense of responsibility

563
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:00,466
and passion for these
past 9 years.

564
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,900
But from on, no.

565
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,833
Because you're now my woman.

566
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,766
My woman...

567
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,034
Can you see me cringing?

568
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,134
What are you going to
do about that?

569
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,167
Good.

570
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:18,700
It'll be hard to work
with those hands,

571
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:20,833
so it's been decided,
you'll take a day off!

572
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,000
- What?
- I'll just go to that board meeting,

573
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:25,934
so tell me if anything's up.

574
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,666
You can still call me,
even if nothing's up.

575
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,867
The Yumyung Department Store
that's due to open in

576
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:42,634
Dongseong-ro, Daegu next week...

577
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,900
The opening event is
creative enough,

578
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:47,734
and since we'll be launching
a brand that hasn't been

579
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,200
introduced in Korea,
it'll draw enough attention.

580
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,367
And we have Daegu's
biggest kids' cafe coming in,

581
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:54,600
so the marketing team
could highlight that, too.

582
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:58,433
I say this would be
a successful opening.

583
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,300
Yes, I agree with you, sir.

584
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:04,666
Then why don't we
wrap up for today?

585
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,400
What, it's already over?

586
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:12,867
I thought it'd take forever,

587
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,100
with him picking at each detail.

588
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,500
What's gotten into him?

589
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:19,966
Please excuse me, then.

590
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:24,434
What, are you in a rush?

591
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,434
No, no.

592
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,800
Then why wrap that up so quick?

593
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:30,967
That was for me, wasn't it?

594
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:32,266
You thought I wouldn't be
in the mood for this.

595
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,133
Though I was acting like
I was fine... Guess you noticed.

596
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:39,900
See, it's been
pretty hard for me lately.

597
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,334
I still can't get that
image out of my head,

598
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,166
of my ex-wife with her new...

599
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:48,400
But I decided to
just forget all about it.

600
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:50,533
I need to forget her, yes.

601
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:54,466
Well, buddy, you're the
only one who ever thinks of...

602
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,666
He's gone.

603
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,866
What, he went that far already?

604
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,933
Is he a track athlete?

605
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,100
Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

606
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,300
I'm heading out now,

607
00:47:10,366 --> 00:47:11,800
so cancel all my afternoon...

608
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:19,767
What's this?

609
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:20,767
I hope I'm not seeing things

610
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,433
just because I miss
someone dearly.

611
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:26,467
I thought I told you
not to come into work.

612
00:47:26,533 --> 00:47:29,200
And I'm sure I told you
I'm not that sick.

613
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:31,134
Besides, isn't it
special treatment to

614
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,467
get a special holiday for
a full health check when I'm fine?

615
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:34,100
What's wrong with
special treatment?

616
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,600
Why do you hate it
so much, anyway?

617
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:38,067
What, did it ever drive
your family to bankruptcy?

618
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:41,600
My family's never been wealthy
enough to go bankrupt, sir.

619
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,067
Don't laugh.

620
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,666
I'm not liking this, Ms. Kim.

621
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,567
What is it?

622
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:55,034
What's Mr. Lee not liking?

623
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,366
It's nothing.

624
00:47:57,233 --> 00:48:01,534
So even you don't know
all your mistakes.

625
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,100
Well, I say
Mr. Lee's just too sensitive.

626
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,500
Yes, you can put up with
your boss being a perfectionist,

627
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:09,600
but if my boyfriend was like that,
it'd be so tiring.

628
00:48:10,866 --> 00:48:12,966
Is that why
he can't be in a relationship?

629
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:14,966
Sorry?

630
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,234
I hear that Mr. Lee has

631
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,866
never been in
a proper relationship.

632
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,067
But then again, who could
ever put up with him?

633
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:25,733
When he's so sensitive and
so full of himself!

634
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,833
Guys who are so full of themselves
are such a turn-off...

635
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,000
W-what is it, Ms. Kim?

636
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,000
Sorry?

637
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,766
Well, uh...

638
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,366
By the way, are you done
writing up this week's report?

639
00:48:46,266 --> 00:48:47,500
No, not yet...

640
00:48:47,566 --> 00:48:48,500
What about the schedule sheet?

641
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:50,300
And the list of overseas
travels for the second half?

642
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:52,067
I'll do them now.

643
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:53,767
Yes, please do them now.

644
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,134
Guys who are so full of themselves
are a turn-off, yes,

645
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,833
but so are girls who
don't do their work on time.

646
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:00,866
Yes...

647
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:10,200
If Ms. Kim collapses again,

648
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,533
I don't think I'll be
able to live...

649
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,967
But that would be such a big loss,

650
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,500
for this country and this world!

651
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,934
I mean, look!

652
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,733
She's that tired!

653
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:26,766
How can I make her take a break?

654
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,734
Come on, brain,
which is as sexy as my body.

655
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,367
Are you listening?

656
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:33,700
Yes, I'm listening.

657
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,400
It's listening.

658
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:40,967
I know you already work three
times more than others,

659
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:44,033
but how about work harder
for some ideas?

660
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,100
Is it delicious?

661
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:06,867
Mr. Park.

662
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,600
Is the board meeting
already over?

663
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,000
It must be, because I'm here.

664
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:14,134
Oh, could you heat up
my supplement I brought?

665
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,334
Yes, I'll heat it up,
exactly for 2 min and 30 seconds.

666
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,933
Thanks.

667
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:22,033
Oh. This stuff is supposed to be...

668
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:24,167
...Very good for rejuvenating,
so it's very pricey.

669
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,500
So don't spill a single drop!

670
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,533
Yes, don't worry.

671
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:40,800
Ah, no wonder it has
a big price tag. Because...

672
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,500
...I can feel it working!

673
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:46,200
Alright, let's cheer up,
Park Yu-sik.

674
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:49,066
Let's forget it all
and start anew!

675
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,234
I'm so sorry, Mr. Park.

676
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,934
Why? What have you done this time?

677
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,266
Well...

678
00:51:01,866 --> 00:51:03,633
I drank...

679
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:05,367
...Your supplement.

680
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:06,600
What?

681
00:51:07,433 --> 00:51:08,567
Then what's this?

682
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:11,100
That's for my diet.

683
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:18,333
Lose weight! Reduce your appetite!

684
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:25,334
Do you think they have
anything for

685
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,900
suppressing your rage
and frustration?

686
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:28,200
I don't think so...

687
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:29,400
Really?

688
00:51:29,466 --> 00:51:33,033
Because that's the stuff
I really need right now!

689
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,866
(Mr. Park's acquaintance,
Choi Seo-jin's birthday)

690
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,633
Mr. Park, I'm sorry
but who's Ms. Seo-jin?

691
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:48,000
I've seen this name somewhere...

692
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,400
Why do you ask?

693
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:52,600
I just got a reminder that
it's her birthday.

694
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,834
It says she's your acquaintance.

695
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,666
Should I send her a bouquet?

696
00:51:58,433 --> 00:51:59,867
No, you don't have to.

697
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:02,300
Really? But she must be
someone important,

698
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:04,267
because I even set a reminder.

699
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:07,466
She was someone
important in the past.

700
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,700
She's my ex-wife.

701
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:13,033
Oh...

702
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:15,733
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

703
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,434
No need to be.

704
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,867
It's alright, don't mind it.

705
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:21,900
If you still have
feelings for her,

706
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:23,734
why not send her flowers...

707
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,233
Still have feelings for her?

708
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,367
But you saw, Ms. Seol.

709
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:29,433
That she has a boyfriend now.

710
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,766
I'm sure he'll take
good care of her.

711
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,600
Go back to your work, then.

712
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,233
Yes, sir.

713
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,434
A hotel spa?

714
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,367
Yes, with everyone in the team.

715
00:52:59,433 --> 00:53:00,967
Please go for a spa.

716
00:53:01,033 --> 00:53:02,700
Yes, sir.

717
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,400
But, uh...
We're still in working hours.

718
00:53:04,466 --> 00:53:06,066
This is also part of work.

719
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,700
I need some feedback for our

720
00:53:07,766 --> 00:53:09,400
Illusion Hotel's spa that was
recently renovated.

721
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:10,900
So please experience it
for yourselves,

722
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:12,766
because I want a proper feedback.

723
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:14,900
Yes, sir.

724
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:18,400
Then I'll take everyone but
leave Ms. Kim Mi-so behind

725
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:20,034
to support you in your duties.

726
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,800
I thought I just told you,
everyone in the team.

727
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:27,967
That includes Ms. Kim Mi-so.

728
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:29,900
Yes, sir.

729
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:33,833
Then I'll take Ms. Kim Mi-so too,
and we'll head off right away.

730
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,100
That's the end of the
whole-body care session.

731
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,367
Let me now get your
clay masks ready.

732
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:51,900
Thank you.

733
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,834
It's my first time at a hotel spa.

734
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,066
Our skins are going to
glow after this!

735
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:05,134
I don't need this,
I already have honey skin.

736
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,434
See, whenever my crush sees me,

737
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,266
his eyes just drip with honey.

738
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:10,800
"Crush?"

739
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:12,434
Are you seeing someone?

740
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,134
Yes.

741
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,234
He's a superhero
who comes to my rescue,

742
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,300
every time I'm in distress.

743
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:21,967
That's a turn off for me,

744
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:24,100
because it feels like
he's treating me like a child.

745
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,766
Ms. Kim, what's your
ideal type of guy?

746
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:30,000
Well, uh...

747
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:34,500
Someone who's considerate,

748
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,467
and has a warm heart.

749
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:39,800
Oh, so it's...

750
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:42,200
...The complete opposite of
Mr. Lee, is it?

751
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:48,966
Why? Mr. Lee is also
considerate and has...

752
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:50,766
...A warm heart?

753
00:54:51,466 --> 00:54:52,733
Hold on.

754
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:55,200
(Mr. Lee)

755
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,766
Ms. Kim, having a good time?

756
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,767
It's all thanks to you, sir.

757
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:08,000
I'll make sure to
pay extra attention

758
00:55:08,066 --> 00:55:10,066
so I can give proper
feedback to the hotel.

759
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,234
No need to do that,

760
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:12,267
(Mr. Lee)

761
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,834
just let it all down and rest.

762
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,034
(just let it all down and rest)

763
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,500
(I sent you there
so you can have a good rest)

764
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,334
I sent you there
so you can have a good rest.

765
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,567
You say it'll be special treatment
if I send just you,

766
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:20,733
but this is special treatment
for the whole team, right?

767
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,766
(Thank you)

768
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,700
Thank you.

769
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:44,600
Tsk.

770
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:46,700
I didn't see that attack coming.

771
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,600
She could've just
sent an empty heart,

772
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,600
but instead, she had to
send me a full one.

773
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:58,133
Does that mean her heart's
full of me, like this heart?

774
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:09,700
Well, since I'm a generous guy,
I'll send you two.

775
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:17,700
Ms. Kim, who are you
so busy texting?

776
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:19,933
Oh, it's nothing.

777
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:22,234
Whatever.

778
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,666
I just had a look,

779
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,934
and I think it's Mr. Lee.

780
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,467
Oh my God.

781
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:28,767
He's making you work again?

782
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:32,134
He's so cruel. Can't he let you
rest at a time like this?

783
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,500
See?

784
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:36,166
He's not considerate and
warm-hearted at all.

785
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:51,133
Mmm, delicious!

786
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:56,566
Steak is so delicious
even when you're on your own.

787
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:08,734
What's this?

788
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,900
You love their steak so much

789
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:13,666
that you'd always come here for
our wedding anniversary.

790
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:15,400
I made a steak cake for you,

791
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,600
so you can eat
all the steak you want!

792
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,334
Incredible!

793
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,266
Come on. Blow the candle
and make a wish.

794
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:43,834
Is it because of that
appetite-reducing diet drink?

795
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,500
Because I really have
no appetite now.

796
00:57:47,066 --> 00:57:49,866
Why did I come here,
all by myself?

797
00:57:57,133 --> 00:57:58,333
Seo-jin?

798
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,333
Yu-sik...

799
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:04,466
So we meet here.

800
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:10,600
Actually, I came here because

801
00:58:10,666 --> 00:58:13,466
I thought maybe,
I'd be able to see you...

802
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:23,500
You're so cruel.

803
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,067
- What?
- Yes, fine.

804
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:29,767
We got a divorce, so I understand
if you're seeing other guys.

805
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:33,300
But don't bring him here!

806
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:35,600
This is a place we used to
come together every year,

807
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,334
so it's not manners for me
or for your new boyfriend,

808
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,866
is it now?

809
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,267
He's not my boyfriend.

810
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,133
Then what? Then is he...

811
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:47,800
...What, our husband?

812
00:58:47,866 --> 00:58:49,967
What, you got married already?

813
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:51,400
Without telling me?

814
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,566
- He's my cousin.
- Whatever, he's...

815
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,233
...Your cousin?

816
00:59:04,266 --> 00:59:06,166
Hello, cousin.

817
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,500
Yes, hello.
Let me just use the bathroom.

818
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:13,333
Ah, sure.

819
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,334
Why attack me like that
when you know nothing?

820
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Why are you so rash?

821
00:59:30,566 --> 00:59:32,200
Rash...

822
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:38,000
I bet you didn't know,
but today's my birthday.

823
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,466
Thanks for making this
the best birthday ever.

824
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,533
Uh, Seo-jin? Seo...

825
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,500
I knew that it was your birthday.

826
00:59:58,566 --> 01:00:00,566
That's why I came here.

827
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,966
(Yumyung Land Guide Map)

828
01:00:14,966 --> 01:00:17,333
Why are you looking at the
map of Yumyung Land?

829
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,167
I'm sure there's a reason for
you to be doing that.

830
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,333
Or was I being too rash
in asking you?

831
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,634
If I was, I'm so sorry.

832
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,634
No need to apologize.

833
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,467
Yes, well...
Now that I think about it,

834
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,467
it wasn't something to
apologize about.

835
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:36,066
I guess I was too rash.

836
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,900
What's with your "rash?"

837
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,300
I bumped into my ex-wife just now,

838
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,233
and she told me I was too rash.

839
01:00:46,766 --> 01:00:49,834
Fine, I was too rash, yes.

840
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,700
What's this about?

841
01:00:51,766 --> 01:00:52,900
I thought
you decided to forget her.

842
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:55,000
Yes, I decided to forget her,

843
01:00:55,066 --> 01:00:57,133
but I just had to
bump into her right there...

844
01:00:58,966 --> 01:01:00,734
Actually, no.

845
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,366
I was too "rash" to
go there in the first place.

846
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,500
Mr. CEO?

847
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:10,233
Don't you ever break up
with Ms. Kim.

848
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:14,133
Because break-ups hurt.

849
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,467
Oh, there I go again,
giving you advice.

850
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:21,100
I guess I was too rash.

851
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,800
Too rash!

852
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,134
Mr. CEO?

853
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,867
How about a drink tonight?

854
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,633
There's somewhere
I need to go tonight.

855
01:01:30,933 --> 01:01:32,500
With Ms. Kim?

856
01:01:33,366 --> 01:01:35,033
Alright. Is it me, or Ms. Kim?

857
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:38,666
What are you trying here?

858
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:41,866
Come on, have a drink with me!

859
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,633
I don't want to be alone!

860
01:01:47,233 --> 01:01:48,534
Yes.

861
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,533
I guess I can't leave you alone.

862
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:54,233
So you really chose
me over Ms. Kim?

863
01:01:54,566 --> 01:01:55,567
I can't do that either.

864
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:58,500
Looks like there hasn't been
progress on that airline M&A,

865
01:01:58,566 --> 01:02:01,933
so why not have a meeting with
them to see how it's going?

866
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,367
What, you're making me work?

867
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:06,367
You said you don't
want to be alone.

868
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:08,400
Well, I'd rather be alone
than do work, alright?

869
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:14,434
Ha, so I said something
unnecessary, did I?

870
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,700
Well, I was too rash. Too rash!

871
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:20,133
So call me Mr. Park Rash,
not Mr. Park Yu-sik from now on.

872
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:22,300
Mr. Park Rash?

873
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:26,600
Goodbye.

874
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:37,033
I was too rash. Too rash!

875
01:02:38,366 --> 01:02:39,300
So soft!

876
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:40,400
Hello, sir.

877
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:41,766
Yes, yes.

878
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:44,334
After that spa session,

879
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,734
I feel so rejuvenated
and so great!

880
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,467
And stepping out of the office
just got me so high!

881
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:50,767
I don't think I can
go back to work like this,

882
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,866
so how great would it be if
we could all go home now?

883
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:54,766
Then why don't you?

884
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:58,167
I'm sorry, sir.
I said something unnecessary...

885
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,534
No need to apologize
or be flustered.

886
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,267
Because that's what
I had been thinking too,

887
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,533
before you mentioned it, Ms. Bong.

888
01:03:05,033 --> 01:03:07,833
Then see you tomorrow,
and have a good rest.

889
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:10,700
No, sir!

890
01:03:10,766 --> 01:03:13,634
We already wasted a day
at the spa,

891
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,067
so let us work harder

892
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:18,634
now that we're rejuvenated,
thanks to you, sir!

893
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,567
It's alright, you may go home.

894
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:21,634
You need days like this

895
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,534
for you to be
more motivated at work.

896
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,200
We'll raise that motivation now.

897
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,234
Just...

898
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,933
...Raise it tomorrow.

899
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,733
Then... Shall we?

900
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,600
Alright, then. For Mr. Lee,
who did so much for us to

901
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:41,366
encourage us on our job...

902
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:44,100
It's alright.

903
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:46,034
If you start clapping for
every trivial thing like this,

904
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,100
you'll wear your hands out.

905
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,800
See you everyone,

906
01:03:50,866 --> 01:03:53,200
but Ms. Kim, you stay behind,
I need to talk to you.

907
01:03:54,033 --> 01:03:55,400
Yes, sir.

908
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,667
Goodbye, then.

909
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:02,000
- Goodbye, sir.
- See you tomorrow.

910
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:04,033
- Thank you everyone.
- Thank you!

911
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:12,934
No misunderstandings, Ms. Kim.

912
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,300
This wasn't
special treatment either,

913
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:16,566
because I sent
everyone home early.

914
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,667
Once is fine but don't do this
from now on.

915
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:21,466
Because I'm really fine.

916
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,300
So how are you feeling?

917
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,267
Better, thanks to you.

918
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:29,167
Then come with me.

919
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,666
To where?

920
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:40,534
Mr. Yang, you may
go home for today.

921
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,466
There's somewhere I need to
go with Ms. Kim.

922
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:48,167
Everyone else has
gone home early today, too.

923
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:49,766
Oh, I see.

924
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,200
Then take care.

925
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,933
That means everyone else has
already gone home.

926
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
Does that mean Ms. Bong, too?

927
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:18,066
So why did you bring me here,
all of a sudden?

928
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,166
I wanted to show you.

929
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,600
It was right here.

930
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:35,966
That house.

931
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,666
The place where
we were locked up inside.

932
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,300
How did you...

933
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:47,134
I suddenly had
the urge to find out,

934
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,734
so I compared the
satellite photos,

935
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,333
old maps, and even
Yumyung Land's blueprint.

936
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:57,400
And it was right here.

937
01:05:58,133 --> 01:05:59,600
This carousel.

938
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,333
And do you know what the first
thing that came into mind?

939
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,033
'Thank goodness.'

940
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:14,700
Because thanks to all the
happy people on this carousel

941
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:19,033
may just be able to

942
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,200
cover up those horrible memories.

943
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,634
You're right.

944
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,533
Instead of painful memories,

945
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:32,433
this place will now be
full of happy ones.

946
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,000
And there's one more place
I wanted to show you.

947
01:06:54,433 --> 01:06:55,667
Why here?

948
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:57,700
Do you want to throw coins
and make a wish?

949
01:06:58,866 --> 01:07:01,234
Your wish already
came true, didn't it?

950
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:05,566
You already found that boy
you were searching for.

951
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,300
You're right.

952
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,467
You were curious, right?

953
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:12,033
About where your
old place used to be.

954
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:14,633
Then...

955
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:17,866
Yes, it's right here.

956
01:07:21,433 --> 01:07:22,933
Really?

957
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,100
Wow, I can't believe this.

958
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:28,300
That this is where
our house used to be...

959
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:33,267
Thank goodness that

960
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:35,400
it's not a public toilet
or a haunted house

961
01:07:35,466 --> 01:07:37,333
like you said last time.

962
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,667
You probably have no idea,

963
01:07:44,733 --> 01:07:46,500
about what it means to me to

964
01:07:46,566 --> 01:07:49,767
talk about what had happened then

965
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:51,800
like it was nothing, like this.

966
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,866
We're going to be
happy from now on.

967
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:12,066
Because we'll be together.

968
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,066
I had fun tonight, Mr. Lee.

969
01:08:33,433 --> 01:08:34,600
I know.

970
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:37,566
How can you not have fun
when you're with me?

971
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:41,467
So refrain from making
such obvious comments.

972
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:43,833
Because you'll only
tire your lips.

973
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:48,166
Thanks for
your kind consideration.

974
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,900
Then I should get going.

975
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,534
Ms. Kim?

976
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,000
Yes?

977
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:11,100
It's nice out today and I'm sure
you want to go for a walk with me.

978
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:13,266
How about I grant
that wish for you?

979
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:19,533
It'll be my honor.

980
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:39,800
Guess it's your first time with
that ice cream. How is it?

981
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:44,200
Though it's just frozen ice with
sugar and food coloring,

982
01:09:44,266 --> 01:09:46,066
it's not all that bad.

983
01:09:46,866 --> 01:09:50,933
Though the taste of rubber
ruins it from time to time.

984
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:57,900
Ms. Kim?

985
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,666
Why not come to
my place this evening?

986
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,666
Just what...

987
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:07,366
I don't want to
leave you alone tonight.

988
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,466
I suffered from PTSD for
a long time after that.

989
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,266
I couldn't even sleep, because the
image of that woman would surface.

990
01:10:19,733 --> 01:10:21,933
When I finally did,
I'd be plagued by nightmares.

991
01:10:22,866 --> 01:10:23,900
I'm worried that

992
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:26,200
you'll also be plagued by
nightmares, like me.

993
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:30,500
So I don't want to
leave you alone tonight.

994
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,733
Thank you.

995
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,000
But I'm fine.

996
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:47,500
To be honest with you,
I don't remember much.

997
01:10:47,566 --> 01:10:49,166
After all, I was very young.

998
01:10:51,066 --> 01:10:54,834
For me, it's just

999
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,500
'I saw a dead person and
thought she was a scary spider.'

1000
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,900
It's not all that painful for me.

1001
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:07,333
But if it gets too hard,
then I'll let you know.

1002
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,566
And when that time comes...

1003
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,500
...You'll protect me,
like then, right?

1004
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:18,100
Of course. I'll protect you.

1005
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,700
So call me, if it starts to get
scary, even just a little.

1006
01:11:23,266 --> 01:11:25,900
Because I'll be waiting
all night for that call.

1007
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:51,433
(Every Moment Was You)

1008
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:06,533
Every moment was you.

1009
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:13,466
Even when I was in love,

1010
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:17,666
even when I was in pain,

1011
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:20,866
and even as we said our farewells...

1012
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:24,566
You were my world,

1013
01:12:26,066 --> 01:12:27,833
and my every moment.

1014
01:12:30,766 --> 01:12:32,733
Without you now,

1015
01:12:35,266 --> 01:12:39,733
I won't be able to
describe my life until now.

1016
01:13:50,933 --> 01:13:52,366
Who is it?

1017
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,600
Who is it?

1018
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,266
It's me.

1019
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,766
Mr. Lee?

1020
01:14:04,766 --> 01:14:06,634
Why did you come...

1021
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,100
Because you said
you didn't want to.

1022
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,100
Sorry?

1023
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,967
Because you said you didn't
want to come to my place,

1024
01:14:11,033 --> 01:14:13,400
I thought I'd come here
and sleep over.

1025
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,800
Let's sleep together tonight.

1026
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:29,366
(Thank you to Ms. Son Sung-yoon for
her special appearance)

1027
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:51,733
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

1028
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:53,967
After a glass of wine
out in the open air...

1029
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:55,700
Oh, but I would need
a wine opener for the wine.

1030
01:14:55,766 --> 01:14:57,100
Hold on.

1031
01:14:58,233 --> 01:14:59,134
You know something, Ms. Kim?

1032
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,100
- Sorry?
- That wine's worth $20,000.

1033
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:05,133
You look uncomfortable...

1034
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:08,934
That incident left me
traumatized, more than I thought.

1035
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,100
But when I thought about how

1036
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:13,800
you may have felt the same fear
as I did...

1037
01:15:13,866 --> 01:15:15,300
I stayed up all night.

1038
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,266
Ms. Kim.

1039
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:20,033
I'm not sure I can
retrain myself tonight.
