(A legendary secretary)

00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,186
(Brother)

00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,733
(Friends)

(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,820
Oh, that's right.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,520
If it's for victory,

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,286
you'd be willing to
cling onto a complete stranger

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,020
any time, huh?

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,086
Of course!

12
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,253
Better than being a loser.

13
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,253
Oh, I see!

14
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,453
So you don't care about

15
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,920
getting all touchy with someone,
if you can win, huh?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,166
No.

17
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,286
Even if it's this close?

18
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:52,900
Of course.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,720
Or this close?

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,366
I really don't mind.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
What about now?

22
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:28,866
Let me get the ice pack.

23
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,500
Ha...

24
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,933
Oh what? He fell asleep?

25
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,833
Hey, there.

26
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,933
Will you help me?

27
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,853
Come on.

28
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,366
Come here.

29
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,986
- Don't do this to me!
- Mr. Lee?

30
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,266
Mr. Lee!

31
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,133
Are you alright?

32
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,133
Have some tea.

33
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,333
Have you calmed down?

34
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,466
Yes, thanks to you.

35
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,666
Do you have nightmares often?

36
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,000
Well...

37
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,466
But I don't want to be
alone tonight.

38
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,066
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:10,200
Can't you stay the night,
just for tonight?

40
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,266
Sorry?

41
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,500
Stay the night. Here.

42
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:24,133
Huh? Just what do you...

43
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:32,386
Yes, I know how scary it is
after a nightmare,

44
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,533
but you're not a child anymore.
You can't just...

45
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:38,666
Really?

46
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,853
I meant the guestroom, and I asked
because it was late already.

47
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:46,920
So why...

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,486
...Are you all flustered?

49
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,766
Sorry?

50
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:55,953
You used to stay the night here
often after working late.

51
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:59,800
Ah, yes. You're right.

52
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,220
What were you expecting?

53
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,600
Expecting?
I wasn't expecting anything.

54
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,200
Hmmm.

55
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:24,933
Hello?

56
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,766
Fine.

57
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,053
Unfortunately,

58
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,153
I can't have you stay the night here
after all.

59
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,986
Sorry to disappoint you.

60
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,086
Disappoint?

61
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,853
I had no plans to
stay the night in the first place!

62
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,286
Well, it looks like
you're all better, sir,

63
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:52,320
so let me head off for tonight.

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,666
If you'll excuse me.

65
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,953
I wonder who it was on the phone.

66
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,866
He didn't look happy.

67
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,133
(Episode 4)

68
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,520
Oh my goodness!

69
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,900
Oops, I'm so sorry.

70
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,686
You should've been more careful.

71
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,586
Looks like nothing's broken.

72
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,933
Never mind that.

73
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,833
It's alright.

74
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,053
You'll trip like that.

75
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:38,500
I can do it.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,220
Thank you.

77
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,520
Oh, here.

78
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,033
Thanks. Then goodbye.

79
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,986
What a sweet person.

80
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,700
Unlike someone, that is.

81
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,800
You're not even going to
ask me to sit down?

82
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,453
What brings you here,
at this hour?

83
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,133
Do I need a reason to
come see you, brother?

84
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,753
My new book's coming out
next month, so I'm back.

85
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,986
I came without calling,

86
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,153
and it turns out Mother and
Father are in Jeju Island.

87
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,020
I didn't want to
return to an empty house,

88
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,733
so I dropped by to say hello.

89
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,453
Actually, I...

90
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,900
I came here to forgive you.

91
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,220
To be honest with you,
the memories still surface

92
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,186
But it only tormented me to

93
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,720
blame you and hate you for it.

94
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,033
So I thought I should
just try and forgive you.

95
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:05,253
Should we have a drink together?

96
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,753
There were three things that
kept me preoccupied in France.

97
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,953
Writing, women, and wine.

98
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,066
Can you leave already?

99
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,233
- What?
- I'm too tired.

100
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,620
I got rid of it, sir.

101
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,886
Are you alright?

102
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,033
Who was it?

103
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,420
I must've been too busy
and made a mistake.

104
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,733
I'm sorry, sir.

105
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,600
I got rid of them all.

106
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,766
Are you alright, sir?

107
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,186
Ms. Kim Mi-so.

108
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:26,620
Yes.

109
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,786
You said spiders scare you the
most in this world, right?

110
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,433
Ah... Yes, sir.

111
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:36,120
To me, it's the cable ties.

112
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,586
So from now on,

113
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,853
don't use them.

114
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,753
Please.

115
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,700
Oh... Yes, sir.

116
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,286
The day when my perfect boss

117
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,166
came to me like a normal person,
just like me.

118
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,120
Ouch, it stings.

119
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,866
Oh man.

120
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:19,200
Did I tie it too tight
during the race?

121
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,566
Don't say you're fine, when...

122
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,820
What was that scar
around his ankle?

123
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,920
I wonder what had happened...

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,333
To Mr. Lee.

125
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,420
Is your ankle alright?

126
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,786
I didn't want you to
push yourself,

127
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:00,553
so I cancelled all your
visits for this week.

128
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:04,120
I also asked Ms. Shin to have
the ice pack ready in the morning.

129
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,686
I'll leave you to rest, then.

130
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,853
Her and her nagging...

131
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,400
How very tiring.

132
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:27,753
Ah, Ms. Kim!
I'm so sorry I'm late.

133
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,720
It's alright.

134
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
But be here early from tomorrow.

135
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,920
I will.

136
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,420
By the way,
Is Mr. Lee's ankle alright?

137
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,720
It's nothing serious,

138
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,520
but I cancelled the appointments
so he can get some rest.

139
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,453
Please re-schedule them later.

140
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,900
Alright. Let me do it.

141
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,420
Oh man...

142
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,753
We'll have to tell him quick.

143
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,953
Ugh, just be quiet!

144
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,920
Hey, but this is
an emergency situation.

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,920
What's going on?

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,586
Well... It's about that
UK Group's Art Center.

147
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,586
They've advanced their
opening date to early August!

148
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,053
What?

149
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,253
Why, what about it?

150
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,633
Can't they?

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,820
You really know nothing.

152
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,786
Our Art Center's due to
open on August 20!

153
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,120
They did this on purpose.

154
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,320
We need to open first,

155
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,820
in order to draw the attention.

156
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,320
This has been on
Mr. Lee's mind too,

157
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,886
because our opening dates were
so close...

158
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:19,820
Before Mr. Lee is here,

159
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,433
- we need to come up with a...
- We've just one option.

160
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:24,766
Good morning, sir.

161
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,520
We push forward
our opening date, too.

162
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,820
To July.

163
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,186
July means... Next month.

164
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,700
That's just a few days away!

165
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,053
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,533
- We'll do the preparations.
- What?

167
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,153
- Here, from the Planning Team.
- Director?

168
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes, this is
the Vice President's office.

169
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,453
Mr. Lee's headed for
the Art Center now.

170
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,720
He wants to push the opening date
forward to July.

171
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm currently printing off the
current progress report.

172
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Get them ready so he can
look them over on his way.

173
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,220
Would advancing the date to
next month be a problem?

174
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,920
Unfortunately,
our main outdoor piece,

175
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,353
the wire mesh 3D art,
is yet to be completed.

176
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,453
It takes time to ship it
and install it...

177
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,920
To save time, ship it unassembled

178
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,186
and provide full support to
our artist.

179
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,366
Alright.

180
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,220
The concert hall
will be fine, will it?

181
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,533
Unfortunately...

182
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,453
Then what about the library?

183
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,120
Alright with
the date for next month?

184
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,586
- Well...
- Don't tell me.

185
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,853
More disappointments?

186
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:36,753
I'm sorry, sir.

187
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,620
The copyright matter is
yet to be settled for

188
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,666
our movies and other
video material systems...

189
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,753
It should be fine as long as
we don't hold screenings.

190
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,886
I say hold screening events for
the films where

191
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,720
copyright issues
have been solved, first.

192
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,286
- Hmmm...
- Ah...

193
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,553
I understand the sudden change
in our schedule surprised you,

194
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:55,920
but please do all you can
so all goes smooth.

195
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,320
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,720
Then why don't we take
a look at the library?

197
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,833
Yes, sir.

198
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,386
Very well-made, isn't it?

199
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,866
I'd like to
read books here all day.

200
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,353
Then it's a success.

201
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,100
That was our very goal for
this place.

202
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,166
Oh my goodness!

203
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,766
Let me go see what's going on.

204
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,186
Yes, Director.

205
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,953
What? A complete blackout?

206
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,653
No, no need to head over here.

207
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,120
Please get it up and
running again.

208
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,186
Alright.

209
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:44,586
Ha... A blackout?
Something basic like that

210
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,500
should already have been
set up perfectly!

211
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,553
Argh!

212
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:55,453
You scared me, Ms. Kim!

213
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,820
Sorry, I was trying to
get some light for you.

214
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,553
Instead of making me mad?

215
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:00,786
Never, sir.

216
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:05,033
But that expression just now was
really cute.

217
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:20,386
Ms. Kim.

218
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:23,786
I'm not "cute." I'm sexy.

219
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,086
Oh, my mistake.

220
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,833
Then this way, sir.

221
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,033
Um...

222
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:31,386
Hey!

223
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,866
This is my favorite book.

224
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,300
(Every Moment Was You)

225
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:41,400
This book has all the
romance I've dreamed of.

226
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,633
This is my favorite part.

227
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,520
'This is the romance I want.

228
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,586
A romance where,
even if he won't make your

229
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,986
heart skip a beat every second,

230
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:46,553
just one embrace from him

231
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,200
will wash all the
exhaustion from that day.'

232
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,666
Isn't that nice?

233
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:06,920
How childish.

234
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,453
To wash away all the
exhaustion from the day,

235
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,886
all I need is
my high-technology shower

236
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,233
equipped with anion, vitamins
and sterilization functions!

237
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:15,866
It's not that "washing away"
this is talking about.

238
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:20,920
You may think this is childish,

239
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,866
but this is my definition of love.

240
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,153
Ms. Kim, have I ever told you that
you're actually quite pretty?

241
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,433
Sorry?

242
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:52,600
No.

243
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,686
Yes, well... Of course not, I guess.

244
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:59,733
Because I never thought so.

245
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,386
Looks like it'll be some time
before they get it up again.

246
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:14,820
Ah, let me call them again.

247
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,486
No need. Let's just go.

248
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,453
It feels a bit stuffy in here.

249
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,800
Yes, sir.

250
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,886
Uh... Mr. Lee?

251
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,933
The exit's that way.

252
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,386
Ms. Kim.

253
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,686
You don't know
how buildings work, do you?

254
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,453
The exit is this way.

255
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,133
Um... Fine.

256
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,000
Hmpf!

257
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:11,653
Mr. Lee?

258
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,220
Instead of relying on
your logic on buildings,

259
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,853
why not just trust the
words of someone

260
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,886
who's been here several times?

261
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:21,100
The exit is, as I said, is that way!

262
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,020
Hahaha!

263
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,120
No wonder he's the world-class
architect I picked myself!

264
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,700
A very innovative design, that
breaks free from the norm.

265
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:35,486
Yes, sir.

266
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:38,020
I'll make sure to emphasize that
in our marketing material.

267
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,733
Then this way, sir.

268
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,553
Ms. Kim, are you wearing perfume?

269
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,986
No, I don't wear perfume.

270
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:57,153
But I smell
a citrus fragrance on you.

271
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,886
Oh, if you're talking about citrus,

272
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:00,720
then it's probably my shampoo.

273
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,820
The supermarket always has
Buy 1 Get 1 Free event,

274
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,633
so this is the only shampoo I use.

275
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,200
Buy 1 Get 1 Free, huh?

276
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,833
Ms. Kim, did you
always walk this fast?

277
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:16,886
It's become a habit,

278
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:18,720
after trying to
keep up with you, sir.

279
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,253
Well, my stride is
twice the distance of others.

280
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,886
You must've had
a hard time catching up.

281
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,766
I've become
fully accustomed to it.

282
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,820
But why did I never notice
how fast you walk?

283
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,786
They say darkness
heightens your senses,

284
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,800
and makes you notice things
you weren't able to before.

285
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:42,453
Come on, keep up with me.

286
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:44,333
You don't want to
trip over, do you?

287
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,833
You were right.

288
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:08,733
About darkness
heightening your senses.

289
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,500
You said
you don't want me to trip.

290
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,700
Ah.

291
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:45,966
Ah, the lights are back on again.

292
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,086
I'll get the car ready.

293
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,300
Alright.

294
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,053
I'm so sorry, sir.

295
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,133
For causing inconvenience.

296
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:07,620
It's alright.

297
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,566
No inconveniences at all.

298
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,286
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes.

299
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:22,086
Any other events at the library,

300
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,753
- other than the movie nights?
- No, sir.

301
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,786
We have a lot of exhibitions and
musicals scheduled, so...

302
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,953
But it didn't feel so bad
when I was in there.

303
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:35,253
How about an opening event for
the library, too?

304
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,966
I'll pass that on, sir.

305
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,520
And I'll have a think, too.

306
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,166
About what event would
suit the library.

307
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,953
You?

308
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:46,020
Yes.

309
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,186
We're short of time, and...

310
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:51,300
It's something you've put
a lot of effort into, so...

311
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,600
Now!

312
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,553
- Woo-hoo!
- Wow, that's perfect.

313
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:14,553
Wow, no wonder
you're a barbecue master.

314
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,786
See? Just five seconds like this,

315
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:19,033
and it already has
a different sheen.

316
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,933
Say ah!

317
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,820
What's on your mind?

318
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,386
I need some ideas for
the library opening event.

319
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:40,286
What, that's
a secretary's job, too?

320
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:43,233
Why are you in faithful mode,
when you're quitting soon?

321
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,453
Right. From a psychologist's
point of view,

322
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,520
- you're addicted to work.
- Right?

323
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,286
In other words,
you're a workaholic.

324
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:51,920
Workaholic? No!

325
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,453
I'm just doing my best
until the very end.

326
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:55,153
Oh man.

327
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,486
Because you're so
devoted to your work,

328
00:25:56,566 --> 00:26:00,286
your VP is desperate
not to let you go!

329
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,886
Oh, I heard from Pil-nam.

330
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:07,453
That he's extremely
possessive of you.

331
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,086
You told her already?

332
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,886
Hey, Ms. BBQ master,

333
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:12,353
Shouldn't you flip that over now?

334
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,133
Not just yet! After 40 seconds.

335
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:17,153
By the way.

336
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:18,620
I think maybe, it's not
because he's possessive that

337
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,466
he's trying to hold onto me.

338
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,853
Maybe he really needs me.

339
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:25,720
- What?
- What?

340
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,720
But think about it.

341
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,686
How would he be,
without me there by his side?

342
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:31,053
I can't keep thinking about that
nowadays.

343
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,520
Don't tell me.

344
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,420
Did you fall for him?

345
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,520
Ha!

346
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,220
What on earth are you on about?

347
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,586
No way!

348
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,200
You've taken this too far.

349
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,320
If not, then really cut ties
when your mind's on it.

350
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,986
Otherwise, you'll just let him
control you for life

351
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:50,166
and you'll live as Secretary Kim,
instead of Kim Mi-so.

352
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:51,986
Well, that...

353
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:54,986
I know better than
anyone else about that.

354
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,086
Hmpf!

355
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,420
Hey, grill that thing properly.
All the smoke's coming toward me.

356
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,786
You!

357
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,533
Aren't you the BBQ master?

358
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,020
Argh!

359
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,833
What? What is it?

360
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,300
Hey.

361
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,586
It's just dust.

362
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,233
Alright?
Mi-so, it's really alight.

363
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,486
Pil-nam.

364
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:26,386
About phobias...

365
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:29,586
They can be
overcome someday, right?

366
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:30,986
Of course.

367
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,033
Keep facing it head on,
and you'll get used to it.

368
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,633
After you quit,
drop by to my clinic.

369
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:42,520
No, no. I don't mean me.

370
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,133
Then who?

371
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,600
Actually, it's nothing.

372
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,000
I wonder what
Secretary Kim is up to...

373
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,066
(Every Moment Was You)

374
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,466
Reading a childish
book like this, huh?

375
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:29,986
('In a complicated world of chaos,)

376
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:32,766
(while unravelling your
own issues and tasks)

377
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:36,220
'In a complicated world of chaos,

378
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,120
while unravelling your
own issues and tasks

379
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,586
if you suddenly
find yourself asking,

380
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:45,353
"I wonder what she's up to?"

381
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:50,753
Putting someone else
before me like that,

382
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:54,166
that alone, can be love.'

383
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,186
If a boss is going to
give work to his secretary,

384
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,053
of course he wants to know
what she's up to.

385
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,153
Love?

386
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,966
No way, ha!

387
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:11,433
Ha!

388
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,566
It's Morpheus!

389
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,553
Sorry.

390
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,520
The release date of
his book's just been announced,

391
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,300
and it's all over the news.

392
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,753
I'm looking forward to
his new work, too.

393
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:43,653
The title was...

394
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,386
'Once In a Lifetime!'

395
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,286
I already read the U.K. version.

396
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:49,053
It was a sad love story,

397
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:51,120
about a love that really would
come once in a lifetime.

398
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,553
I cried all night!

399
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:54,786
- It was that good?
- Yes!

400
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:58,320
But why won't Morpheus
show his face?

401
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,120
If he did, he'd be a star!

402
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,286
He'll draw all the attention.

403
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,966
Right?

404
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:12,120
A book concert?

405
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,220
Yes, why don't we invite
an author that will

406
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,633
draw attention, for
the opening event?

407
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,686
Gathering attention by
inviting an author, huh?

408
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:24,386
How about J.K. Rowling
who wrote Harry Potter, then?

409
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:27,400
J.K. Rowling is one,
but I think Mor...

410
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:29,220
If I do mention Morpheus
but can't get him,

411
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,966
then that's not good.

412
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,886
Mor...?

413
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,366
...Mor... I need to think more.

414
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,186
A plan with no back-up options.

415
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:44,486
That's not like you, Ms. Kim.

416
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:45,686
Just a little more time,

417
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,500
and I won't disappoint you.

418
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,466
Ha.

419
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:56,620
What was that laugh?

420
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,900
- Me?
- Yes.

421
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,920
I'm at the company.

422
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,366
I'll be right up.

423
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,320
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes, sir.

424
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,753
Did you know that
your brain consumes one-fourth of

425
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,853
- your calorie intake?
- Sorry?

426
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,553
After working my brains,
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

427
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,353
Oh, I'll go
prepare some snacks, sir.

428
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:28,953
No, I already have
what I have in mind.

429
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:30,286
Go to McDoria right now,

430
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:32,720
and get me the most expensive
and the least popular item,

431
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,286
and two fresh French fries.

432
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:36,233
That's "freshly deep-fried."

433
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:37,420
Uh... sorry?

434
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,953
And on your way back,
an Americano with an extra shot

435
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:42,420
and a latte with two extra shots
from Foursome Place.

436
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,653
No need to rush,
so take your time.

437
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:45,886
And get two sugar and two straws,

438
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:49,120
and five napkins each.

439
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,153
Just what...

440
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:51,420
Do as I say.

441
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,866
Huh? Yes, sir.

442
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:57,853
Take the emergency stairs,
and not the elevator.

443
00:31:57,933 --> 00:31:59,420
- What?
- Right now. Go!

444
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,666
Yes, sir!

445
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,333
Why on earth does he want me to
take the stairs?

446
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:30,386
Vice President Lee Young-joon!

447
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:32,720
Hey, seeing you like this,
you look so different.

448
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
In my memory, you were
always that little kid.

449
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:38,653
What brings you here
out of the blue?

450
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,733
I thought we were
done exchanging hellos.

451
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:43,653
Just...

452
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,786
I was at the publishing company
for my new book,

453
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,320
and I'm just dropping by.

454
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,433
Oh, that's right.

455
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,686
I got some copies.

456
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:54,000
You want one?

457
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:59,486
But then...

458
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:00,820
Like you'll ever read it.

459
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,053
Since it's about love,
which you have zero interest in.

460
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,553
You should date someone, too.

461
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,753
You need to discover love

462
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,833
in order to know
the real world out there!

463
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:13,333
I have many other things
I need to discover, so...

464
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,520
So callous.

465
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,620
I'd like you to leave.

466
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,600
As you can see,
I'm a little bit busy.

467
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:26,986
Alright, looks like you are.

468
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,300
I'll see you later, then.

469
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,700
Ah, thank you.

470
00:33:58,366 --> 00:34:00,020
- Huh?
- Huh?

471
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,186
The shoe laces!

472
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:02,720
Ah, yes.

473
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,653
So nice to see you again.
I can't believe this!

474
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,500
Yes, it's nice to see you again.
Goodbye, then.

475
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,186
I regretted not
asking for your number.

476
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:12,320
But bumping into you here
again like this,

477
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,900
I guess it must be destiny.

478
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:17,286
Oh, sorry. But I'm a little busy...

479
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:18,520
I'm busy, too.

480
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,486
And you're making me
really anxious right now,

481
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:22,100
because I'm worried
you'll just run off again.

482
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,366
(Kim Mi-so)

483
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:34,366
Then goodbye.

484
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,820
Oh what?

485
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,433
What's with these numbers?

486
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,266
Ah!

487
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,320
Ugh, why's he so persistent?

488
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,366
But if he was Morpheus,
I would've given him his number.

489
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:07,166
Mr. Lee, the coffee and
the hamburgers you asked for.

490
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,953
I'm not having them.

491
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,120
Sorry?

492
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,286
But you just told me to get them.

493
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:16,166
And I just had a change of heart.

494
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,600
I see.

495
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,886
I didn't know
I have to be at the meeting, too.

496
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:42,286
Well, this is an emergency!

497
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:44,053
So don't cause a scene,

498
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,786
and try to read
the atmosphere this time!

499
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,720
Yes, I'll watch myself.

500
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,486
Actually, I'm so nervous
in case I make a mistake.

501
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,686
Why, I'm nervous too!

502
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:55,066
Sorry?

503
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:03,353
My, Mr. Koh must be feeling tired.

504
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,386
Is work keeping him
busy these days?

505
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:06,453
Oh, that's right.

506
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,420
You said he's a workaholic, right?

507
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,453
Yep.

508
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,566
You've no idea.

509
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:13,286
Mr. Koh.

510
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:15,420
How about we go for coffee?

511
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,120
To wake ourselves up!

512
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,320
Well...

513
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,886
I think it's work that
best beats drowsiness.

514
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:22,520
Because nothing beats work

515
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,386
when it comes to
getting me all fired up.

516
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:26,953
Alright?

517
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:29,153
How about we all go for
a drink tonight?

518
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:30,186
To beat stress!

519
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:31,486
Sounds good!

520
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:32,253
What about you, Mr. Koh?

521
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:35,986
My way of relieving stress is
through work.

522
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:40,633
Because nothing stresses me out
more than leftover work!

523
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,253
Unbelievable!

524
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,553
That's so admirable.

525
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,833
Don't admire him just yet.

526
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,886
I hear he has 10 exact same suits,

527
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:52,333
and he just rotates them around!

528
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:56,020
Because he'd rather
do more work than

529
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,466
waste time on
picking out his outfit!

530
00:36:58,666 --> 00:36:59,933
Unbelievable!

531
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,920
Instead of workaholic...

532
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Why can't he be Se-ra-holic?

533
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,400
Hey, Kyung-mun.

534
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
You've got a rice grain
on your suit!

535
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,733
Son!

536
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:35,986
I thought you'd be
coming up next week.

537
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,053
Why are you back so early?

538
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,886
Of course I have to,
even if I have to swim,

539
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,520
when my son's back in 3 years!

540
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,220
And you've gotten
even more handsome!

541
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,900
I'd say you're the one
who's become more beautiful!

542
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:48,420
Of course!

543
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,333
After all the money she spent!

544
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,753
Honey.

545
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,353
Even money can't help you
if you're not born with it.

546
00:37:57,433 --> 00:38:00,833
I'd say the doctors can't help you
even if you spend all your money.

547
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,853
Ha...

548
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,086
Well, so did you see Young-joon?

549
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,286
Yes.

550
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:07,686
He hates me as always.

551
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:09,353
Hate you?

552
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:12,086
You know he's not the
amiable type.

553
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,686
I guess he just doesn't want to be
amiable with me.

554
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:17,933
There's also the fact that
he excels me in many ways.

555
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,886
Yes, this is Kim Mi-so speaking.

556
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:32,820
You left a message,
so I'm calling back.

557
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,986
This is Morpheus' agency.

558
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:35,820
Ah, yes.

559
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,753
I'm sorry, but Morpheus is not

560
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,653
interested in any kind of
public activities.

561
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:44,733
Well, could you pass on
our proposal, at least?

562
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,720
I guess it can't be helped, then.

563
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,100
Alright.

564
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,586
Ms. Kim. How about
Italian food tonight?

565
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:17,653
I'm sorry, sir.

566
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:20,633
But I'm a little busy with
the library event.

567
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,386
Don't get your hopes up!

568
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:26,620
I meant, you should get
yourself some Italian food.

569
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,053
You should use the
company credit card a bit more.

570
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,300
Thank you for
looking after me, sir.

571
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,300
See you.

572
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,753
Morpheus and interviews?

573
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,233
We did one yes, last year.

574
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,220
Did you meet him in person?

575
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,953
It was through writing.

576
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:03,420
I sent him the questionnaires,
and he e-mailed me back.

577
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,653
Then can I have his
e-mail address?

578
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,886
Ahaha!

579
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:09,420
No, never.

580
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,453
I promised him
I'd never disclose it.

581
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:17,686
It's manners to
keep promises you made.

582
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,200
Do you understand my position?

583
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:23,020
Ha...

584
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes, I did.

585
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:27,333
But...

586
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,720
You didn't forget that
I rounded the matter nicely

587
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,920
without taking you to court

588
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,633
when you were almost sued for
paparazziing my boss?

589
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:40,286
Sorry?

590
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:43,153
Repaying favors...

591
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,033
Now isn't that manners?

592
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:48,453
Do you understand me?

593
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,766
Yes.

594
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,433
Now where was that e-mail address?

595
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:56,300
Was it here?

596
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:04,433
I can't believe his e-mail
was just "Morpheus."

597
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,400
Alright, should I
start working my talent?

598
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,800
(This is Kim Mi-so, Secretary for
Vice President of Yumyung)

599
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,533
Simply amazing!

600
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:27,686
What is it?

601
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:29,053
You like the whisky
I picked out that much?

602
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:32,266
No, the reflection of
my face in the glass.

603
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,333
Keep looking.

604
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:39,353
Oh. I heard you advanced the
dates for the Art Center.

605
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:43,566
You're always so
fast to act, aren't you?

606
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:47,720
And this had to happen
while I was on a business trip!

607
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,020
I heard there was
a power cut, too.

608
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,686
You really ran into
so many troubles, Mr. CEO.

609
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:52,866
Troubles?

610
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:20,353
No.

611
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:21,966
It was fun.

612
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:24,833
Fun?

613
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,653
Well, the Art Center can't have
another power cut.

614
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:36,186
I'll make sure that
never happens again!

615
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:37,786
You trust me, right?

616
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:39,133
Well, thanks.

617
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:53,820
Hey, get it right.

618
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,286
How come every time
you make a copy,

619
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:57,386
half the page disappears?

620
00:42:57,466 --> 00:42:59,433
Because of you, I...!

621
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:07,920
Ugh!

622
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,353
Ji-ah, if you ever
run into trouble,

623
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:11,100
then you can
confide in me any time!

624
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,333
- Here you are.
- Ah! Yes. Sure.

625
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:17,186
The PPT files for the
library opening event.

626
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:18,820
Ah, let me take it.

627
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,386
I'll make sure to
pass it onto Ms. Kim!

628
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:23,700
Thank you.

629
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:35,420
He looks even more
dazzling in the morning!

630
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,486
By the way,

631
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:38,953
is it really true he has
ten suits and

632
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,386
rotates them around every day?

633
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:42,520
Apparently so!

634
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,786
I heard he said he'd rather work
than spend time picking his outfit.

635
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:47,086
I don't think so.

636
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,220
I think that suit's
what he wore yesterday.

637
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,666
- That rice grain...
- Hey!

638
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,720
Who are you, making up
rumors about Mr. Koh?

639
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,553
Do you want me to
tell you off?

640
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,253
I'm sorry.

641
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,633
Just get back to work!

642
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,533
Ugh, just move already! Ugh.

643
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:29,533
This is the proposal from Planning
for the library opening.

644
00:44:36,566 --> 00:44:38,753
Nothing new, and
it doesn't strike the heart.

645
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:40,986
What about your proposal?
Still coming along?

646
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:42,120
I'm still looking into it.

647
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,566
I'm sorry, sir.

648
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:50,853
Uh... Mr. Lee?

649
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:53,200
Let me fix your tie.

650
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,586
Uh... Let me do it today.

651
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,066
Ah, sure.

652
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,986
Mr. Lee.
Let me just take this call.

653
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:27,100
Sure.

654
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,366
Hey!

655
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,033
Why did my heart suddenly...

656
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,586
I should see my family doctor.

657
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,386
Something's not right
with my heart.

658
00:45:46,466 --> 00:45:47,433
Hey...

659
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,366
Hmmm?

660
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,420
I hope I didn't interrupt you
when you're busy.

661
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,420
No, not at all.

662
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,366
So, what brings you here?

663
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,353
To give you this.

664
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:03,933
This is for you.

665
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:05,720
You shouldn't have, Ms. Kim.

666
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,853
You didn't need to...

667
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:07,986
Take it.

668
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:11,066
I got it while I was
shopping for myself.

669
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:15,833
Um, is Young-joon that busy today?

670
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,853
He's gotten busier
after pushing forward

671
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:20,500
the dates for the
Art Center opening.

672
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,720
Then he probably isn't
in a good mood.

673
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,653
Say, you think he'll get mad if I...

674
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:28,866
Ask him to join me for dinner?

675
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,120
No, I don't think
he's at that level yet.

676
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,153
Besides, his schedule is
free for tonight.

677
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:37,433
Really?

678
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,686
Will you be returning home?

679
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:42,020
Should I call the chauffeur?

680
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,366
No.

681
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:44,953
From what you told me,

682
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:47,553
I guess I can
go see him today, so...

683
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:48,933
Thanks, Ms. Kim.

684
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,920
Uh, Young-joon?

685
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,286
Why don't we all...

686
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:06,886
Have dinner as a family, tonight?

687
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:08,586
Sorry.

688
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:09,886
Why not?

689
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:13,166
Ms. Kim said
you have this evening off.

690
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,786
You called out Ms. Kim again?

691
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,653
I called her out to
give her something.

692
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:21,586
Lucky her.

693
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:22,720
She gets presents.

694
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,633
I want presents, too.

695
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:32,386
Young-joon, can't you
give me a present?

696
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:34,153
I want you to come, too.

697
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:36,466
- I want the whole family...
- No.

698
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:40,786
You may not realize it
because of how I look,

699
00:47:40,866 --> 00:47:42,686
but I'm an old lady now!

700
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:45,120
I only have two sons,

701
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,153
and one lives abroad so

702
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:49,086
we can only all get together
every 2 or 3 years...

703
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,253
How many more times
will I have the whole family together

704
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,233
before I die now, huh?

705
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,286
Let's all have dinner.

706
00:47:58,366 --> 00:48:01,166
Young-joon, please!

707
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:03,566
I'm sorry.

708
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:13,686
I guess it didn't go well?

709
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,453
No.

710
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:20,153
To be honest, it's not something
Young-joon's comfortable with.

711
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:24,253
And it's not like
I can convince him, either.

712
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,800
There probably isn't a...

713
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:35,786
Hey, my shoes.

714
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:37,153
It's all dusty.

715
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:39,066
Oh, should I give you something to
wipe it off with?

716
00:48:44,033 --> 00:48:45,366
Here you are.

717
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:53,933
Where did she go,
leaving her purse?

718
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,433
Yes, ma'am. Your purse is here.

719
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,420
Sorry?

720
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:11,420
Well, tell Young-joon to
bring me my purse tonight. Okay?

721
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,553
Yes, ma'am.

722
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:16,733
Alright.

723
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:28,820
Let's have Mr. Yang send it.

724
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,086
No.

725
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,586
She asked especially for you to

726
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,600
bring it back to her.

727
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:36,720
Ms. Kim, who do you work for?

728
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,453
Is my mother
more important to you?

729
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:39,420
No.

730
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,000
You're more
important to me, sir.

731
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,553
That's why I'd like to say this.

732
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:49,320
I know you feel
bad about your mother.

733
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,486
I don't know what's
holding you back,

734
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:55,120
but don't do something
that'll only make you feel bad.

735
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,366
Then...

736
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,386
Have some of this, too.

737
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:23,953
I'm alright.

738
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:26,853
Don't give me the,

739
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,353
'I'm full already,
watching you two eat.'

740
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:29,920
No, no!

741
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,586
She's cut down on her dinner

742
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:36,166
to stay in shape now.

743
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:37,620
Your father's right.

744
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,386
You can't stay in shape like this,
without effort now!

745
00:50:41,466 --> 00:50:44,133
Hahaha!

746
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:49,953
Young-joon.

747
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:52,220
We should've called
Mi-so here too.

748
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,220
Right?

749
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,353
Mi-so?

750
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,853
She's Young-joon's secretary.

751
00:50:56,933 --> 00:51:01,620
The only one
he trusts and relies on.

752
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,720
I'm so grateful and relieved to
have her by his side!

753
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,986
What a pretty name.

754
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:07,986
Kim Mi-so.

755
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,386
She's a pretty girl, too.

756
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,253
Before you go, let's call her
and we'll all have...

757
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:13,586
By the way.

758
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:16,420
Did you hear the new dates for
the Art Center?

759
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,586
Ah, yes.

760
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:20,153
I heard you made that decision
because of UK Group.

761
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:24,366
Good work! I knew you were
a fighter like me!

762
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:26,586
But if you do that
all of a sudden,

763
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,253
doesn't that mean
more work for you?

764
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,453
I'm worried that
you'll harm your health.

765
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:32,920
Watch your health, alright?

766
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,453
The fate of our company
depends on it!

767
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:37,833
Yes, don't worry.

768
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:40,220
Have some of this, too.

769
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,520
Don't just eat rice.

770
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,220
Have some galbi, too.

771
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,686
Delicious.

772
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:47,833
Let me do that for you.

773
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,666
Have some coffee.

774
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,686
Later.

775
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:04,066
I'm working.

776
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,753
About that secretary, Kim Mi-so...

777
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,900
I'm curious what she's like.

778
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:15,666
I mean, she put up with you for
9 years, didn't she?

779
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,900
So what's she like?

780
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,453
Seeing you how
you're keeping quiet about her

781
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:26,166
makes me think you're
hiding her from me.

782
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,220
Why?

783
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,533
You think that if I meet her,

784
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,466
I'll date her?

785
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:40,333
Get out.

786
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:44,933
I really don't understand you.

787
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,120
I'm making the effort to
make the first move,

788
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,886
so shouldn't you
at least appreciate that?

789
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:54,966
Why should I appreciate it?

790
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,486
You're as selfish as ever!

791
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:01,333
You're really asking me why?

792
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:04,486
I said, I'll forgive you!

793
00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:05,920
That I'll put the past behind us,

794
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,233
and act like
nothing's ever happened!

795
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,633
Is that the attitude of
someone who's here to forgive?

796
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,320
Going on about what happened
more than 20 years ago,

797
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,533
which I don't even remember.

798
00:53:32,066 --> 00:53:33,333
Lee Young-joon.

799
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:37,133
Why do you
hate me so much, anyway?

800
00:53:38,866 --> 00:53:40,520
I don't hate you.

801
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,986
I only...

802
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,500
Despise you.

803
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,253
Watch that mouth of yours.

804
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,986
If you hadn't done
what you did back then,

805
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,033
it would've been me in your place.

806
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,286
You really think so?

807
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:07,500
What?

808
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:10,033
You're weak and incompetent.

809
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,686
In order to protect yourself,

810
00:54:14,766 --> 00:54:16,800
you bully others.

811
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:21,020
Even if that had never happened,

812
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,133
you would've never made it to
where I am now.

813
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,300
You bastard!

814
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,820
What are you two doing?

815
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,266
Stop it!

816
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:45,186
Stop!

817
00:54:45,266 --> 00:54:47,553
Just please, stop.

818
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,453
Stop...

819
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:52,666
Please. Just stop.

820
00:55:38,866 --> 00:55:39,686
Hello.

821
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:41,820
Morpheus, we just sent you our
marketing proposal for

822
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,653
your new book to your email.

823
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:46,286
It's urgent, so
can you check it now?

824
00:55:46,366 --> 00:55:48,166
Alright.

825
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,053
(Marketing Proposal)

826
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:01,333
(This is Kim Mi-so, Secretary for
Vice President of Yumyung)

827
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:06,833
(This is Kim Mi-so, Secretary for
Vice President of Yumyung)

828
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:14,066
Oh my God!

829
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,420
Mr. Lee?

830
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,953
What were you daydreaming about to

831
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:20,100
not even recognize me,
when I was right here?

832
00:57:21,933 --> 00:57:24,886
What brings you here at this hour?

833
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:27,420
Oh no, all the eggs are
cracked except one.

834
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,733
Why, out of the blue...

835
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,500
What's with your face?

836
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:35,520
No need for you to know.

837
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,286
Weren't you with your family?

838
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:38,586
Did something happen
along the way here?

839
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:40,320
Yes, I was with my family.

840
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,320
But don't ask any more.

841
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,120
Let's first get you treated.

842
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,666
Otherwise that'll scar.

843
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:59,020
Uh... hold on!

844
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,433
30 seconds! No, one minute!

845
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:29,686
3 minutes...

846
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:31,366
4 minutes...

847
00:58:31,866 --> 00:58:33,300
Mr. Lee.

848
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:44,953
It's a bit shabby, isn't it?

849
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,100
No.

850
00:58:50,066 --> 00:58:51,233
It is extremely shabby.

851
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:54,666
Please come in.

852
00:59:14,433 --> 00:59:15,820
I'm fine.

853
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,620
I'm not fine!

854
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,653
Do you know how many publicity
photos you'll need to take?

855
00:59:19,733 --> 00:59:22,620
If someone raises an issue,
it'll all be my fault!

856
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,966
Follow me.

857
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,633
I'm sorry, but
can you come closer?

858
00:59:56,266 --> 00:59:57,300
Oh.

859
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:45,620
Just so you know, no Band-Aids.

860
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,686
I hope you don't think
Band-Aids will do

861
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:49,986
justice to this face.

862
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:52,866
Oh. I won't stick it on, then.

863
01:00:57,633 --> 01:01:00,453
So, how did you hurt yourself?

864
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,720
I don't think
this is from an accident...

865
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,566
Did you get into a fight?

866
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,953
I thought I told you
not to ask questions.

867
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,786
Oh, sorry.

868
01:01:15,866 --> 01:01:17,133
I didn't realize...

869
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:23,666
Uh...

870
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:27,666
Do you want to
stay for some ramen?

871
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:30,866
Ramen?

872
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,086
When you're feeling down,

873
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,720
have some spicy noodles and

874
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,253
that cheers you up right away!

875
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,420
It's the best!

876
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:37,953
Oh!

877
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:40,186
Remember that one egg
that was saved?

878
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:43,000
I'll put it in your bowl!

879
01:02:25,866 --> 01:02:26,686
Homework.

880
01:02:26,766 --> 01:02:28,320
Remember, with all your heart.

881
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,033
Mr. Lee is an egomaniac!

882
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:40,166
(Every Moment Was You)

883
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:43,686
So I find this
childish book here, too.

884
01:02:43,766 --> 01:02:45,220
What would you know?

885
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,900
You know nothing about love.

886
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,620
Then do you, Ms. Kim?

887
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,366
When you've been
single all your life.

888
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,420
I've read about it in books,
you know!

889
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,766
Good for you.

890
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:04,033
Ah, the water's boiling.

891
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:11,566
Why is Thank-cow
facing down like that?

892
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:14,920
No, not there!

893
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,066
Not over there!

894
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,333
A little longer.

895
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:55,933
Just a little longer.

896
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:06,233
I thought maybe
I should try this love thing.

897
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:11,333
With you.

898
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,333
(Thank you, Ms. Lee Do-yeon, for
a special cameo appearance)

899
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:51,533
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

900
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,453
A date?

901
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:54,533
Yes.

902
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,253
When she said,
'Want to stay for ramen?'

903
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,286
And you do...

904
01:04:58,366 --> 01:04:59,653
Thanks for the ramen tonight.

905
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:00,620
It's like saying,

906
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,053
'It's day one from today!'

907
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,120
So who is it?

908
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,386
Your blind date?

909
01:05:04,466 --> 01:05:05,686
No wonder you're a writer.

910
01:05:05,766 --> 01:05:07,333
You care about details.

911
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,120
What's the hottest
restaurant these days?

912
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,566
A love confession...

913
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,166
Ms. Kim? First off,
congratulations.

914
01:05:16,933 --> 01:05:18,100
Since when did this start?

915
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,766
- Uh...
- Just don't.
