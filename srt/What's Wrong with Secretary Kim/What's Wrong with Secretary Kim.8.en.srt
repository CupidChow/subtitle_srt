(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,033
Whatever you want
and want to know...

8
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,333
Alright, I'll accept it.

9
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,333
Do whatever you want.

10
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:47,286
Because I'll just accept it all.

11
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,700
Your everything.

12
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,700
I'm ready to, you know.

13
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:04,566
Because you belong...

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,266
...Right here.

15
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,366
Uh, Mr. Lee?

16
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,520
You said you're ready to accept

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,666
whatever it is I want to know.

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,866
There's something I want to know.

19
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,820
Go on.

20
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,633
Whatever it is, I'm ready.

21
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,866
That time when we almost kissed...

22
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,333
Why did you push me away?

23
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,786
You said to go ahead,

24
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,220
so tell me.

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,386
I know you don't act
without a reason.

26
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,286
But no matter how hard I think,

27
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,333
I just don't have a clue as to
what was on your mind.

28
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,420
Mmmm.

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,200
Well, you see...

30
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,600
When I close my eyes,
I sometimes see a ghost.

31
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:26,720
What?

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,486
Since when?

33
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,520
Does this have to do with

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,933
the nightmares you often have?

35
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,186
Ha... Why do you ask?

36
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,386
What, will you call
an exorcist for me?

37
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,553
Please be serious.

38
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,200
There's a ghost behind you!

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,966
Just kidding.

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,920
You're kidding?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,686
What, were you also kidding about

42
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,300
how you see ghosts,
when you close your eyes?

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,766
I can't believe you!

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,266
- Um, there...
- Ah!

45
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,966
Ms. Kim, wait for me.

46
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,433
- Woo-hoo!
- Yeah!

47
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,166
(Episode 8)

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,386
Man...

49
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,753
So Gui-nam, you even work
as you drink, huh?

50
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:42,353
Yes, I believe work is
your drink's best company.

51
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,000
No hangovers too, the next day.

52
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,886
Mr. Yang, aren't you having any?

53
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:51,020
Oh, who knows
what might just happen?

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,586
So I always have to be
ready to go, 24/7.

55
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,286
Eh? So you're just like Ms. Kim.

56
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,500
Guess that means no love life.

57
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,733
What's your ideal type of girl?

58
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,153
I like girls who are cute.

59
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:16,200
- Hey.
- Hey!

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,120
Sir, you're finally back.

61
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,900
Mr. Lee, looks like you got
caught up in the rain.

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,366
We're sorry to have you
go through all that trouble.

63
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,153
Trouble?

64
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,866
No, it was a meaningful time.

65
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,266
Meaningful?

66
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,120
Oh.

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,186
While we were finding
shelter from the rain,

68
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,286
we took the time to
go over bits and pieces

69
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,900
about the company, overall.

70
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,866
I don't think so.

71
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,166
You look like
you're hiding something.

72
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,320
Come to think about it,

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
you two were on the same team for
that ribbon-hunt,

74
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,233
and you only just came back now.

75
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:07,966
Don't tell me...

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,086
...That you sneaked out for
top-grade beef?

77
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,620
Not fair! We were stuck with
the cheaper ones.

78
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,220
Did all that meat
get to your head?

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,920
Ms. Seol, get a grip!

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,420
Mr. Lee, are you hungry?

81
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,153
I'll grill some meat for you
right away.

82
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,753
- Thank you.
- This way, sir!

83
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,553
This way, this way!

84
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:35,833
Come on!

85
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,586
What? Where's the meat?

86
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,620
Where did they all go?

87
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,020
We grilled everything.

88
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,386
Everything?

89
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,620
But I said let's leave
some for Mr. Lee.

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,753
When you said that,

91
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,320
I thought you were going to
leave some for him.

92
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,753
Instead of 'Lets,'

93
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,866
you should've just
given us a clear order.

94
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:03,086
Hey, this is no time to
argue about that now.

95
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,520
What do we do?

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,300
We're out of food.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,486
As a former member of
the special forces unit,

98
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,866
let me go into the water and
catch a catfish for a stew.

99
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:14,786
No.

100
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:17,486
I'll go and get some meat.

101
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:18,553
But you've been drinking.

102
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,486
And it's 30 minutes to
the nearest supermarket.

103
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,400
That's a round trip of one hour.

104
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,166
Then... Let's just have that.

105
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,186
Will that be alright, Mr. Lee?

106
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,633
You do like ramen, right?

107
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,066
You eat ramen too, Mr. Lee?

108
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,320
I tried it the other day,
and it wasn't so bad.

109
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,986
Then let's just have ramen.

110
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:45,820
Yes, sir.

111
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,233
Then let me go and
boil the water right away.

112
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,820
It's your first time
at the workshop,

113
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,633
so too bad you missed out on
the charcoal barbecue.

114
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,953
Are you saying that
because you're disappointed?

115
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,186
Of course.

116
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,986
Because you've no idea
how delicious it is.

117
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,500
A barbecue out on open air!

118
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,600
It should be ready now.

119
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,466
Hot...

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,333
Here.

121
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,600
Use this.

122
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,020
What's this?

123
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,353
This is a little trick to
eating instant ramens.

124
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,766
Cool some noodles onto here,
and it shouldn't be so hot.

125
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,700
Hold on.

126
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:06,066
Slurp!

127
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,020
- Slurp...
- Slurp!

128
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,286
Slurp?

129
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,733
Just put it in here, and...

130
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,453
Not hot at all, right?

131
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,366
Hmmm. Not a bad idea.

132
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:26,900
Slurp!

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,053
- I want some kimchi.
- Sorry?

134
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,033
The kimchi tastes more delicious
when you get it for me.

135
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,733
Here.

136
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,400
Delicious.

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,553
You're going to sleep already?

138
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,753
Come on, just one more glass! Huh?

139
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,066
Just one more  glass...

140
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,700
No, can't.

141
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,766
Ah...

142
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:07,920
Everyone's ready for bed?

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,986
Then I'll turn the lights out.

144
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:11,833
- Good night!
- Sweet dreams!

145
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,400
(Mr. Lee)

146
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,066
Good night. And you have the
permission to dream about me.

147
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,500
(Ms. Kim Mi-so)

148
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,366
Thank you for your permission.

149
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:55,566
Then shall I go drop by
into Ms. Kim's dreams?

150
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,366
Hey, isn't that Mr. Lee's car?

151
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,353
Mr. Lee, where are you off to?

152
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,186
A French brand representative has
just arrived in Korea

153
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,786
on a top-secret trip.

154
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:27,486
This brand is yet to be
launched in Korea,

155
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:29,633
so I scheduled a meeting to
win them over first.

156
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,220
What?

157
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,353
But how could I not
know about this?

158
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,653
I just got the call last night.

159
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,020
From Mr. Park.

160
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,420
Oh...

161
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,820
Then you should've told me, too.

162
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,920
I'll get ready too,
and be there ASAP.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,853
No, this is my business.

164
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,386
Sorry?

165
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,886
Your business is to enjoy the
rest of the workshop.

166
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:52,133
When you're relaxing,
just have fun. I'll call you later.

167
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,300
But...

168
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,286
(Mr. Lee)

169
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:04,820
If you feel so guilty,

170
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,300
then come drop by my place later.

171
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,553
(If you feel so guilty,)

172
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:12,220
(then come drop by my place later.)

173
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,353
(There'll be an amazing
gift waiting for you.)

174
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,520
There'll be an amazing
gift waiting for you.

175
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,533
(Now aren't you excited?)

176
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,833
Now aren't you excited?

177
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,533
What are you up to, Ms. Kim?

178
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,486
Why are you getting
all shy over a text?

179
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,953
Could it be... Someone
asking you out on a date?

180
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,920
No, no.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,753
It's just from my supermarket.

182
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,720
That Chilean shrimps are on sale.

183
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,166
- Oh.
- Better go get those!

184
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,986
Come on, what's taking it so long?

185
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm sorry, sir.

186
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,386
But we have a speed limit.

187
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,266
Oh, I see.
You're doing fine, then.

188
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,153
(Ms. Kim Mi-so)

189
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:08,500
Yes, I'm excited.
I'll see you there then, sir.

190
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,120
(There'll be an amazing
gift waiting for you.)

191
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,053
(Now aren't you excited?)

192
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,133
(Yes, I'm excited.
I'll see you there then, sir.)

193
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,600
Is it because
it's so early in the morning?

194
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,453
We look forward to having
a long-term business partnership

195
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,853
with a major company.

196
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,933
You will not regret choosing us.

197
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,600
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

198
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,266
- Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:53,553
Yumyung just managed what
everyone else failed to do!

200
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,633
Nothing's impossible when
I step out to do something.

201
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,286
I respect you, Mr. CEO.

202
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:01,566
Yeah, yeah.

203
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,820
Do you have some time?

204
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,686
Time...

205
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,086
...Yes, I have more than
enough. Why?

206
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,086
- Why don't we go shopping?
- Shopping?

207
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,886
I'm thinking of having
a barbecue in my terrace.

208
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:17,000
- A barbecue?
- Yes.

209
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,533
(Butcher's)

210
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,553
Let's a bit of everything.

211
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,786
The beef, the chicken... Everything.

212
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:24,933
Let's first get the beef.

213
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:26,786
Uh, ma'am?

214
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:27,986
How's the tenderloin today?

215
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,900
Because you can't go wrong
with tenderloins, huh?

216
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,720
Charcoal-grilled sausages.

217
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,253
Once you taste them, you'll never
want to fry them in a frying pan.

218
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,666
They're on a whole new level!

219
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,720
And... Let's buy some potatoes
and sweet potatoes, too.

220
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,686
Once they're in that
charcoal fire...

221
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,786
They're not just potatoes.

222
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,800
They become
unbelievably delicious!

223
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,733
Let's go.

224
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:04,386
With the best selection of
ingredients

225
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:06,820
and the best chef to
cook them - yep, that's me...

226
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,720
There's no way it can't go wrong.

227
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,653
Oh no!

228
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,600
We should've gotten some
more vegetables.

229
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,086
Thanks for helping me out
with the groceries.

230
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,653
Then I'll see you
at the company tomorrow.

231
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,653
What? So you're not having
that barbecue with me?

232
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:29,720
Hey, hey, hey!

233
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,886
Were you using me?
You were toying with me, were you?

234
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:32,986
Hey!

235
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,833
You're so bad, you know! Real bad!

236
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:49,086
- Thank you.
- Thank you, everyone!

237
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,986
Awww, I don't want to
say goodbye just yet.

238
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,953
How about we all go for round two?

239
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,286
I really would like to join you,

240
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,020
but I have to go return the car.

241
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,066
So see you tomorrow!

242
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,286
- See you.
- Goodbye!

243
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,286
I can't, either.

244
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,520
I'd rather go over one more page

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,486
if I have time to drink soju.

246
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:04,166
Then... Please excuse me.

247
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,886
Then... Ms. Kim?

248
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,620
Sorry, I'm seeing someone today.

249
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,900
So see you tomorrow!

250
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,900
- Bye!
- Bye!

251
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,520
Something's definitely up
with Ms. Kim.

252
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,833
It's as if...

253
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,486
...She has a date today.

254
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:20,886
Whatever!

255
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,020
She's been single all her life!

256
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,020
Oh, come on.

257
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,986
She has no time to
date anyone because

258
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,853
she's always next to
Mr. Lee, 24/7.

259
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,353
Oh my goodness!

260
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:31,600
Then don't tell me
Mr. Lee has called her...

261
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,033
What?

262
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,220
...Out to work again?

263
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,500
On a weekend?

264
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,053
You think so?

265
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,820
This is your future, Ji-ah.

266
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,220
Once Ms. Kim quits,

267
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,453
this is what's waiting for you.

268
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,100
R-really?

269
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,886
Well, then why don't we
talk more about Ji-ah's future

270
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,720
over some soju and some...

271
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,666
- Bye!
- Bye!

272
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,566
Wait for me!

273
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,533
Ha...

274
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,520
Let's just throw something on.

275
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,966
It's not like
this is a date or anything.

276
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,933
Is this too much like
what I wore last time?

277
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:10,033
But I wore jeans to
that theme park.

278
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,700
Is this too "wedding?"

279
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,233
Well, that'll do.

280
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,566
What do you think,
Thank-cow and Remember-dog?

281
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:33,533
Oh my goodness!

282
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,420
Sorry.

283
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,453
Did I suffocate you?

284
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,720
But I don't have time now,

285
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,566
so let me clean up afterward.

286
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,800
Ugh, mosquitoes...

287
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Mr. Lee.

288
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,666
You look beautiful tonight.

289
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,866
Thank you.

290
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,786
So what's all this?

291
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,553
You said you wanted
charcoal-grilled meat yesterday.

292
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,386
That it tastes better
out on the open air.

293
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:06,686
So here you are.

294
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,353
Wow.

295
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:11,500
I was right about
an amazing gift waiting, huh?

296
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,966
Yes, this is amazing.

297
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,300
But uh... I think you need to
flip that over now.

298
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,486
Oh.

299
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:39,853
Ah... What do we do?

300
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,720
That's alright.

301
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,420
Let's just grill one again.

302
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,200
- We've no meat left.
- Sorry?

303
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,620
What, you burnt them all?

304
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,953
It was my first time
grilling meat.

305
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:55,820
So it turns out there's
something I'm not so good at.

306
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Doesn't that make me more human?

307
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,900
Well, yes...

308
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,020
Well, what shall we do, then?

309
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,253
If you're not too hungry,

310
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,986
should I go and
get some more meat?

311
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,600
- I'll grill them again for...
- No.

312
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,233
No, sir.

313
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,633
Are you mad at me, Ms. Kim?

314
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,153
Enjoy.

315
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,566
Thank you.

316
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,020
Sorry about the charcoal barbecue.

317
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,653
It's alright. I like pizza, too.

318
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:47,800
Go on.

319
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,666
Thank you.

320
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:15,120
Ms. Kim.

321
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,686
You have something here.

322
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:21,620
What, here?

323
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,200
- No, not there.
- Here?

324
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,266
No.

325
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,666
Come with me.

326
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,053
I don't want to go alone.

327
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,633
- You come with me.
- No!

328
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:23,253
To which direction will you
push me away this time?

329
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,220
So I can get ready.

330
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,366
This way? That way?

331
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,386
Ms. Kim.

332
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,520
About this, I...

333
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,533
Lee Young-joon, how could you
just leave me there? What...

334
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,233
Oh, so you two were
up to something.

335
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:56,586
I just thought this drink would
go nicely with the barbecue,

336
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,353
but guess I don't belong here.

337
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,186
Then I'll get going, continue with
whatever you were doing.

338
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,053
No, it's alright! I'll go.

339
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,900
I was about to leave anyway.

340
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,066
Then...

341
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:27,933
I'm so sorry.

342
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,133
I guess I made a big mistake.

343
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,366
Why did he have to
come in then? So embarrassing!

344
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,733
There's got to be something.

345
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,153
Ms. Kim?

346
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,400
Ms. Kim, wait for me!

347
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:37,520
I'm sorry about yesterday.

348
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,953
I had no idea that
you two would be there together.

349
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:42,286
I wasn't interrupting anything,
was I?

350
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:43,653
Interrupting?

351
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,620
Nothing happened,
for you to interrupt.

352
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,220
I don't know what it is
you're thinking, sir,

353
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,153
but out of all the
possibilities you're considering,

354
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:51,700
- none has...
- Aren't you getting off?

355
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,133
Oh.

356
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,153
Oh, just so you know,

357
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,100
the preparations for that...

358
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,653
- Are you alright?
- Ah.

359
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:12,086
I don't think I twisted anything.

360
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,266
Is it thanks to those
new calcium tablets?

361
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,166
My body sure feels different.

362
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:19,666
Phew.

363
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:22,653
Um...

364
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:26,166
Have you seen the scar on
Mr. Lee's ankle, by any chance?

365
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:30,320
So you've seen it, too?

366
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,533
Yes.

367
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,553
Do you know how he got that scar?

368
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:38,120
I only ever saw it once, too.

369
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,453
While we studied abroad,
we were in the football club.

370
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:42,820
But Young-joon would always
get changed all alone.

371
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,353
See you later!

372
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:45,953
I was on my way out,

373
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:49,200
and he'd stayed behind to
get changed.

374
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:53,666
It was only a glimpse through
the door, but I definitely saw it.

375
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,000
Those clear scars running across
both of his ankles.

376
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,053
Both ankles?

377
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,653
Yes, and they looked like old scars.

378
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:05,953
From being tied to something.

379
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,686
Could be my imagination,

380
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,433
but that's what I thought then.

381
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,420
But can you end up with scars from

382
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,053
simply being tied to something?

383
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:18,820
Well, there was this TV show
about a dog that was

384
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,033
abandoned with a thin
collar around its neck.

385
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:27,120
That collar had
restricted blood flow,

386
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,320
leading to his neck swelling,

387
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,953
and the metal collar
cut into his neck, and...

388
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,100
Please stop.

389
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,120
I'm sorry.

390
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,786
Anyway,

391
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:40,720
I don't know how he got that scar,

392
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,920
but Young-joon's not someone to
tell me all about it.

393
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,500
And it's not like
I can just ask about it.

394
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:52,753
Oh, and now that
we're on this topic,

395
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:57,100
about that kidnapping
you mentioned before...

396
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,420
I once doubted whether it had
anything to do with his scars,

397
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,220
but then again...

398
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,900
You said it was his brother,
and not Young-joon, so...

399
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,766
Still... What are those scars
on his ankles?

400
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,153
That scar...

401
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:25,920
I thought he only had it
on one ankle.

402
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,200
(Scar)

403
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,833
Just as Mr. Park said, could it be
from being tied to something?

404
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:34,200
Because scars like those
aren't common.

405
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,200
Good morning, sir.

406
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,153
What's with that expression?

407
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,433
Is it because we failed to
kiss again last night?

408
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,986
It's not like I don't want to.

409
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,800
I mean, I want to as well! I do!

410
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,820
What is it that
you want to do, Mr. Lee?

411
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,453
A meeting! I want a meeting!

412
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,086
Young-joon! A meeting!

413
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,253
Oh.

414
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,720
Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

415
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,486
Can you ask for Mr. Jung?

416
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,286
For the weekly briefings.

417
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:27,766
Yes, sir.

418
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,666
Let's focus...

419
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,266
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

420
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,220
Wow.

421
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,920
Sweetie, these are so delicious!

422
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,520
They just melt in your mouth.

423
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,153
These are high-end stuff!

424
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:51,053
Did you get them just for us?

425
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,186
Well, not really.

426
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,953
They were a gift to Mr. Park,

427
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,553
but he gave them to me instead.

428
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,053
Oh.

429
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,686
So where's Ms. Bong?

430
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,153
Oh, she's seeing a client.

431
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:01,453
So she'll be coming in late today.

432
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,700
Oh. Then I should
save some for her.

433
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:08,320
For Ms. Bong, three!

434
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,186
Hey, what's with the discrimination?

435
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:14,866
Why two for us,
and three for Ms. Bong?

436
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:17,853
Because I like Ms. Bong.

437
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:20,466
She's cute, and she's charismatic.

438
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,786
- Mr. Jung.
- Yes?

439
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:29,286
Mr. Lee would like his
weekly briefings now.

440
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,900
Alright.

441
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,586
Man, I do this every week,

442
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,386
but I still can't used to them!

443
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:40,920
My heart's beating so fast...

444
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,366
- Go, go!
- I'll be back.

445
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,353
This is the schedule for
our Dongseong-ro store

446
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:52,820
that will open next month
in Daegu.

447
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,420
And these are the
press releases for

448
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,666
our Art Center's opening ceremony.

449
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:00,253
And this is...

450
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,286
...The proposal by the PR team,

451
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:05,933
for Yumyung Land's
summer festival this year.

452
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:16,553
The theme is 'A Romantic Night,'

453
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:17,653
and the main image is

454
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,866
a couple kissing, with the
theme park in the backdrop.

455
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,133
Eh?

456
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,253
Sorry, I'll have them
re-do it, sir.

457
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,586
No, no.

458
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,753
Let's go with this concept.

459
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,220
No, sir.

460
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,086
I'll return with improved results.

461
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,333
Then...

462
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:01,453
Yes, from Ms. Kim's point-of-view,

463
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:02,833
it'll be hard to understand.

464
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,666
So how do I explain myself?

465
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,486
I'm here.

466
00:31:11,566 --> 00:31:12,853
- Hello.
- Hello.

467
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:13,953
Great job.

468
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,220
Good on you.

469
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,420
Oh, I wish tomorrow would
just come here already.

470
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,886
There's too many things to
check for the opening!

471
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,253
I won't be able to breath

472
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,866
until that Art Center is open!

473
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,720
What's this?

474
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,020
That? That's from
someone who likes you.

475
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,866
- Someone who likes me?
- Yes.

476
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,233
I have a bug down my shirt!

477
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:15,366
Mr. Yang, thank you!
I'll enjoy them.

478
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,086
Ms. Bong, here are
the files you asked for.

479
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,486
Oh, so you're having
the macarons?

480
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:36,220
Yes, but it's kind of
embarrassing, you know?

481
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,086
Why can't he just tell me
up front that he's interested?

482
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,520
Doing this in public...

483
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,900
It kind of puts me
in an awkward position!

484
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:51,420
Is it so weird having
a colleague admire you?

485
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,053
- Colleague?
- Yes.

486
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,386
That's from Ms. Seol.

487
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:56,420
What?

488
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,753
Oh man.

489
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,286
Don't tell me...

490
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:04,966
You thought that there's a guy
who likes you, Ms. Bong?

491
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,866
No, like I'd ever!

492
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:13,900
Ugh!

493
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,433
- Uh, Ms. Bong?
- Yes?

494
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,053
What do you mean by this text?

495
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:43,033
Enjoy what?

496
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:47,353
Just... Enjoy my day!

497
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,700
What, can't I just say that?

498
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:52,233
Ha...

499
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,520
Why did he have to
pick up those pads for me?

500
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,586
Why throw a stone and

501
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:11,653
cause a ripple in my heart?

502
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:12,933
Ha...

503
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:19,000
I like girls who are cute.

504
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Cute, did he say?

505
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,553
To which direction will you
push me away this time?

506
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,133
So I can get ready.

507
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:48,586
Ms. Kim,

508
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,000
I promise a sweet kiss next time.

509
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,033
(I promise a sweet kiss next time)

510
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:06,400
Ms. Kim, I actually have
this traumatic...

511
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:09,333
(I actually have this traumatic...)

512
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,500
No, no!

513
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:24,420
Ji-ah,

514
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,353
this is the prize for

515
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,366
our winners for the ribbon-hunt.

516
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:30,086
I heard you and Gui-nam
came first.

517
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:33,286
Wow, so they're really
giving us tablet PCs!

518
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:35,620
Of course. Oh, and
can you also give one to

519
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,986
Mr. Koh Gui-nam?

520
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:39,533
- Me?
- Yes.

521
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:44,120
Oh... Alright.

522
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,700
I'll be back.

523
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:06,900
Oh, Mr. Lee.
Did you need something?

524
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,866
Well...

525
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,420
I want that.

526
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,820
My blood sugar's low.

527
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,166
But that was my last one...

528
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,533
- So what?
- Sorry?

529
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,566
Oh, nothing, sir.

530
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:53,766
I'm going to overcome it.

531
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,400
Because there's nothing that
I, Lee Young-joon, can't overcome.

532
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:15,433
Here, the prize for
the ribbon hunt.

533
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:22,253
You must be feeling very grateful.

534
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,786
Huh? Why?

535
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,686
Why else? For coming in first
for that ribbon-hunt.

536
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,020
You do realize that
out of the five ribbons out there,

537
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,520
we found three and
that's why we came in first, right?

538
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,286
Oh, I know.

539
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:33,386
Then what about the fact that
out of those three,

540
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:36,353
I found two and
you found one?

541
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:37,420
Yes. So what?

542
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,820
Then do you think it makes sense
for us to equally receive

543
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,753
one tablet PC each when
I found two and you found one?

544
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,520
- What?
- This tablet PC...

545
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,386
The lowest price on the Internet
was $799.

546
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,120
That's $1,598 for the two tablets,

547
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,453
and we should really be
dividing this 2:1.

548
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,020
But being the gentleman I am,

549
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,053
I'm not raising any issues.

550
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,720
So isn't that enough
reasons to thank me?

551
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,720
What?

552
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,553
Anyway, I let you off for

553
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:06,353
leaving me up on that tree,

554
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:08,753
and I also let you have
that tablet PC too,

555
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:13,966
so take my secret
to hell, alright?

556
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:16,953
By the way,

557
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,186
why hell?
I'm going to go to heaven!

558
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:20,820
Hahaha!

559
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,053
Then off you go.

560
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,620
As for me, it's back to work.

561
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,666
Ha! Goodbye, then.

562
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,386
By the way,
when are you moving in?

563
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:33,686
In a few days, why?

564
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:36,586
Great!

565
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,886
When ordering food,

566
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,120
you can't order for one person
so I'd always end up with leftovers.

567
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,186
Don't tell me...
You're inviting me?

568
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:44,620
Ha, no way!

569
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,986
I'm just saying,
when you order food,

570
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,153
if you could halve it and

571
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:49,520
bring it to me,

572
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,686
then you won't have to
waste any food!

573
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,066
Then please excuse me.

574
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,420
- What a beautiful day!
- Ha!

575
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,653
How could he just
blatantly say that?

576
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:03,200
Gosh!

577
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:07,300
I should think again
about moving there...

578
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,386
Eh!

579
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:13,533
Oh what?

580
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:19,820
Sweetie,

581
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,800
what's with that hair?

582
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:24,920
Well...

583
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,286
Se-ra just thought that
her hair this morning

584
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:30,133
didn't really suit her...

585
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,253
So Se-ra decided to re-do it,

586
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,233
to suit her cute image.

587
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,333
Did you say, "cute?"

588
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:41,766
- Not "pathetic?"
- What did you say?

589
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,333
What?

590
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,386
If you keep on
teasing me like that,

591
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:49,766
I'm going to be real mad!

592
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:54,886
You know, I've seen that
hairstyle before...

593
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:57,486
Oh, that's right! My Mom!

594
00:39:57,566 --> 00:39:59,586
I saw it in my Mom's
high school album.

595
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,420
Right!

596
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,686
That movie set in the 70s
with Kwon Sang-woo in it...

597
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:07,953
'Once Upon a Time in High School!'
Han Ga-in had that hair.

598
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,920
- Huh?
- 'Once Upon a Time in High School?'

599
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,353
What, is she a high school kid?

600
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:17,200
Bwaha!

601
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,486
Oh, man.

602
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:24,686
Mr. Yang over here is
always so quiet

603
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:25,886
and I hardly saw him laugh,

604
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,853
but I guess he thought
the same just now.

605
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:30,600
Right, Mr. Yang?
So high school, right?

606
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,333
You want to be beaten up
the old school way, then?

607
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:37,833
Boo hoo...

608
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,420
Why is everyone laughing?
Isn't this cute?

609
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,933
Cute? Hey, laugh harder!

610
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,020
Why are you so
self-conscious around him?

611
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,253
All he did was just
pick up one push-up pad!

612
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,586
Whatever, I'm going to
just ignore him from now on.

613
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,033
He's not my type anyway!

614
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:23,853
(Today Dad bought caramel)

615
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:25,400
(Oppa, aren't you coming to see me?)

616
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,820
Son, I know you're a novelist,

617
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,920
but do you have to be
holed up in the study all day?

618
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,886
What is that book
you're reading, anyway?

619
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:47,520
It's not a book, it's a diary.

620
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,886
Diary?

621
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:54,253
Yes, a diary written by a girl who
was with me when I was kidnapped.

622
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,420
What?

623
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,520
Apparently I wasn't alone.
She was with me.

624
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,653
And she said we managed to

625
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:04,400
escape that horrible place together.

626
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,466
Just... What do you mean?

627
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,353
Back then...

628
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:12,953
I wasn't alone.

629
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:16,033
She had been kidnapped
by that woman with me.

630
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,320
There's no way.

631
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,386
That early morning...

632
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:25,820
You came to the
police station, all by yourself.

633
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,586
Apparently I took her home.

634
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,453
It was such a relief to hear that

635
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:34,466
I wasn't alone in that
dark, scary place.

636
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,553
I'm not so sure about this.

637
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:42,420
Somehow, I feel
uneasy about this girl.

638
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,933
Whoever she is,
don't trust all her words.

639
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,520
But aren't you curious
who this girl is?

640
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,033
You know her too, Mother.

641
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:54,633
What?

642
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:58,053
It's Mi-so.

643
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,200
Kim Mi-so.

644
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:14,300
I'm going to overcome it.

645
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:18,500
Because there's nothing that
I, Lee Young-joon, can't overcome.

646
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:22,586
Overcome what?

647
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,066
Just what had happened to
Mr. Lee in the past?

648
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:32,220
Yes, ma'am.

649
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,600
How have you been?

650
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:37,386
Yes, Mr. Lee has
just gone into a meeting.

651
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:39,386
I see.

652
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:40,986
Can I...

653
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:43,233
...See you for a minute?

654
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:45,120
Sorry?

655
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,166
I'll talk to Young-joon myself.

656
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:49,533
Alright.

657
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:53,553
Ah, Ms. Kim.

658
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:55,686
I know you're busy,

659
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,086
so sorry to take your time.

660
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,533
No, it's alright, ma'am.

661
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:03,633
I heard from Sung-yeon.

662
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:08,353
Is it true that...

663
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:11,120
You were there with him

664
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,433
at that place,
when you were little?

665
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,566
Yes, it's true.

666
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:20,820
It was such a long time ago
so I don't remember the details

667
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,500
but I came across his writing
and that's when I knew.

668
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:27,386
Could you...

669
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:30,020
Could you tell me,

670
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,433
more about then?

671
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:43,300
It was a very cold,
and a very narrow room.

672
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:47,153
When I stepped inside,

673
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,886
there was a boy sitting
crouched in one corner.

674
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:53,586
It seemed like he had been
kidnapped before me.

675
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,020
I can't quite
remember the details,

676
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,833
but he called me stupid
as soon as he saw me.

677
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:00,553
You're really stupid, aren't you?

678
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:01,753
I'm not stupid.

679
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,620
I'm five years old already.

680
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,366
And I can even read better than
my sister, Mal-hee.

681
00:45:08,266 --> 00:45:11,700
I guess he felt sorry for me,
seeing how I was kidnapped, too.

682
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:18,366
And he tried to comfort me,
when I started getting scared.

683
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:23,733
Ha...

684
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,266
Ma'am...

685
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:35,966
It's alright. I'm alright, so...

686
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:38,066
Please continue.

687
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:41,300
How was he?

688
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,633
How did my Hyeon look?

689
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:57,133
He seemed fine, from my memories.

690
00:45:57,533 --> 00:46:01,420
He even took me home
after we escaped from there,

691
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,233
and we'd even promised to
meet again.

692
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,986
In my memories...

693
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,586
He was brave and considerate,

694
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,633
protecting a younger child - me.

695
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:18,620
Didn't he look cold?

696
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,833
He's weak against the cold.

697
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,053
He was wearing a blue shirt
and a jacket, I think.

698
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:31,020
It wasn't a jacket.

699
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,500
It was a cardigan.

700
00:46:33,533 --> 00:46:35,120
That cardigan...

701
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,520
Mr. Jang Jeong-do, the designer,

702
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,666
had made it especially for him...

703
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,620
And though he's my son,
he looked so good in it.

704
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,086
I still remember
how cute he looked on that day,

705
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,200
when he stepped out
in that cardigan.

706
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,633
If only I'd dressed him warmer...

707
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,020
...Then he wouldn't be
freezing in the cold...

708
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,386
...Was what I thought.

709
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:12,200
For those three days,
it pained me thinking about that.

710
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:15,766
Ma'am...

711
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:23,553
Ever since that day...

712
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:27,566
Every day has been
like hell for our family.

713
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,086
It was so hard seeing Sung-yeon,

714
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:34,866
who'd spring at his brother
whenever they saw each other,

715
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:39,333
and also Young-joon,

716
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,433
who would stand there,
not knowing what to do.

717
00:47:44,933 --> 00:47:46,333
Ma'am,

718
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:51,020
I may be stepping out of line here,

719
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,786
but I heard Mr. Lee
lost his memories.

720
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:56,966
How did that happen?

721
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,633
When each day was
starting to feel like hell,

722
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:07,400
one day, at breakfast...

723
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,133
Young-joon suddenly collapsed.

724
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:14,833
And when he woke up,
he couldn't remember anything.

725
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:19,333
I really can't remember anything.
I'm so sorry.

726
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:25,586
And ever since then,

727
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:28,420
our family finally got back to

728
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,900
where we were,
even it's only a facade.

729
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,666
But...

730
00:48:36,566 --> 00:48:37,900
Mi-so?

731
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,000
I heard Mi-so is here.

732
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:42,466
Ah, so it's true.

733
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:47,220
You should've said
you were coming.

734
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,286
Well...

735
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:51,066
You should stay for dinner.

736
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,886
No, I have a lot to do
at work today, so...

737
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,933
Do you?

738
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,053
Then let me see you off.

739
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:01,166
Just wait there.
Let me go get changed.

740
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:11,733
Anyway,

741
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:18,100
what I wanted to say today, is...

742
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:22,353
Thank you,

743
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:25,953
for being with him on that day.

744
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,733
I just wanted to tell you that.

745
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,766
So it's finally tomorrow.

746
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:44,853
The book concert, I mean.

747
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:47,920
I got nervous,
and almost even regretted it,

748
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,286
but looking back,
I'm glad I took the offer.

749
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:52,920
I think it'll be fun,
and thanks to that...

750
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,300
I got to see you again, too.

751
00:49:57,766 --> 00:50:00,220
The summer sun's so intense.

752
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,920
I hope summer ends soon.

753
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,100
Because I prefer winter.

754
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:05,920
Winter?

755
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,720
But you hate the cold.

756
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,086
Uh... no.

757
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,800
I'm fine with the cold.

758
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,253
But his mother said...

759
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:24,053
...That he hates the cold.

760
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:26,000
So what was that?

761
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,920
What if we catch a cold?

762
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,853
I'm fine.
I'm healthier than I look.

763
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:31,320
I don't mean you, I mean me.

764
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,953
What if I catch a cold?

765
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:36,166
Oh, that's right.
You get cold easily.

766
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:40,233
No way...

767
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,786
Ha... What are you thinking?

768
00:50:45,866 --> 00:50:46,966
There's just no way.

769
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,433
(To my oppa)

770
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,020
Today Dad bought caramel.

771
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,186
I left some for you,

772
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:30,286
but Pil-nam and Mal-hee
tried to eat them.

773
00:51:30,366 --> 00:51:32,600
Still, I managed to
save them for you!

774
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:45,420
This is my house.

775
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,020
You really do live near here.

776
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,020
By the way, oppa.

777
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,886
I want to marry you
when I get older.

778
00:51:51,966 --> 00:51:54,053
M-marry me?

779
00:51:54,133 --> 00:51:57,033
So promise me, quick.
That you'll marry me.

780
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,666
- I can't.
- Why not?

781
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:05,320
Because you should only marry
your love once you're an adult.

782
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,833
Then once you're an adult,
you could love me!

783
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:14,753
Alright, I'll marry you.

784
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:17,920
Then it's a promise!

785
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,533
I'll come back to see you again.

786
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,900
Don't touch that.

787
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,533
It's something that's
precious to me.

788
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,033
Thanks.

789
00:53:03,466 --> 00:53:05,886
Thanks to you,
I was able to meet Mi-so.

790
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:09,833
Thanks to you
ditching me there, that day,

791
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,566
and thanks to you
hiring Mi-so as your secretary.

792
00:53:17,133 --> 00:53:19,866
It's all thanks to you,
from the very beginning.

793
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,166
So thanks. I mean it.

794
00:53:28,766 --> 00:53:32,433
Yes, keep on
thanking me all you want.

795
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:37,933
Because thanks to me, you'll be
able to see more of her.

796
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,433
She's always going to be
right next to me, you see.

797
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,566
Well, let's see who she'll
really be next to, in the end.

798
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,266
You're home.

799
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:07,433
I heard you called Ms. Kim,
so I came to check.

800
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,166
And Mom?

801
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:17,686
Please don't call out
Ms. Kim like that anymore.

802
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:18,866
What?

803
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,200
She's a busy person.

804
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:27,600
I'll see you at the
opening ceremony, then.

805
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:40,800
Mmm.

806
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:45,820
Why are you all so serious?

807
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,833
You're not even
touching your drink!

808
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,866
Is this because of Ms. Kim?

809
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:55,700
Well... No.

810
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,000
Something's up, huh?

811
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:03,986
Alright, listen to me, Mr. CEO.

812
00:55:04,066 --> 00:55:05,420
You know,

813
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,500
a relationship is like facing
each other, stark-naked.

814
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:14,486
- How vulgar.
- I don't mean it literally!

815
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:17,486
I mean as in,
you should have nothing to hide.

816
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:20,320
Think about it. Let's say
you said you'll both strip.

817
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,386
And she's taken it all off,
but you...

818
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:25,253
If you still have something on,

819
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,566
how embarrassed and
uncomfortable would she feel, huh?

820
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,766
'Hey, I took the leap but
why not that bas...'

821
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,986
I mean, 'Why not him?'

822
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,200
She'd feel so betrayed!

823
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:42,620
Your point is?

824
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,033
Take off all your underpants!

825
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:50,186
What?

826
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:54,153
You're hiding something from
Ms. Kim, aren't you?

827
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:57,420
I don't know what
you're trying to say.

828
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,620
You know,

829
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,353
ever since I was busted for
lying to my ex-wife,

830
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:05,353
I never kept anything from her.
Why?

831
00:56:05,433 --> 00:56:08,620
Because the more you hide it,
the more you're forced to lie,

832
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,086
and that'll only
torment both of you.

833
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,500
I know,
because I've been through it.

834
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:19,553
What did you lie to her about?

835
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:21,066
That she was my first.

836
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:26,386
But she knew right away
on our first night.

837
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,753
Anyway, let's not side-track.

838
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,533
There's just one thing
I want to say here.

839
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:34,953
If you're hiding something,

840
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:38,186
then it's manners to take it
all out before you start anything.

841
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:41,153
Even if they are those underpants
that you've been wearing for

842
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:43,633
so long, that they feel like
they're a part of you.

843
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,400
This is not that simple.

844
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:55,986
Because sometimes,

845
00:56:56,066 --> 00:56:58,400
knowing the truth can hurt you.

846
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,566
Oppa, I'm scared!

847
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,786
No, Mi-so.

848
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:20,700
That's just a spider.
A big spider.

849
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:42,186
What was that dream?

850
00:57:42,266 --> 00:57:46,853
I thought I'd remember everything
once I do meet him,

851
00:57:46,933 --> 00:57:48,833
but I'm feeling
more and more unsure.

852
00:57:57,733 --> 00:57:58,833
Are you sleeping?

853
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:03,500
Just woke up a while ago.

854
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:07,400
I see. I saw the
lights come on, so I wondered.

855
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,033
What's this?

856
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:45,766
Open and see.

857
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,386
A token of my apology for
that caramel I ate earlier.

858
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:02,533
And...

859
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,700
I also wanted to see you.

860
00:59:14,866 --> 00:59:15,866
You should go in now.

861
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,100
And sweet dreams.

862
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,766
How strange.

863
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,653
Why do I...

864
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,566
...Feel like crying?

865
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,353
We believe that Yumyung Art Center

866
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:48,786
will satisfy your cultural needs

867
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:52,320
and enrich our community.

868
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,500
Thank you.

869
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,266
(Once In a Lifetime
A journey in search of destiny)

870
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:08,353
Anything we should be
aware of from the rehearsal?

871
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:11,020
No, all the sound, video and the
lighting system are in check.

872
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,820
Please check the press list
when our reporters arrive.

873
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,486
Yes, we'll check them thoroughly.

874
01:01:15,566 --> 01:01:17,453
Keep up the good work

875
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:18,553
until the end of today.

876
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,833
Yes, sir.

877
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,466
Good work, Ms. Kim.

878
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:36,700
The book concert.
You planned it, didn't you?

879
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,133
So good work.

880
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:43,333
Thank you, sir.

881
01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:56,753
Mr. Morpheus?

882
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:58,486
The waiting room is this way.

883
01:01:58,566 --> 01:01:59,666
Alright.

884
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:15,686
Were you looking for me?

885
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:18,353
Yes, do you have some time?

886
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:19,900
Sure, what's this about?

887
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:23,453
I was wondering if you could
go over my script for today.

888
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:25,520
I feel a bit nervous,

889
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,186
thinking about the crowd.

890
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:28,500
Will you help?

891
01:02:30,866 --> 01:02:32,933
Sure, if I can help.

892
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,053
This is great.

893
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:51,953
It'll be a meaningful session for
our audience,

894
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:53,686
as they'll get to learn about
your values and thoughts.

895
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:55,200
You think so?

896
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:58,820
I feel at ease now,
hearing you say that.

897
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,733
Then I'll get going.

898
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,566
Mi-so, wait.

899
01:03:11,366 --> 01:03:12,466
You're here.

900
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,666
Did the talk go well
with the Director?

901
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,386
What's with that glare?

902
01:03:26,466 --> 01:03:28,966
Mi-so was only here to
check my script.

903
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,953
If you can't manage
that much on your own,

904
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:33,633
then you shouldn't have
accepted this.

905
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:39,266
Let's go.

906
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,020
Uh, Mr. Lee...

907
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,386
About just now...

908
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:01,366
Mr. Lee?

909
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,853
Sir, the President is
looking for you.

910
01:04:04,933 --> 01:04:06,033
Let's go.

911
01:04:10,633 --> 01:04:12,986
Your new book, 'Once in
a Lifetime' is all the talk!

912
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:16,066
It became a bestseller as soon as
it hit the stores, right?

913
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:18,620
Don't you think it's amazing?

914
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,200
- Yes!
- Yes!

915
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,386
I can't believe Sung-yeon decided
to finally show himself.

916
01:04:31,466 --> 01:04:32,566
It makes me so happy.

917
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:38,053
This is all thanks to you, Mi-so.

918
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:39,866
No, I didn't do much.

919
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,253
Please excuse me for a moment.

920
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:56,320
The title of your new book is
'Once in a Lifetime.'

921
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,333
May I ask whether you've
met the one, then?

922
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:01,953
Just recently.

923
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:03,933
- Wow, really?
- Yes.

924
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,720
I met that person who
kept by my side

925
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,686
when I was little,
and in darkness.

926
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:14,000
I wouldn't have made it on my own.

927
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,820
So I don't want to
ever let go of this person,

928
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,566
who was with me through that time.

929
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,833
I'm going to risk my everything
to hold onto that hand.

930
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,466
What is it?

931
01:06:06,866 --> 01:06:08,266
I have something to say.

932
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,800
What is it?

933
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:28,386
It's all a misunderstanding.

934
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:30,120
What?

935
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,786
What you heard,

936
01:06:31,866 --> 01:06:32,753
and saw just now.

937
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,286
It's all a misunderstanding.

938
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:35,853
No need to explain yourself.

939
01:06:35,933 --> 01:06:37,600
I said I can accept
and handle everything.

940
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,020
No, let me explain.

941
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,500
I want to make myself clear.

942
01:06:47,366 --> 01:06:50,686
Why, all of a sudden?

943
01:06:50,766 --> 01:06:54,586
Because I don't want even
the tiniest misunderstanding.

944
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:56,966
I'm scared that...

945
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:00,533
...It'll drive us apart.

946
01:07:05,733 --> 01:07:06,800
Why?

947
01:07:09,966 --> 01:07:11,266
Because I like you.

948
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:20,220
I'm sorry to answer you so late

949
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,333
after all your confessions.

950
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,666
But...

951
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,866
I like you, Mr. Lee.

952
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,466
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?)

953
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:57,286
This is our first dinner
ever since we became lovers,

954
01:09:57,366 --> 01:09:58,520
so I want it to be
somewhere special.

955
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,453
Alright, I'll book for
somewhere special.

956
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:02,400
You'd think she's your secretary.

957
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,266
I think we need to
get some things straight.

958
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,153
He made copies, himself?

959
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:10,400
He did?

960
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:13,400
- Would you like one?
- I'm alright, sir!

961
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:17,086
Be honest.

962
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:19,653
Have you been hiding it from us?

963
01:10:19,733 --> 01:10:21,033
Sorry?
