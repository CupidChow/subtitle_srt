(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,700
I'm sorry to answer you so late
after all your confessions.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,000
But...

9
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,666
I like you, Mr. Lee.

10
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,266
Come with me.

11
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,166
I don’t want to go alone.

12
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,966
You come with me.

13
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,633
(Episode 9)

14
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,466
Hold on.

15
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,920
Let's make this clear.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,020
Sorry?

17
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,066
So we're definitely dating,

18
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,833
right?

19
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,653
Yes, sir.

20
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,900
'Yes, sir?'

21
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,766
What, is this a quiz show?

22
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,100
Why so formal?

23
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:17,600
But it is true, isn't it?

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,933
Wait for me!

25
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,466
Girlfriend!

26
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,300
Wait for me, girlfriend.

27
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,000
I said, wait for me, girlfriend.

28
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,400
Take care, Mr. Lee.

29
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,633
Why are you looking
at me like that?

30
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,066
Because I don't want to
say goodbye.

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,133
Ms. Kim,

32
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,786
I may have told you this before

33
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,986
but I'm smart, handsome,

34
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,033
rich, and talented.

35
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,800
So...

36
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,733
...Marry me.

37
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
As soon as you can.

38
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:33,400
What, it's been less than an hour
since we started dating!

39
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,600
Aren't you rushing things?

40
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,666
Who was in a bigger rush?

41
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,633
Sorry?

42
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,400
It's nothing.

43
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,586
Then see you.

44
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,533
Yes, sir. I'll see you tomorrow.

45
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,000
Toot toot! Toot toot!

46
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,900
Off we go!

47
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,920
Yay, this is fun!

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,853
Now you ride this time.

49
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,833
I'll push the car
especially for you.

50
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,086
Thanks.

51
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,986
You know what, oppa?

52
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,966
I want to marry you.

53
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,520
M-marry me?

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,933
Yes, you're just like a prince.

55
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,620
Promise me.

56
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,766
I'll come and
see you again, Mi-so.

57
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,333
I can't hold it anymore.

58
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,933
What, why are you back?

59
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,233
In case someone misses
a certain person all night long.

60
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,900
I mean you.

61
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,433
In case you miss me
all night long.

62
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,453
You know me, don't you?

63
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,866
I don't give second chances.

64
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,486
But for you, especially,

65
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:46,533
I'd be willing to give second,
and even third chances.

66
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,000
Chances to see me.

67
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,353
So?

68
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:56,400
Don't you feel honored to
be my special person?

69
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes, it is an honor, sir.

70
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,733
Sweet dreams, Ms. Kim.

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,553
You know what I mean by
"sweet dreams," don't you?

72
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,066
Of course.
I'll dream about you, sir.

73
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,966
Let me hold you one more time.

74
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:33,633
Tonight, I...

75
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,166
I might just be able to
have a sweet dream, too.

76
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,320
You have a board meeting tomorrow.

77
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,100
You should go now
and get some sleep.

78
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,366
I think I can even
put up with your nagging tonight.

79
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,933
Go in, Ms. Kim.

80
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,266
You go ahead first.

81
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,800
Alright, stop smiling.

82
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,433
Well, guess I can't help it.

83
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,700
It's a promise!

84
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,186
I'll come and
see you again, Mi-so.

85
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,020
Really? You'll really
come to see me?

86
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,786
- Of course.
- I won't ever forget your name,

87
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,600
Sung-yeon!

88
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,833
That's right.

89
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,266
His name was Sung-yeon.

90
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:50,500
Is he feeling unwell?

91
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,986
He's never been like this.

92
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,086
Sorry?

93
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,353
I mean Young-joon.

94
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,820
He dozed off during the meeting
and he's still sleeping.

95
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,986
What, again?

96
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:02,233
He slept in this morning
and was almost late, too.

97
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,820
That Lee Young-joon,

98
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,733
who's always so
strict with himself?

99
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,753
What just happened?

100
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,333
I know, right?

101
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,300
Oh, that's right.

102
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,900
Want to see something fun?

103
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,833
Something fun?

104
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:38,133
- Mr. Lee.
- What?

105
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:45,633
Who do you like more?
Your Dad or Mom?

106
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,120
I can't believe he's
answering in his sleep!

107
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,253
Does his brain work 24/7?

108
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,666
I know, right?
I only just learned it, too.

109
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,733
But it's my first time
seeing him so defenseless.

110
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,933
Did the world change for him
overnight or something?

111
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,966
Ms. Seol? I'm on my way!
Can you grab those files...

112
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,366
She hung up.
Then take care, Ms. Kim.

113
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,533
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee?

114
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:26,886
He seemed like he was
having nightmares then,

115
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,000
but now he looks so peaceful.

116
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,500
Where are you going, after
staring at a person sleeping?

117
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,833
Mr. Lee! What if someone sees us?

118
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,120
Like anyone would barge in here.

119
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,466
Don’t worry.

120
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,400
It's not that I'm worried...

121
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,220
Then what?

122
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,820
You just stirred up
a dormant desire in me,

123
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,666
so shouldn't you
at least take responsibility?

124
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,933
Dormant... What?

125
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,620
De-

126
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,033
-sire.

127
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:22,700
Desire... How could you say that
with such a straight face?

128
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,053
You better get ready.

129
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,300
Because I won't put
my brakes down this time.

130
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,333
So... You're not sick
anywhere, are you?

131
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,600
It's just that I've never seen you
sleep so much.

132
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,400
After yesterday,
I finally found peace.

133
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,033
I don't think I'll be
having nightmares anymore.

134
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:55,920
Sorry?

135
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,320
Call Dr. Choi,

136
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,533
and tell him he won't need to
prescribe any more tranquilizers.

137
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,133
Are you really all better?

138
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,166
It doesn't hurt now.

139
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,166
Not anymore.

140
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:11,066
Not anymore...

141
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,166
What's with that look?

142
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,666
There's something I want to ask.

143
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,366
The boy I was looking for...

144
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,066
...Are you sure it's your brother?

145
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,500
Of course. Why do you ask?

146
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,200
I know this might sound strange,

147
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,900
but for some reason,
it feels like you were that boy.

148
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,553
From how you'd have nightmares,

149
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,620
like you were
traumatized by something,

150
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,353
and those scars on your ankles...

151
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,453
If the man you've fallen for
happens to be that boy,

152
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,933
then that'd be
the icing on the cake.

153
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:00,966
But unfortunately,
I'm not that boy.

154
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,433
My nightmares and my scars...

155
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,733
...Have nothing to do with that.

156
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,386
And...

157
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:14,453
What does it matter,
if I'm not him?

158
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,400
Will that change the
way you feel for me?

159
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,866
No, it won't change anything.

160
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,600
Because regardless,

161
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,900
I like you, Mr. Lee.

162
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,233
Then...

163
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,800
I'll leave you to sleep some more.

164
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,953
Yes, I should be
there by 7 o'clock.

165
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,886
I'll text you the passcode,

166
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:03,086
so if you're there early,

167
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,053
just go in and
put them all inside.

168
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,666
Yes, please. Thank you.

169
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,033
I'm moving today, you see.

170
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,953
But it's the weekday.

171
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,886
It's cheaper to move
on the weekday.

172
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:18,186
I only just started work,

173
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,120
so my parents are paying for
my deposit and

174
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,966
my moving fees, so...

175
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,133
I need to do what I can and
make it cheaper.

176
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,553
It'll be hard if
this is your first time

177
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,133
moving out of your parents' place.

178
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,586
Still... If I want to be
a career woman like you,

179
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,633
it's a must.

180
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:37,633
I'm going to move closer to
the office, and focus on work!

181
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:40,453
By the way, isn't it time for
your meeting?

182
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:41,766
Sorry?

183
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,666
Oh my!

184
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,366
I'll make sure to focus
much more on work!

185
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:51,653
I'll be off, then.

186
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,600
See you.

187
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:59,866
(Mr. Lee Sung-yeon)

188
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,786
Your call cannot be
connected at this time.

189
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:21,433
Please leave a message, after the...

190
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,766
Morpheus! I kept you
waiting, didn't I?

191
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,153
No, it's alright.

192
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:34,320
The book concert was a success!

193
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,853
Our phone was ringing
non-stop today.

194
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,553
There are requests for
interviews, TV appearances...

195
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,733
You'll keep making
public appearances, right?

196
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,486
No, I'm not interested.

197
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:48,686
Why not? It'd be great if you did.
You give great talks.

198
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:51,720
I really enjoyed your
book concert.

199
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,020
Especially the last bit,

200
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,633
when you confessed to
your love... Man!

201
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,066
She was there too, was she?

202
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:06,133
I bet she was touched.

203
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:20,900
- Ms. Seol?
- Yes, sir.

204
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,153
Mr. Choi is away for
his army drills.

205
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,886
Could you drive instead?

206
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,686
I need to look over some files
on my way, so...

207
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,520
Just leave it to me, sir.

208
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,833
I'll drive you safe and sound.

209
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:38,486
I hope it's not the underworld
you'll be driving me to.

210
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,333
Come on, what do you take me for?

211
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,353
Did you call for me?

212
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,253
Can we have lunch together?

213
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,666
Yes. You've no lunch appointments,
so that is possible.

214
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,620
It's our first lunch
since we started going out,

215
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,220
so I want it to be
somewhere special.

216
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,553
Yes, I'll book for
somewhere special.

217
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,353
Not the usual place,
but somewhere new.

218
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:32,486
Yes, I'll make a list of
some new places.

219
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,486
How about we also
get a cake ready?

220
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,620
We need to celebrate
this special occasion, won't we?

221
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,420
Yes, I'll get your favorite
rare cheesecake ready.

222
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,766
Good.

223
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,033
Oh what?

224
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,433
Is this really a conversation
between lovers?

225
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,966
Things have always been like this,
so why doesn't it feel right?

226
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:02,966
Do we have to go
all out and stick candles?

227
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,033
Candles? No...

228
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,753
But I went to all this length to
celebrate our beginning.

229
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,086
I was the one who
went to all the length.

230
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,366
It was me who made the
reservation, after all.

231
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,520
How is everything?

232
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,986
Ah, very good, thank you.

233
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:50,000
Thank you very much.
You look like a great couple.

234
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,866
Though we almost mistook you
as his secretary.

235
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:56,500
Please enjoy.

236
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,286
Instead of going back to the
office, how about we go on a date?

237
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:16,386
Sorry?

238
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,966
Let's go for a walk,
and watch a movie.

239
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,433
We can't.

240
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,320
Do you have to
give me a straight no?

241
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,886
My schedule's all free
this afternoon, isn't it?

242
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,686
But you still need to
be in the office.

243
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,120
I don't think it's right to leave
the office for private affairs,

244
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,600
especially to go on a date.

245
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,786
I'm confused.

246
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:37,786
Sorry?

247
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:39,133
Sometimes you're like a secretary,

248
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,066
and sometimes you're like
my girlfriend.

249
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,600
I think we need to
settle some things.

250
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Settle things?

251
00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:55,586
Until now, your service by my side
felt natural.

252
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,733
But now I feel like
it's making me a bad boyfriend.

253
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,166
For example, like how you were
refilling my glass back there,

254
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,220
and how you'd
carry my handkerchief

255
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,733
and hand it to me
whenever I needed it.

256
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:11,153
That's not what
an average couple would do, is it?

257
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,886
But that can't be helped.

258
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:16,186
It's my job to be
always a step ahead,

259
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:17,366
so everything goes
smoothly for you.

260
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:19,466
That's why I want to
settle some things.

261
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,286
From now on,
you just support me with my work.

262
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:24,566
As for all else,
I'll handle it myself.

263
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,286
But that's...

264
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:28,233
Don’t say anything,
just do as I say.

265
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,253
While I can't help being
a selfish boss,

266
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,533
I don't want to be
a selfish boyfriend.

267
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:50,133
Okay, alright!

268
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,386
Ms. Seol, I don't want to see
any more blunders.

269
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:53,866
Don't get lost now, alright?

270
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,053
Don't worry,
I know this neighborhood so well,

271
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:58,600
that I can drive
with my eyes closed.

272
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,533
I hope that won't have us
closing our eyes forever.

273
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,653
See? We're almost there.

274
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:05,986
Now this is rare!

275
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:07,900
You not making mistakes...

276
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,233
...That's more reason for
me to feel uneasy.

277
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,133
Hey, that's...

278
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,533
Isn't that your ex-wife, sir?

279
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:52,733
Come on, he could
just be a friend.

280
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,566
If I'd just gotten lost,
you wouldn't have had to see that.

281
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:03,666
After always making mistakes,

282
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,233
this had to be the
one time I had to get it right...

283
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,366
I'm sorry.

284
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,833
Hey, it's alright.
I'm fine, don't mind me.

285
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,233
Actually, no.

286
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,000
Did you need anything, sir?

287
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:48,633
Indifference.

288
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,866
I need your indifference
and insincerity.

289
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,886
Man, after all that talking
in our meeting...

290
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,100
My neck hurts.

291
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,133
Good work, everyone.

292
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,333
What the...

293
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,700
Mr. Lee!

294
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,453
What happened?

295
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:18,386
If you needed to make copies,

296
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,920
you should've just said so!

297
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,020
- Let me do it for you.
- No, let me, Mr. Lee.

298
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,720
No, I'm already done,

299
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,400
and I mastered this copier, too.

300
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,086
Normal, enlarged, reduced.

301
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,353
I mastered all the functions,

302
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:30,833
so from now on,
I make my own copies.

303
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,600
Oh man...

304
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,733
Thank you.

305
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:55,353
What's going on?

306
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:57,700
Ms. Kim, did you leave your desk
by any chance?

307
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,366
No, I was sitting there
all this time.

308
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:02,653
Then how could this be?

309
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,120
Why, what happened?

310
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,486
Well, Mr. Lee, he...

311
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,800
He was making his own copies!

312
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,753
What? He did?

313
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,920
Yes!

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,133
My heart almost stopped
right then and there!

315
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,720
You all heard it, right?
My heart stopping!

316
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,966
Yes.

317
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,966
What's with this situation?

318
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:51,520
Ms. Kim,

319
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,953
they want you at the
Executive Director's office.

320
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,533
Mr. Park wants to see you.

321
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, alright.

322
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,320
You know Mr. Lee's cookies?

323
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,520
They look so exquisite
and delicious.

324
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
Say, why don't we
just have one, hmmm?

325
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:17,700
Would you like one?

326
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,586
No, sir.

327
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,753
Please forget
my atrocious remark just now.

328
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,433
I swear, I have never laid
a finger on your cookies!

329
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,733
- Right?
- Yes.

330
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:29,866
Yes.

331
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,120
Did Mr. Lee just
prepare his own tea?

332
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,753
Yes, I saw it with
my own two eyes!

333
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,400
It was so scary!

334
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:01,686
What's with him today?

335
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,686
Making his own copies,
making his own tea...

336
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:06,066
I think I know.

337
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,586
Gather around,
if you think you can handle this.

338
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,353
We're all here!

339
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:12,533
What I think is...

340
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:14,600
Well...

341
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:20,366
It looks like he's implying
he wants to fire us!

342
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,186
In other words, it's

343
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:24,386
'I can manage just fine
without you lot.'

344
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:25,753
What?

345
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,420
No, I don’t think so.

346
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,020
I think it is!

347
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,733
Else there is no way to
explain all his strange behavior!

348
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:35,420
That's true, but...

349
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,100
What do I do?

350
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,186
My daughter's going to
turn one soon.

351
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,986
Actually, before that...
What about my mortgage?

352
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,020
What about me?

353
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,200
There are so many things
I still want to eat!

354
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:48,586
Guess that means
everyone is worried.

355
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,720
So you should've worked on
earning more certifications

356
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,086
before you receive the pink slip!

357
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,500
Like me.

358
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:55,720
Sweetie.

359
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,566
If you've time for that,
work on your personality?

360
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,866
Because I'm yet to meet a person
who's worse than you!

361
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,200
Then what about me?

362
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Mr. Bae Youn-seung,

363
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,800
interns need to
worry about nothing.

364
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,266
You really think
this signals restructuring?

365
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,533
This is like the
night before the storm!

366
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,333
I mean, what is going on?
Ever since this morning...

367
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:26,700
Ah, you're back.

368
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:46,700
Hang on.

369
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:49,600
This is the first tea I made myself.

370
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,166
Yes, I should give this to
Ms. Kim.

371
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,200
Wait right there.

372
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,600
Did you call for me?

373
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:25,433
Take a seat.

374
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,186
This is the first tea
I made myself, ever,

375
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:37,300
so I wanted to give it to you.

376
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,200
Go on and taste it.

377
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,153
Uh, Mr. Lee?
I have something to tell...

378
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,600
Have a sip first, then let's talk.

379
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,300
At this rate, the first tea
I ever brewed is going to get cold.

380
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,033
Yes, sir.

381
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:02,600
Ah, hot! Ah...

382
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,566
Ah, hot!

383
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:06,600
Hot!

384
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,520
Are you alright?

385
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
Did you hurt yourself?
Come on, say ah.

386
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,153
- I said, say ah.
- No...

387
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,153
It's alright, say ah!

388
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,353
- I'm... I'm fine.
- Say ah!

389
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,386
- Ah!
- I'm fine.

390
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,833
Ah...

391
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:45,666
I have something to announce.

392
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,033
Today is actually
a very special day for me.

393
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,466
Special... Day?

394
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:59,886
Yes, today is the first
"communication day"

395
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:02,633
that I've long had in mind.

396
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,220
Communication Day?

397
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,753
Yes, it's like... Sitting down and

398
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,420
making eye contact with
each and every one of you,

399
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,453
who have been
working around the clock

400
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,966
supporting me.

401
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,700
And the first one to do it
was Ms. Kim.

402
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:27,453
Alright, then. Let me proceed with
our next employee,

403
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:28,600
in making eye contact.

404
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,633
Mr. Jung.

405
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,000
Thank you for everything.

406
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:54,966
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

407
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,833
Uh, Mr. Lee?

408
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,086
We have piles of proposals that
need your review.

409
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,086
You'll need to confirm them,

410
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,300
so that our projects that are
waiting can go ahead.

411
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,753
Oh, is that right?

412
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:08,933
Yes, sir.

413
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:13,353
Sorry to disappoint you all,

414
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:14,786
but you'll have to look forward to
the second communication day

415
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:17,233
which will be held next year.

416
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,733
Thank you everyone.

417
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,733
Ah, yes. Goodbye, sir.

418
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:32,966
Thank you.

419
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,553
What was that?

420
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:55,553
Hmmm?

421
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:58,033
Why this "communication day,"
all of a sudden?

422
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,553
Right?

423
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:02,353
Do you think Mr. Lee felt that
our team lacked communication?

424
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,353
No.

425
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,266
I think I know what's up.

426
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,333
This is all because of...

427
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,500
...Ms. Kim.

428
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,553
What?

429
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:14,300
I don't know what you mean.

430
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:16,600
Come on, be honest.

431
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:20,233
You kept it a secret from us, but...

432
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,786
...You proposed it to him,
didn't you?

433
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:29,153
You suggested this day so
he can take better care of us!

434
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:32,933
Because Mr. Lee is never someone
to come up with such a thing!

435
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,053
I mean, it totally has to be
your idea, Ms. Kim!

436
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,300
Is this true, Ms. Kim?

437
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,566
Yes, well... Uh...

438
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,586
Hey, there's no need!

439
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:49,333
It was so awkward that
I almost died!

440
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:53,486
But if he's really trying to
look out for us,

441
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:55,566
then it means there's no
restructuring taking place, right?

442
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,666
You're right. But how do you
explain everything else?

443
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:11,700
Man...

444
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,666
Communication Day?

445
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:21,233
Young-joon, you...

446
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,633
That was simply brilliant!

447
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,953
What do you think, Ms. Kim?

448
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,900
We got away with it
so naturally, didn't we?

449
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:39,033
Mr. Lee.

450
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,700
You managing things on your own...

451
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:46,533
It's making me uncomfortable.

452
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:52,353
I think you had a slip of tongue.

453
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:55,433
Don't you mean "comfortable,"
not "uncomfortable?"

454
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,900
No, it's not making me
feel comfortable at all.

455
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,153
Because my pride won't allow
special treatment,

456
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:03,233
just because I'm your girlfriend.

457
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,566
Is it such a problem that
I'm only doing my work?

458
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,553
But it's been my work for
these past 9 years.

459
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:14,620
So please. Let me continue
doing what I've been doing.

460
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,333
Then...

461
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:18,333
Ms. Kim.

462
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,333
I understand what you said.

463
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,753
But you know,

464
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,720
I don't want to make you do
all those trivial...

465
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,633
Trivial?

466
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,666
They're all part of my work.

467
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,520
I made the effort to
carry them out to perfection,

468
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,233
and I felt proud, watching how it
pleased my boss.

469
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,620
But how you described it just now...

470
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,800
I'm disappointed that
you don't respect my work.

471
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,833
I should be the one
who's disappointed.

472
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,320
Don't you really understand
why I did all that?

473
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,020
Do you think it was easy for me,

474
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,820
trying to do something
all by myself when

475
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,300
all my life, I've been
serviced to?

476
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:02,933
It was hard, but still,
I wanted to do it for you.

477
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,233
I wanted to be goo to you.

478
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,133
Still... Don't be like that
from now on.

479
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,800
This is our workplace,

480
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,933
and it's still office hours.

481
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,420
Even from now on,
I have no choice but to

482
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,020
carry on as usual,
in order to keep the line between

483
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,833
Ms. Kim and "Kim Mi-so."

484
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,966
Because I want to
guard my territory, too.

485
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,600
So please understand.

486
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,166
You're too rational.

487
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:37,133
Then... Please excuse me.

488
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,966
She's right, yet...

489
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:51,833
Why do I feel this way?

490
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,900
Uh, Ms. Kim?

491
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,333
Did you do make a mistake
in front of Mr. Lee?

492
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,386
It's nothing like that.

493
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:23,433
But it looks like it.
The mood between you two...

494
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:28,920
I don't know what it is,
but can't you just apologize?

495
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,400
This is scaring me too much.

496
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:35,353
Well, I don't think
I've done anything wrong.

497
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,920
Still...

498
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,053
Until now, even if you did
nothing wrong,

499
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,000
you always just let
Mr. Lee have his way.

500
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,100
Sorry?

501
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,533
I just don't get it.

502
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,386
How could she be so rational?

503
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:17,120
How could she draw
such a fine line?

504
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,786
That workaholic woman who knows
nothing but work!

505
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,520
But isn't that why you kept her
by your side for 9 years,

506
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,886
because she was so rational

507
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,900
and knew where to draw the line?

508
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,586
She just doesn't know men.

509
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,000
Is it because she's never
dated anyone?

510
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,786
Isn't it your first time
dating anyone, as well?

511
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,886
All was good just a few hours ago,

512
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:38,453
but now it feels like
a small spark has

513
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:40,866
grown into a disaster.

514
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,433
You won't listen to anything
that's against you, huh?

515
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,033
Well, that's what love is.

516
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:53,266
A small difference in perspectives
will lead to conflict.

517
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,666
But!

518
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,853
If those quarrels get longer
and more frequent,

519
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:01,500
it'll only end badly.

520
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:04,186
- Like me.
- What?

521
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:07,066
Are you cursing a couple
who only just started out?

522
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,833
Mr. CEO...

523
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,433
Young-joon...

524
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,733
Don’t drag this on for too long.

525
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,820
Otherwise, you'll lose her.

526
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,233
Like me.

527
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:50,866
What's with him?

528
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:01,986
Until now, even if you did
nothing wrong,

529
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,033
you always just let
Mr. Lee have his way.

530
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,820
I used to apologize for
all the things that

531
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,533
I didn't feel like
apologizing for, but...

532
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:12,200
...Now it's not so easy.

533
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:17,000
Maybe we can have
a chat over this?

534
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:28,033
Um... Ms. Kim?

535
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:30,153
May I go ahead first?

536
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:31,766
I'm moving today, so...

537
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,486
Sure, go ahead.

538
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:34,720
Good luck with moving!

539
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,253
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow!

540
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,633
Alright.

541
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,833
Is that all my schedule for today?

542
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:01,966
Go on. Say that there's one thing
left and it's making up.

543
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,866
Yes, that's it for today, sir.

544
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,520
Go on. Ask me to dinner
so we can make up.

545
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,766
I see.

546
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,153
You should go home too, then.

547
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:16,353
Don't say you'll go home,

548
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:18,166
tell me you want to go somewhere
with me, anywhere!

549
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:20,500
Yes, sir. Then I'll head off, too.

550
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:23,986
Come on. Say Ms. Kim can go,

551
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:26,086
but Mi-so needs to
stay for a date.

552
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,600
Alright.

553
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,400
Then... See you.

554
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:35,266
Go on. Say, 'What are you doing?
Come with me!'

555
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,766
Say 'Don't go!'

556
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,233
Gosh, how many times
have I told you?

557
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:56,066
Mom, it's room 301, not room 302!

558
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:59,253
Send my things to
this address, alright?

559
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,433
Bye.

560
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:03,353
Hello.

561
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,620
This is for room 301, is it?

562
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,053
- Yes.
- Sorry I'm late.

563
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:07,820
It's alright. We're almost done,
just these to go.

564
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,966
Thank you.

565
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,200
Ah, nice. So beautiful!

566
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,100
Hey, I say I can use this.

567
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Come with me.

568
00:44:56,033 --> 00:44:57,466
Huh?

569
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,153
Hello.

570
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,320
Did you happen to see
a fan that was just here?

571
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,386
A fan?

572
00:45:05,466 --> 00:45:06,720
Was that yours?

573
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,986
The guy at the rooftop
took it with him.

574
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:10,166
What?

575
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:11,866
Ugh...

576
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:22,986
I thought you were abandoned
because you were broken,

577
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:24,533
but you work just fine!

578
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,786
I announce you the
Mr. Koh Gui-nam of fans.

579
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:29,100
Fan-Koh.

580
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:31,733
Fan-Koh... Haha!

581
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,120
What is it?

582
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,066
Here to say hi to your neighbors?

583
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:41,066
Say hi?

584
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,700
You really did take my fan!

585
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:47,800
What's this?
Why did you steal my fan?

586
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:51,233
Oh, this was yours?

587
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:55,400
I thought someone had
thrown it out!

588
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,886
So why did you
abandon it on the road?

589
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,453
Abandon it? I was in the middle of
moving all my things!

590
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:04,886
And does it look like
I want to throw this out?

591
00:46:04,966 --> 00:46:06,220
It's in top shape!

592
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,253
People these days will
throw away everything!

593
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,620
Including this table here.

594
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,333
Someone threw it out, so I...

595
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,966
I mean, it's not like
I took it or anything.

596
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:18,553
But anyway, alright.

597
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:21,520
I won't ask questions,
but just give it back to you.

598
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,900
Ask questions?
It was mine from the beginning!

599
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,333
Phew...

600
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,533
(Pil-nam)

601
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,000
Hey, Sis.

602
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,966
No, forget drinks.

603
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm too tired.

604
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,200
Alright, bye.

605
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:14,033
Looks so delicious!

606
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:19,166
You've got to have Chinese food
on the day you're moving!

607
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,666
Who is it?

608
00:47:36,866 --> 00:47:39,600
What's with these
random cherry tomatoes?

609
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:42,620
Random cherry tomatoes?

610
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,166
They're my precious babies
that I grew like my own,

611
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,633
planting the seeds and
watering them every day!

612
00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:54,933
Go on, take them.

613
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,533
My arms are starting to ache.

614
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,233
Why are you giving me
your precious cherry tomatoes?

615
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,566
Sorry about just then.

616
00:48:12,966 --> 00:48:15,486
Think of it as
a welcome gift as your senior,

617
00:48:15,566 --> 00:48:18,700
and for borrowing your fan
just now.

618
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:23,533
Then please excuse me.

619
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:35,033
Was I too harsh on him?

620
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:53,086
When ordering food,

621
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,820
you can't order for one person
so I'd always end up with leftovers.

622
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,686
Don't tell me...
You're inviting me?

623
00:48:57,766 --> 00:48:58,686
Ha, no way!

624
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,020
I'm just saying,
when you order food,

625
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,686
if you could halve it
and bring it to me.

626
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:06,100
Then you won't have to
waste any food!

627
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,833
What's this?

628
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:30,766
It was too much for me...
So here's some for you.

629
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:33,300
Then please excuse me.

630
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,200
Wait, Ji-ah.

631
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,320
No need to say thanks.

632
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,353
Think of it as
thanking you for the tomatoes.

633
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:41,920
No, it's not about that.

634
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,520
In the future, if you must,
order fried rice with shrimps.

635
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,000
See, I love the juicy texture of
those shrimps.

636
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,620
- What?
- And about sweet & sour beef.

637
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,620
Rather than
pouring the sauce over it,

638
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,000
I like to dip each one
into the sauce...

639
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:57,453
I want it back.

640
00:49:57,533 --> 00:50:01,133
No, I'll have to
accept your kind offer.

641
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:02,386
Kind offer?

642
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,800
No, it's just so we're even!

643
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,866
Then let me take it,
so we're even.

644
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,420
Actually, no need.

645
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,420
Just give it back.

646
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,320
Well, not for me.

647
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,853
Well, you know what?

648
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:14,686
I like tomatoes better than
the cherry tomatoes!

649
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:15,886
Well, I have the big ones
growing right there,

650
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:16,886
so I'll give them to you
next time.

651
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:18,553
They're still not ready, are they?
So give this back, now!

652
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:19,733
I'm going to eat everything!

653
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,920
(A meeting that began
with coincidence)

654
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,400
(might just be fate
Lee Sung-yeon)

655
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,833
I wouldn't have made it on my own.

656
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,453
So I don't want to
ever let go of this person,

657
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:43,100
who was with me through that time.

658
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:46,900
I'm going to risk my everything
to hold onto that hand.

659
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:04,800
(Kim Mi-so)

660
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:25,100
Not a single call from Mr. Lee.

661
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:33,666
Who is it?

662
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,033
Mr. Lee!

663
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:55,666
Were you sleeping?

664
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:59,166
It's too early for that.

665
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,533
Uh...

666
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,220
About today...

667
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,786
- Delivery for you!
- Delivery...

668
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:09,253
Sorry?

669
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,386
Are you Ms. Kim Mi-so?

670
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:12,233
Yes, thank you.

671
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
(Dolsan Mustard Leaf Kimchi)

672
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,666
Dolsan Mustard Leaf kimchi?

673
00:52:24,466 --> 00:52:27,620
Oh, this is a steady seller on
the home shopping channel.

674
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,033
It's really delicious.

675
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,833
- Then I want some.
- Sorry?

676
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,933
Let's have them together.

677
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:41,620
With this.

678
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,100
What is it?

679
00:52:43,533 --> 00:52:45,066
Your favorite.

680
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:50,700
Then come in.

681
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,833
Or not.

682
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,433
(Bye to Rinds)

683
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:10,786
Hey, this is my favorite place.

684
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,653
Did you go all the way there?

685
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:13,853
Of course.

686
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:15,366
And I grilled them
especially for you, too.

687
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,020
Excuse me!

688
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,500
Can I have these to go?

689
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:37,553
Oh, that's right.

690
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:41,433
The lady there remembered
that I went with you.

691
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,253
So she gave me
some insects on the house.

692
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,266
Said they were your favorite.

693
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:47,686
In... Insects?

694
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,900
Yes.

695
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,966
Oh, silkworm pupae!

696
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:02,686
Animal rinds and insects...

697
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:04,900
My girlfriend sure has
a peculiar palate.

698
00:54:06,866 --> 00:54:08,166
Thank you.

699
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,866
For bringing you your favorites?

700
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:15,466
No, for coming here.

701
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
I wanted to see you.

702
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,133
So why are you
so rational at work?

703
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,720
Well, there's your position,
and there's mine, too.

704
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,033
So I wanted to be
extra careful.

705
00:54:37,633 --> 00:54:41,533
So I guess I ended up being
more cautious than usual.

706
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:46,233
Anyway, sorry if that
made you feel sad, Mr. Lee.

707
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,300
I'm not liking this.

708
00:54:53,966 --> 00:54:55,986
Come on, that's not the
way to go here.

709
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:57,933
I even apologized to you.

710
00:54:58,366 --> 00:54:59,486
I didn’t mean that.

711
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:00,620
I meant what you call me by.

712
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,033
From now on, call me oppa.

713
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,100
What?

714
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,953
Can't we just call each other
like we do now?

715
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:16,733
Besides, you still
call me "Ms. Kim."

716
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:18,620
Then I'll call you Mi-so.

717
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,733
Mi-so?

718
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,300
Call me,

719
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:24,533
Oppa.

720
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,666
Op...

721
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:49,966
Op...

722
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:52,966
Ooop...

723
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:55,986
Op.

724
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:57,266
Oppa.

725
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,666
Maybe not today, but next time.

726
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,433
Let's take it
one step at a time, alright?

727
00:56:12,866 --> 00:56:14,166
Mi-so!

728
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:16,286
Mi-so, your sisters are here!
Open the door!

729
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:17,366
Sisters?

730
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:19,753
- Mi-so!
- I guess I should say hello.

731
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,766
Because I certainly want to move
things along in our relationship.

732
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:24,886
No, not now.

733
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:26,253
Come with me.

734
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,553
- Why?
- Mi-so!

735
00:56:27,633 --> 00:56:28,800
Ms. Kim, let me say...

736
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:31,033
Kim Mi-so!

737
00:56:31,766 --> 00:56:33,186
Let me say hi to your...

738
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,400
Shhh!

739
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,266
You're telling me to
hide in here?

740
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,433
Ms... Ms. Kim!

741
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:45,586
Ms. Kim,

742
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:47,386
I'm Lee Young-joon,
Vice President of Yumyung Group!

743
00:56:47,466 --> 00:56:49,000
Right now, you're my boyfriend!

744
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,533
Stay still.

745
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,753
But Ms. Kim!

746
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:55,933
But...

747
00:56:57,633 --> 00:56:58,800
Just be quiet for a while.

748
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:14,586
Oh what?

749
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:15,766
So you were home.

750
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,620
Why didn't you open the
door for us, then?

751
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,900
I fell asleep.

752
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,053
So what brings you here?

753
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:26,653
You sounded down over the phone,

754
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:29,433
so we came to cheer you up!

755
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,600
You'll be happy when we show you
just what we got for you!

756
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,466
It is...

757
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:40,366
Bye to Rinds! Yes, rinds!

758
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:43,486
Let's eat them...

759
00:57:43,566 --> 00:57:44,800
...Or you were already eating.

760
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,333
I just suddenly felt like them.

761
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:52,000
But why two?

762
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:55,933
Right. Don't tell me,
chopsticks in each hand?

763
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:57,886
Well, uh...

764
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:01,700
Don't tell me, you brought that
VP in here again?

765
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:06,720
No, he just stayed for the rinds
and left right away.

766
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,886
Ha!

767
00:58:07,966 --> 00:58:11,320
What, does he have nowhere else
to go when he's a chaebol?

768
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,386
Last time, he came and
had ramen, too!

769
00:58:13,466 --> 00:58:14,533
What, did he?

770
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,853
So it was ramen last time,

771
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:18,466
and now it's the rinds this time?

772
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:21,786
But come on, he's a chaebol!

773
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,266
I didn’t serve it to him today.

774
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,820
He bought them for me.

775
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,753
That totally ruins it!

776
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:29,453
What, rinds and not
top-grade hanwoo beef?

777
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:32,266
Can't believe he's so stingy
when he's a chaebol!

778
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,186
Mi-so,

779
00:58:35,266 --> 00:58:38,620
we told you.
That guy is a big no!

780
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,453
He's different from us.

781
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:42,686
Right?

782
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:45,720
Even if you two hit it off,
his family will be against you.

783
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,586
They'll slide you
an envelope and say,

784
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,100
'Get your dirty hands off my son!'

785
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,200
And what if they pour their
glass over your head?

786
00:58:53,266 --> 00:58:56,086
Come on, you've been watching
too many dramas!

787
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:59,420
Well, even if they did approve,
I won't have it.

788
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,053
From what I heard from you,
that man, he...

789
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:03,766
Well, he's a total
selfish, egoistic bastard!

790
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,886
Hey, when did I say that?

791
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:09,320
But more than that,

792
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,633
didn't you say he has
sexual dysfunction and can't kiss?

793
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,553
Tell him, if he has time to
fool around like this,

794
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:16,566
he should drop by into our clinic.

795
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:21,320
Hey, let's get down to the
details over some drinks.

796
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
- Bring the alcohol.
- Sure!

797
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,586
Go on, Mi-so.

798
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:33,253
Mmm, so good! Cheers!

799
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:34,633
Mi-so, cheers!

800
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,200
Come on, just one more!
Why are you telling us to leave?

801
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,853
Just one more, alright?

802
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:43,866
Next time, next time!

803
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,833
Let's go!

804
00:59:50,366 --> 00:59:52,300
Bye, sisters!

805
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,433
Mr. Lee...

806
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,300
Ms. Kim.

807
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,166
Just how did you brief
about me to them?

808
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,753
Well, it's not what you think.

809
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:30,320
Instead of all the blockbuster-scale
dates I took you out on,

810
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,766
you just talked about that
ramen incident?

811
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,566
And me, selfish?

812
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:38,986
If I really was selfish,

813
01:00:39,066 --> 01:00:40,120
would I have gone and
bought your favorite,

814
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,533
animal rinds and insects?

815
01:00:42,766 --> 01:00:43,900
I'm sorry.

816
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:47,466
I understand why you're mad.

817
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:54,966
Let's stop here.

818
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:08,800
What if this turns into
another fight?

819
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:11,200
When we only just made up, right?

820
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:28,066
And I can't be mad anymore
because you're too beautiful.

821
01:02:21,466 --> 01:02:24,433
I feel bad about putting you
in an awkward position,

822
01:02:24,733 --> 01:02:27,266
by acting too recklessly.

823
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:31,333
I'll be dropping by,
so can we please talk?

824
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,366
Good morning, Ms. Kim.

825
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,166
Um...

826
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:52,266
Can I go see him?

827
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:58,933
I want to tell him clearly
and settle things.

828
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,100
Alright.

829
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,600
Have you been well?

830
01:03:33,633 --> 01:03:34,866
Yes, well...

831
01:03:35,966 --> 01:03:39,000
I felt bad when I realized
you were avoiding my calls.

832
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:41,200
So thanks for coming.

833
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:43,500
It's so nice to see you.

834
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,000
About then... Sorry to
confess to you so suddenly.

835
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:57,166
But I wanted to tell you
how I felt about you.

836
01:03:58,033 --> 01:04:00,066
Guess it
surprised you though, right?

837
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,266
Yes.

838
01:04:02,866 --> 01:04:05,600
Because that wasn't why
I met with you.

839
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,220
You were someone who protected me

840
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,366
in that difficult situation
when we were little.

841
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:16,166
So I wanted to
see you again, someday.

842
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,200
But...

843
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:21,100
That doesn’t mean
I liked you in that way.

844
01:04:23,466 --> 01:04:24,500
Which is why...

845
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:26,933
I can't...

846
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,866
...Accept your feelings.

847
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,133
Is it...

848
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,766
...Because of Young-joon?

849
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,253
Yes.

850
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:41,466
You...

851
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,086
Do you know
how hard it was for me,

852
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:44,833
because of that bastard?

853
01:04:45,266 --> 01:04:47,186
Do you know how I felt
when I gave up everything

854
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:48,120
and chose to go abroad,

855
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,966
after all those
years of suffering?

856
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,166
It's that again, is it?

857
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:01,966
How long are you going to
keep up that repertoire?

858
01:05:02,533 --> 01:05:03,700
Don't you even get tired of it?

859
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,366
Get tired of it?

860
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:06,900
How could you say so?

861
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,500
I still remember it vividly.

862
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:13,000
Which is why
I'm still living in pain.

863
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:16,300
But you...
It must be easy for you.

864
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,700
Because you managed to get away by
erasing those memories.

865
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:21,866
Stop your sarcasm.

866
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,833
And stop calling out Mi-so
for your nonsense.

867
01:05:25,433 --> 01:05:27,700
If you say that crap to her
one more time,

868
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,433
then I won't forgive you,
even if you're my family.

869
01:05:39,466 --> 01:05:40,633
Let's go.

870
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:57,400
Um, Mr. Lee?

871
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,353
It looks like your brother is
having such a hard time.

872
01:06:04,433 --> 01:06:05,733
Don't you feel bad for him?

873
01:06:07,966 --> 01:06:11,233
The past he's obsessed with
isn't in my memories.

874
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,453
Feeling sorry for
what I don't even remember...

875
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,800
Isn't that just cheap pretense?

876
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,600
Anyway, I don’t want to
talk about this anymore.

877
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,366
Alright.

878
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:38,366
Where are we going?

879
01:06:39,866 --> 01:06:41,153
Going for a drive.

880
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:43,900
Today, I'll be Kim Mi-so's
personal assistant.

881
01:06:49,766 --> 01:06:51,333
As I thought, you're prettier
when you smile.

882
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:55,633
Is there anywhere
you've wanted to go?

883
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,000
Well...

884
01:06:58,266 --> 01:07:00,300
I want to go for a walk somewhere.

885
01:07:12,466 --> 01:07:13,800
This is really nice.

886
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:19,400
Are you feeling cold?

887
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:21,366
A little bit.

888
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,366
We're by the river,
so it's a bit chilly out here.

889
01:07:24,766 --> 01:07:25,933
Hold it right there.

890
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,900
Here. Put this on.

891
01:07:43,966 --> 01:07:45,200
Thank you.

892
01:07:46,033 --> 01:07:47,400
Oh, it's burgundy.

893
01:07:47,966 --> 01:07:50,633
I think burgundy
really suits you, Mr. Lee.

894
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,600
You're wrong.

895
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,586
Everything suits me,

896
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,500
but burgundy just suits me
more than the others.

897
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,100
Oh, sure.

898
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,820
Oh, these aren't my own words.

899
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,820
They were the very words
by a fashion designer

900
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,933
who treasured me dearly.

901
01:08:06,566 --> 01:08:08,686
Who is he? Do I know him?

902
01:08:08,766 --> 01:08:11,633
No, he's a friend of my mother
so you wouldn't know.

903
01:08:12,766 --> 01:08:14,733
He'd dote on me
ever since I was little,

904
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,400
and would even make
clothes for me.

905
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:19,020
Make clothes for you?

906
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,053
Yes, he said he didn't even
make them for his nephew.

907
01:08:22,133 --> 01:08:24,033
But I was special.

908
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,886
That cardigan...
Mr. Jang Jeong-do, the designer,

909
01:08:29,966 --> 01:08:32,386
had made it especially for him...

910
01:08:32,466 --> 01:08:34,753
And though he's my son,
he looked so good in it.

911
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:38,486
I still remember
how cute he looked on that day,

912
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:40,200
when he stepped out
in that cardigan.

913
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:54,000
No misunderstandings.

914
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,100
It's not because
I find it boring being with you,

915
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,133
but because being around you is
so relaxing and comfortable.

916
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,220
Is it because my heart's at peace?

917
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,633
These days,
I just want to sleep and sleep.

918
01:09:06,066 --> 01:09:08,266
Then shall we go back to the
car for a little rest?

919
01:09:15,233 --> 01:09:16,633
I know it's no manners to
do that during a date, but...

920
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,566
Maybe just for a little while?

921
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,600
Let's go.

922
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,886
Didn't he look cold?

923
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:51,653
He's weak against the cold.

924
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:53,433
What if we catch a cold?

925
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:54,753
I'm fine!

926
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,086
I don't mean you, I mean me.

927
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:57,586
What if I catch a cold?

928
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:58,766
Oh...

929
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:00,500
That's right. You get cold easily.

930
01:10:01,133 --> 01:10:03,053
I won't ever forget
your name, then!

931
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:06,520
Your name was... Lee...

932
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,233
Dummy, there you go again.

933
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,986
That's not what my name is.
My name is Lee...

934
01:10:12,066 --> 01:10:15,133
How was he?
How was my Hyeon?

935
01:10:17,966 --> 01:10:21,600
Yes. She definitely had said
"Hyeon," back then.

936
01:10:24,866 --> 01:10:27,686
Did I remember it wrong
because I was so young then?

937
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:31,733
Because the pronunciation was
so similar?

938
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,500
Sung... Sung-hyeon?

939
01:10:51,066 --> 01:10:53,366
What?

940
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:23,286
(Thank you to Ms. Jung Su-young)

941
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:24,900
(and Mr. Mihal Ashminov for
their special appearance)

942
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,933
(What's with Secretary Kim?)

943
01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:50,986
I don't want to...

944
01:11:51,066 --> 01:11:52,753
...Worry about us, anymore.

945
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:55,066
When you meet her family,
just put your hands together and...

946
01:11:55,366 --> 01:11:57,620
Yes, yes! All sounds good!

947
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,033
And do everything that
they tell you to!

948
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:00,620
Here we go!

949
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,733
Clams!

950
01:12:02,533 --> 01:12:04,586
You've heard of the saying,
the have's have it more?

951
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:05,586
Well, that'll be me.

952
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:06,820
I'm the full package.

953
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,833
Which one of you is "oppa?"

954
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:12,100
Oppa!

955
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:14,453
I will prove myself to
your sisters

956
01:12:14,533 --> 01:12:16,153
by all means and methods,

957
01:12:16,233 --> 01:12:18,300
so don't cry from now on.
