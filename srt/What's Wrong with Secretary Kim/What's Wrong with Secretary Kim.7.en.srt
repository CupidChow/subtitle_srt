00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,300
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,253
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,366
Why did I hire you?

8
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,066
Are you curious?

9
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:35,600
Sorry?

10
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:40,500
Yes.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,666
Because you were Mi-so.

12
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:11,433
Kim Mi-so.

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,866
What do you...

14
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:25,566
Are you saying you knew me
before we met?

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,466
Like that's possible.

16
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,820
But I've always been curious.

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,186
When I was working as
a temp in General Affairs,

18
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,920
my supervisor suggested
I apply for the PA position.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,753
I thought there was
no way I'd get it,

20
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,133
so I was quite surprised
when I found out I did.

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,566
I want to know what that meant.

22
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,766
It doesn't mean anything.

23
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,700
As I just said, I hired you
because you were Kim Mi-so.

24
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,333
Because Kim Mi-so...

25
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,700
...Was the least qualified candidate.

26
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,220
What?

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,186
This position required
accompanying me to the U.S.

28
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:18,053
for a long, hard journey ahead,

29
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,666
so I thought someone who was
too qualified wouldn't last.

30
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,386
That's why I chose the
least qualified candidate.

31
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:26,786
Someone who'd never be
headhunted elsewhere,

32
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,600
and someone who'd have
no reason to quit.

33
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:35,300
And here I was, thinking that
there was some other reason.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,300
Then I'll get going, sir.

35
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,366
With my brother...

36
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,066
Did you have a nice chat
about the old days?

37
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,766
I saw you two,
talking to each other just then.

38
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,100
Oh...

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
How does it feel to finally meet
that boy you were looking for?

40
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,700
It was nice...

41
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:28,100
But at the same time,
I still can't believe it's real.

42
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,433
I see.

43
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,366
Guess you must've
heard about me, then?

44
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,133
About how I left him there and

45
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,766
that's why he had to
go through all that.

46
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,120
Yes.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,166
He also told me that you lost
all your memories from then.

48
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,286
But doesn't that mean

49
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,600
it was also too painful an incident
for you to remember?

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
So don't blame yourself.

51
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,653
I'll really get going now, sir.

52
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,100
See you tomorrow.

53
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:13,433
(To my oppa)

54
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,086
(I'm great at hide-and-seek,)

55
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:27,400
(so I'm going to
find you one day!)

56
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:42,900
(Resume
Kim Mi-so)

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,933
Are you saying you knew me
before we met?

58
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:52,753
Do you drink?

59
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,753
Well, not really...

60
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,466
Just pour her one.

61
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,620
- For our newbie!
- For our newbie!

62
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,820
- I'll be in your care.
- No, that should be my line.

63
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,000
Mr. Lee?

64
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,566
Mr. Lee?

65
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,886
Ah. Is there something
you wanted to say?

66
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,033
Well...

67
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,420
You don't need to force yourself
to come to these gatherings...

68
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,553
No, no.

69
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,886
This is all part of work.

70
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,166
Oh...

71
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,900
And I'm glad I came.

72
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,133
What's your name?

73
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,633
Oh, it's Kim Mi-so, sir.

74
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,920
- Ms. Kim Mi-so.
- Yes?

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Do you know who I am?

76
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,133
Yes. You're the President's son.

77
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
Was I wrong?

78
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,853
No, you're right.

79
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,666
Ah.

80
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:11,400
- Mi-so, cheers!
- Cheers.

81
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,120
I'll be in your care!

82
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
Let me pour it for you.

83
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:22,766
Good.

84
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:28,853
Oh, about that PA position for
my transfer.

85
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:32,586
I hear there's a temp employee
in General Affairs.

86
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,053
Why not have her
submit her resume, too?

87
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,233
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,366
Good morning, sir.

89
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,953
My name is Kim Mi-so, and I am
your PA from today onward.

90
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,233
I'll do my best, sir.
I'll be in your care.

91
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,200
I'll be in your care, too,
Ms. Kim Mi-so.

92
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,153
You may lift your head now.

93
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,366
Sorry?

94
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,066
Ah, yes.

95
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,433
(Episode 7)

96
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,086
It wasn't Young-joon,
but his brother?

97
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,386
Yes.

98
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:42,166
The boy I was looking for
was his brother.

99
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,700
Are you disappointed?

100
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,853
Huh?

101
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,620
What do you mean...

102
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,620
Well, you found this person
but you look somewhat

103
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,486
disappointed to learn that
it wasn't Young-joon.

104
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:02,853
Me?

105
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,633
No, it's not like that.

106
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,820
Anyway, I thought I should let you
know to get the facts right,

107
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,166
so please pretend
you haven't heard anything, sir.

108
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,866
Then...

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,400
Man, so it wasn't Young-joon,
but his brother!

110
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,266
For some reason, I feel like that
puts him on the losing end.

111
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,886
Yes, Mr. Choi.

112
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,853
What, lunch today?

113
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,086
Sorry, I can't.

114
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,120
Yes, that morning meeting
may run into lunch.

115
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,186
Yes.

116
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:46,166
Alright, thanks.

117
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,233
Now, where are those files for...

118
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
Ms. Seol?

119
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,566
Ms. Seol.

120
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,100
Ms. Seol!

121
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,853
Ugh, I'm so tired.

122
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,453
I really want to just
sleep in tomorrow...

123
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:09,053
I know, right? A workshop
on the weekend, are you kidding me?

124
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,920
Hey, but we need to
hold one every year at least,

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,586
for team-building!

126
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,320
Plus, there's the Art Center.

127
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,720
Mr. Lee's particular
about that project,

128
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,686
so if we show him that we're
always thinking about it too...

129
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,353
Now that would make him so happy!

130
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:27,700
You bet it will!

131
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,366
Right?

132
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:36,086
Well, just put down something along
the lines of that in our schedule

133
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,586
and let's just enjoy the fresh air,

134
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,486
and maybe a drink, too!

135
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:47,020
Let's just think of it
as a relaxing excursion.

136
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,253
Wow...

137
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,220
That drink would taste so sweet
with a nice view...

138
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,253
Right?

139
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,720
I want to go, too!

140
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Like we can't make that happen.
Ms. Seol?

141
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,553
You're coming with us.

142
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,033
- Really?
- Of course!

143
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,953
Then I'll do the shopping, too!

144
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,320
I'll buy the meat and
get us drinks, too!

145
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,686
- Wow.
- Wow!

146
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,500
I've never seen you
on the move this fast!

147
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,820
Um, is Ms. Seol...

148
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,366
...She's here.

149
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,300
I've been looking
all over for you!

150
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,853
You should've just called me.

151
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,086
But you left your phone!

152
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,020
Oh...

153
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,020
So, what brings you...

154
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,220
Can you find those
audit files for me quick?

155
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,653
I need them for the
Yumyung Department meeting.

156
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,120
But sir.

157
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
That's for Friday.

158
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,066
And today's...

159
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:29,986
...Friday, isn't it?

160
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,653
Yes, it's Friday.

161
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,620
It's Friday alright.

162
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,266
Oh my gosh! Today's Friday?

163
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,033
Then I'll see you tomorrow!

164
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,820
Oh man.

165
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,420
You must be speechless.

166
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,853
No, no.

167
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,153
It's her goal to do that
once a day,

168
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,433
so I'm not surprised anymore.
Then please excuse me.

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,333
Once a day, he said!

170
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,086
Son,

171
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,120
when are you going to
spend time with me?

172
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,933
You were out all day
yesterday, too!

173
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,620
I'm sorry, I had someone important
I had to see.

174
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,200
Someone important?

175
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,120
Your girlfriend?

176
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,420
Well...

177
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,820
Maybe, in the future.

178
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,486
Again? You playboy!

179
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,786
This time, it's different.

180
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:28,700
We went round and around and fate
finally brought us together.

181
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:37,366
Is it because he's a writer?
Every word he says is so sweet.

182
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,320
Well honey, I feel the
same way about us.

183
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,933
About going round in circles until
fate finally brought us together.

184
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,266
How I wish we'd have just kept on
going round and round...

185
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,433
Hmpf.

186
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,400
Yes, Morpheus.

187
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:17,486
What? Lunch?

188
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:20,953
It was too sudden yesterday so
we didn't really get to talk.

189
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,433
And I believe we have
a lot to catch up on.

190
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,733
Here's the weekly reports.

191
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:45,966
And...

192
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,453
And?

193
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,520
Ms. Ji-ah will be accompanying you
to the U.K. Bio meeting,

194
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,253
and you won't be needing me,

195
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,533
so may I go ahead for lunch?

196
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,686
Are you seeing someone? Or...

197
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:06,466
Oh, Mr. Lee Sung-yeon
asked me to lunch.

198
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,320
Alright.

199
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,866
Thank you, sir.

200
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,153
Did you have a good sleep?

201
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,920
Because I didn't.

202
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,166
Sorry?

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,966
I couldn't sleep at all,

204
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:48,420
after learning that I wasn't alone
in that dark, scary place.

205
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,786
That left me with mixed feelings.

206
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:52,386
I was surprised myself.

207
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,633
To learn that you were
right here, all along.

208
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,066
What's the first thing you wanted
to do when you saw me again?

209
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,666
You said you were looking for me
for a very long time.

210
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:11,986
Well.

211
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:16,520
I only ever thought of
looking for you.

212
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,233
Am I like your first love?

213
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,033
Well, not quite...

214
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,753
Even if I'm not,

215
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,000
you'll help me find
my memory, right?

216
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,353
Mr. Lee.

217
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:45,833
How did you...

218
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,986
That should be my line, Ms. Kim.

219
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,286
Didn't you forget that
meeting with U.K. Bio?

220
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,820
But I told you sir, that
Ms. Ji-ah would be accompanying...

221
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,153
You've always accompanied me,

222
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,386
so you should be the one
coming with me too, this time.

223
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,086
You know that
they're particular about security

224
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:04,566
so they only like to see
familiar faces.

225
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,300
Did they?

226
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,900
They did.

227
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,653
I guess I'll have to
get going, then.

228
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,653
Alright, Mi-so.
Then see you later.

229
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,666
Ms. Kim, wait in the car.

230
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,600
Yes, sir.

231
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,586
Don't see Ms. Kim from now on.

232
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,220
That should be my line,
leave us alone.

233
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,566
'Us?'

234
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,586
The word 'us' is used to

235
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,186
describe a relationship like the one
Ms. Kim and I have.

236
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,800
Nine years of knowing and
adjusting to each other.

237
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,520
But did you know?

238
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,620
That for more than
those nine years,

239
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,566
Mi-so had been
looking for me, all this time.

240
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,586
She said she's always
longed to see me.

241
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,620
That's what we are. Two people
whom fate brought together

242
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,500
because we earnestly wished so.

243
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,153
Writing another novel?

244
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,353
Or is that from your new book?

245
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:21,120
Then too bad, it's too cliched to
win the readers this time.

246
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,333
Well.

247
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:26,733
We'll see whether it stays
a novel or becomes the real deal.

248
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,353
I thought I heard him say
he'll see you later.

249
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,086
What's this about?

250
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,786
Oh, I was planning to
meet him after work to

251
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,600
visit an area
that's being redeveloped.

252
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,753
An area that's being redeveloped?

253
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,400
Yes.

254
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:52,953
My actual neighborhood has become
Yumyung Land,

255
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:56,353
so you can't go there anymore.

256
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:59,686
So we thought about trying
a similar place.

257
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:03,233
Then that might trigger something.

258
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,720
Both Morpheus and I wanted to
try and remember what...

259
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,033
No, don't go.

260
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:14,933
I said, don't go.

261
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:24,966
But I want to go.

262
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
There are many things
I want to know.

263
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:39,720
Man, I'm so full now.

264
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,133
That bean stew was so delicious
that I had two bowls!

265
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,300
- We did eat a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

266
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:48,953
Hello.

267
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,853
Oh, hello.

268
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,520
Guess you're back from lunch?

269
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,766
Yes, we had some salad for
a light meal.

270
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,286
Oh my goodness!

271
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:04,353
Is that all
you're having for lunch?

272
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,520
But that won't do!

273
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,766
It won't fill your stomach at all.

274
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,286
Rather than filling my stomach,

275
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,886
I'd rather fill my head.

276
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:15,900
In other words, I'd rather work than
waste my time, eating.

277
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,853
Then...

278
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:20,820
As part of work,

279
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,620
we're going to a workshop tomorrow.
Will you join us?

280
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,353
Don't just...

281
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,786
I'm alright.

282
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,666
Then please excuse me,
I'm too busy.

283
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:32,433
Hey, Mr. Koh Gui-nam!

284
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,453
You know,

285
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,620
I heard the rumors.

286
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,786
Just what...

287
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:40,266
Gui-nam,

288
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:45,186
I heard you manage the whole week
with that one thing.

289
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,220
So you finally blew it? My secret?

290
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,253
Sorry?

291
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,486
It wasn't Ji-ah who told me!

292
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,033
And how is that a secret now?

293
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,920
Don't tell me.

294
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,220
Are you on guard because
you think I'll steal it from you?

295
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,000
I have too much heat, so I can't
even if you offered me one!

296
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,053
Just what do you mean...

297
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,753
Gui-nam...

298
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:16,220
I found it amazing how you survive
all those long nights...

299
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,153
I heard it's all thanks to that
ginseng juice from your mother!

300
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,653
People told me that's how you get
through that long week!

301
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:23,800
Ginseng juice...

302
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,020
Ginseng juice! So that's
what you were talking about.

303
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,486
- Yeah.
- Haha...

304
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh man.

305
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:37,386
Then you mean you have
some other secret?

306
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,420
No, you're right about that
ginseng juice.

307
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,786
Right?

308
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,600
You should call your mother to
thank her once more.

309
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,020
Now that I think about it,

310
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,820
I better go to that workshop to
learn more about my work.

311
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,466
Great!

312
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,033
Why?

313
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:11,686
Mr. Lee.

314
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:13,600
You didn't forget the
meeting tonight, did you?

315
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,433
Mr. Yang will be accompanying you.

316
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,553
What about you, Ms. Kim?

317
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,853
Off with your oppa for
memory-searching?

318
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,786
Sorry?

319
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:27,433
Well, uh...

320
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,300
D-don't go.

321
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,033
Don't go.

322
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:38,466
Don't go.

323
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,033
Then I'll get going.

324
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,220
Go where?

325
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,466
What? Down the memory lane?

326
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,020
Instead of trying to
search for memories,

327
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,933
how about making the effort to
build them with me?

328
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,586
Yes, Morpheus. I'm off work now.

329
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,766
I'll grab a taxi, and...

330
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,186
What's gotten into you?

331
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:29,486
Cancelling a social gathering
so we can play a game?

332
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:33,186
I'm not in the mood today to
listen to chit-chat.

333
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:34,566
Is something wrong?

334
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:37,766
Well.

335
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:54,120
Guess who!

336
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,353
What are you doing?

337
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,420
Take your hands off me.

338
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,033
I said, guess who!

339
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,586
If you don't take them off now,

340
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,486
you'll be taking your desk
out of your office instead!

341
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:07,953
Sorry, don't want to!

342
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,566
Not unless you guess who!

343
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,020
What do you mean, guess who?

344
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,900
You really think
I won't know it's you?

345
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:29,253
You may think you know
all about me,

346
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:32,220
but maybe you don't.

347
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,220
What?

348
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,253
I'm not just a friend.

349
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,320
I'm your true friend, Mr. CEO.

350
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,866
And I don't want to see you hurt...

351
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,720
I picked the most
similar place I could find.

352
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,853
So? Anything you remember?

353
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,233
Well...

354
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:07,553
The woman who kidnapped us was
seeing a married man.

355
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:11,453
But she aborted his child,
only to be rejected by him,

356
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,420
and had lost it.

357
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,420
Oh, that's right.

358
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,266
Now that you mention it,
there was one more person.

359
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,753
By the way,

360
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:27,066
do you remember how
we escaped from that place?

361
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,220
Well.

362
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,520
I don't really remember,

363
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,386
but we held our hands tight

364
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:38,653
as you took me home.

365
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,333
I brought you home?

366
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:50,353
By the way,

367
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:53,786
what did you call me by,
back then?

368
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:56,053
Oppa.

369
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,733
Then... Can't you just
keep on calling me the same?

370
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,300
And I'll drop the honorifics, too.

371
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,886
Young-joon, you!

372
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:43,920
What was that kick, huh?

373
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,253
There's no power!

374
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,053
You need to stretch those legs!
Yes, stretch them!

375
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:49,766
Guess you need
another lesson from me.

376
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,466
How about some sparring drills?

377
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:12,766
Sorry.

378
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,420
Is something wrong?

379
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,966
Why are you all angry?

380
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,353
There's something I don't want
to be taken from me.

381
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,233
Of course, no. Never in your life.

382
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,000
Not Ms. Kim.

383
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,520
What are you talking about?

384
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,720
This isn't about Ms. Kim...

385
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,120
Enough already, you sly CEO!

386
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,353
How long are you going to
use your cousin's friend

387
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:48,453
as an excuse, huh?

388
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:50,920
Why can't you just trust me and
confide in me already?

389
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,720
Come on, say it like a man.

390
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,433
Like a man!

391
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,953
- Well...
- Not that again!

392
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,686
Don't give me those excuses!

393
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:03,853
Just go and get her now!

394
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,300
You two can't just
keep on flirting forever.

395
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,986
Flirt?

396
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,520
What else, then?

397
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,453
You both have feelings for each
other, but you're not dating?

398
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,966
Is there another word to
replace "flirt" here?

399
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,186
Go.

400
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,386
Go and tell her how you feel,
and win her heart.

401
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:25,286
You're Lee Yong-joon,
for Christ's sake.

402
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,686
You're that tenacious brat who's

403
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:29,833
always had what he wanted,
whether it's a thing or a person!

404
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,333
- 'Brat?'
- Let's forget I said that.

405
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,466
Anyway, go for it!

406
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,100
This is the diary you asked about.

407
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,800
(To my oppa)

408
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:56,166
I hope it helps you to
find your memory.

409
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:00,453
Actually,

410
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:04,086
I blamed Young-joon
all my life, until now.

411
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,453
That if it weren't for him,

412
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:09,033
I wouldn't have had to
go through that.

413
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:13,786
But now that grudge has
started to disappear.

414
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:16,986
After hearing that
you were there with me, Mi-so.

415
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:18,253
What?

416
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,586
Because now I can share it
with you, Mi-so.

417
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,700
Actually, I'm even starting to
thank Young-joon.

418
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,866
One moment.

419
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,266
Yes, Mr. Lee.

420
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,886
What?

421
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,333
An emergency?

422
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:04,620
You didn't have to
drive her here yourself.

423
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,153
Oh, but I can't do that.

424
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,786
Because see, I'm a gentleman.

425
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:10,120
Then I'd like you to
leave like one.

426
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,720
Because we're busy.

427
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,366
There's been an emergency.

428
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,453
Your company sure had
many emergencies today.

429
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:19,020
Is it because the
Vice President is so inefficient?

430
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,453
It's quite the opposite.

431
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:23,353
He's always held in check, because
he's too talented.

432
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:27,833
But you wouldn't know, because
you were never talented like him.

433
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,820
You should get going,
I know you're busy, too.

434
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,686
Alright.

435
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:41,386
- I'll call you, Mi-so.
- 'Mi-so?'

436
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:43,986
Then take care, oppa.

437
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,633
'Oppa?'

438
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,520
'Oppa?'

439
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,986
You find it so easy
calling him that?

440
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:07,500
Yes. He's not my unni, is he?

441
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,120
What?

442
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,900
- Well, let's go.
- Actually,

443
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,320
there's no need.

444
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,253
What?

445
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm hungry. Make me ramen.

446
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,920
Me being hungry is an emergency.

447
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,586
Just what are you...

448
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:24,620
Did you forget who I am?

449
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,886
I'm the final decision-maker for
all of Yumyung's affairs

450
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:28,053
and holds all responsibilities.

451
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,253
My decisions can influence

452
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:33,286
the tens of thousands of workers
here and their families, too.

453
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:34,320
And?

454
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,320
And now I can't concentrate,
because of ramen!

455
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,433
Is there a bigger emergency
than this?

456
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,666
So cook me ramen, now!

457
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,153
This isn't the ramen I wanted.

458
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,433
And this isn't the situation
I wanted, either.

459
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,753
Why do you keep interrupting us?

460
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:06,720
Interrupt?

461
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,653
You'd pop up whenever
I was with Morpheus.

462
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,533
If that's not interrupting,
then what is?

463
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,553
I know that things aren't so
good with your brother.

464
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:17,653
But,

465
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,086
there are things I want to
know about my past...

466
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,886
Put your past behind you.

467
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:21,720
What?

468
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,953
People need to look to the future.

469
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,620
How long are you going to be
tied down by your past?

470
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,920
Is what's gone by
so important to you?

471
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,833
More important than
how your crush feels about it?

472
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,386
'Crush?'

473
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:37,520
Yes, your crush.

474
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,053
Though it's the most
frivolous word out there,

475
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:42,286
it's that word where there's no
equivalent to replace it.

476
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:45,353
You like me, and I like you.

477
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:49,153
So we're crushing on
each other, aren't we?

478
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,186
Well...

479
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,786
You admit it too, don't you?

480
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:54,633
That we're flirting with
each other.

481
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:57,186
And... what?

482
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:59,253
A boy you've been
desperately looking for?

483
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,920
A forgotten past
you want to know about?

484
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,753
Is this manners for your crush?

485
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,566
Here are your dumplings.

486
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,166
One more ramen here, please.

487
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,786
I don't think this is the place to
have this kind of conversation.

488
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,566
You're the one who brought us
to this place.

489
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:37,066
Ms. Kim,

490
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,886
I'm smart, I'm handsome,

491
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:44,966
I'm rich, and I'm also competent.

492
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,920
So...

493
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,833
Stop resisting already,
and just marry me.

494
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,253
This is...

495
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,353
...Different to when I asked you to

496
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,620
marry me or date me.

497
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,966
Back then...

498
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,620
I only said so because
I didn't want you quitting.

499
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,200
But not now.

500
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,566
I really mean it, this time.

501
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:15,086
So let's call this
crush thing quits,

502
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,366
and start dating.

503
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,700
No, I don't think we should.

504
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,133
Why not?

505
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,920
But aren't we at that stage?

506
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,120
We are, yes.

507
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,666
Then why can't we date already?

508
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:46,386
I don't want to
start a relationship

509
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:47,453
with words that were
fired on by jealousy

510
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,700
and your competitive spirit.

511
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,086
This mood, this whole situation...

512
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,466
It really puts me off.

513
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,200
What?

514
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:59,120
Anyway,

515
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,666
I don't think
now's the right timing. Then...

516
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,200
Well, now is the
right time for me! Right now!

517
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:18,733
How many times has it been now,
being rejected by the same woman?

518
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,900
How could he ask me out like that,
every time?

519
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,453
Ms. Seol, I heard you were the
first to arrive today.

520
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:51,820
Yes.

521
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,220
I was that girl who'd always be
late for school,

522
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,266
except on days when we had
school excursions.

523
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:59,020
I don't think that's
something to be proud of.

524
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,953
Ms. Seol, hope you did
a good job with the shopping.

525
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:03,286
The meat! Meat is a must!

526
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:04,500
Come on!

527
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,466
Ta-da!

528
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,253
I wasn't sure what you'd like,

529
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,153
so I got everything.

530
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:14,453
So pick and choose!

531
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,353
Chucks, ribs, flanks, loins...

532
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,166
All kinds of domestic meat.

533
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,266
Did you get the veggies, too?

534
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,333
Ta-da!

535
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:26,500
What about the drinks?

536
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,666
Ta-da!

537
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,933
- Way to go!
- Amazing!

538
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,153
Wow, that was perfectly done.

539
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,553
Man, Ms. Seol!

540
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,666
So you're an elite when it
comes to partying, huh?

541
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,520
Right? If you did your
work like this,

542
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,666
then you'd have become
Ms. Kim Junior by now.

543
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:45,966
I know, right?

544
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,386
Come on!

545
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:49,486
Why do you always have to
say the right things?

546
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:50,633
Hello!

547
00:35:58,633 --> 00:35:59,966
Uh, Mr. Koh?

548
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,253
Why are you in a suit for
a workshop?

549
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:07,400
Oh, that's because workshops are
extended working hours for me.

550
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,353
Fine, I have just one suit!

551
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,086
But what's that got to
do with you, huh?

552
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:15,220
Well, since everyone's here,
shall we get going, then?

553
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,600
Yes!

554
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,300
Let's start loading!

555
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:22,820
- After that one...
- This one, too.

556
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,520
Ms. Kim Ji-ah, do you know
why I'm going to this workshop?

557
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,786
Huh?

558
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:30,520
Well, I guess to check out the
Art Center on the way...

559
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,720
No, I'm going to
keep my eyes on you.

560
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,786
What?

561
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:38,986
In case you tell everyone that
I have just one suit and

562
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,586
that I live a cheap... I mean,
a modest life on the rooftop.

563
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:45,020
But is it even a big deal if
people find out about it?

564
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,786
Of course it is!

565
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:48,386
Mr. Popular, Workaholic,

566
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:51,853
the most eligible bachelor in
Yumyung Group!

567
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,086
I don't want to
stain my reputation!

568
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,200
So...

569
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,600
What are you doing there, you two?

570
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,633
Yes, coming!

571
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:08,086
Oh, uh...

572
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,453
Coming?

573
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:10,533
Yes.

574
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,000
What's with that guy?

575
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:26,900
(Gapyeong Rest Stop)

576
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,553
Mmm, so good.

577
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:31,366
You have to have these
at the rest stops!

578
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,586
By the way, Mr. Koh.
Aren't you eating?

579
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,700
Are you on a diet?

580
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:38,466
Right! Stop working and have
one of these. They're so good!

581
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,953
- I'm alright.
- Come on, just one bite.

582
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,100
I'm...

583
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:43,986
Oh no!

584
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,953
What the...

585
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,720
Hey, this is
my only suit and you've...

586
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,153
- Oh man...
- What? This is your only suit?

587
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:53,833
I thought you had ten!

588
00:37:56,366 --> 00:37:58,453
I have ten,

589
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,220
but I wear each and every one
like they're my only suit.

590
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
I see.

591
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,520
Well, take that off.
Let me get it cleaned for you.

592
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,520
Sorry, I apologize.

593
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,666
Ah, alright.

594
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,186
Well, you took a long time.

595
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,186
I was like,
should I have ramen or udon?

596
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:18,633
Udon? Ramen?
I just couldn't make up my mind!

597
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,486
Here, everyone try some.

598
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,400
Here you are.

599
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,333
'Want to stay for some ramen?'

600
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,586
Oh, not that cliched line for
when you're seducing someone!

601
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,786
Right? These are the
words to seduce a guy!

602
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:36,000
Right!

603
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Do you want to stay for
some ramen?

604
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:41,966
Ramen?

605
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:46,533
Since when did those words become
words of seduction?

606
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,333
'She could really mean,
'Do you want some ramen?'

607
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,753
We were only fooling around.

608
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,866
So why are you all serious?

609
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:05,620
What, I was being
serious now, was I?

610
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,533
No, no!

611
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,933
Oh...

612
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,000
You almost got me!

613
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,366
- Me, too.
- Same here.

614
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,800
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you for the meal!

615
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:45,886
What?

616
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:50,033
'Words fired on by jealousy
and my competitive spirit?'

617
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,300
Is that how she took my
genuine words of confession?

618
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:18,020
What is that?

619
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,500
- You do this, and…
- Huh?

620
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,766
You take a picture, and…

621
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:27,020
You do this, and pick this, and…

622
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,300
- Done!
- Wow!

623
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:30,953
Then you do this, and…

624
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:33,533
- Wow!
- …And this. Now watch.

625
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,166
Hello, I'm Ji-ah!

626
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,020
Then you send it.

627
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,120
- Did you send it?
- Yes.

628
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,353
Let's see!

629
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:45,273
Here you are.

630
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,820
Hello, I'm Ji-ah!

631
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,586
Wow, amazing!

632
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:53,333
This is really like you, Ji-ah.

633
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,533
- Right? Isn't this fun?
- Yes!

634
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,353
But is it really alright to
fool around like this?

635
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:01,820
According to the schedule,

636
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,853
we should be announcing
our visions we drafted.

637
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:06,586
That's just for the formalities.

638
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:07,686
Right, Ms. Kim?

639
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:11,333
You're right. So think of this as
a holiday, and just relax.

640
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,120
I wish we could just
do this every day!

641
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,786
Same here!
I love doing nothing!

642
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,200
Same here!

643
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,086
What, you two have
already started drinking?

644
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:30,420
Of course. Drinks taste the
sweetest during daytime!

645
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,953
Hey, don't just stand there,
just lay the table!

646
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:37,020
Or there was that valley we saw
on our way here.

647
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,553
Why don't we
exchange conversations

648
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:41,353
and exchange drinks, too?

649
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:42,600
What about it?

650
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,953
No, I think we should exchange
information on that Art...

651
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:48,900
Alright, off to the valley it is!

652
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:53,500
Let's go! Let's go! Go, go go!

653
00:41:54,766 --> 00:41:56,020
Go! Go!

654
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,453
- For real?
- Where's the cooler?

655
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:59,833
- Where's the cooler?
- Mmm, sounds delicious!

656
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,953
The air's so fresh out here.

657
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:07,920
Right? It's so rejuvenating.

658
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,833
Glad we came here.

659
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,286
Wow, I haven't seen
a fumigator in a long time.

660
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,820
You had them in your generation?

661
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,720
Back in the old days,
when one of those drove past,

662
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,286
all the kids would come running

663
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:25,066
and open their mouths to
breathe in that stuff.

664
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:56,753
- Ugh, my eyes.
- My eyes.

665
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,286
Oh man, my eyes hurt. My eyes!

666
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:00,533
Come on, keep walking.

667
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:19,486
Mr. Lee? How did you...

668
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:21,233
I'm here because...

669
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:27,533
...Because of Mr. Yang.

670
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:33,153
Mr. Yang is in your team,

671
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:35,766
so of course he has to
join the workshop.

672
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:40,453
Then you could've
just sent Mr. Yang.

673
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:42,420
I considered that option too,

674
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,320
but I thought it'd be
meaningful if I participate,

675
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,566
since everyone here has always
worked so hard to support me.

676
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:53,233
Oh, so Mr. Lee, you'll also...

677
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,166
...Stay the night here with us?

678
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,066
Yes.

679
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,766
Because the one who
completes this team is...

680
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,633
...Me, Lee Young-joon.

681
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:09,853
It's an honor, sir.

682
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:12,653
- It's an honor.
- Of course!

683
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,153
Of course, of course.

684
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:16,033
- It's an honor.
- Of course!

685
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:19,186
So, were you off somewhere?

686
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,886
Oh, we were on our way to
have a drink at the valley...

687
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:21,953
No, no!

688
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:24,686
We just bought a watermelon and
were on our way back.

689
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:26,000
- Yes, sir.
- And then...

690
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:30,153
We were going to
draft up our goals

691
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:33,920
as we discuss our
future directions as

692
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,553
a proud member of
the Yumyung Group.

693
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,000
Right!

694
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,866
Alright, then.
Let's go in and discuss.

695
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:43,286
- Yes!
- Sounds good!

696
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:45,266
- Let's go.
- Let's go, then.

697
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:47,200
Our visions!

698
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:51,000
- Let's... let's go.
- Let's go.

699
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:59,753
Oh no, but I've never
thought about goals or visions.

700
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:02,020
What does he want us to
present, anyway?

701
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,320
Sweetie, just write something
if you have time to grumble.

702
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,020
Reflections on your past,

703
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,053
your present efforts, and
your aspirations for the future!

704
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,986
Your goals should be high,
but realistic,

705
00:45:13,066 --> 00:45:16,886
and your dreams big,
but not too far-fetched. Alright?

706
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:18,086
Something along the lines of that.

707
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,486
- Mr. Jung?
- Yeah?

708
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:20,633
Did you write yours?

709
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,733
Ugh, I knew it!

710
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,920
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have come.

711
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,153
I regret it now!

712
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:34,433
I know, right? Who knew we'd
really be doing this?

713
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:38,053
Right? This is more like punishment
rather than team-building.

714
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,433
Exactly...

715
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,553
Do you know
why I'm here, Ms. Kim?

716
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,686
You just said it was
because of Mr. Yang.

717
00:46:02,766 --> 00:46:06,233
No, I'm not here because of Mr.
Yang, but because of you, Ms. Kim.

718
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:08,753
Just thinking about how
you kept rejecting me

719
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,620
made me so angry,
and I couldn't sit still.

720
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,653
And,

721
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:14,120
in case you use this chance to
think about that "oppa,"

722
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,653
I came here so you can
think about me instead.

723
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:19,433
Now aren't you blessed?

724
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:24,553
Ms. Kim, do you know what the
purpose of this workshop is?

725
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:25,666
Well...

726
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,366
To emphasize
solidarity and cooperation?

727
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:29,953
No.

728
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:32,620
It's to put an end to our
flirting, so we can start dating.

729
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,720
Sorry?

730
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,820
Just you wait. By the time
this workshop is over,

731
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,000
you and I will be lovers.

732
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:40,866
You'll be... What?

733
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:48,253
I heard you say
you'll be something.

734
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,820
Well, that's...

735
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,920
We'll be a team, is what I said.

736
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,620
With me here,
once this workshop is over,

737
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,400
we'll really be a team now,
won't we?

738
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,286
Yes, you're right, sir.

739
00:46:57,366 --> 00:46:59,333
Why don't you get going?
Everyone else is waiting.

740
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:22,500
Alright, then.
Let's all share our visions.

741
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,333
So who would like to...

742
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:28,900
Who should go first?

743
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:32,200
Alright, then.
Please give her a big hand!

744
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:34,420
Ms. Bong has volunteered to
go first!

745
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,533
What?

746
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:41,266
That wasn't...

747
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:45,900
Come on.

748
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,553
Well, I...

749
00:47:55,633 --> 00:48:00,320
I thought, as long as
I stick to that path...

750
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,653
I'll feel rewarded...
and be rewarded...

751
00:48:02,733 --> 00:48:04,686
If this is going nowhere,
you may sit back down.

752
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:06,733
Yes, thank you.

753
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:13,066
I'll volunteer to go next.

754
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:21,786
Dr. McClelland, an American
neurologist, once said:

755
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:28,886
that people who were or
felt rewarded from their success

756
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:31,400
develop a stronger
desire to achieve.

757
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:34,986
Based on this
success-motivation theory,

758
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:38,253
My vision is to minimize PPM,
and maximize CSI.

759
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:37,020
(PPM/Number of defective item
from million products or services)

760
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,100
(CSI/Customer Satisfaction Index)

761
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,486
I know 2PM, but what's PPM?

762
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:42,866
Right. And isn't CSI to
do with forensics?

763
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,120
That's why, my goal is to
prove myself as a talent

764
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,566
with the creativity for
extraordinary proposals.

765
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,166
Wow!

766
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:01,586
This isn't why I'm here...

767
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:02,666
Sorry?

768
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,486
No, it's nothing.

769
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:07,853
I'll be the next to
present my visions

770
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:09,220
as the SNU elite who has a bright...

771
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,466
Hold on.

772
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:13,986
No need to be so verbose about
your goals and visions.

773
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,233
- Then...
- In other words,

774
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,666
it's your eyes.

775
00:49:20,266 --> 00:49:21,186
No need for eloquent language,

776
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:23,153
everyone, take two seconds to

777
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:25,486
show us how determined you are.

778
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:27,666
Alright then, let's start.

779
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,033
Is that how determined
you are, Ms. Kim?

780
00:49:57,633 --> 00:49:58,633
Oh.

781
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,186
Well, that was to mean that
I'm ready to

782
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:02,966
tackle all the hardships
as I have until now.

783
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,000
Splendid.

784
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,020
Alright, let's end our
presentation with that,

785
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,600
and it'll be free time for
the rest of the day.

786
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:16,186
No, no.

787
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:18,933
Now's the time to go
ribbon-hunting.

788
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:22,000
- Ribbon-hunting?
- Yes.

789
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,953
It's like a treasure-hunt.

790
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:27,020
We will all pair up
and hunt for ribbons with

791
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,486
our company's
mission statements on them.

792
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:31,266
The team that finds the
most ribbons, wins.

793
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,633
Pair up, did you say?

794
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,786
Alright then,
let's get started right away.

795
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:43,166
As for me, I...

796
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:52,900
I'm going to pair up with Ms. Kim.

797
00:50:56,566 --> 00:50:57,800
But why me?

798
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,053
During our hike,

799
00:50:59,133 --> 00:51:03,386
I would like to discuss politics,
world trade, economy and such.

800
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:06,200
Or would anyone else like to
hold those conversations with me?

801
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,766
Why, Ms. Kim!
You're just the right person!

802
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,353
Then...

803
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:16,253
That's Ms. Kim and Ms. Lee,

804
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,000
then we'll have a pair here,
a pair here,

805
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:21,366
and a pair here, like this.

806
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:25,600
In the meantime, Mr. Park and I
will hide those ribbons.

807
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,133
- Alright, please.
- Yes, sir.

808
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:40,833
It's great being out, huh?

809
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,466
Ms. Bong, why did you
suddenly get changed?

810
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,333
Now that's quite
an alluring transformation.

811
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,820
Well, Mr. Koh Gui-nam is
here today, isn't he?

812
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,200
So that means three
push-up pads for him!

813
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:58,653
But these hips are mine!

814
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:01,000
I was just born with them, so...

815
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,333
Where did they go, huh?

816
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:06,466
Hey, wait for me, you!

817
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,800
Wait for me!

818
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:12,566
There they come.

819
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,720
Alright, alright.

820
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,620
Line up in your pairs.

821
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,086
Come on!

822
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:27,666
Ms. Bong, you come here. Come on.

823
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,633
Mr. Lee.

824
00:52:31,366 --> 00:52:33,453
This is a little something
from me. A chocolate.

825
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:37,166
In case your blood sugar
falls low during your hike.

826
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,866
Thank you.

827
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:42,953
For our winners today,

828
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:45,053
on top of those gift vouchers,

829
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:47,466
let me add on a tablet PC as well.

830
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,400
Amazing!

831
00:52:52,466 --> 00:52:57,500
Then, on your marks...

832
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:01,866
...Get ready, and...

833
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:04,420
Oh what?

834
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,353
Gui... What the...

835
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,453
Let's go!

836
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:09,466
- Hurry!
- Wait for me!

837
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:11,020
- Go!
- Go, go!

838
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,053
- Way to go, Mr. Lee!
- Mr. Lee, way to go!

839
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:14,433
Go, go!

840
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,066
It won't be easy.

841
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:27,666
Just where are they?

842
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,886
Come on, hurry up!

843
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:31,933
We need to win and
get that tablet PC!

844
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,833
- Tsk...
- What's with that face?

845
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:39,120
What, you think I'm pathetic?

846
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,600
Because I'm so hung over that
first prize?

847
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:44,233
No, it's not like that.

848
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,986
Alright, listen.

849
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:49,720
I'm not hung over the first prize,

850
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,533
it's being the first place winner!

851
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:54,800
Because it's always so thrilling,
being the winner.

852
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,253
Alright? Then move it!

853
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:58,666
Oh what...

854
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:02,600
Huh? A ribbon!

855
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,000
(Passion)

856
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,833
Hey, a ribbon! Found one!

857
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,886
Come on, higher!

858
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:15,433
How did they tie it up there?

859
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,533
Found it!

860
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,433
What are you doing?

861
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:42,566
You're going to climb up?

862
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,700
Of course. We need to win
and get that tablet PC...

863
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:49,533
...But more importantly,
be the winner.

864
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,333
Hey, be careful!

865
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,820
- Found it! Ribbon!
- Found it!

866
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,300
- We got a ribbon!
- Ribbon!

867
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,533
Alright, then.

868
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:13,466
Was it... This high up?

869
00:55:16,466 --> 00:55:18,366
Hold on, uh...

870
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:21,153
- Uh, Ms. Kim Ji-ah?
- Yes?

871
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:23,720
Can you help me?
I can't come down.

872
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,520
- What?
- Get on the ground.

873
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,520
- Hurry?
- You're going to step on me?

874
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,233
Come on... Hurry up!

875
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,586
- Mom?
- Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

876
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,220
I can't hear you,
the signal's really bad here.

877
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,353
Ms. Kim Ji-ah? Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

878
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:43,153
- Let me go down a bit.
- Don't put my jacket...

879
00:55:43,233 --> 00:55:44,286
Not my jacket over there...

880
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:45,953
Ms. Kim Ji-ah!
Don't put my jacket there...

881
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:47,886
Ms. Kim Ji-ah! Ms. Kim Ji-ah!

882
00:55:47,966 --> 00:55:50,686
Ms. Kim Ji-ah! Oh man!

883
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:53,053
Don't put my jacket there!
Damn you!

884
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:55,720
Oh man, this is driving me nuts.
Ugh!

885
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,753
Ugh!

886
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:57,866
Ms. Kim Ji-ah!

887
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:01,633
Someone, help!

888
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,800
Help me!

889
00:56:04,533 --> 00:56:06,000
Someone, anybody, help!

890
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Mommy!

891
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,633
Today Dad bought caramel.

892
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,620
I left some for you,

893
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,586
but Pil-nam and Mal-hee
tried to eat them.

894
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:24,866
Still, I managed to
save them for you!

895
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,853
Oppa, aren't you coming to see me?

896
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,986
You didn't forget me, did you?

897
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:34,433
I hope you come see me, real soon!

898
00:56:36,533 --> 00:56:41,720
Oppa, I forgot your name.
I can't remember it anymore.

899
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,953
I can write really well now,

900
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:48,386
but not your name
because I can't remember.

901
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:50,800
So come and
tell me your name again!

902
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,300
I wonder what Mi-so is up to now.

903
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,566
Ms. Kim.

904
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:10,653
Why don't we continue on from
where we left off?

905
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:11,653
Sorry?

906
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:13,253
I didn't ask you out,
fired by jealousy and

907
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,320
my competitive spirit.

908
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,566
It's a misunderstanding.

909
00:57:27,433 --> 00:57:28,633
(Mr. Lee Sung-yeon)

910
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:37,133
What do you want?

911
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,553
Why are you picking up?

912
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:40,900
Because I'm with her right now.

913
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:42,520
What?

914
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,786
Sounds like it's nothing urgent.
Well, hang up, then.

915
00:57:44,866 --> 00:57:47,233
Because we're in the middle of
something important.

916
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,900
What are you doing?

917
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:55,620
I told you, didn't I?
Focus on your crush.

918
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,953
And I thought I told you, too.

919
00:57:57,033 --> 00:57:59,033
That these are
memories I want to find.

920
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,586
So...

921
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:01,720
You're going to
keep seeing my brother

922
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,486
- and try get your memory back?
- Yes.

923
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,833
- Even when I hate it so much?
- Yes.

924
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,020
Wow, there's one!

925
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,166
Mr. Yang! Go! Go!

926
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,253
Yes, we got it! We got it!

927
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,333
Well done!

928
00:58:36,066 --> 00:58:37,233
Oh what?

929
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,466
Hey, you look like
you'd beat up a bear.

930
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,120
I'm actually quite fragile...

931
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,700
Good for you!

932
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,300
What are you looking at?

933
00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:55,400
Oh, you suddenly find me beautiful
now we're up in the mountains?

934
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,153
Bug...

935
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,366
What?

936
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:00,853
Are you saying I look like a bug?

937
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:03,900
No, I don't mean that...
There's a bug there.

938
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,386
Argh! How did it
get on my clothes?

939
00:59:07,466 --> 00:59:09,653
Oh my God,
it's gone down my top!

940
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:12,253
Oh my God!

941
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,820
It's inside my top!

942
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,453
What's wrong?

943
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,053
There's a bug in my top!

944
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:18,233
Oh my God!

945
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,620
Hey, oh what?

946
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,100
Oh my God!

947
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:49,800
So, uh...

948
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,733
Have you seen Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

949
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:54,586
Huh?

950
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:56,586
- Oh. Uh... no.
- Ugh, damn it!

951
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:58,833
- Uh...
- Ugh, where is she?

952
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,166
Hey!

953
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:29,433
Mr. Lee...

954
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,986
Don't refuse.

955
01:01:32,066 --> 01:01:35,400
When else will you get to
use a $9,000 umbrella?

956
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:38,200
This jacket is limited edition.

957
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:41,966
Let's first find a shelter.

958
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:15,533
What if we catch a cold?

959
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:18,966
I'm fine.
I'm healthier than I look.

960
01:02:20,066 --> 01:02:21,420
I don't mean you, I mean me.

961
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,300
What if I catch a cold?

962
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:27,700
Oh, that's right.
You get cold easily.

963
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,600
When will the rain stop?

964
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,233
It's okay, Ms. Kim.

965
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,300
No need to be frightened.

966
01:02:56,966 --> 01:02:58,133
It's alright.

967
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:07,400
Ms. Kim, take this.

968
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:12,166
Have one, and calm down.

969
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:18,000
Oppa, I want to go home.

970
01:03:18,433 --> 01:03:20,253
Mi-so, stop crying.

971
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,653
If you do, I'll give you
something yummy.

972
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:24,400
Something yummy?

973
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,766
Here. Caramel.

974
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:30,833
Eat this, and
promise me you won't cry.

975
01:03:33,366 --> 01:03:34,633
Enjoy.

976
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:48,966
Thank you.

977
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,300
Feeling better?

978
01:04:15,033 --> 01:04:17,366
Yes, a lot better.

979
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,833
Looks like the rain's stopped now.

980
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:35,033
Shall we start heading down?

981
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:37,233
Let's go.

982
01:04:43,633 --> 01:04:44,766
Careful.

983
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:55,000
I think ever since that incident,
I developed arachnophobia.

984
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,100
The kidnapping, I mean.

985
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:09,500
Because I remember there being
a big spider out the window.

986
01:05:11,066 --> 01:05:12,120
Do you know that
strange feeling you get

987
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,020
when you re-visit a place from
your childhood

988
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,466
after you've all grown up?

989
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,266
That feeling of,
'Was this place always this small?'

990
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,153
Sorry?

991
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:23,620
When you were a child,

992
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,533
because you were little,
everything is bound to feel big.

993
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,653
That's probably why that
spider looked so big.

994
01:05:30,733 --> 01:05:32,166
So no need to be so scared.

995
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,266
Do you think that's why?

996
01:05:38,133 --> 01:05:39,586
Have you ever had a dog?

997
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:40,653
No.

998
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:45,286
When I was a child,
I had a purebred golden retriever.

999
01:05:45,366 --> 01:05:48,900
His name was Big Bang
Andromeda Supernova Sonic.

1000
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:53,153
That name...

1001
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:56,120
You gave it to him, didn't you?

1002
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,266
Of course.

1003
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:00,653
Big Bang Andromeda
Supernova Sonic was docile.

1004
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:03,100
He didn't bark,
and he was very smart.

1005
01:06:03,966 --> 01:06:06,120
But that Big Bang Andromeda
Supernova Sonic...

1006
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,533
Can't we just call him
'Big Bang' for short?

1007
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,933
Of course we can't.

1008
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:14,066
Anyway, he had a strange habit.

1009
01:06:14,366 --> 01:06:17,033
He'd always bury his dog chew.

1010
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,386
Not to retrieve it later,

1011
01:06:20,466 --> 01:06:22,833
because he'd forget
he'd buried it there.

1012
01:06:23,766 --> 01:06:27,433
Do you think it's like amnesia?

1013
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,933
Maybe.

1014
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,120
Big Bang is long gone now,

1015
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,886
but somewhere in our yard

1016
01:06:33,966 --> 01:06:36,400
will be those dog chews
that he had buried.

1017
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,300
Now, do you think I should go
digging for them?

1018
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,966
Because after all the effort,
they might be all rotten.

1019
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:51,700
I...

1020
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:55,533
I just didn't want you to
remember that pain again.

1021
01:06:56,833 --> 01:07:01,186
Because my brother, my family...

1022
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:03,133
They all had a hard time
for a very long time.

1023
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:08,333
I was worried that
you'd go through the same.

1024
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,433
Though it's true that I got jealous,
as you said.

1025
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,600
I understand you very well, sir.

1026
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,933
But...

1027
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:31,666
As you know, I've lived my life
not for myself, but for my family.

1028
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:37,200
Even my career entails me to put
someone else before me.

1029
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,220
That's why...

1030
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,533
I've hardly been in the
receiving end throughout my life.

1031
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,886
But that day...

1032
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:52,500
That moment, when I'm sure
it was scary for him, too...

1033
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,900
He protected me.

1034
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:02,433
And that was the greatest act of
selflessness I received in my life.

1035
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,686
So please don't hate me
meeting with Sung-yeon,

1036
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:13,233
because he was the first to
give me that.

1037
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:28,153
Whatever you want
and want to know....

1038
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:29,700
Alright, I'll accept it.

1039
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:32,566
Do whatever you want.

1040
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:41,420
Because I'll just accept it all.

1041
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,133
Your everything.

1042
01:08:45,066 --> 01:08:46,900
I'm ready to, you know.

1043
01:09:16,966 --> 01:09:19,266
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?)

1044
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,666
Something's definitely going on.

1045
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:24,320
You may dream about me tonight.

1046
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,900
So how about a sweet kiss...

1047
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,686
It's not like I don't want to.

1048
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,353
I want to, as well!

1049
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,420
A kiss is a lover's...

1050
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,166
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll tell them to re-do it.

1051
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,486
You're hiding something from
Ms. Kim, aren't you?

1052
01:09:37,566 --> 01:09:39,286
He gets cold so easily.

1053
01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:40,666
I like winter.

1054
01:09:40,966 --> 01:09:43,633
Sometimes, ghosts appear when
I close my eyes.

1055
01:09:44,533 --> 01:09:45,520
I'm going to overcome it.

1056
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,766
Because there's nothing that I,
Lee Young-joon, can't overcome.
