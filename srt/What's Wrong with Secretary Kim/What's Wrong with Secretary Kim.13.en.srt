(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,267
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:29,866
What's with that laugh?

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
I thought after the
truth was finally out,

9
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,366
it'll only get uncomfortable. But…

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,500
It's exactly the opposite.

11
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,700
I'm glad I came out honest.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,333
Of course. There's nothing better
than being honest.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,533
Do you really think so?

14
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:02,566
Then…

15
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,067
Can I be honest…

16
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,833
…About how I feel right now?

17
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,633
I don’t want…

18
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,500
…Tonight to be just another night.

19
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,000
(Park Yu-sik)

20
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:17,834
Take it.

21
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,866
It could be something urgent.

22
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,866
(Park Yu-sik)

23
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,834
If it's not,

24
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,933
he'll be moving out of
his office tomorrow.

25
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,167
What is it?

26
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,233
It's an emergency!

27
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,967
You know that French brand that
we signed an exclusive deal with?

28
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,966
(Episode 13)

29
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,133
Looks like UK Group is
negotiating with them, too.

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,400
But the deal has been sealed,
so what's this about?

31
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:56,067
If they breach the contract,

32
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,567
that means we have the
right to drive out

33
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,767
all of their affiliates
from our department stores.

34
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,367
I just reviewed the figures with
our legal team,

35
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,767
but the loss on our end
will be greater.

36
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,367
They boast high sales figures, so…

37
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,134
Send me the estimates
of the amount of loss.

38
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,300
Along with the data that

39
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,467
compares their profits from
our department stores

40
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:14,500
with our rivals'
for the past 3 years.

41
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
What could it be?

42
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,600
Oh my.

43
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,900
My goodness!

44
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,033
Hold on.

45
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:57,534
Would it be weird if
I tie this again?

46
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,966
But it'll be weird to
just let it loose like this.

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,434
This is so embarrassing.
What do I do?

48
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
So embarrassing!

49
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,167
Yes.

50
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,700
I don't know what UK's offers are,

51
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,034
but they won't take on the risk of

52
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,700
withdrawing all their brands
from our store.

53
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,934
But I'll have to meet with them
again to re-negotiate.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
It looks like that's
what they're after.

55
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:48,000
That means we'll have to
go to France, huh?

56
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,534
Looks like it.

57
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,933
Let's leave right away tomorrow.

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,567
Hold on.

59
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,200
If I go to Paris tomorrow,

60
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,766
I won't be seeing
Ms. Kim for at least a week.

61
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,233
That means I can't just
waste the night tonight.

62
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:39,000
Just when we were in the mood,

63
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,566
she falls asleep, drunk?

64
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,600
Sorry, but I have to go on
a business trip tomorrow.

65
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,767
Once I depart,

66
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,566
I won't be able to
see you for at least a week.

67
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,800
So if we just
let tonight pass like this,

68
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,600
then you'll be extremely sorry.

69
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,366
Looks like she was tired.

70
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,366
Yes.

71
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,500
Okay.

72
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,266
How long do I have to be satisfied
with kisses on foreheads?

73
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,866
At this rate, I'll be
an expert at just that.

74
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,366
Just why am I…

75
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,333
Did I fall asleep, drunk?

76
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,833
Oh, you're up?

77
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,200
Oh my…

78
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,766
You're up already.

79
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,666
Did you have a good sleep?

80
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,134
No.

81
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,867
I didn't get any sleep at all.

82
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,733
Because you had to
fall asleep first.

83
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,400
So, uh… What was that
call about last night?

84
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,433
You took quite a long time.

85
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,334
I have to go on a business trip.

86
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,933
A business trip?

87
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,600
This is for you.

88
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,666
I've already packed your bags.

89
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,066
You need to hurry,
else you'll miss your flight.

90
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,834
I won't be seeing you for
another week,

91
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,933
so I want to hug you for
just one more second.

92
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:30,033
Or how about I take you?

93
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,666
I'd really like to pack you
in my suitcase right now.

94
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,267
What, while you fly
in first class,

95
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,266
you want me to fly
in your suitcase?

96
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,167
And while I'd like to
accompany you,

97
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,200
I need to stay behind and
take care of many things.

98
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,366
Is that so?

99
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,100
Alright.

100
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,466
You may look at this picture
every time you miss me.

101
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,866
Thank you.

102
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,234
Ms. Kim?

103
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,633
Smile.

104
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,867
And this is for me.

105
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:27,200
You may look at that picture
every time you miss me, too.

106
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,534
Well, thank you very much.

107
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,833
Sure.

108
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,333
Come here.

109
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Call me often.

110
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,934
If you don’t,
I'm going to punish you.

111
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,666
Punish me how?

112
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,433
Like this?

113
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,333
(I'm on my way to the airport)

114
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,966
(Mr. Lee)

115
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,634
(Mr. Lee)

116
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm on my way to the airport.

117
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,633
Missing you already.

118
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,767
(I'm on my way to the airport)

119
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,966
(Missing you already)

120
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,566
How cute.

121
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,267
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

122
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,700
I get that a lot,
though I'm quite big.

123
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,466
Ah, yes. Good for you.

124
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,233
Mr. Lee.

125
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:10,534
Did I wake you?

126
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,100
No, I wasn't sleeping.

127
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,034
Did you have a good day today?

128
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,967
Yes, I thought about you
100 times today.

129
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,334
How disappointing.

130
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,434
I thought about you 101 times.

131
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,266
Better work harder next time.

132
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,133
Yes, sir.

133
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,466
How envious…

134
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,334
Of what?

135
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,967
Of Thank-cow that's
lying next to you now.

136
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,134
That should be my spot,

137
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,766
that cow…

138
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,166
Oh my.

139
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,966
Here, I reserved your spot.

140
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,833
I packed this so it'll feel like
I'm right there with you.

141
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,666
(Mr. Lee)

142
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,733
Your call cannot be connected
at this time. Please leave…

143
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,233
I wanted to hear
your voice at least.

144
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,866
I miss you…

145
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,234
Hello.

146
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,400
I'm Koh Gui-nam,

147
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:02,866
and I will be joining your team
from today onward.

148
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Hey!

149
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:09,034
There were so many people

150
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,400
wanting to transfer here,

151
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,834
but to bring you here,

152
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,533
I really did all I can…

153
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,234
…With my authority, you know!

154
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,966
Thank you sir,
I won't disappoint you.

155
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,367
My goals may not be so ambitious,

156
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:29,167
but it is to be like
that salt in your soup.

157
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,467
In other words,
an existence that may not get

158
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:35,333
a lot of attention,
but does what needs to be done.

159
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,633
I see you're ready for this team!

160
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:49,667
Though I did hear
about your transfer,

161
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,967
I didn’t expect
it'll happen so fast.

162
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,066
Since his transfer has
been decided,

163
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,634
might as well as do it now to
get used to things,

164
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,800
was what Mr. Lee said.

165
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,467
By the way,

166
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,000
when's Mr. Lee coming back?

167
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,800
In two days.

168
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:09,634
Man.

169
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,734
It was so great
not having him here.

170
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,700
All our good days are
coming to an end…

171
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,967
I know, right?

172
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:19,234
I wish his flight was
delayed for just one day!

173
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,100
I really hope he takes his time,
coming back here.

174
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,966
Let's… Start the day!

175
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,400
This is delicious.

176
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:48,666
That is one delicious coffee, right?

177
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,400
Well, let's sit down
and get started.

178
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:53,533
- Yes, sir.
- Welcome to the team.

179
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,633
Damn, I blew this.

180
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,833
Ouch, my hand…

181
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:07,067
Wait up, Young-joon.

182
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,967
You have long strides so
what's the rush anyway?

183
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,900
The more I hurry, the sooner
I can see Ms. Kim.

184
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,500
Is that right?

185
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:16,967
I see.

186
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,533
So that's how it is.

187
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,100
Working away to
cut down our trip short and

188
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,500
walking like an athlete now…

189
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,934
It's all so that
you can see Ms. Kim again. I see!

190
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,167
No, it's all so that
I can say bye to you sooner.

191
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,733
Like I enjoyed being with you!

192
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,233
It was more like, I was happy.

193
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,800
Anyway, guess
you kept her waiting.

194
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,400
I bet she missed you
hell of a lot!

195
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:41,634
Of course.

196
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,267
She couldn't see this
addictive face for

197
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,467
almost a week.

198
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:48,733
Now that's a cruel punishment.

199
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,334
But she's not here, is she?

200
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,167
She doesn't know that
I came back earlier.

201
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,934
It's meant to be a surprise,
so I didn't contact her.

202
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,500
I can just see it already.

203
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:04,666
That wide smile on her face,
from the surprise.

204
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,934
You're done already?

205
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,600
Yes. Because work is
both my hobby and talent.

206
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,667
Man.

207
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,267
Is the air conditioner set
too strong only in this room?

208
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,100
Why does it feel
so chilly in here?

209
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,533
Mr. Lee!

210
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,134
Oh…

211
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,300
I thought you'd be back
on the twentieth.

212
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,734
Good morning, sir.

213
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,067
I was just transferred from
the planning department…

214
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,234
- Yes, I know.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,866
- And I'm an intern…
- The intern, yes.

216
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,034
Mr. Bae Hyun-seong?

217
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,667
Welcome aboard.

218
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,267
I'll do my best here, sir.

219
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,134
My goals may not be so ambitious,

220
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,367
but it is to be like
that salt in your soup.

221
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,767
In other words,
an existence that may not get

222
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,233
a lot of attention,
but does what needs to be done.

223
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,834
But isn't soup all about
the meat and the salt?

224
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
So you say salt…

225
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,500
Now aren't you being
too ambitious?

226
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,634
Sorry?

227
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,667
Well, I'll look forward to
how you prove yourself as

228
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:23,434
the salt in our soup.

229
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,867
And Ms. Kim, I want to
see you for a while.

230
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,166
Yes, sir.

231
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,766
Salt.

232
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,300
What happened?

233
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:40,434
If you'd called me, I would've
met you at the airport.

234
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,800
Don't smile!

235
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,734
That pretty smile of yours!

236
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,166
Don't show it to other guys,
other than me.

237
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,667
To see you again
as fast as I could,

238
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,234
I worked through lunch and dinner!

239
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,434
I even put up with
a 12-hour flight!

240
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,234
All for your smile upon
seeing me back so soon.

241
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,500
Yet there you were,
flashing that smile to

242
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:01,600
that salt bastard and
that chicken-like intern…

243
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,233
I'm really not in a good mood.

244
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,534
What are you doing? We're at work!

245
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,500
If that bothers you,
shall we go home now?

246
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,200
That's not what I meant…

247
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,133
I missed you.

248
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:33,766
Let's be together for
all the time we were apart.

249
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,633
Where are we going?

250
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,066
What a fine day.

251
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,267
You've been gone for five days

252
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,800
so you have work
piled up waiting for you.

253
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:12,034
I don't know if
we should really be here.

254
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,434
Ms. Kim.

255
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,034
Even back in school,

256
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,200
I never wagged one single period.

257
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,167
So here I am, Mr. Good,

258
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:24,234
whose about to wag for
the first time in my life.

259
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,733
To spend time with you instead.

260
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:35,267
When I saw all those
couples in Paris,

261
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:38,234
I thought to myself,

262
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,900
'I want to go back ASAP
and go on a date with Mi-so.'

263
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,834
That's what kept me going,

264
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,133
so let me off for just one day.

265
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,534
Then just one day.

266
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,566
Since I missed you, too.

267
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,966
Sung-hyeon! Sung-hyeon!

268
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,600
Sung-hyeon, come quick.

269
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,900
This is your new English tutor.

270
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:30,467
Say hello.

271
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:31,667
Hello!

272
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:35,000
He's been progressing much faster
than the other kids his age,

273
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,667
so please take good care of him.

274
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,134
He's that bright, is he?

275
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,334
Then just wait here.

276
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,967
I'll go get us some drinks.

277
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:44,134
I'll come with you.

278
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,500
Why? Scared to be alone?

279
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:49,434
I said, I'm not!

280
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,300
Go, then.

281
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:53,266
Stay right there then,
so I can find you again.

282
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:57,466
Come back soon!

283
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,800
Was Sung-hyeon really…

284
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:07,300
…Locked up in here?

285
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:11,734
Because I left him there?

286
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,400
It's all because of me?

287
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,033
What are you thinking about?

288
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:31,933
About when we were young.

289
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:37,233
Young-joon and I.

290
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,200
Because I can't run away again.

291
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,300
Sung-yeon.

292
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:49,600
Now that I look back,
I realized something.

293
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,400
I never…

294
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:56,300
….Really hated Young-joon
from the heart.

295
00:26:56,366 --> 00:27:00,900
If I ever did hate anyone,
it was myself.

296
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:05,034
I was jealous of Young-joon,
who was good at everything

297
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,233
so I always wanted to be like him.

298
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,233
I'm sorry, Sung-yeon.

299
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,600
We were too ignorant.

300
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:24,000
If you were ever hurt
because of us…

301
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,066
Though it might be too late,

302
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,666
could you still forgive us?

303
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:35,667
Yes, Sung-yeon.

304
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:38,633
It was never our attention,
but we're sorry for

305
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,766
comparing you to Young-joon.

306
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,066
We're sorry about…

307
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
…Not considering

308
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,766
how you might've felt.

309
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,400
We really mean it.

310
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:59,600
I hope it's not too late,

311
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,800
to build a new path.

312
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:24,867
Oh my goodness!

313
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:25,967
Did anything happen
while I was gone?

314
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,900
Did anything happen!
Yes, of course!

315
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,200
Why, what is it?

316
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:35,434
Should I tell you this or not?

317
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,200
Come on, what is it?

318
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,766
Well…

319
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:44,067
Mr. Lee got a girlfriend!

320
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:45,067
What?

321
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:48,767
He was just out
seeing his girlfriend!

322
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:49,966
I mean, look at this.

323
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,600
Who took this picture?

324
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,900
My friend from university.

325
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:59,367
He's an intern here so
he knows Mr. Lee.

326
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:03,767
And he said
he saw him do this, non-stop!

327
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,500
No picture of the girlfriend?
Is this all he got?

328
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:07,800
Sadly, yes.

329
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:09,500
My goodness.

330
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:11,834
When he said to
leave his schedule free today,

331
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,334
I thought it was because
he was extremely tired.

332
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,133
But who knew it was all to
see his girlfriend!

333
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:20,400
I guess he's only cold to
his subordinates,

334
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:23,000
but must be a real
romanticist to his girlfriend.

335
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,466
I guess so, yes.

336
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,834
So… You didn't know?

337
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,634
I thought you were with him.

338
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,034
Oh.

339
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,934
I was waiting in the car,

340
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,733
so I didn't know
who he was seeing…

341
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,100
Here.

342
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,433
Thank you.

343
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
I enjoyed our little escapade.

344
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:50,400
Wasn't that message from
Mr. Lee just now?

345
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,034
Huh?

346
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,667
I thought it read 'Mr. Lee.'

347
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,300
But why is there a heart?

348
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:03,833
Don't tell me…
You're his girlfriend?

349
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,534
Like our Mr. Lee is
the only Mr. Lee out there!

350
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,134
This is a guy from church.

351
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
He's so full of love that

352
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,800
he always sends me hearts.

353
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:18,234
Amen.

354
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,767
Oh. I see!

355
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,234
I see.

356
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,966
For a minute, I thought…

357
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:50,034
It was close,
but I managed just fine.

358
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,800
I acted so natural.

359
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:54,866
Ms. Kim?

360
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,867
If…

361
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:01,434
If there's anything bad I said
behind Mr. Lee,

362
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,366
please forgive me.

363
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,700
What's this, all of a sudden?

364
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:10,167
Anyone would get angry for
their boyfriend.

365
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,500
What?

366
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,334
You two are dating, aren't you?

367
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,234
That girl in the picture,

368
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,100
whose hand Mr. Lee was kissing…
It's you, isn't it?

369
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:24,100
No, it's not me! It really isn't!

370
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:29,233
I really hate myself at times like
this, being so quick to catch on.

371
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:39,333
This bracelet is the
same one you have on.

372
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,400
Oh, this?

373
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:45,600
But everyone wore this
bracelet like last year!

374
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,967
Didn't Ms. Bong have
the same one, too? No?

375
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,067
Ms. Kim,

376
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,300
just admit it.

377
00:31:52,366 --> 00:31:54,833
I told you already.
I'm very good with details.

378
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,467
So now you admit it?

379
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,333
I know you're really
dating Mr. Lee!

380
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,100
Yes, it's true. I'm dating him,
but please keep it a secret.

381
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,066
Please just keep it to yourself.
Please?

382
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,867
Of course!

383
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:18,300
I don't only have
an eye for details,

384
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:19,334
but I have loyalty, too!

385
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,133
So don't worry,

386
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,100
but stay happy in love.

387
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,733
Yes, well…

388
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,200
Congratulations!

389
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,166
Alright.

390
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,766
- Congratul…
- Yes, alright! Thank you.

391
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,467
Oh my.

392
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,500
Oh my goodness!

393
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,766
He just smiled at you, didn't he?

394
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,366
You two sure make a great couple.

395
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,400
Aren't you going?

396
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,567
Your boyfriend just called you.

397
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:10,166
Haha… No way.

398
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,034
I never thought much about
that beeping sound,

399
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,967
but after finding about you two,

400
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:17,267
it suddenly feels more romantic.

401
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,700
I mean, this is like
a love signal, right?

402
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,367
No, that'll be "work" signal.

403
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:23,900
So please calm down and
get back to your work, Ji-ah.

404
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:25,166
Yes.

405
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:31,100
But I can't calm down
because I'm so curious!

406
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,934
Since when did it happen?

407
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,034
Is he good to you?

408
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,000
Do you have
nicknames for each other?

409
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,834
Does he call you Mi-so?

410
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
My dear Mi-so? Baby? Honey? Babe?

411
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:40,533
Oh my goodness!

412
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:50,500
Did you call for me?

413
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,934
Why shut the blinds?

414
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,734
So I can work with you
right by my side.

415
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,900
Have a seat.

416
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:02,300
No.

417
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,333
Ji-ah will get suspicious.

418
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:13,467
She found out about us!

419
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,934
Did she?

420
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,734
So what?

421
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,267
What do you mean, so what?

422
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,334
Though Ji-ah's not the type to
go around telling everyone,

423
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,000
at this rate,

424
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,267
everyone will find out about us!

425
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,367
I'd like everyone to.

426
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,834
Then it'll make things
even more convenient,

427
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,700
and that salt bastard won't try
flirting with you, either.

428
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,300
Who's flirting with me?

429
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,234
Anyway, making our relationship
public is no good.

430
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,134
So from now on,

431
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,400
no more PDA
especially near the office.

432
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:51,800
I can't tell everyone about us
and PDA is banned.

433
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:54,200
Why won't you let me do
anything I want to?

434
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:55,900
Isn't love all about adjusting to
each other?

435
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:58,100
So why have me
make all the sacrifices?

436
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,134
It's not like that…

437
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,300
Here I am, itching to tell the
whole world you're mine.

438
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,300
Yet you seem like
you want to keep us a secret.

439
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,600
Now that doesn't me happy.

440
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,067
It's not I want to
keep us a secret.

441
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,700
I'm doing it for you.

442
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:10,700
Why?

443
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:13,900
Because you're a public figure.

444
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:17,200
When I think about the
influence you have,

445
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,100
I can't help but be careful.

446
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,034
Oh, whatever!

447
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,534
I'll try my best to
do what you want,

448
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,167
but I can tell you,

449
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:29,900
my patience will run out soon.

450
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:48,600
Looks like Mr. Lee will be
busy for a while, huh?

451
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:51,700
Yes, he'll be real busy,

452
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:54,100
taking care of all that work
that's been piled up.

453
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,766
Man, that sounds tough.

454
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,666
So why are you suddenly
worrying about Mr. Lee?

455
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,500
You'll get hurt
if you fall for him…

456
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,567
Huh? What did you just say?

457
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,166
It's nothing.

458
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,367
Well, alright then.

459
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:17,100
Bye.

460
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,166
Let me go make copies.

461
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,700
Uh, Ji-ah?

462
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:47,434
Did you finish writing up that
report on Yumyung Electronics?

463
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,066
No, not yet.

464
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,467
I had other urgent work to
take care of first,

465
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,867
after Mr. Lee's
sudden business trip…

466
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:55,934
But I'll have it for you
by the end of this week.

467
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,166
Alright, then.

468
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:03,234
Man, it's time to go home already.

469
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,466
Already?

470
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,734
Hey,

471
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,667
to welcome you on to the team,
how about, say…

472
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:12,367
…We have a drink?

473
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,934
No, what will be welcoming me
isn't a drink,

474
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,034
but all this work piled up here.

475
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,600
So let me hold my
own welcoming party tonight,

476
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,933
here with these babies
in the office.

477
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,466
Then please excuse me.

478
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,100
Man.

479
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,867
I did hear that he's a workaholic,

480
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,800
but I didn't know
he'd be this much.

481
00:37:32,866 --> 00:37:34,934
- I know, right?
- Whatever.

482
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,200
Well, though our protagonist
won't be joining us,

483
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:41,600
how about we all have a drink to

484
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:44,600
welcome Mr. Koh Gui-nam
in his absence?

485
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:45,600
- Bye.
- Huh?

486
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,167
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you for today.

487
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,533
Huh?

488
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,600
Ms. Kim just asked me
for something.

489
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,166
What was it again?

490
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,533
So, are you coming to
my place tonight?

491
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,766
To your place?

492
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:13,900
Oh, but I stopped
having nightmares and

493
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,200
I can sleep well on my own now.

494
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:19,334
So no need to
stay over at your place.

495
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,167
But…

496
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:24,866
There are things
we still need to do.

497
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:26,900
Do we?

498
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,233
You know, what we never
got to do last time.

499
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,100
What we never got to do…

500
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:44,467
We only got off work just now,

501
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,200
and must you be so direct?

502
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,367
What's so direct about
"things we never got to do?"

503
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:55,634
I could put it more
directly than that, you know.

504
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
A passionate night.

505
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:59,600
A wild night!

506
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:01,034
A burning night!

507
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,866
Please stop.

508
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,100
But most of all,
the sexiest words I can say are…

509
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:11,800
…That I love you.

510
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:22,166
I love you.

511
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,867
Man.

512
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,634
I'm out of ramen and

513
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,266
I don't want to eat alone…

514
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,766
Mr. Koh? I thought you were
working late tonight.

515
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,700
Oh, I lied in case

516
00:39:57,766 --> 00:40:00,267
they wanted me to
pay for all the drinks.

517
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,500
Because that's
unnecessary expenditure.

518
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,300
Oh…

519
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:07,566
Then how about a welcome party
with just me?

520
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,433
What?

521
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:15,267
I'm grateful about you
saving those meeting minutes,

522
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:19,334
and I want to hold a welcome party
for you, as your neighbor!

523
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,500
So let me buy you a drink.

524
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:23,700
It's alright.

525
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,834
Once I accept a favor,
I have to return it.

526
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,266
I'd like to avoid that
vicious cycle.

527
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,234
Tsk!

528
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,900
Just come.

529
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:34,500
- You're always all excuses.
- Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

530
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,234
Where are you taking me?

531
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,267
To your welcome party!

532
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,733
Well, let me go!

533
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:49,533
We'll be there in 5 minutes.

534
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,966
Hold on.

535
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:58,966
Hey, Dad.

536
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:03,066
What?

537
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,300
(Seyeon Hospital)

538
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,300
I'm fine.

539
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,034
I really am!

540
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,867
Rockers don't stay in hospitals.

541
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:14,600
Dad, please!

542
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,167
He won't need to
stay here for long.

543
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:22,467
Just a stretched ligament,
so a few days' rest will do.

544
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:24,034
Thank you, Dr. Choi.

545
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,634
Then say hello to Mr. Lee for me.

546
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,800
I will.

547
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,533
How did you hurt yourself?

548
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,767
Well…

549
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:47,167
Up next is Phoenix,
from Yeongdeungpo!

550
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:47,500
(Phoenix,
from Yeongdeungpo!)

551
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:49,833
Their title song is, 'Crazy Dog!'

552
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,766
Hey, are you alright?

553
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:29,734
A bad case of stage dive.

554
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,900
I'd forgotten that the mean age of
our audience is fifty-something.

555
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,934
At that age,
you don't take chances.

556
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,534
The same goes for you!

557
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,966
Man.

558
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,367
Is your father alright?

559
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,134
It's just a stretched ligament,

560
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,600
so he should be fine
after a few days.

561
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:54,834
That's a relief.

562
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,200
But it looks like
I'll need to stay with him tonight.

563
00:42:58,766 --> 00:42:59,866
All night?

564
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:04,267
Then shall I stay here
with you, too?

565
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,200
You could introduce me to
your father, too.

566
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:07,500
No.

567
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:09,900
This isn't the time for that.

568
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,566
I see.

569
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,734
Besides, you must be exhausted
from your 12-hour flight.

570
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,400
So go ahead and get some rest.

571
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,300
Alright. I guess I have no choice.

572
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:40,400
Who knew I'd be
sleeping here alone tonight?

573
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:43,133
I didn't work that
crazy Paris schedule for this!

574
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:45,467
I know, right?

575
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:47,800
You must be so disappointed!

576
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:51,467
You got your hopes up
from Paris, right?

577
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:52,933
Well, too bad. I can't help it.

578
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,100
Who are you?

579
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,134
The devil of lust?

580
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,466
(Tonight, the star is)

581
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,700
Yes, it's me!

582
00:43:58,766 --> 00:43:59,534
My goodness…

583
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,667
You were a girl?

584
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:02,200
- Of course.
- You even talk?

585
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:03,966
Yes, so how about a little chat?

586
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,866
(Wickedness)

587
00:44:05,066 --> 00:44:07,800
- Aux Champs-Elysees…
- Go away!

588
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:08,900
This is to cheer you on!

589
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,166
(Cheer Up)

590
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:10,134
Go!

591
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,334
- Go where?
- Just get out!

592
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,834
Aux Champs-Elysees…

593
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,300
It was a girl!

594
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:18,700
I just got the goose bumps.

595
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,300
(Tee hee)

596
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,600
You should stop now.

597
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,533
You'll really
get drunk at this rate.

598
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:40,766
But this is just too good.

599
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:44,966
By the way, what was this again?

600
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,433
Guo bao?

601
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,800
No, Guo bao rou.

602
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,066
Oh, that's right. Guo bao rou.

603
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,900
I've never had such delicious
sweet & sour meat.

604
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,367
And…

605
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:03,400
…Never such fragrant spirits, too.

606
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:06,900
I'm going to have them
again on my birthday.

607
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:09,334
That's May 17,

608
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,200
so how long do I have to wait?

609
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:15,267
What, wait until next year for

610
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,033
just guo bao rou and kaoliang?

611
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,100
You know, I've always
wanted to ask.

612
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,000
You're on the
fast track to success and

613
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:34,867
even got paid with
the biggest bonus.

614
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:38,766
So why are you so thrifty?

615
00:45:43,433 --> 00:45:45,866
That's a secret.

616
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:50,867
But owning just one suit and

617
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:52,334
living in a rooftop house…

618
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,367
That's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

619
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:57,167
So why keep it a secret?

620
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:58,933
I just don't understand.

621
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:02,500
Because it can be
something to be embarrassed about.

622
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,734
When I was young,

623
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,033
our family lived in
a tiny, one-bedroom house.

624
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:14,834
Back then, I thought
everyone else was just the same.

625
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,333
Cramped but happy
in a tiny house.

626
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,066
So I never thought of it
as embarrassing.

627
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:26,600
But as I grew up,

628
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,633
people made me think it was so.

629
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,866
I used to be just that
Koh Gui-nam with good grades,

630
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,934
but that turned into

631
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,600
that poor kid who
still receives good grades.

632
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:54,966
I was the first to get a job
out of all my college friends.

633
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,700
They could've just
congratulated me,

634
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,166
but it was, 'That's great news
with your situation and all.'

635
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,700
Oh…

636
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:11,633
So my goal is…

637
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,100
…To save a lot,

638
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,934
buy a house,

639
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,467
and make sure that
my future wife and kids

640
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:26,133
don't hear all those words
I had to hear.

641
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:34,066
In fact, I saved $100,000 already!

642
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,300
What?

643
00:47:37,366 --> 00:47:39,200
$100,000?

644
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:40,733
Amazing!

645
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:45,533
After just 4 years,
you already saved $100,000?

646
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:49,400
I spend just $100 a month.

647
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,267
Man.

648
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,934
And with the $100,000 I saved,

649
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,200
I invest in the stock market
and make more money.

650
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,867
As for the joy of spending…

651
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:05,966
I'm going to save that
for my family in the future.

652
00:48:09,466 --> 00:48:13,067
Well, anyway….

653
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:16,900
You helped me
discover this delicious dish,

654
00:48:16,966 --> 00:48:21,334
so next year, on my birthday…

655
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,767
…When I have this
guo bao rou again…

656
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,866
I'll invite you, Ji-ah.

657
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:43,000
In case you wake up
and you're thirsty.

658
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,333
Mi-so.

659
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,100
I heard you're quitting.

660
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:02,200
Did Pil-nam and Mal-hee tell you?

661
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:05,267
After I heard you decided to quit

662
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,267
in order to find your real self...

663
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:11,033
I couldn't eat properly,
out of guilt.

664
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:15,234
After all,
it was because of me that

665
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,933
you never got to
live your own life.

666
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:21,800
Because I never got a proper job,

667
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:24,833
going round doing
whatever I want to do.

668
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,234
Don't say that.

669
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,500
This was your dream.

670
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:33,067
Being a musician, like this.

671
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:34,800
I'm happy, as long as you are.

672
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:38,667
Dream?

673
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:42,034
I'm not so sure anymore.

674
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,933
It's just that this is the
only thing I can do, so…

675
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:49,234
Oh,

676
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,034
but if my dream was to
be a doctor or a judge,

677
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,100
my daughters would've had
an easier life.

678
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:03,700
Don’t say that, Dad.

679
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:07,567
I'm only quitting
because I want a break.

680
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:10,833
So never mind me,
but just get some sleep.

681
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:15,433
Mi-so, remember Beyonce?

682
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:20,234
She became more successful

683
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,666
once she left Destiny's Child
and went independent.

684
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:25,100
Same for you, Mi-so.

685
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:30,800
You'll be more successful
once you leave Mr. Lee.

686
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:37,300
So how about we get some sleep now
listening to that music?

687
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:39,500
Your mom's favorite song.

688
00:50:40,766 --> 00:50:41,800
Sounds good.

689
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:43,233
Alright.

690
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,733
Ms. Kim, are you sleeping?

691
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,833
(Ms. Kim, are you sleeping?)

692
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:59,633
(Ms. Kim, are you sleeping?)

693
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,533
(Ms. Kim, are you sleeping?)

694
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:11,134
Looks like she is.

695
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,100
Why can't she say so, if she is?

696
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,533
And why is it harder to get hold
of her than while I was in Paris?

697
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,634
Young-joon, you…

698
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,533
You're as handsome as ever.

699
00:52:58,066 --> 00:52:59,433
(Mi-so)

700
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,700
Though you did such a despicable
thing, not calling me last night,

701
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,600
I'm going to forgive you
since you called so early today.

702
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:12,300
Hello, Mi-so.

703
00:53:12,366 --> 00:53:13,600
Hello, Mr. Lee.

704
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:17,034
It looks like I'll have to
have the morning off today.

705
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,234
This morning?

706
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,667
Yes, Pil-nam can only
come in this afternoon,

707
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:24,134
so I'll have to stay at
the hospital this morning.

708
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,000
There's nothing urgent that
needs to be taken care of,

709
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:28,567
and Ji-ah is now doing fine
on her own, so…

710
00:53:28,633 --> 00:53:31,300
Alright, I'll see you
in the afternoon.

711
00:53:31,366 --> 00:53:33,200
Thank you, sir.

712
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:51,333
I never knew half-day leaves
could make me this sad…

713
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,666
How about I pop in to
see her face?

714
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,334
Mr. Yang? To Seyeon Hospital.

715
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,666
Yes, sir.

716
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:09,234
You'll be surprised when you
find out where I am right now.

717
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,667
I'm at the lobby of
Seyeon hospital.

718
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:12,900
What?

719
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:14,934
But why are you…

720
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,800
Yes, it's exactly what you think.

721
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:18,000
To see you.

722
00:54:18,066 --> 00:54:19,834
So that you can see
my face, even for just a bit.

723
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,900
Oh no.

724
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,400
I'm not there right now.

725
00:54:22,466 --> 00:54:23,234
What?

726
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,434
I had some things
I needed to get for Dad.

727
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,467
Then too bad.

728
00:54:27,533 --> 00:54:28,634
I'll just go up by myself and

729
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,767
say hello to
my future father-in-law.

730
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,066
No, you can't!

731
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:34,667
Why can't I?

732
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:38,067
He doesn't even know we're dating,

733
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:40,234
so visiting him
on your own is a bit…

734
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,234
Oh, don't you have that
meeting at 10 a.m.

735
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,934
about our new airline routes?

736
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,300
I think you should head there now.

737
00:54:47,366 --> 00:54:48,766
Yes, alright.

738
00:55:00,366 --> 00:55:04,000
Report on Yumyung Electronics'
current revenue…

739
00:55:04,066 --> 00:55:06,900
This is never-ending.

740
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,400
Oh, Ms. Kim is on leave
this morning.

741
00:55:18,466 --> 00:55:20,066
Yes, she called me.

742
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:26,300
Of course she did.

743
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,266
She's your girlfriend!

744
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,900
He looks kind of sad
without his girlfriend here.

745
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:35,800
Those sad, yet romantic eyes…

746
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:42,200
I wish someone could
look at me like that.

747
00:55:43,266 --> 00:55:46,000
Man…

748
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:51,700
Here.

749
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,400
What's this?

750
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:57,300
The data for
Yumyung Electronics' revenue.

751
00:55:57,366 --> 00:56:01,100
Huh? But I'm supposed to be
doing this.

752
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:03,000
Well, uh…

753
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:05,867
Thanks for that
delicious sweet & sour meat,

754
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,167
along with other things, and…

755
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:10,433
I also wanted to get
used to the work here, so…

756
00:56:18,566 --> 00:56:20,767
Thank you.

757
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:25,767
It must've been a lot of work,
since there's so much data.

758
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,867
Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

759
00:56:27,933 --> 00:56:30,467
What do forest walks feel like?

760
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:31,733
Sorry?

761
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:36,734
Well, it'll feel rejuvenating.

762
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,534
That's what work is like to me.

763
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,467
Nothing is more rejuvenating than
getting your work done.

764
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,967
So,

765
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:46,366
don't be so burdened.

766
00:56:55,566 --> 00:56:57,933
Rejuvenating…

767
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:02,266
Yes, rejuvenating!

768
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,100
- Here.
- Ah, thanks.

769
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,700
- Take it slowly.
- I will.

770
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:16,900
Dad!

771
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,667
Pil-nam!

772
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,300
Yes.

773
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:22,434
Having lunch?

774
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,800
Mi-so, you need to
go to work now, right?

775
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:25,667
How about you have
lunch with me before then?

776
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,900
Dad, I'm just going to
take Mi-so to lunch.

777
00:57:27,966 --> 00:57:29,266
Alright, go ahead.

778
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,366
Ms. Kim, when are you coming?

779
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,867
Let's go, Mi-so.
What do you feel like?

780
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:37,434
Uh, it looks like I need to
go into work right away.

781
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,667
But you should at least
eat something first!

782
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:42,500
There's something I need to
say to you, too.

783
00:57:42,566 --> 00:57:43,766
You do?

784
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,433
(I hope to see you
as soon as possible)

785
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:47,600
I hope to see you
as soon as possible.

786
00:57:55,466 --> 00:57:58,234
Mr. Lee, what about lunch…

787
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,067
I'll take care of it myself,
so no need to mind me.

788
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:02,633
Oh. Sure.

789
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:09,433
I'm going to wait for Ms. Kim.

790
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:23,866
Ms. Kim, are you on your way?

791
00:58:24,966 --> 00:58:26,133
I'll be there soon.

792
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:27,900
(I'll be there soon)

793
00:58:30,366 --> 00:58:31,700
I really have to get going.

794
00:58:31,766 --> 00:58:33,133
What was it that
you wanted to tell me?

795
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:39,467
Here, take this.

796
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:40,767
What's this?

797
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:43,200
One of my senior colleagues is
opening her own hospital,

798
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:44,634
and I decided to transfer there.

799
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,466
So I quit my current job.

800
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,100
This is my severance pay,

801
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,734
and you can have it.

802
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,600
No, why give this to me?

803
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,100
Why else?

804
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,234
You've been working for 9 years

805
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,800
all to pay off the family debt,

806
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:01,300
and even for student loans
Mal-hee and I had.

807
00:59:01,366 --> 00:59:03,800
I know you don’t have a cent
under your name now.

808
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:06,967
Still, I can't take this.

809
00:59:07,033 --> 00:59:09,800
Don't say that, and just take it!

810
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:13,134
You can't get married
penniless now, can you?

811
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,967
Marriage? Isn't it too early to
talk about that?

812
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:18,900
Why isn't it too early?

813
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:19,967
Anyway, I've given it to you,

814
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:22,700
so it's up to you now to
decide what to do with it.

815
00:59:22,766 --> 00:59:24,167
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

816
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:25,900
Can I have the bill?

817
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:27,366
One moment, please.

818
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,000
Hey!

819
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:45,767
That dress would look
great on you.

820
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,034
You want me to get that for you?

821
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,334
No, I really should get going.

822
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,867
Like it takes forever to
try on one dress! Let's go.

823
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:52,333
I said, it's fine!

824
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,700
Young-joon, you…

825
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:16,034
Waiting for your girlfriend

826
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,467
just so you can have
lunch with her,

827
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:19,134
even though you're so hungry…

828
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,466
How very romantic and sweet.

829
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,900
There she is.

830
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:33,066
What is that?

831
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,867
Oh.

832
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:40,266
Was she late because
she was getting a present for me?

833
01:00:49,966 --> 01:00:51,467
Mr. Lee, I'm back.

834
01:00:51,533 --> 01:00:52,834
How's your father?

835
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,900
He's doing very well,
all thanks to you.

836
01:00:55,966 --> 01:00:57,300
That's great to hear.

837
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:59,867
Then shall we go for lunch?

838
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:01,500
But I just had lunch.

839
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,600
Well, I didn't.

840
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,967
Why not?

841
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:10,066
Why else? I was waiting for you.

842
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,300
Oh.

843
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:16,433
My sister wanted to
have lunch with me, so…

844
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,534
I see.

845
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,400
You were late because
you were having lunch.

846
01:01:27,033 --> 01:01:30,900
Is that why you got that
gift for me, to apologize?

847
01:01:31,433 --> 01:01:32,634
Gift?

848
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,000
I saw you carrying a shopping bag

849
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:37,067
when you came into the office.

850
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:39,167
Oh, that…

851
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:40,933
That's a clothing for me.

852
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,667
So you were late, having lunch and

853
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:53,467
shopping for yourself?

854
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:54,600
Well, uh…

855
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:56,633
Did you ever think about me,
who was waiting for you?

856
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:01,334
I'm desperate to spend
one more second with you,

857
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,166
but it looks like you're not.
How disappointing.

858
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,300
I'm sorry.

859
01:02:07,366 --> 01:02:08,566
If you're so sorry,

860
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,400
then how about we get off work
and go to my place?

861
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,400
Why are you
looking at me like that?

862
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:24,634
There's this word that
you've been reminding me of.

863
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,033
Wait, hold up. Let me guess.

864
01:02:29,066 --> 01:02:30,834
Sexy?

865
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,267
Charming?

866
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,633
Homme fatale?

867
01:02:35,266 --> 01:02:36,834
No.

868
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,767
A bulldozer.

869
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:40,400
What?

870
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:43,434
You're like a bulldozer,

871
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
just razing through everything.

872
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,034
What?

873
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,400
A bulldozer?

874
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,134
What did you do to hear that,

875
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,966
you pervert, you Mr. CEO?

876
01:03:05,066 --> 01:03:06,433
Young-joon!

877
01:03:07,966 --> 01:03:11,600
Though I'm divorced and
bitterly regretting it,

878
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:14,600
as your mentor in love…

879
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,600
Wait.

880
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,234
If this is something cheap like
that underpants advice,

881
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,200
then I don't need to hear it.

882
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:23,400
Though my expression was cheap,
the contents were high-quality.

883
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,300
So listen up, Mr. CEO.

884
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:30,700
What you need to remember in
your relationship with Ms. Kim

885
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:33,800
is that you're her
first boyfriend, too.

886
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,034
Well, it's not like
she's my second girlfriend!

887
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,367
She's my first girlfriend, too.

888
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:39,500
I just can't help it and
I want to do everything for her.

889
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:43,133
But that doesn't mean
you can be so pushy.

890
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,467
Then…

891
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:50,034
Just pushing your way through
doesn't mean progress.

892
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,867
Take it slowly,

893
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:54,433
as much as you need to. Alright?

894
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:59,000
Take it slowly,
as much as I need to?

895
01:04:00,533 --> 01:04:02,567
How suffocating.

896
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:05,166
How can I,
when I can't hold back already?

897
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,434
If you can't,
then she'll get tired of you.

898
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,800
What? Tired of me?

899
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,667
How can she get tired of this
perfect face with

900
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:19,133
new charms to discover, every day?

901
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,167
That is a phrase that
isn't in my dictionary.

902
01:04:23,233 --> 01:04:25,667
But think, Young-joon.

903
01:04:25,733 --> 01:04:28,067
She only just started walking,

904
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:30,167
so you can't just
start running like

905
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,900
Usain Bolt now, can you?

906
01:04:32,966 --> 01:04:35,834
Yes, she'll try to
catch up to you at first,

907
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,767
but she's bound to get tired
and give up.

908
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:43,300
Being in a relationship is
all about speed control.

909
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:51,133
Oh, Mr. Lee.

910
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,434
I got this on my way
back from lunch,

911
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,667
and it's really delicious.

912
01:04:58,733 --> 01:04:59,834
You should try some.

913
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,100
Then…

914
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,600
Oh my!

915
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,734
Oh no.

916
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,967
I'm so sorry!

917
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:09,967
Oh no…

918
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:13,400
It's alright, it's not
like I'm bleeding…

919
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,400
Let me go and get
something to wipe that off with.

920
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,433
Oh no…

921
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:23,934
Hey, it's not a big deal!

922
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,700
This happens all the time.

923
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,300
Hold on.

924
01:05:33,466 --> 01:05:34,700
A living Buddha you are!

925
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,834
I mean, see?

926
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,266
It happens so often that
I keep a change of clothes here.

927
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,634
So, did you see?

928
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,700
About what happens if
you fail to control your speed?

929
01:05:49,766 --> 01:05:52,533
I'm sure you don’t want to
end up in this mess.

930
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:55,166
Right?

931
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:08,534
Yes, my hero?

932
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,634
This evening?

933
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,566
Of course we have to go on a date!

934
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,000
Then I'll see you tonight.

935
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,466
Looks like things are
going well with your crush.

936
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:25,033
Yes, we're going out!

937
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,867
That's great!

938
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:31,367
Anyway, what should we do tonight?

939
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:33,934
Have dinner, watch a movie,

940
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,600
have a drink,

941
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,300
go to the Hangang river…

942
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:39,734
What, all on one night?

943
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,434
We'll just stay up
the whole night!

944
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
I mean, we don't ever
want to be apart…

945
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,600
We're so in love!

946
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,034
It's going to be
such a long night tonight too,

947
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,900
so we're even going to kiss!

948
01:06:52,966 --> 01:06:54,200
Oh my…

949
01:06:54,266 --> 01:06:55,400
What's with that?

950
01:06:55,466 --> 01:06:56,867
That should be my line!

951
01:06:56,933 --> 01:06:58,967
I mean, we've only just
started going out,

952
01:06:59,033 --> 01:07:02,367
so this is when that
flame's burning hot, isn't it?

953
01:07:02,433 --> 01:07:06,200
We're adults, you know!

954
01:07:06,266 --> 01:07:07,566
Anyway, take care!

955
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:24,533
Um…

956
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,700
I'm sorry I couldn't
control my speed.

957
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,800
Sorry?

958
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:39,333
Now that I think back,
I guess I was rushing things.

959
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:49,167
It seems like all that
I held back for the past 9 years

960
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:51,566
finally exploded all at once.

961
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,566
Mr. Lee.

962
01:07:57,266 --> 01:08:00,900
Though that was
a horrifying experience…

963
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,200
If I were to go back to then

964
01:08:05,266 --> 01:08:07,333
only to go through the same thing…

965
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,166
Still, I would gladly
do that again.

966
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:14,966
As long as I can meet you.

967
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:24,100
Still, I'll take it slowly.

968
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,566
Because that's what you want.

969
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,967
You can go ahead first.

970
01:08:32,033 --> 01:08:34,400
I have an appointment, so…

971
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,833
What brings you here, Mi-so?

972
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:15,433
I wanted to apologize for

973
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:19,300
not considering your feelings.

974
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,400
And…

975
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,000
And?

976
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:39,100
I'm…

977
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,166
I'm not going home tonight.

978
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:46,966
What?

979
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:50,466
I'm not going home,

980
01:09:52,066 --> 01:09:54,866
but I'm staying here with you,
all night.

981
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:07,166
If you come in,

982
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,333
I won't be able to
hold myself back tonight.

983
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:17,433
Tonight…

984
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,733
...I'm not going to stop.
