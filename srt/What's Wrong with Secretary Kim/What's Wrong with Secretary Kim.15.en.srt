(A legendary secretary)

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,267

(Friends)

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,100
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,866
Why do I feel so happy?

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,634
It's always been
my dream, you know.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,634
Spending the evening with

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,600
my husband after work,
enjoying a simple meal.

11
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,566
Ah, why does it feel so
hot in here?

12
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,600
That dream…

13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,100
Let me realize it for you.

14
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,100
Let's come home
together every day,

15
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,833
and let's have ramen
together every day.

16
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:08,200
I don't care if my body ends up
filled with MSG.

17
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,400
I…

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,633
I want to be your husband.

19
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,133
I want to marry you, Mi-so.

20
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,133
Why? Any objections?

21
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,400
I do!

22
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,766
Dad!

23
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,533
Mr. Kim…

24
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,734
I have an objection to

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,733
you two getting married!

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,200
Ah…

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,767
Why are you here, Dad?

28
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,267
You need to be at the hospital.

29
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,567
They said I can go. And, uh…

30
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,167
The water pipes at home broke,

31
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,700
so I came here instead.

32
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,034
Then you should've
contacted me first.

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,967
I did text you.
You were the one who didn't reply!

34
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,067
Oh. There was an emergency
at the company that

35
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,367
I didn't have time to realize it.

36
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:20,467
You… I want a word with you.

37
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,000
Dad, just say it here.

38
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:26,800
This is a guy's talk.
You stay out of this.

39
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,833
Let's go.

40
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,133
(Episode 15)

41
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,266
Ah.

42
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,134
Today, you…

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
You disappointed me very much.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Alright, you being here
at her place…

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,000
It's understandable,
since you're in a relationship.

46
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:33,200
I mean, back when Mi-so's mother
and I were dating,

47
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,567
I'd sneak into her house

48
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,600
whenever her mother was away…

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,567
Anyway. How could you
ask for her hand

50
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,634
with words like,

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,334
'Let's live on ramen until

52
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,334
our bodies are full of MSG?'

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,166
It's just not cool.

54
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,900
But I meant it as…

56
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,534
'Let's live that simple,
happy life together.'

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,934
You…

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,066
Do you really want to
marry my daughter?

59
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,467
Yes, I do want to marry her.

60
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,200
Then propose to her again.

61
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:07,900
What?

62
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,967
Even though the
times have changed,

63
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,333
romance still needs to be alive!

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,900
I… I can't give my daughter to

65
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:17,233
someone who won't even make
the slightest effort to be cool.

66
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:23,100
Why? You're not so confident?

67
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,400
No, sir. I am confident.

68
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,633
In fact, I'm overflowing
with confidence!

69
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,633
I like that attitude.

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,066
Here, have a drink.

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,366
Bottoms up!

72
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,933
Bottoms up…

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,467
You… I'm going to watch

74
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,900
with my eagle eyes,

75
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,766
to see how romantic
you'll make it.

76
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,133
I'll be watching!

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,066
Yes, please watch me, sir!

78
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,300
Okay!

79
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,033
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up.

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,700
Let's drink until
we pass out tonight!

81
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,600
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

82
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,867
That's right, bottoms up!

83
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,600
- Bottoms up!
- Okay, bottoms up!

84
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:45,266
Here, have one more!

85
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,833
Your call cannot be connected…

86
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,400
What could they be talking about
that he won't even pick up?

87
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:00,100
Don't tell me…

88
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,366
He's not telling him off, is he?

89
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,867
Mr. Kim, thank you so much for

90
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,466
bringing Mi-so to this world.

91
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,366
You need to be
good to Mi-so, alright?

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,400
Buy her many delicious things.

93
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,800
And by the way,

94
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:30,967
do you know that
Mi-so loves mackerel?

95
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,733
Oh, she doesn't eat
mackerel anymore.

96
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,634
Two years ago,

97
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
she chocked on its bone,

98
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,300
and she's been scared to
have mackerel ever since.

99
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,833
- Is that so?
- Yes.

100
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:45,600
Then buy her lots of chicken feet.

101
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,600
Especially on those days
when she's stressed out.

102
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:53,067
She always relieves her stress
with spicy food.

103
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,733
Mi-so doesn't eat spicy food to
relieve her stress anymore.

104
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,800
Back when she found out
you took out a private loan,

105
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,300
to relieve stress,

106
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:01,767
she went between

107
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,267
spicy chicken feet,

108
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,333
spicy topokki and spicy eels…

109
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,933
…Until she came down
with a sick stomach.

110
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:10,700
- Is that so?
- Yes.

111
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,600
Hold on.

112
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:18,067
How do you know about
my private loan?

113
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:21,467
I know all about how you went
bankrupt with your store at Nakwon

114
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,200
and stood surety for
someone else's debt.

115
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,366
- Is that so?
- Yes.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,700
How embarrassing.

117
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:31,767
Ah…

118
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:36,133
To be honest with you,
we don't have…

119
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:41,366
…Much of this.

120
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,166
Mi-so's place
may have shocked you,

121
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,167
yet that's not even her place.
She rented it on jeonse.

122
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,600
Not quite jeonse, but half-jeonse.

123
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,000
With a deposit of $50,000
and a monthly rent of $200.

124
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,933
- Is that so?
- Yes.

125
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Well, I'm learning many things
about my daughter today.

126
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:09,033
So even though she doesn't have much,
you still like my daughter?

127
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,500
Yes.

128
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,900
Are you confident
your heart won't change?

129
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,433
Yes.

130
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:20,233
Though I lead
the change in this world,

131
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:25,100
my heart for Mi-so
won't ever change, sir.

132
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:29,166
- You pass!
- Sorry? What…

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,834
I officially name you

134
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,900
my son-in-law.

135
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,600
Thank you, sir.

136
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,300
But on one condition!

137
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to see
a proper marriage proposal.

138
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:48,333
I'll take that into heart, sir.

139
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,934
Awww, you!

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,600
I just love you already!
You adorable thing.

141
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,900
Sit. Come on, sit!

142
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,200
Come on, sit properly.

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,566
I love you…

144
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,200
- Huh?
- I love you, my son-in-law.

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,666
I love you too.

146
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,366
Be good to my Mi-so.

147
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:24,634
Alright? What I want isn't

148
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
a rich son-in-law,

149
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,900
but a son-in-law
who can make Mi-so happy.

150
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,666
Though 'rich' would still be nice.

151
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,266
Yes, you're absolutely right, sir.

152
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,966
Ah, my dear daughter!

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
My girlfriend!

154
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,434
Oh, what?

155
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,900
Why did you two drink so much?

156
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,866
Why else? Because it's a good day!

157
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,934
Just what am I going to
do with you?

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,067
It's only been a few days
since you were discharged,

159
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,734
and you get drunk already?

160
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,067
Dad, you'll be sixty soon.

161
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,266
You need to think about
your health now.

162
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,333
Kim Mi-so!

163
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:07,300
What's with your attitude to

164
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,100
my father-in-law, huh?

165
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,634
The same goes for you, Mr. Lee!

166
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,834
You have a meeting with
the board tomorrow,

167
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,300
so you should've watched it!

168
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,933
You hardly have time to
review the agendas.

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,033
This is a secret, but…

170
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,600
Mi-so scares me sometimes.

171
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,566
This is a secret too, but…

172
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,233
Mi-so…

173
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,666
…She scares me quite often!

174
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:52,166
Daddy's going to bed first,

175
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:57,500
so… Grab a taxi for
my dear son-in-law.

176
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,633
Son-in-law? What?

177
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Father, please take care.

178
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,500
Yes, my son.

179
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,434
Bye-bye!

180
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,066
- Please take care.
- Bye-bye!

181
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,066
What's with you too, Mr. Lee?

182
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,733
Ugh.

183
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,866
Huh?

184
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,400
Mr. Lee.

185
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:29,566
Oh man…

186
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,734
My girlfriend…

187
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,900
Ah, ugh…

188
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,466
I'm going to go nuts!

189
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,100
Come on, please!

190
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,366
Yes, Mr. Yang.

191
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,567
Yes. We're at
Jangchung-dong Intersection.

192
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,666
Please come quick.

193
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,500
Alright.

194
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,200
Mr. Lee, are you alright?

195
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,500
Why did you have to drink so much
when you can't handle alcohol?

196
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,933
Next time, watch yourself.
Alright?

197
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,433
Mi-so.

198
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,133
Mi-so.

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,433
I love you.

200
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,066
I…

201
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:55,633
I really do love you, a lot.

202
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,366
To be honest…

203
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,833
When I met you again, 9 years ago…

204
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,766
I was really happy.

205
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,100
Though you didn't recognize me,

206
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,766
still, I was happy.

207
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,200
Perhaps…

208
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,933
…It was since then,

209
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,066
that I…

210
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,433
…Fell in love with you.

211
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,500
I…

212
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm going to make you
happy forever.

213
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,733
And I…

214
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm going to be happy forever,
thanks to you.

215
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,166
I love you,

216
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,633
Mi-so.

217
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,833
I'm at home?

218
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,700
How did I get home?

219
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,300
I hope I didn't make any mistakes
in front of my father-in-law.

220
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,767
My perfect brain…

221
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,366
Recover those memories!

222
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:02,900
Forget recovery.

223
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,166
Ugh, it hurts even more
when I try to work it.

224
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,800
Ugh.
I think I'm going to throw up.

225
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:25,033
Stomach - hang in there!

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,900
If you ruin my dignity that
I've kept for 33 years,

227
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,300
you better watch out!

228
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:36,166
Um, Mr. Lee?
Did I perhaps do something?

229
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,734
Oh, no.

230
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,767
That wasn't for you, Mr. Yang.

231
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,400
That was for my stomach.

232
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:45,133
What? For your stomach?

233
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,133
Yes, uh…

234
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,366
Good morning.

235
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,000
What's going on?

236
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,300
We have something to
give to you, Ms. Kim.

237
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
We have a plaque of
appreciation for you.

238
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,733
A plaque of appreciation?

239
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:33,934
Ms. Kim, who were
with us for so long…

240
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,867
So what's with
this news of farewell?

241
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:44,766
Must you really go?

242
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,400
Plaque of appreciation,

243
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,600
presented to Kim Mi-so!

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,566
Though you leave us,

245
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,366
Your passions and your dreams
that you've shown us

246
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:04,266
along with your leadership,
will remain with us.

247
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:07,234
Thank you so much for
all your work these past 9 years.

248
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,633
From the Vice President's Office.

249
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,200
Um…

250
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,500
Um!

251
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:27,300
I, uh… I'm not quitting.

252
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,266
No, of course you're not quitting.

253
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,866
- Huh?
- What?

254
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,334
It just turned out that way.

255
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,634
I realized that I like this work

256
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,967
more than I thought, you see.

257
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,634
So I decided to

258
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,400
give it one more go, once more.

259
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,700
Really?
You're really not leaving us?

260
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:53,967
This is great news!
We were so worried about

261
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,167
who'll take care of Mr. Lee

262
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,700
once you quit, you see.

263
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,367
That's great news!

264
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,366
We'll be in your care from
now on as well.

265
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,934
But, uh…

266
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,934
I'm sorry that I put you through
so much trouble.

267
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I do apologize.

268
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,966
Then promise us you won't say
you're quitting, ever! Alright?

269
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,800
- Promise us!
- Promise us!

270
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:24,667
Man, what a relief!

271
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,900
I was really worried, you know.

272
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,566
Oh, wow.

273
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,900
Hold on.

274
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:37,866
Then what about me?

275
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,433
What?

276
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,400
I was hired to
replace you, Ms. Kim.

277
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,200
So if you're not quitting…

278
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,866
…Does that mean I'll be fired?

279
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,566
Oh.

280
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,266
No way.

281
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,567
One of the main reasons
I decided to stay was

282
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,867
thanks to you taking on
so much of my work, Ji-ah,

283
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,700
I managed to have
some more time for myself.

284
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
So let's continue to
work as a team.

285
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:07,600
Ah, yes! I'll work even harder!

286
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,667
Here are the meeting minutes from
the meeting with Development.

287
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,134
Good work.

288
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,366
Man… You have everything, Ms. Kim.

289
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:17,934
You're competent,
have a great boyfriend,

290
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and…

291
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,833
…Even have colleagues
who are so loyal.

292
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,934
Come on, don't say that.

293
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,734
Why not? You defended her

294
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,200
against those girls who were
talking behind her back.

295
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,534
Come on, it was you, Ms. Bong,

296
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,166
who first took up that mop
and attacked them.

297
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,600
Um, you two…
If you're free tonight,

298
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,800
how about dinner together?

299
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,700
Why, what's this about?

300
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,667
Now that I think about it,

301
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm so grateful that
I want to treat you.

302
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm down for tonight!

303
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:50,066
I'm free as well,
take us to somewhere nice!

304
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,833
Then let's really
get together, alright?

305
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,034
Where shall we go?

306
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,200
- Chicken and beer?
- Oh my.

307
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,833
Good morning, sir.

308
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,800
Have some pollack soup.

309
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,800
I made some for you,

310
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:39,533
while making some for
my dad as well.

311
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:44,466
Thank you.

312
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,700
How's your father?

313
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
Suffering from a hangover,

314
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,633
just like you, of course.

315
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:56,333
And he went home first
because he had work to do.

316
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,766
Oh. I see.

317
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,166
You know what?

318
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,200
Sometimes my too perfect self

319
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:22,800
would even burden myself.

320
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,100
Because I had no flaws,

321
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,800
I was worried that
I was pressuring other people.

322
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,667
So I think that it's okay to

323
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,834
make mistakes and
show weaknesses once in a while.

324
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,000
I mean, I'm human too, aren't I?

325
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,167
If this is about your
drunk ramblings from last night…

326
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,566
Drunk ramblings?

327
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,167
Why, those were…

328
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:45,100
…My carefully calculated actions

329
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,200
to reveal my weak side to
you, Mi-so.

330
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,266
Still, you should've
watched yourself.

331
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,834
Don't drink until you pass out,

332
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,833
like there's no tomorrow!

333
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,866
I mean, you're the
CEO of a company!

334
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,633
Before being CEO,

335
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:02,100
I'm the future husband of
a woman, aren't I?

336
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,633
So of course I should
listen to your father.

337
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:07,366
Still, you should've
taken it easy.

338
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,067
By the way, what were you two
talking about?

339
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,633
You two took a long time.

340
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,466
It's a secret.

341
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,966
Oh what?

342
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:33,034
What? A marriage proposal?
What's the dilemma?

343
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,567
Just make it romantic like

344
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,867
your future father-in-law said.

345
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,567
You're a chaebol,
so you have the money.

346
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,400
Rent out the entire restaurant

347
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,667
and order the finest champagne…

348
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:43,067
I already did that.

349
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,133
What?

350
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,534
The Dom Perignon Limited Edition
you asked for, sir.

351
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,533
Please serve it with
the cake later.

352
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,433
A champagne's a must when
there's a reason to celebrate.

353
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,034
Not only that,
it ended in failure.

354
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,433
Because of the circumstances.

355
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,200
Oh.

356
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,334
How about renting out
the entire Yumyung Land?

357
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,367
I mean, in the dramas,

358
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,867
all the chaebols with
a theme park do that.

359
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:08,167
- I already did that.
- Yes, you did.

360
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:09,533
You did. I forgot.

361
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,067
Oh, but this place is
already closed for the day.

362
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,100
Closed? Why is that a problem?

363
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,766
When you have
the free pass right here.

364
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,934
Then… Since you did all the
big and fancy events,

365
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,067
how about something
that's smaller,

366
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,366
but with more details?

367
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,800
Or just blurt it out
all of a sudden.

368
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,200
I, Lee Young-joon,
will marry you.

369
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:43,300
I'm smart, I'm handsome,

370
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,133
I'm rich, and I'm also competent.

371
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:46,866
So stop resisting already,

372
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,467
and just marry me.

373
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,667
Ms. Kim, like I said before,

374
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,800
I'm smart, I'm handsome,

375
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:55,700
I'm rich, and I'm also competent.

376
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:59,200
So marry me already.

377
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,100
As soon as possible.

378
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,533
I want to be your husband.

379
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,100
You did that already, you did.

380
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,200
Well, you went this far

381
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,600
yet you two aren't still married…

382
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:22,400
But I'm sure that doesn't mean…

383
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:24,000
…That Mi-so
doesn't want to marry you.

384
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,767
Anyway, Mr. CEO.

385
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,400
I can't believe you're so
direct and so forward!

386
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:32,767
No wonder Ms. Kim
called you a bulldozer.

387
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,866
You sexy bulldozer, you!

388
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:39,500
Wedding Peach Bulldozer…
Wedding Bulldozer?

389
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:42,166
Before I really bulldoze you,
you better stop.

390
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,434
I'm sorry, I stepped out of line.
I was too rash.

391
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,533
Sorry, Mr. Wedding Peach.

392
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,834
Park Rash.

393
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,300
How did you propose to your wife?

394
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:56,666
I…

395
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,100
I was really serious about mine
and made it really romantic.

396
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,933
I proposed to her
under the Eiffel Tower in Paris!

397
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,566
That's romantic?

398
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,466
Asking for her hand,
under a steel object?

399
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:17,434
Tsk, Mr. Wedding Peach!

400
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,700
The city of Paris is
surrounded by that

401
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:21,067
romantic atmosphere!

402
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:23,933
You know, like you just
want to fall in love!

403
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,433
So just imagine.
Under that shining Eiffel Tower,

404
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,366
you two are
basking in the ambience, when…

405
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,166
'Seo-jin,'

406
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:38,133
'you shine more brightly
than that Eiffel Tower.'

407
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,366
'Will you continue to do so,
right by my side - forever?'

408
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:45,467
'Marry me.'

409
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:48,100
And she said yes, right away!

410
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,334
But in the end,

411
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,367
she didn't remain
by your side forever.

412
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:57,167
That was mean. That was mean!

413
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:58,766
You had to punch
where it hurt again!

414
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,900
Anyway, a marriage proposal
should be done

415
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:09,300
somewhere that's not everyday,
but romantic.

416
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,667
Damn, after all this talk of
marriage proposals…

417
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,233
I'm starting to miss Seo-jin.

418
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:37,000
Eiffel Tower, you say…

419
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:39,700
But my pride won't allow

420
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,566
just copying his proposal…

421
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,500
The Colosseum? Too aggressive.

422
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:49,000
The Great Wall of China?
Too suggestive…

423
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:52,733
Las Vegas?

424
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Yes!

425
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,600
A city that shines bright
just like me.

426
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:00,866
Las Vegas, it is!

427
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:10,967
In order to fully enjoy things
after I ask for her hand,

428
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:13,166
I say we'll need about
six nights and seven days.

429
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,466
I can't believe I'm booking
a hotel myself.

430
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:37,666
How sweet.

431
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:22,366
(I love you)

432
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,167
Gosh, it's so hot!

433
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,967
The rooftop! I'm going to get some
fresh air on the rooftop!

434
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,834
Gosh, it's so hot.

435
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,966
That's right!

436
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:43,733
My mother asked me to call her…

437
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,566
Man, they're trying so hard!

438
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:54,700
Let's just pretend we know nothing
since they want it that way.

439
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:56,500
What?

440
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:59,467
Why, Mr. Yang and
Ms. Bong are going out!

441
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,634
Really?

442
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,267
Tsk, Bae Hyun-seong…

443
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,834
They're making it so obvious
and you still haven't caught on?

444
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,400
At work,

445
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,366
what's most important is…

446
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,800
…Reading the atmosphere.

447
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:15,900
You know, I wouldn't have
made it this far

448
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:17,767
with just my looks alone.

449
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:18,933
Of course!

450
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:23,834
Mr. Koh, looks like
you're not too interested

451
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,367
about these scandals.

452
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,666
Right? Aren't you
dating anyone, Gui-nam?

453
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:34,233
I am in a relationship already.

454
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,600
With work.

455
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:42,433
I have no other intentions to
date anyone, other than work.

456
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,867
Here.

457
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,100
The contract from
the legal department.

458
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,834
I already reviewed it to
see there are no errors.

459
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,366
- Thank you.
- It's alright.

460
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,400
These are the contracts,

461
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,600
and this is your schedule for
next week. Please review.

462
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,133
About my schedule for next week…

463
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,333
Cancel all my appointments!

464
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,700
You see, I'm going to

465
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,800
take you to Las Vegas next week.

466
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,434
Las Vegas? Why?

467
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,934
Why else? For a holiday.

468
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,733
You and I. Just us.

469
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,634
Why, did the thought of
us two, on holiday,

470
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,967
leave you speechless?

471
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:53,934
But of course you're overwhelmed.

472
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,200
We'll enjoy the night view,
and go for a drive.

473
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,566
We can't.

474
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:03,534
We can't, what? The night view?
The drive?

475
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
The whole "holiday" itself!

476
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,400
You're behind on your schedule.

477
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:11,000
But you've always managed to
reschedule appointments.

478
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,967
Mr. Lee,

479
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,634
ever since word got out
about our relationship,

480
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,567
there are many eyes watching us.

481
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:19,466
In a time like this,
you can't get behind.

482
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,633
- Still…
- I'll pretend I never heard that.

483
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:30,900
Ah! Mr. Lee, you had no
appointments after work today,

484
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,833
so if it's okay, may I take time
off to have dinner with Ji-ah?

485
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
We could even go for a drink.

486
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,334
You won't go on holiday with me,

487
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,166
yet you'll have dinner and
drink with Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

488
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,200
They're not quite the same thing.

489
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,234
Fine, whatever! Drink if you want!

490
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
Thank you, sir.

491
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,133
Thank you, sir?

492
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:02,900
Is that even anything to
thank me about?

493
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:08,100
Anyway, how am I going to
overcome this crisis?

494
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:11,000
She won't go to Las Vegas with me…

495
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,366
Then I'll have to
re-plan everything!

496
00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:19,667
Enjoy yourselves.

497
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,567
I wanted to
treat you to something nicer.

498
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,567
Come on, nothing beats alcohol!

499
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:25,434
Let's all say cheers!

500
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,866
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

501
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
Ah!

502
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:35,966
This is so nice.

503
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,567
Well, thank you.
For taking my side.

504
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,067
Hey, it's nothing!

505
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,000
And don’t mind what others think.

506
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,100
I'm going to do that, yes.

507
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,534
As long as I've earned the

508
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,867
recognition of my colleagues.

509
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:50,033
Nicely put!

510
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:54,067
So, we've been wanting to ask.

511
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,366
Since when were you two dating?

512
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
And who liked who first?

513
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,233
Come on, tell us!

514
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,866
Well, uh…

515
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:10,300
Mr. Lee… Probably?

516
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,266
- She said Mr. Lee!
- Oh my gosh!

517
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,466
Anyway, let's just drink.

518
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,833
Then who initiated
holding hands first?

519
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,433
Mr. Lee… Probably?

520
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,266
Then who initiated
your first kiss?

521
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:36,933
Mr. Lee… Probably?

522
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:39,934
Then who initiated…

523
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,200
Let's stop.

524
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,100
Yes, we're sorry.

525
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:47,733
- Here.
- Alright.

526
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,434
By the way, Ms. Bong.

527
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,100
How's it going with
your Mr. Superhero?

528
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:59,133
Man! I'm not sure
if I should say this, but…

529
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,334
I'll just blow it
before I'm interrogated.

530
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,800
we already held hands,

531
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,566
we kissed,

532
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,366
and it was good.

533
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,933
And then…

534
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,000
Ms. Bong?

535
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,167
I don't think you need to
go into that much detail.

536
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,500
Oh, did I go too far?

537
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:24,000
What about you, Ji-ah?

538
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,066
Do you have a crush?

539
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:29,034
Well, uh…

540
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,133
There's this guy I like, but…

541
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:34,034
He's not looking for
anyone right now.

542
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,500
Says he just wants to
concentrate on work.

543
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,867
Hey, come on!

544
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:42,100
No need to get so down about it.

545
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:45,334
Make him concentrate on you,
more than work.

546
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,466
Be more aggressive!

547
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,700
Shall I?

548
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,767
Of course!

549
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:55,466
Alright, let's all say cheers!

550
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:57,100
Alright!

551
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,566
Here's to Ms. Kim's
happy relationship,

552
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,634
and to wishing for
Ji-ah's success in love,

553
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,566
and for a passionate love
with me and my boyfriend!

554
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,433
Bottoms up!

555
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:18,600
(Marriage proposals)

556
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,333
(The candle event that'll have
your girl in tears)

557
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,133
How childish.

558
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,900
Who does this, anyway?

559
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:39,866
It's hot enough already, yet
they want to build a fire pit?

560
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:47,300
(The sketchbook event
just like in the movies)

561
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,300
(Thank you for loving me,)

562
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:49,733
(though I have so far to go)

563
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:53,634
Why flip each page,

564
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,533
instead of just writing it
all out on a big piece of paper?

565
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,367
This isn't for me

566
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,066
who treasures every
minute and second.

567
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,200
Anyhow, why hasn't
Mi-so called me already?

568
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:19,066
I hope nothing's up.

569
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:23,733
Here, bottoms up!

570
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,000
Ah, so good!

571
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,400
I gotta have some soup now.

572
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:36,766
Ms. Bong,
you're holding that wrong.

573
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,967
Oh. Looks like Ms. Bong is drunk!

574
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:43,200
She so is!

575
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:44,934
I didn’t mean to
hold it upside down!

576
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,233
When did that happen?

577
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,233
Looks like she is drunk!

578
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:54,033
Let me just go to the bathroom.

579
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,266
Come back quick,
before we miss you!

580
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:00,066
Whoa, watch out!

581
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:06,134
Ms. Kim! The bathroom's that way!

582
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,034
Haha! She's drunk! She's drunk!

583
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,266
Oh my!

584
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,633
You're so drunk! Drunk!

585
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,700
(Mr. Lee)

586
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,100
Can't believe that girl…

587
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,866
Who is it?

588
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:27,500
(Mr. Lee)

589
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,234
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!

590
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,133
Take it, take it! Let's take it!

591
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,467
Hello?

592
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,066
Hello? Ms. Kim?

593
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,334
Isn't this Ms. Kim's phone?

594
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,067
Yes, this is Ms. Kim's phone,
and I'm Ms. Bong!

595
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:49,866
And I'm Ms. Kim Ji-ah!

596
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,034
Where's Ms. Kim?

597
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,833
Oh, she just went to the bathroom.

598
00:38:56,566 --> 00:39:00,066
By the way, when are you
coming to pick her up?

599
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Mr. Lee, come get her!

600
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,300
Ms. Kim's so drunk right now!

601
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,567
- Drunk?
- Dead drunk?

602
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:09,766
- Dead drunk?
- She's totally drunk!

603
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,266
Let's just drink and die!

604
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:22,066
Ah! Let's have one more!

605
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,233
Mr. Lee?

606
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,166
How did you…

607
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,333
Mr. Lee? How did you…

608
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:38,034
Mr. Lee! Here! Have a seat!

609
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,300
Come on, sit!

610
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,033
How did he come here?

611
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:46,034
I told you, didn't I?

612
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,734
That he loves me so much!

613
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,867
Ah! Ba-dum, ba-dum!

614
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,534
Ba-dum!

615
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,933
Awww! You!

616
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,434
Mr. Lee, would you like
a glass as well?

617
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,467
I'm fine, thank you.
I brought my car, so…

618
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,500
I'm sorry, I did it again.

619
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:11,367
Ji-ah, no need to wimp out!

620
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:16,166
Today, he's not here as Mr. Lee,

621
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,933
but as the boyfriend of Ms. Kim,

622
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:23,300
our colleague! Am I not right?

623
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:29,366
Well, yes. I guess.

624
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,567
Then from now on,

625
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:34,366
we're going to call you
Young-joon.

626
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,334
Nice! Then…

627
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,533
Young-joon?

628
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,367
Tell us what you like
best about Ms. Kim.

629
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,366
Come on, Young-joon!

630
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,866
Well, uh…

631
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:55,700
Because she's pretty?

632
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:56,900
Whoa!

633
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:59,566
He said she's pretty! Oh my God!

634
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,133
He said she's pretty!

635
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,666
Ms. Kim, why don't we call it
a night and go home?

636
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:12,000
- Huh?
- Where are you going?

637
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:15,200
It's not every day that
we get a chance to meet up.

638
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:18,134
You can't go! If you must,

639
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,400
then like this…

640
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,434
Write your name with your ass!

641
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,867
Young-joon! Young-joon!

642
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:28,100
Write what… With my ass?

643
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:32,000
Actually, no. We need to
make sure they don't run away!

644
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,433
Ji-ah, take this.

645
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,800
Nice catch!

646
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,733
Still, I'm still not assured.

647
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:45,867
Mr. Lee, looks like
you've got something here.

648
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:47,733
Hold on, what's this?

649
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,366
Well done! Good job!

650
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:58,934
Just what are you doing?

651
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,867
Now you can't go home, Mr. Lee!

652
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:03,866
Ha! We're only giving it back
when we'll allow it!

653
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:07,666
Ms. Kim, can you try
stopping them?

654
00:42:09,566 --> 00:42:11,533
This is too funny!

655
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:14,266
Right? It's so fun!

656
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:21,400
So. When are you two
planning on getting married?

657
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:25,400
I'm so curious about

658
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:27,566
how chaebols propose.

659
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:31,866
I bet it's the marriage proposal
of the century.

660
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,467
He'll rent a private jet,

661
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:36,700
and hold this amazing event,

662
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:39,300
and ask for her hand!

663
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,100
Oh, there's that option, too.

664
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,934
Or buy an island,

665
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,500
and make it really private,
with just the two of you!

666
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,800
Ah, there's that option, too.

667
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:54,100
A private jet
and a private island?

668
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,367
That's just a waste of money.

669
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:01,733
Guess we went too far.

670
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,034
Anyway, if he ever does
propose to you,

671
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,067
make sure to get
a picture for us, alright?

672
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:11,533
Alright, I'll do that.

673
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:14,100
Thank you!

674
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,666
Then… Oh, that's right.
You can't drink.

675
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:19,134
Let's all have a drink!

676
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,900
Thank you! Ah…

677
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,866
Why are you all high?

678
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:27,000
Is it because you've had
a drink in a long time?

679
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
Yes.

680
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:33,700
It's my first time
I drank this much, you know.

681
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,133
Why?

682
00:43:36,766 --> 00:43:38,500
Because I always had to be ready

683
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:40,066
in case you called for me.

684
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,133
Now that I think about it,
it makes me really mad.

685
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,900
Why?

686
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,900
Because you'd always drink
and won't let me have any.

687
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,200
Since I had to drive.

688
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,933
So, do you hate me?

689
00:44:05,066 --> 00:44:07,500
No, I love you.

690
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,666
I was so touched that
you came to pick me up.

691
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:18,000
What's really touching is
my face.

692
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:23,467
Yes, you're absolutely right.

693
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:25,867
You're so handsome,

694
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:27,833
and you sing so well…

695
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,400
This is a secret, but…

696
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:35,333
When you sang
a lullaby to me last time,

697
00:44:36,066 --> 00:44:38,066
I was so touched!

698
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:40,500
I had a good sleep, too.

699
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:44,400
Whoa, careful.

700
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:50,633
My boyfriend's the best!

701
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,033
Ugh, my head.

702
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:22,333
Just what happened last night?

703
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,800
Ah, Mr. Lee!

704
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,166
Awww! You!

705
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,666
Oh no!

706
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,333
Ms. Kim.

707
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,700
Ah, you're here.
Are you feeling alright?

708
00:45:56,766 --> 00:45:59,000
My stomach's fine,

709
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,866
but I'm not so sure
about my future.

710
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,134
What do we do?

711
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,766
We made a big mistake
in front of Mr. Lee!

712
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,400
What…

713
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:14,100
Don't you remember?

714
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,066
I took Mr. Lee's wallet!

715
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:20,333
And I took his watch!

716
00:46:20,866 --> 00:46:23,400
Don't tell me I'm fired
in just a month!

717
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,300
Oh no…

718
00:46:27,633 --> 00:46:28,934
What do we do?

719
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,533
We must've been crazy!

720
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,833
I'm sorry, sir.

721
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:45,033
I… I'm so sorry, sir.

722
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:48,033
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

723
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,600
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

724
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:57,133
It's alright. As long as
you enjoyed yourselves.

725
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:02,766
However!

726
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:06,766
Just once is enough.

727
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,533
- Yes.
- Of course.

728
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,666
What did he say? Was he mad?

729
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,300
No. But…

730
00:47:23,733 --> 00:47:26,534
He wants to see you, too.

731
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,300
What? Me?

732
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,033
Have a seat.

733
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:21,866
What's this?

734
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,133
Pollack soup.

735
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,133
I asked Ms. Oh for this,
especially.

736
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:46,866
You know what?

737
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:49,800
I found that sometimes,
my too perfectionist self

738
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:52,933
would be a burden to myself, too.

739
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:56,600
In case

740
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:59,300
it choked you, Mr. Lee.

741
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:06,600
Just like you said,

742
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,967
I don't think it's so bad to

743
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:09,000
make mistakes in a while,

744
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:11,433
and show your weakness - right?

745
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:20,433
Still, watch yourself.

746
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:25,333
Yes, since I'm the
secretary of a CEO.

747
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,800
No,

748
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:34,033
because you're my girlfriend.

749
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:37,700
I'm worried that
you'll ruin your health.

750
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,633
Come on, help yourself.

751
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,400
After my own experience yesterday,

752
00:49:48,466 --> 00:49:49,800
I found there's nothing better
than this to beat a hangover.

753
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:53,466
Thank you.

754
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:05,833
Oh, by the way…

755
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,633
You were quite cute
when you were drunk, Mi-so.

756
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,233
I'll never forget it.

757
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,300
Are you alright?

758
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:44,466
Looks like you had
a lot to drink last night.

759
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,466
How did you know
I had a drink last night?

760
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,533
Does my breath smell?

761
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,600
You don't remember?

762
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:55,066
You even took that video
with my phone!

763
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,366
Video?

764
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:05,900
It's alright,
if you don't remember.

765
00:51:07,433 --> 00:51:08,767
What do you mean, it's alright?

766
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,767
What's this video anyway?

767
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,034
- No, give it to me.
- No, just wait!

768
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,266
I want to see this video
if I took it!

769
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,567
Mr. Koh, are you really going to
bury yourself in work,

770
00:51:22,633 --> 00:51:23,766
without ever dating anyone?

771
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,100
You really won't even date me?

772
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,833
Come on, answer me!

773
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:33,066
Uh, Ji-ah? Come on,
don’t do this now.

774
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,767
Then just say you'll date me!

775
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,934
Just say that you'll date me!

776
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,233
So I can have
this video for proof!

777
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,734
You're drunk, Ji-ah.
Let's just go home.

778
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,100
Ah, you reek of alcohol!

779
00:51:48,466 --> 00:51:51,534
So you'll date me?

780
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,800
Uh, Ji-ah?

781
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,600
Looks like you were
really drunk last night.

782
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:58,900
You went too far
with your jokes, haha!

783
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,833
I wasn't joking.

784
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,966
Sorry?

785
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I…

786
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,466
I think I like you, Mr. Koh.

787
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:22,200
I'm not sure if it was since
you gave me those cherry tomatoes,

788
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:26,233
or from when you helped me with
those shredded documents,

789
00:52:27,266 --> 00:52:28,466
or from that time

790
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,700
when you called
guo bao rou something else

791
00:52:31,533 --> 00:52:33,200
and laughed like a child.

792
00:52:33,766 --> 00:52:35,633
I'm not sure when it started,

793
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,500
but I think I like you, Mr. Koh.

794
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,533
Can we… Talk about this later?

795
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:06,566
What, why does he want to
talk about this later?

796
00:53:08,266 --> 00:53:09,967
If he was going to reject me,

797
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:12,333
he'd have rejected me flatly
with that personality…

798
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:17,567
Oh my God!

799
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:19,733
Looks like
I'm getting a boyfriend!

800
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:27,933
Good job!

801
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,066
Thank you.

802
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,366
This is really good.

803
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:47,866
Ji-ah,

804
00:53:48,966 --> 00:53:51,200
day by day, I see what
a good person you are.

805
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:56,300
You never blurted out
other people's secrets,

806
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,200
and you've been
so good to me, too.

807
00:54:03,966 --> 00:54:04,966
But…

808
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,400
I can't…

809
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:11,933
…Accept your feelings.

810
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:16,233
What?

811
00:54:18,366 --> 00:54:19,700
Why… Why not?

812
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,433
I…

813
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,300
I want to work hard
and be successful.

814
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,266
I also want to save up
and buy a house.

815
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:32,233
I have many goals.

816
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:35,533
And until I realize them,

817
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:38,300
I just won't have time for
anything else.

818
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:45,334
Ji-ah, you'd always have

819
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,133
caramel macchiato after lunch.

820
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:50,034
But once you start dating me,

821
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,433
it'll have to be coffee from the
vending machine.

822
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:53,767
And your favorite, guo bao rou…

823
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,933
You'll only be able to
have it on your birthdays.

824
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:02,266
That's okay.

825
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,200
No.

826
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:10,034
It's enough with me alone,

827
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,733
living that life that's no fun,

828
00:55:13,366 --> 00:55:14,766
and with many hardships.

829
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,000
Because I know
what a good person you are,

830
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:26,133
I don't want to drag you
into this life.

831
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:34,500
I'm sorry.

832
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:42,600
What are you doing?

833
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,433
Can't you see?
I'm wearing a face mask.

834
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,534
This is real expensive stuff
imported from France,

835
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,966
and it'll turn your skin back to
like it was in your 20s.

836
00:56:57,933 --> 00:56:59,100
How can it?

837
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,300
What do you mean?

838
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,434
By "20s,"

839
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,700
you'll have to subtract
forty years from your age!

840
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:13,766
Do you think that's even
logically possible?

841
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,000
You're really greedy, aren't you?

842
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,234
If I was really greedy,

843
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,900
I wouldn't have married
a guy like you!

844
00:57:25,266 --> 00:57:28,134
I was beautiful, came from
a good family,

845
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,534
so there were guys lining up

846
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,766
wanting to marry me!

847
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,533
Huh? Yes?

848
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:40,933
What?

849
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:46,867
What is it?

850
00:57:46,933 --> 00:57:48,466
Did something happen to
the company?

851
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,500
It could be something to
do with the company,

852
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:53,000
or even our family…

853
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,700
Just what do you mean?

854
00:57:57,233 --> 00:58:01,266
Young-joon and Ms. Kim are dating!

855
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,200
What?

856
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,900
Still lost about how to
ask for her hand?

857
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:13,833
I have zero ideas, but
feeling so much pressure!

858
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,500
Pressure?

859
00:58:17,466 --> 00:58:19,200
This is the biggest crisis
n my life.

860
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,467
Anyway, don't mention the word

861
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:23,200
proposal in front of me
until I say so.

862
00:58:26,366 --> 00:58:27,466
Um, Young-joon?

863
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,100
Since you're a pro…
I'm sure you can handle it!

864
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:39,333
By the way! Pro…

865
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:43,000
What about professional baseball?
You don't want a team?

866
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,300
Having fun, are you?

867
00:58:48,366 --> 00:58:50,033
Yes, it's so much fun!

868
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,733
What, isn't it fun for you,
Mr. Wedding Peach?

869
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:56,200
Oh, I'm enjoying it too, yes.

870
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,400
But you know what?

871
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:01,000
Rather than someone who's
just "fun,"

872
00:59:01,966 --> 00:59:04,733
I need someone who can read the
atmosphere in that seat.

873
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,167
I… I stepped out of line.
I was so rash.

874
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:14,434
I'll cut down the fun and
read the atmosphere.

875
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,933
I'll think about it.

876
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:30,300
So rash…

877
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,833
So rash, I tell you!

878
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:34,434
Yes, mother.

879
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,166
Young-joon?

880
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:40,966
If you're free, can I see you?

881
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:44,566
Alright.

882
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,366
Young-joon…
Are you seeing Ms. Kim?

883
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,833
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this sooner.

884
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,866
But I was going to, soon.

885
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:09,600
I…

886
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:14,333
I want to marry Mi-so.

887
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:20,800
I see.

888
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:28,566
But you like Mi-so, don't you?

889
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,066
I do, yes.

890
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,333
I trust Mi-so, and I adore her.

891
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,700
I wanted to see her
by your side, always.

892
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,066
But now…

893
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:51,466
I'm a little worried.

894
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,066
Because it looks like

895
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,866
Sung-yeon had
feelings for her as well.

896
01:01:03,466 --> 01:01:06,034
You and Sung-yeon…

897
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,233
It was so rough between you two,

898
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,566
and you only made up recently.

899
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,900
So I'm worried that
this'll drive you apart again.

900
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,100
That's what I fear, anyway.

901
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,500
No need to worry, Mom.

902
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,500
The reason
I felt anything for her was because

903
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,866
of that feeling of
being comforted that

904
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,066
I wasn't there, alone.

905
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:48,300
But it turned out that
it wasn't me but Young-joon

906
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,466
that Mi-so was with.

907
01:01:53,866 --> 01:01:58,133
So… It's right that
Mi-so goes to him.

908
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:17,566
Don't you think
I'm doing much better?

909
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:20,700
Now that you mention it, yes.

910
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:22,633
I'm seeing a psychologist.

911
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,100
I didn't expect much from it
at first,

912
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,466
but I'm feeling much better,
more and more.

913
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,333
I'm glad to hear that.

914
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:32,733
That should be my line.

915
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:35,833
You're even thinking about
getting married.

916
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:38,666
Did you propose to her yet?

917
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:44,400
I guess not yet.

918
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:49,666
When you do propose to her,

919
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,900
don't do something that
everyone else does,

920
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,566
or anything to
flaunt yourself, alright?

921
01:02:58,666 --> 01:02:59,800
Then what?

922
01:02:59,866 --> 01:03:01,166
Just focus on Mi-so.

923
01:03:01,766 --> 01:03:03,900
Think about what she likes best,

924
01:03:03,966 --> 01:03:07,233
and what you want to
do for her the most.

925
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,800
Keep thinking,
and eventually you'll see the answer.

926
01:03:32,866 --> 01:03:35,933
What Mi-so likes,

927
01:03:37,633 --> 01:03:40,366
and what I want to
do for her, did he say?

928
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:09,466
Ms. Kim.

929
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,300
Can you come over right now?

930
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:21,933
There's something
I must tell you tonight.

931
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,600
Mi-so.

932
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,666
I prepared the classic version of
marriage proposals.

933
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,733
Because I'm a classic guy.

934
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,833
And who prepared it?

935
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,133
Me - myself!

936
01:05:55,766 --> 01:05:59,733
I can be childish if I need to,
for you.

937
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:05,233
So come in - my love.

938
01:06:51,866 --> 01:06:57,767
On starry nights,

939
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:03,500
I would hear your voice;

940
01:07:05,733 --> 01:07:13,267
I want to be that fine white pollen,

941
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:21,000
and rest on your flower.

942
01:07:22,366 --> 01:07:28,267
Looking up at the night sky,

943
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:33,733
I feel your breath against mine.

944
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:43,800
I want to set sail on that boat

945
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:51,434
and remain in your lake

946
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:59,000
If you should ever leave by my side,

947
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:05,200
I will follow you, to the end of this world.

948
01:08:05,266 --> 01:08:16,933
My love, rest in my arms,

949
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:22,434
and close your eyes.

950
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:33,067
Rest in my arms,

951
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:41,966
and let's dream of love.

952
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,500
What's this, all of a sudden?

953
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,166
You said it was so touching
when I sang a lullaby to you.

954
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,300
And that you had
a good night's sleep.

955
01:09:00,566 --> 01:09:03,566
So I thought I should sing for you
from now on.

956
01:09:08,366 --> 01:09:09,833
Please fall asleep

957
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,600
beside me, every night.

958
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,534
You know I'm not the type to

959
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,800
ask for permissions, right?

960
01:09:25,766 --> 01:09:27,233
Yet here I am,

961
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,733
asking for your permission,

962
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:36,300
in the most polite and
romantic way.

963
01:09:57,933 --> 01:10:00,566
Will you marry me?

964
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,866
Finally, a yes after
my fifth marriage proposal.

965
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,500
I proposed to you first
when I was five!

966
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,300
I love you.

967
01:11:05,966 --> 01:11:08,900
I love you, too.

968
01:11:46,133 --> 01:11:47,200
Who…

969
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,333
Young-joon?

970
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:54,833
Why are you here at my place?

971
01:11:56,033 --> 01:11:57,600
Why…

972
01:11:58,066 --> 01:11:59,534
What?

973
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,800
Mi-so…

974
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:05,366
What's wrong with Kim Mi-so?

975
01:12:06,066 --> 01:12:09,866
I… I can't get married like this!

976
01:12:38,966 --> 01:12:40,933
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?)

977
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:42,767
Time's so damn slow…

978
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,900
Just fly! Just fly past!

979
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:47,300
Just the two of them?
I won't have Mother bullying her!

980
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:48,900
We'll take everything.

981
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:51,966
I feel like I've been here.

982
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:53,700
Ms. Kim!

983
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:54,700
A blind date?

984
01:12:54,766 --> 01:12:56,434
Is that something to get
so mad about?

985
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,567
It's all in the past, anyway.

986
01:12:57,366 --> 01:12:58,933
(Mr. Lee)

987
01:12:57,633 --> 01:12:59,066
Well, I don't like it one bit!

988
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,766
Husband!

989
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:02,966
(Husband)

990
01:13:03,766 --> 01:13:04,800
Married woman!

991
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,866
Married man!

992
01:13:07,266 --> 01:13:10,433
Congratulations, now I'm sold out!
