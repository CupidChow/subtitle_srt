00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,300
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,267
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,100
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,833
Who...

8
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:30,433
Young-joon?

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,733
Why are you here at my place?

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,500
Why...

11
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,466
What?

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,833
Mi-so...

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,400
What's wrong with Kim Mi-so?

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,034
Well, what's wrong
with you, Young-joon?

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Visiting me at
this time of the night.

16
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,066
What's this about?

17
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,066
(Final Episode)

18
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:05,133
Mr. Lee, here's the schedule for
next week.

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,600
Shall we have dinner together
before we go home?

20
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,666
I'd like...

21
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,733
One moment.

22
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,133
Yes, Mrs. Lee.

23
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,934
Ah, sure.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,566
Then I'll see you soon.

25
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,366
Yes.

26
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,433
See you soon?

27
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,800
She wants to have dinner.

28
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,500
I see.
Well, my mother loves Japanese,

29
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:32,767
so book a table for us at
the Illusion Hotel's...

30
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,000
No.

31
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,833
She just wants me, without you.

32
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,467
Just you?

33
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,100
I guess she has something to say

34
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,300
before our families meet tomorrow
to discuss the wedding.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,166
Hmmm.

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,767
If she says anything unnecessary
to make you uncomfortable,

37
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,500
tell me right away.

38
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,400
I won't have her bullying you.

39
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,100
You won't ever have to
worry about that,

40
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,066
but I'll say yes for now.

41
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,900
This is so nice,

42
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:12,200
having dinner with
just you, Mi-so.

43
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,400
Yes, I'm enjoying this
very much, too.

44
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:18,000
I have just two sons,

45
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,567
so I've always been envious of
my friends who have daughters.

46
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:23,034
But now that
I have a daughter-in-law,

47
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,267
I want to go shopping with you,

48
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,567
and go to nice places with you.

49
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,066
Just like a mother and daughter.

50
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,567
Yes, I'd like that, too.

51
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:33,267
Right?

52
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,900
Besides, since we're
both so beautiful,

53
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,566
people will think we're
actual mother and daughter.

54
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,633
Or even sisters,

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,100
because I don't look
my age - right?

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,966
No, you really don't
look your age, Mrs. Lee.

57
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,834
Mrs. Lee?

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,766
It should be "Mom" now.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Yes, Mom.

60
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:12,234
The reason why
I called you out is,

61
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
I wanted to buy you
a dress for tomorrow.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,766
Oh.

63
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,600
Take your pick.

64
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,866
Sure.

65
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,467
Why? Nothing suits your taste?

66
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,734
No, it's just that
they're all so pretty.

67
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,900
Is that right?

68
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,434
We'll take everything.

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,034
- Yes, Ma'am.
- No, you don't have to...

70
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,900
You'll be meeting with
many people from now on,

71
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,566
so you'll need at least this much.

72
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,233
Take a look at the shoes, too.

73
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,800
Out of all these beautiful babies,

74
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,866
I wonder which one is
to your taste?

75
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,366
These ones.

76
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,267
Those ones?

77
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,700
We'll take these,

78
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:14,967
along with everything else here.

79
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,600
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,733
No, I think just
one pair is enough.

81
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:21,667
Why? The more, the better!

82
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:25,200
That's right.
Mi-so, do you have purses?

83
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,900
I do. And quite a lot, too!

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
Oh my.

85
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,634
So you collect purses too, do you?

86
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,167
We have the same hobby!

87
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,067
How about we go shopping
while we're here?

88
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,834
We'll take all the newly
launched purses.

89
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,366
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,566
Talk about Paris Hilton of
Jangchung-dong.

91
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,000
(Mr. Lee)

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,034
Yes, Mr. Lee.

93
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,800
Did it go well with my mom?

94
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,966
Yes.

95
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,500
Why did she want to see you?

96
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,566
Well, uh...

97
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,366
She wanted to buy me
a dress for tomorrow.

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,633
Oh.

99
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:25,666
I should've done that,
but I didn't think that far.

100
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,000
So, did you pick out
a pretty outfit?

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,166
Yes, well...

102
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,834
You must be tired from keeping up
with your future mother-in-law.

103
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,533
Get some rest.

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,900
See you tomorrow.

105
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,567
Alright.

106
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,633
And sweet dreams, Mr. Lee.

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,600
Though I always think this,
but you look so beautiful today.

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,633
You look handsome too, Mr. Lee.

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,034
That's right! Did you say your
father and your eldest sister are

110
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,400
coming on their own?

111
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,666
Yes, they'll be arriving soon.

112
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,800
I see.

113
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:00,400
Are you perhaps, nervous?

114
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:03,334
Of course. You saw my Dad.

115
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,067
He's a bit eccentric,

116
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,533
so I'm worried that
he'll make mistakes.

117
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,466
I hope it goes well.

118
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
Don't worry.

119
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,167
The entire universe wants
this wedding to happen,

120
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,934
so I'm sure it'll go well.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,233
Besides, you have me by your side.

122
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,066
Whoa, amazing!

123
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,600
Hey, would you look at that?

124
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,666
How many windows are there?

125
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:37,900
This place is so huge!
One, two, three, four, five...

126
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,334
Good afternoon.

127
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,100
- Yes, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,934
Let me take you inside.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,066
Ah, sure.

130
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,733
Man, what's with this atmosphere?

131
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,666
Right? Chaebols sure
have it different.

132
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,434
- This way.
- Ah, sure.

133
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,633
Ah, yes.

134
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,500
Man, so this is a house for
just one family, is it?

135
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,067
Not even one whole family!

136
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,634
I hear Mr. Lee has his own place.

137
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,934
What? Then will Mi-so be alright?

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,934
What if they shun her
because she has nothing?

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,534
From what I heard,
they dote on her...

140
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,766
Really?

141
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm glad you came with me, though.

142
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,900
What a relief to have
a doctor in the family, huh?

143
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:26,500
Why couldn't you come
in your white coat?

144
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,400
So you can overwhelm them.

145
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,500
Dad! Overwhelm the chaebols

146
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,667
with a doctor's coat? Really?

147
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:33,933
No?

148
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,733
Ah, it's so nice to see you.

149
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,833
Come on! Quick!

150
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:43,933
Ah, you're here.

151
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,400
Long time no see, chaebol...

152
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,400
...I mean, brother-in-law.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,234
Have you been good, son?

154
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,267
- Yes.
- Dad, are you nervous?

155
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,200
Nervous? I'm Kim Young-man!

156
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:02,900
I never get nervous, not even with
an audience of some thousands!

157
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,434
Some thousands?

158
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
I thought a hundred was
your record

159
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,000
at some bellflower root festival.

160
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,000
Son, don't be so nervous.

161
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
Rock spirit!

162
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,733
Rock spirit!

163
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,466
Why, hello!

164
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:20,700
It's nice to meet you.

165
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,400
This is my father, and my mother.

166
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,734
I'm Mi-so's father.

167
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,500
Hello, I'm Mi-so's eldest sister.

168
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,234
She's a doctor. A psychologist.

169
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,600
Ah.

170
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,867
We wanted to do our utmost to
make you feel at home,

171
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,234
so we invited you to our home.

172
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,434
I hope you won't find us
rude for that.

173
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,734
No, thank you for the invitation.

174
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,467
Then shall we go in?

175
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,333
Sure.

176
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,734
We ordered our chef for
a medium steak, is that alright?

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,734
Yes, a rock artist is
all about slender figure

178
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,400
like he's adequately famished.

179
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,167
So I'd say a medium is enough.

180
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,433
A large would be too much.

181
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,700
Dad, they're not talking
about the size,

182
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,400
but how well you want it cooked.

183
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,333
As in grilled medium.

184
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,166
Oh, is that right?

185
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,333
To be honest,
I haven't had a lot of steaks...

186
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,466
I'm more of
the charcoal galbi type.

187
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,634
Why, then why don't we have
some charcoal galbi

188
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,267
over a glass of soju
when it's convenient with you?

189
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,900
Ah, that'd be nice.

190
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:06,666
Then shall we get right into
the wedding talks?

191
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:12,566
Do you perhaps,
have a date in mind?

192
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, we don't mind when.

193
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,834
By the way, there's no
need to worry about

194
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,867
dowries and wedding gifts.

195
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:25,966
I'm planning to do
all that for Mi-so.

196
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:30,300
Because we dote on her so,

197
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,634
we'll have the best furniture,

198
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,033
electronics and
the finest jewelry ready.

199
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
That's right, you don't have
a car either, right?

200
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,333
We could just get you
the same model as Young-joon's.

201
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:50,300
And I'm sure you want to
keep her close.

202
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:53,867
It just happens we have
a building near Young-joon's place.

203
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,100
If it's alright with you,

204
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,266
why don't you move into there?

205
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,133
I...

206
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,833
I can't get married like this.

207
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,966
I know very well

208
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:26,734
how much you dote on me,
and I appreciate that.

209
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
However,

210
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:31,234
I don't think I can just
let myself be spoiled with

211
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,766
all these overwhelming gifts.

212
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,534
Excessive kindness is

213
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,666
just as much as a burden as
excessive demands.

214
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,933
You needn't worry,
I'll take care of Mi-so.

215
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,666
I guess it's my mistake.

216
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,734
We just love you so and
let ourselves go too far.

217
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,566
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,834
This is exactly why I love Mi-so.

219
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,400
So independent and strong-willed.

220
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,067
You did a fine job, raising her.

221
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:21,200
Thank you for your compliments.

222
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,133
- So, when do we eat?
- Please go ahead.

223
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,166
Thank you for the meal.

224
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,900
You did very well today.

225
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,867
No.

226
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,100
I know your mother was
only looking out for me,

227
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,700
so I'm worried that
she found me rude.

228
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:44,700
Don't worry.

229
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,666
What you said made sense.

230
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,333
And I like how you're
able to speak your thoughts.

231
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,600
And I like how you're
so understanding, sir.

232
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,967
With the date fixed,

233
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:00,866
now it's finally sunken in
that we're getting married.

234
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,167
I know, right?

235
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,966
Me, Lee Young-joon, a married guy!

236
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:08,300
And you just won that guy
who's like the special edition

237
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:10,100
that everyone was dying to have.

238
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,833
You must be happy.

239
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,700
Yes, this is like a dream.

240
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Married woman.

241
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,900
Married man.

242
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,000
You forgot "awesome."

243
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm going to be
an awesome married man.

244
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,334
A married man who
keeps these solid abs,

245
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,733
and doesn't lose that sexiness.

246
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,067
Do you agree?

247
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,800
Yes, I do.

248
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:10,066
(The day I become a married guy!)

249
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,634
Where are we going?

250
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,733
There.

251
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,500
That's...

252
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:31,134
I'm going to get that dish set for
the newlyweds from last time.

253
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,366
Hurry up.

254
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,266
Welcome.

255
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,767
I'd like the dish set.

256
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,267
The one that's highly
popular among newlyweds.

257
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,200
Yes, please hold on.

258
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,967
We're getting married
very soon, you see.

259
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,233
Just a month to go now.

260
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,300
Do you have to
mention such details?

261
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,133
I just want to show off,
to anyone!

262
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,900
By the way, I'm getting the
pots as well.

263
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:01,400
I didn't know you were that into
kitchenware, sir.

264
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:04,200
I am, only after I started
thinking about living with you.

265
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,366
I'll be in charge of cooking,

266
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,733
so don't even think about
going into the kitchen.

267
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,066
Which pot shall we get?

268
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,267
The first is the ceramic pot,

269
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,367
the second is
the stainless steel one.

270
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,367
The first one.

271
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,234
The first one? Then the ceramic...

272
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,400
The first was the one that

273
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:24,567
Mr. Lee ordered himself
during that meeting last time.

274
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,466
Then please proceed that way.

275
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,266
What are you doing?

276
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:37,134
Oh, I received some
materials from Planning,

277
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,000
and I thought they might be
waiting for an answer.

278
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,600
Focus.

279
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,200
Right now, pots are our priority,

280
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,000
not some business proposal.

281
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:46,534
I'm sorry, sir.

282
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,567
From now on,
I'll focus on the kitchenware.

283
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,334
Yes, do focus.

284
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes, sir.

285
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,966
Did you call for me, Mr. Lee?

286
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,967
I'm in a dilemma.

287
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,633
Which option will leave me
with no regrets?

288
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,767
Is this about merging with JH Bio?

289
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,534
No, I already made my decision
on that one,

290
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,234
after reviewing many reports
and reading the market trends.

291
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,533
To not merge with them.

292
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,600
Then what...

293
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,400
The dress you'll be wearing.

294
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,867
My dress?

295
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,634
Mr. Jang Jeong-do has just sent the
pictures of the dresses.

296
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,967
He sent five,

297
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,467
and they're all beautiful,
hence the dilemma.

298
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:30,333
I managed to pick out two,

299
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,666
so out of these two,
which do you like better?

300
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,567
I'm not sure,
they're both similar.

301
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:38,167
They're both bell line.

302
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:39,600
But they feel different!

303
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:43,266
This is like the cheery bell that
reminds you of Christmas,

304
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,800
whereas this one is
more solemn, like that

305
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:49,766
traditional bell in
Bosingak Pavilion.

306
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:54,200
You know what, I think
this one will suit you more.

307
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,266
Yes, I'm fine with anything.

308
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,266
Oh, and I thought about
your hair as well.

309
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,866
What about this one?

310
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:07,767
You have a beautiful neck,

311
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,833
so I think you should
put your hair up like this.

312
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,800
Well, yes. I think so, too.

313
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,566
You must be so happy, Mi-so.

314
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Here's me, a guy that
everyone wants,

315
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,566
and the like that'll never be
out on the market again -

316
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,666
going over every detail of
the wedding, with you.

317
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes, I'm very happy.

318
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,600
Please excuse me,
I have a meeting to attend.

319
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,633
Hi, Young-joon!

320
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,566
Wow, how long has it been again?

321
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,467
I take it that you've been well?

322
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:51,300
Why, of course!

323
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,900
You look handsome, every time!

324
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,833
So, where is your fiancee?

325
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
Oh, she'll be here soon.

326
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,000
I was out seeing a client,

327
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,400
so I came straight from
the meeting.

328
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,000
Did you?

329
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,033
Then have a seat and wait.

330
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,967
Meanwhile, I'll grab the
tuxedo and the dresses

331
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:12,134
you picked out.

332
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,933
Sure.

333
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,100
Then...

334
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,733
Girls, come here.

335
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,666
Just imagine how great we'll look!

336
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,500
Are you on your way?

337
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:34,600
Where are you?

338
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,567
Well, I was about to leave

339
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:40,167
when I received the guest list
for our foundation's event.

340
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,633
So I'll need to meet with
the Protocol team now.

341
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,000
- What?
- We can't start the preparations

342
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,900
until the guest list is confirmed.

343
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,333
I'll be right there
as soon as this is done.

344
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,900
Alright. But I hope you come
as soon as possible.

345
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Yes?

346
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,400
What do I do, Mr. Park?

347
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:12,500
Yes, I've been waiting.

348
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,100
What could it be today?

349
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,933
Well, uh...

350
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,567
It was DM Holding's CEO's
birthday,

351
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,534
so I sent her a box of
the finest chocolates.

352
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,234
Mmm-hmm?

353
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,234
But her office said
they received nothing,

354
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,800
so when I checked...

355
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:27,033
Oops!

356
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,033
It turned out I sent it to...

357
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,666
Choi Seo-jin, not Choi Seo-jung.

358
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,033
Choi Seo-jin?

359
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:41,666
You don't mean
my ex-wife, Choi Seo-jin?

360
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm so sorry, sir.

361
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,833
Their names were so similar
that I must've made a mistake.

362
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,200
But that's just no excuse!

363
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:54,667
What will she think,
when she suddenly receives

364
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,167
chocolates from her ex-husband?

365
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,133
I mean... This will
make me look clingy!

366
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,200
Um... I might be
stepping out of line, but...

367
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,534
No, don't step out of line.
Just stay there.

368
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,866
No, let me do it just once!

369
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,134
But isn't it true that

370
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,600
you still love your ex-wife?

371
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,833
Perhaps this could deliver
your feelings to...

372
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,433
...Her?

373
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:25,200
What, if chocolates could do that
and solve things between us,

374
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,166
then I wouldn't be
like this now, would I?

375
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:31,566
Just go.

376
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,966
Alright, sir. I'm sorry.

377
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,500
Have you ever seen
a sexier sold-out bachelor?

378
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,633
Congratulations on making me
sold-out on the market.

379
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:06,033
You wished you could've
come here sooner, right?

380
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,633
Just where is she?

381
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:22,000
Man, you look damn fine!

382
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,533
That suits you so well!

383
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:28,167
To be honest, I want to make you
try on everything in here.

384
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:30,567
Ever since when you were little,

385
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:33,200
you had that ideal figure that
made the creators feel satisfied!

386
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,466
Thank you.

387
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:40,300
So, uh... Your fiancee's
running late. Guess she's busy.

388
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:44,033
She had something come up,
but she'll be here soon.

389
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:45,900
Is that so?

390
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,166
- Then take a break.
- Alright.

391
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,333
Oh no.

392
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,533
You're finally here.

393
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,200
Mr. Lee!

394
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,300
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

395
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,467
Everyone said
they didn't mind waiting,

396
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:15,900
but I thought that'd be too much

397
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,033
so I left.

398
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm so sorry.

399
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:22,366
I had to mail all the
invitations by today.

400
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,033
Did you have to do that yourself?

401
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,900
This is an event
hosted by you, sir.

402
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,766
We'll have many political
figures attending, so...

403
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,300
If I knew it'd take this long,

404
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:39,233
we should've delayed the
fitting session.

405
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,134
Aren't you hungry?

406
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,833
I'm not in the mood.

407
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,400
Then... Do you want to
go for coffee?

408
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:58,600
Coffee?

409
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,233
Well, it's not bad.

410
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,200
Right?

411
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:13,233
I knew this place would
earn your nod.

412
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:20,333
But I feel like
I've been here before.

413
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,833
Maybe it was with me?

414
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,066
With you?

415
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,267
The coffee's really
good here, right?

416
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,034
I clicked away so many times to
find this place, you know.

417
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,034
Oh, this is where I met
my blind date last...

418
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,900
What? Blind date?

419
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,833
No wonder it seemed familiar.

420
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,967
Why did you have to
bring me to this dreaded place

421
00:24:58,033 --> 00:25:00,366
where you had your blind date?

422
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,267
I forgot.

423
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,267
Back then, it all flew past

424
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,734
so I don't remember much.

425
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,666
Except that the
coffee here was good.

426
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,133
Thanks for bringing me here.

427
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,966
Because now you've revived
some shocking memories.

428
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,133
Shocking memories?

429
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:21,333
I thought you only fixed my ties.

430
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,400
Oh my! Sorry, this is from my job.

431
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,200
Ms. Kim!

432
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,400
Um, well...
That didn't mean anything.

433
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:38,200
It's a side-effect from my job,

434
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,400
automatically reaching out

435
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:42,366
when I see a crooked tie!

436
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,566
What? Side-effect from your job?

437
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,200
Is that what you
call that behavior

438
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:51,200
that made my heart
flutter each time?

439
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:56,600
Well, it's just an expression,
I don't really mean that...

440
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:57,734
Yes, I get it.

441
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,567
It doesn't always have to be me,

442
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,167
you'd just reach out
your hands like a machine

443
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,466
every time you see a crooked tie.

444
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:06,000
So I was a fool to
think that meant something!

445
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:07,833
Mr. Lee...

446
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,334
I want to
get out of this place ASAP,

447
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,467
which is full of memories
with your blind date.

448
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,033
And go to a place where
we can build our memories.

449
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,800
Alright. Then let's go
build memories.

450
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,167
Come on, quick!

451
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:19,267
This place is choking me.

452
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,533
Come here.

453
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:25,966
Enjoy.

454
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:31,500
Help yourself.

455
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:37,000
Was this a tip from
your blind date, too?

456
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,866
That it's nice having pizza
out in the open?

457
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,034
No! this is our place, remember?

458
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,866
And this is your favorite.

459
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,566
I brought you here, just for you.

460
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,033
Since you went to all that
effort, I'll have some.

461
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,567
Ah, it's hot.

462
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,666
Yes, it's so hot.

463
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,467
Looks like their ties are crooked.

464
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,433
Shouldn't you go and fix them?

465
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,900
After all, you're
a tie-fixing machine.

466
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:27,434
Please stop.

467
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,800
It's not like I'm keeping quiet
because I've nothing to say.

468
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,534
What?

469
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,766
You know her, don't you?

470
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,467
Of course I do.

471
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:39,800
Do you remember how

472
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,434
on Ms. Oh Ji-ran's birthday,

473
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,100
I ran like crazy, trying to get
flowers for her in your place?

474
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:45,034
Why are you bringing that up now?

475
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,034
You know it too, don't you?

476
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,267
That there was nothing between
her and I.

477
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,767
That was all just for
my public image...

478
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:50,867
I know.

479
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,667
That's why I've never
said anything about it until now.

480
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,000
Because I know there was
nothing between you two,

481
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:55,500
and besides, it's all in the past.

482
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:56,600
I think it's unfair to
pick on the things that

483
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,300
happened before
we started going out.

484
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,766
Still, I...

485
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,700
Yes, Ms. Bong.

486
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,600
If it's alright with you,
can we grab soju?

487
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,033
I'm not really in the mood
for soju tonight.

488
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,866
So how about beer instead?
Alright.

489
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,600
What, you're leaving me to go
drinking, in this mood?

490
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,633
Yes, because we're in this mood.

491
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:26,500
Then... Please excuse me,
the tie-fixing machine.

492
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,633
As for you, jealousy machine,
safe driving.

493
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,166
What's wrong with Kim Mi-so?

494
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:43,534
Why is she neglecting
wedding plans,

495
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,567
and took me to
such a place instead?

496
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:46,733
Why?

497
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:54,400
Looks like the wedding plans was
just because she was busy,

498
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,267
and taking you there was
only because she didn't remember.

499
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,533
So no need to sulk, Mr. CEO!

500
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,934
Besides, it's not like
she went there with her ex.

501
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,400
It was for a blind date!
Like that means anything.

502
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,267
It wasn't just a place where
she met her blind date.

503
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,300
I told you, didn't I?

504
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:12,866
It was when she tenderly fixed
that bastard's tie!

505
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:18,066
You know, you're right.

506
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:21,366
Now that I think about it,
that does get you mad.

507
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,300
I thought Ms. Kim was the
type who was

508
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:28,433
thoughtful and considerate,

509
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:32,667
but that was so rash!

510
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:35,966
We'll have to call her
Ms. Kim Rash from now on, right?

511
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,833
Who are you bad-mouthing
in front of me?

512
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,800
Like you can ever find a more
thoughtful girlfriend like her!

513
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,467
He throws a fit no matter
whose side I take!

514
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,500
Then what? What?

515
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:53,133
If that's how you're going to be,
go home and talk to the wall!

516
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,467
What - you're really going to
go home and talk to the wall?

517
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,000
Then should I stay?

518
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,200
Bye!

519
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,200
Don't even look back
and just keep walking, alright?

520
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,400
And say hello to your wall for me.

521
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,100
Bye-bye!

522
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,866
That Young-joon!

523
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,600
Mr. CEO, what did you
forget this t...

524
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,833
Honey? What brings you here?

525
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,800
I had something to say.

526
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,533
What...

527
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,933
I...

528
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,733
I got those chocolate you sent me.

529
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,634
Well, that's...

530
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,966
Thanks.

531
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,133
So...

532
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,633
It turns out you remembered.

533
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,333
Huh?

534
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:12,533
Yes, of course I did.

535
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Those chocolates...

536
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:21,433
We had them on
our trip to France, right?

537
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,600
After you proposed to me,

538
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,666
you said you'll get me
something sweet,

539
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:30,300
and so you did,
in front of the Eiffel Tower.

540
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:37,366
Oh, I know. I got them for you
in front of the Eiffel Tower.

541
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:39,566
So why?

542
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,866
Why did you send me
those chocolates we had then?

543
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,000
Because I want us to
go back to then.

544
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,600
What?

545
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
Because things were
so good between us.

546
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,966
We were so much in love.

547
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,666
See, I miss those days.

548
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:15,233
Because I still love you
very, very much.

549
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,733
Yu-sik...

550
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,766
Seo-jin...

551
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,000
Maybe I should stay for
another glass of beer.

552
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:45,600
Uh-oh.

553
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,733
What?

554
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,333
I think I should just leave.

555
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
Go.

556
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:03,566
Go, now!

557
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:11,233
It's been a while.

558
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,500
Ah, yes.

559
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,933
Yu-sik?

560
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:22,300
Since you made a similar mistake...

561
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:23,800
Just go.

562
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,134
Let's just keep it cool, and...

563
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Get lost.

564
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,967
...And let it all out.

565
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,267
No, just get lost.

566
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,333
I'll take my leave, then.

567
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,633
I said, get lost!

568
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,466
Sorry, Young-joon's a bit mean.

569
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:53,600
Ouch, that hurts! The spikes...

570
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,666
Come on, do it right!

571
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,466
These lamb skewers are
just like me.

572
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:50,900
Round and round...

573
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,666
I'm going nuts!

574
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,533
Is something up?

575
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:01,033
Asking us to drink,
all of a sudden...

576
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:07,733
It's about my hero.

577
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,534
We had a fight.

578
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,133
Oh my... About what?

579
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:17,667
So, with my hero...

580
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:20,133
We went to this
spicy stir-fried meat place.

581
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:22,300
But to be honest with you...

582
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:26,867
I used to go to that place
sometimes

583
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:30,366
with my ex-boyfriend. Sometimes.

584
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:34,434
But I just brought him there
without thinking,

585
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,834
only because that
place is really good.

586
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,734
But then I had to...

587
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,733
...Bump into my ex right there!

588
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:43,434
- Oh no.
- But that bastard...

589
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,800
Does he think this is Hollywood?

590
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:48,167
As soon as he saw me,

591
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,967
he came up to me right away

592
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:52,000
and said hi, like it was nothing!

593
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:53,600
So I had no choice but to

594
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,334
confess it was my ex-boyfriend.

595
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,267
But he got all jealous
and was like,

596
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,867
'How can you bring me to somewhere

597
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,366
you used to go with your ex?'

598
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:02,800
But is that anything to get
so mad about?

599
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:04,000
I mean, it's all in the past!

600
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:06,200
I know, right?

601
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,866
Still, I say he has his reasons.

602
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,534
Though it's in the past,

603
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,000
if he got hurt...
I guess it's your bad.

604
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:23,100
It's me who should be sulking,
so what's up with you?

605
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:24,700
Sorry?

606
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,467
What is it?

607
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,433
Are the wedding preparations
giving you a hard time?

608
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:32,133
No, it's not like that!

609
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:36,566
Here's the
guo bao rou you ordered.

610
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,067
And what's up with you
these days, Ji-ah?

611
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,267
Did something happen?

612
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,766
Sorry?

613
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,533
Oh, it's nothing.

614
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:05,600
Ji-ah.

615
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,533
What brings you
at this time of the night?

616
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:11,266
Here, it's for you.

617
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,300
What is this?

618
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,733
This is... Guo bao rou! Wow.

619
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,666
Ji-ah, I...

620
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,100
I'm not giving them to you
to make you fall for me.

621
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:33,266
They just reminded me of you, and...

622
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:39,100
There's something I wanted to
say to you, too.

623
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,733
Though it's alright to

624
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,334
delay falling in love with someone

625
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,966
after you've realized
all your goals...

626
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:53,467
I hope you won't delay

627
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,600
loving yourself in the process.

628
00:37:58,233 --> 00:37:59,266
What?

629
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,500
Don't just live in that
KORI T-shirt.

630
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:06,534
Get some nice shirts for yourself.

631
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,334
And stop living on rice balls,
and think of your health!

632
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,066
Eat a proper meal, alright?

633
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,534
What I'm saying is,

634
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,833
don't sacrifice your present
for your future.

635
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:29,000
Enjoy your life,

636
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,434
since we're still so young.

637
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,200
All the while loving yourself.

638
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,000
Remember what I said, alright?

639
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:45,600
Otherwise I might not be
able to keep my eyes off you.

640
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:14,866
Why hasn't she called?

641
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:19,200
I hope she's not drunk again,
like last time!

642
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:22,866
I can't let other people

643
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,700
see that cute drunkard...

644
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:28,833
Oh, I should go pick her up!

645
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,833
No, never mind.

646
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:33,333
This time, she was at fault.

647
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:41,366
Alright, so it was my bad.

648
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:47,566
I shouldn't have taken him
to that cafe...

649
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,067
Focus.

650
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:55,667
Right now, pots are our priority,

651
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,200
not some business proposal.

652
00:39:58,533 --> 00:39:59,767
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

653
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,834
Everyone said
they didn't mind waiting,

654
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,334
but I thought that'd be too much

655
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,800
so I left.

656
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:07,433
I must've been crazy.

657
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,133
It's not like he's
getting married by himself.

658
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:17,733
Mr. Lee.

659
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,300
Mr. Lee, come out to
the living room.

660
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:40,433
The living room?

661
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,000
As in my place?

662
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,500
What...

663
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,433
What happened?

664
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:51,700
I wanted to keep my promise for
our fitting today.

665
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,267
I went and borrowed the
dress from the shop

666
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,100
and went to the salon to
get my hair done.

667
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,933
I really did my best.

668
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,300
Thinking about
how I did you wrong all this time.

669
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:10,900
So...

670
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,300
Since I went to all this effort,

671
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,466
please forgive me already!

672
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,033
I have, already.

673
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,833
Since that moment I saw you.

674
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:28,833
You're 50 million, no,
5 trillion times more beautiful

675
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,533
than I thought.

676
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:37,866
Still...

677
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:40,066
Be more careful next time,
alright?

678
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,234
I have a good memory,

679
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,034
so every time I walk past that place,

680
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,266
I'll always remember that scene.

681
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:50,100
Even after 10 years, no, 20 years.

682
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,534
Maybe until the day I die...

683
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Actually, even after death.

684
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:56,166
Then...

685
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,500
Please remember this moment
until the day you die, too.

686
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:21,533
And...

687
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,100
Here's one more thing
you need to remember.

688
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,900
I love you so much that

689
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:33,766
I'm finding even this
jealous side of you...

690
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:37,366
...So cute.

691
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,666
I'm never letting you go.

692
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:01,166
Even if you say
you had a change of heart,

693
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,366
I'm not letting you go.

694
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:06,666
So brace yourself, alright?

695
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:12,133
Alright, I'll brace myself.

696
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,100
Why did you call me out?

697
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:34,034
My hero...

698
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,766
I wanted to
apologize for yesterday.

699
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:39,733
It's alright.

700
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,367
Please don't be mad.

701
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,100
And be nice to me,

702
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:51,300
like you were before, please?

703
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:59,667
Man, it's so hot!

704
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:02,100
So why did you have to
insist on taking the stairs, huh?

705
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,866
Exercise is all about
making it a habit!

706
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:05,934
Watch it!

707
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,467
Make one more mistake,

708
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:11,833
and you'll have to say goodbye to
your other arm, too!

709
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:13,800
Got it?

710
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:15,034
Yes!

711
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,366
Oh man...

712
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:20,266
What's this about, Ms. Bong?

713
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,900
I don't think
you need to go that far.

714
00:45:23,966 --> 00:45:26,100
Tsk, let's just hurry up
and go our way.

715
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,733
Otherwise she'll kill him.

716
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:32,333
Mr. Yang, whenever you feel like
a drink... Call me.

717
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,267
Ms. Bong, you're getting
more fiery each time.

718
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,733
Yes, well...

719
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,300
Oh no, my hero!

720
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,134
Is your arm dislocated?

721
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Oh no.

722
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
My arm's fine,

723
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,000
but there's something that isn't.

724
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:51,266
What?

725
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:55,133
Us. I'm not sure whether
you're sincere about us.

726
00:45:56,566 --> 00:46:00,300
To be honest,

727
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,934
I'm not sure if you
really love me anymore.

728
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,367
What...

729
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:06,833
Just what do you mean?

730
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:09,900
You'd take me to a place
you'd go with your ex

731
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:11,366
like it was nothing,

732
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,566
and keep us a secret
from the others...

733
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,566
That's because you're not
serious about me, isn't it?

734
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:22,166
Don't say that...

735
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:25,166
Then... Please excuse me.

736
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,866
Let's make it public!

737
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:38,700
W-what?

738
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,033
Can we have your attention?

739
00:46:57,166 --> 00:47:00,500
We have a grand announcement.

740
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,766
Ms. Bong and I...

741
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,200
...We're going out.

742
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:10,466
Oh, we know.

743
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:12,734
- What?
- Huh?

744
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,567
We all knew already.

745
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:18,867
So just relax and
enjoy yourselves.

746
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:20,834
That means you can stop those

747
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,766
weird behaviors on the stairs.

748
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:27,400
Ah, yes.

749
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:31,066
Idiot!

750
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,900
Where do you prefer, Mr. Lee?

751
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,934
It doesn't matter where,

752
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,166
because we won't be stepping out
of our hotel anyway.

753
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,000
Why not?

754
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:58,666
What do you want to do instead
all day in the hotel?

755
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:07,200
Mr. Lee!

756
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:11,233
How long are you going to
call me Mr. Lee?

757
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,367
Stop being so mean!

758
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:14,566
Oh no.

759
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,434
We have just two weeks
until the wedding,

760
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,133
so spare me if you want me
walking down the aisle.

761
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,466
Are you alright, Mr. Lee?

762
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,166
Blow on my wound to
make it all better.

763
00:48:32,966 --> 00:48:34,733
Hurry!

764
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:40,200
Fff...

765
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:59,400
13 days to go.

766
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:04,234
The days are going so slow.

767
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,833
Come on! Hurry up and move it!

768
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,967
Thank-cow,

769
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,666
your days sleeping next to me
will be over soon.

770
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,966
I need to practice if I want to
make Mi-so breakfast.

771
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,434
Mr. Lee, you must be so tired.

772
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,834
You drove me home when
we finished so late today.

773
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,666
I'm alright with that,

774
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,067
but what's harder is turning
my back against your door.

775
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:07,967
Same with me.

776
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:10,867
Thank God our date for the
wedding is so early.

777
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:14,000
You should be thanking me,
not God.

778
00:50:14,066 --> 00:50:16,400
I was the one who insisted that
we have it early.

779
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:27,433
Um...

780
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,800
I have the wedding invitations.

781
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:33,567
Wow!

782
00:50:33,633 --> 00:50:40,734
Congratulations!

783
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,400
Congratulations on your wedding!

784
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,533
The wedding's tomorrow,
so just go home and get rest.

785
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,833
I can't unless
you take time off, too.

786
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,000
That sounds like you don't want to
be apart, even for one second.

787
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,366
It's along the lines of that, yes.

788
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,666
What are you doing?

789
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:26,666
(Mr. Lee)

790
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,166
I'm not liking this at all.

791
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,000
(Husband)

792
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,866
Husband.

793
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:02,066
- Mr. Jung.
- Yes.

794
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:03,867
This is the list of
Mr. Lee's current projects

795
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:05,200
and the officers in charge.

796
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:07,267
I listed them so
they're easy to check.

797
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,100
Oh man.

798
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,000
You're working this hard,

799
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:11,567
when the wedding's tomorrow?

800
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:14,000
There's a lot to do
before the wedding, so...

801
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:16,566
At this rate, you'll even be
working on your honeymoon.

802
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,900
Let me warn you guys now,

803
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:21,134
but during their honeymoon,

804
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,367
whatever comes up...

805
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:27,100
You can't contact
Ms. Kim, alright?

806
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,634
- Yes, sir!
- Yes!

807
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,167
So please just relax and

808
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:32,567
do all the things you've
wanted to, and...

809
00:52:32,633 --> 00:52:34,766
- Thank you.
- Ah, yes.

810
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:42,866
She's running away!

811
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,567
In the end, you worked
all day today.

812
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:49,134
What am I going to do with you?

813
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,033
That should be my line.

814
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,634
I took care of all the
urgent agendas so

815
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,866
nothing comes up
while you're away.

816
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,267
Since you've worked so hard,

817
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,966
I'll reward you with the
best honeymoon ever.

818
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:05,534
I have a feeling you won't be
able to sleep tonight.

819
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,234
Want me to stay the night for
our sweet day tomorrow?

820
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,067
Or shall I make a U-turn
and go to our place?

821
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:13,234
I'm sorry,
I'm seeing my sisters today.

822
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,166
I'll be spending
the night with them.

823
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,434
Why your sisters?

824
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,700
You'll be seeing them
tomorrow, won't you?

825
00:53:20,766 --> 00:53:24,300
You're supposed to be with your
family before the wedding day.

826
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,600
I see.

827
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:30,500
Then I'll gladly hand you over to them
just for tonight.

828
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,500
Ah, Mi-so!

829
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:45,133
I'm here.

830
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,800
Dad will be dropping by, too.

831
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:48,066
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

832
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,367
No, Ms. Bride.

833
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:55,934
Have some cucumbers instead,
for your dress tomorrow.

834
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,433
Guess you're right.

835
00:53:59,266 --> 00:54:00,367
All set to go?

836
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:03,567
We told you to call us
if you needed anything.

837
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:06,867
Yes, you should've called us
to move your things.

838
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:08,300
I haven't even packed.

839
00:54:08,366 --> 00:54:10,834
They'll be moved while
I'm on honeymoon, anyway.

840
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,433
It'll be so weird to see
everything go from your place.

841
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,400
I know, right?

842
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:20,734
I can't believe our baby is
getting married!

843
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,300
Don't say that, like
we'll never see each other again!

844
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:27,866
I wish Mom was here too, right?

845
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,967
Whenever you celebrated
those big days in your life

846
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:37,933
without Mom by your side,
I'd tear up thinking about...

847
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:41,966
But it's the same for you, too.

848
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:47,700
Maybe it's because
you're the youngest, Mi-so.

849
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,033
I can manage just fine,
even without Mom,

850
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:54,434
but why does it hurt me to see you

851
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,800
without Mom by your side...

852
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:08,766
To me, you guys are mom.

853
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:12,266
Ever since I was little,

854
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:17,933
you'd feed me, wash me,
pack my lunches...

855
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:22,267
And that's when you were
still young, too.

856
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:24,734
I know how hard you tried

857
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,000
so I won't feel Mom's absence.

858
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,000
So thank you.

859
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,366
Don't say that.

860
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,600
Mi-so...

861
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:44,000
...Have a happy marriage, alright?

862
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:47,134
Hope you receive all the love
from your new family,

863
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,533
to make up for the
share you missed out on.

864
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,066
Be happy, Mi-so.

865
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:58,567
Oh, man.

866
00:55:58,633 --> 00:55:59,900
Why do I have tears in my eyes?

867
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,500
What's wrong with me?

868
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,534
Oh man...

869
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,767
Girls!

870
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,033
Huh?

871
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,834
My gorgeous daughters!

872
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,300
Dad.

873
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,333
Oh, what? Dad, what happened to...

874
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:15,133
You're getting married
tomorrow, aren't you?

875
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:19,466
I didn't want all our guests to
talk bad about my daughter.

876
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:22,534
But you never cut your hair short,

877
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,033
saying long hair was
a rock artist's pride.

878
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,533
Though long hair speaks for
a rock artist's pride,

879
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:32,133
you are my pride, Mi-so.

880
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:38,500
I don't want to do anything

881
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:39,900
that will trouble you.

882
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,133
Dad...

883
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,500
Don't cry.

884
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:51,533
My hair'll grow back.

885
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Because the rock spirit never ends!

886
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:01,267
Alright.

887
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:02,100
Shall we all say cheers?

888
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:03,100
Shall we?

889
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,667
- Excuse my empty class.
- Yes, Mi-so.

890
00:57:04,733 --> 00:57:06,366
Cheers!

891
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,034
Yes, hello!

892
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,100
Just congratulations
would've been enough,

893
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,967
no need for all these...

894
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,567
But thank you.

895
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:22,634
Yes, please pass on
my hello to Mr. Kim, too.

896
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,566
Yes, goodbye.

897
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,034
I guess they're for Mi-so?

898
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,900
Yes, the wife of
Taewoong Construction's CEO

899
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:33,467
sent them, with regrets that
she can't make it to the wedding.

900
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:38,700
But won't Mi-so find them
to be a burden?

901
00:57:38,766 --> 00:57:41,100
That's what I think, too.

902
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:45,500
I think we should be
extra careful from now on.

903
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,666
Too bad.

904
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:53,033
I guess I'll just have to
wear them.

905
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,366
I mean, what a waste, right?

906
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,333
Oh my, they look so good on me!

907
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,466
They're so gorgeous!

908
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:21,967
You're here.

909
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:23,700
Ah, Young-joon!

910
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,033
You finally show up, just before
the wedding day, huh?

911
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:32,467
I heard you're supposed to
spend this evening with the family

912
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:33,866
so I came to say thank you.

913
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:38,900
Thank you?

914
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,934
Yes.

915
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,300
It's a tough job raising a child,

916
00:58:43,366 --> 00:58:46,633
so thank you for
raising me this fine.

917
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:50,300
Is it thanks to our
daughter-in-law?

918
00:58:50,366 --> 00:58:54,600
Who knew we'd ever hear our
curt son say that?

919
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:57,766
I know, right?

920
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,067
So it's only a day to go.

921
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:12,433
Congratulations.

922
00:59:19,266 --> 00:59:21,333
It's not long before
you leave, right?

923
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,166
Will you be going back to France?

924
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:25,800
No.

925
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:28,633
I just...

926
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,000
I just want to travel,
to wherever life guides me.

927
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,300
Travel?

928
00:59:35,466 --> 00:59:36,766
Yes. A journey to discover myself.

929
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,300
I thought maybe,
if I roam until I'm exhausted and

930
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:44,433
come back to where I belong,
then it'll all be alright.

931
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:48,000
I see.

932
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,433
Then does that mean you'll be
coming back with a new book?

933
00:59:54,266 --> 00:59:55,733
Maybe?

934
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,500
I'll look forward to it.

935
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:12,133
What's with that look?

936
01:00:14,466 --> 01:00:17,300
It's just that I've never heard
those words from you.

937
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,400
Now I want to
live up to your expectations.

938
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,800
I'll try my best.

939
01:00:33,566 --> 01:00:36,066
By the way, thanks for your gift.

940
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,500
I see you went out of your way as
someone who's paid high royalties.

941
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,034
Oh, I told our parents to

942
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,800
not accept those flowers
at the wedding hall tomorrow.

943
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,166
It seemed like they didn't know.

944
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:52,633
Flowers?

945
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,933
Why not?

946
01:00:55,766 --> 01:00:57,167
What do you mean, why not?

947
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:59,300
Mi-so's allergic to flowers,
isn't she?

948
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,400
What?

949
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,833
(Husband)

950
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:29,834
I ordered all the flowers and
decorations to be

951
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:30,700
(Husband)

952
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,600
changed to fake ones.

953
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:32,000
(I ordered all the flowers and
decorations to be)

954
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:34,867
I'm sorry for not realizing
you were allergic to flowers.

955
01:01:32,066 --> 01:01:33,034
(changed to fake ones)

956
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,300
(I'm sorry for not realizing
you were allergic to flowers)

957
01:01:34,933 --> 01:01:36,967
I'll do my best to

958
01:01:37,033 --> 01:01:37,866
know more about you.

959
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,433
Thank you.

960
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:43,767
(Thank you)

961
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,133
I'll do my best to
know more about you too,

962
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,634
(I'll do my best to
know more about you too)

963
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:47,800
dear husband.

964
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,600
(dear husband)

965
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:50,467
(Mi-so)

966
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,466
Husband...

967
01:01:50,533 --> 01:01:51,200
(Thank you)

968
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:52,234
(I'll do my best to
know more about you too)

969
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,366
(dear husband)

970
01:02:10,633 --> 01:02:11,500
(Mi-so)

971
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,100
It's finally past midnight.

972
01:02:11,566 --> 01:02:13,300
(It's finally past midnight)

973
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:15,833
Today's the day where we finish
dating and begin marriage.

974
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:16,800
(Today's the day where we finish
dating and begin marriage)

975
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:20,133
Thank you for having me
sold-out from the market, Mi-so.

976
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:20,533
(Thank you for having me
sold-out from the market, Mi-so)

977
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:45,500
Your hair...

978
01:02:45,566 --> 01:02:47,367
Ah, yes.

979
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:50,666
I cut it off because I wanted to
look presentable for the wedding.

980
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:52,934
What a pity!

981
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,767
That long hair really suit you.

982
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,000
I even wanted to grow mine
just like you.

983
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,733
Stop saying unnecessary things.

984
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,234
You must've been up all night,

985
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,134
thinking about sending off
your dear daughter...

986
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,234
Ah, yes.

987
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,467
We all had some soju last night

988
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:12,600
and almost couldn't get up
this morning!

989
01:03:13,933 --> 01:03:16,000
Dad, stop saying
unnecessary things.

990
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,634
I'm looking forward to
this wedding.

991
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,933
Yes, I'm so excited thinking about
how beautiful Mi-so will look.

992
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,466
What a fine day!

993
01:03:34,866 --> 01:03:36,000
Huh?

994
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:37,066
Ah...

995
01:03:37,366 --> 01:03:39,333
Huh? You two, how did you...

996
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:44,667
I kept it from you because
you were a chatterbox,

997
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:46,100
but we got back together.

998
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:48,800
Oh, really?

999
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,533
Wow, congratulations!

1000
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,067
Oh, that's right.

1001
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:53,467
I'm so sorry about last time.

1002
01:03:53,533 --> 01:03:54,567
About those chocolates, I...

1003
01:03:54,633 --> 01:03:55,800
Tsk!

1004
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:00,500
Tsk...thank you for
working so late all the time.

1005
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:01,833
So, uh...

1006
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,233
I'm really happy right now.

1007
01:04:06,066 --> 01:04:09,000
So can you postpone
today's blunders for tomorrow?

1008
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,366
I'm begging you.

1009
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:15,033
Let's go.

1010
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:20,300
Ms. Seol!

1011
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,700
You're here.

1012
01:04:22,766 --> 01:04:24,834
You look like
you're in a good mood.

1013
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,434
Today's the day
I'm not holding back!

1014
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,800
Just imagine! They'll have
so many delicious dishes!

1015
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,900
Forget about my diet!

1016
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:32,534
I'm going to lose myself today!

1017
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,800
You're full of swag today,
aren't you?

1018
01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:37,034
Then let's eat like
food fighters today!

1019
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,333
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1020
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,200
Wow.

1021
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,066
Your clothes...

1022
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:03,200
I paid attention,
since I have my first date today.

1023
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,233
First date?

1024
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,100
You have a girlfriend?

1025
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,966
You said it was
still valid, right?

1026
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:20,133
Your confession.

1027
01:05:22,066 --> 01:05:23,233
What?

1028
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:29,233
That means...

1029
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:34,366
Will you go on
a date with me today?

1030
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,334
Yes!

1031
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,666
Of course it's a yes!

1032
01:05:40,933 --> 01:05:43,400
Then shall we go
have your favorite,

1033
01:05:43,466 --> 01:05:44,933
caramel macchiato?

1034
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,466
I'm up for anything!

1035
01:05:47,766 --> 01:05:49,567
I don't care if it's
coffee from the vending machine,

1036
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:51,000
or even tap water!

1037
01:05:51,066 --> 01:05:52,500
Anything's good!

1038
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:03,266
Let's go.

1039
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:09,733
Are you that nervous?

1040
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:16,434
I don't think it's me
who's nervous and shaking.

1041
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,800
I think it's you.

1042
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,000
What do you mean?

1043
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:28,300
I've given speeches to a crowd of
some thousands,

1044
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:30,700
and I didn't tremble even when
signing contracts

1045
01:06:30,766 --> 01:06:31,966
in which billions were involved.

1046
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:35,833
So what's wrong with my leg?

1047
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,100
If you're that nervous, Mi-so,

1048
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:41,366
let me hold your hand.

1049
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,266
I have some medicine from my
sisters to help calm me down.

1050
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,466
I don't really need it,
but since you mentioned it...

1051
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,834
I'll take it.

1052
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,033
It's in my bag.

1053
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,100
Take it slowly.

1054
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:12,866
Peace.

1055
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:14,866
- Much better?
- Yeah.

1056
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,234
Ta-da!

1057
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,233
Hyun-seong, you're looking
all flashy today!

1058
01:07:30,266 --> 01:07:32,200
They better watch out!

1059
01:07:32,266 --> 01:07:33,367
You look so fine!

1060
01:07:33,433 --> 01:07:34,900
We're a couple today!

1061
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,534
Look! It's the supermodel,
Oh Ji-ran!

1062
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Where?

1063
01:07:38,966 --> 01:07:39,567
Oh Ji-ran?

1064
01:07:39,633 --> 01:07:42,066
Hello, I'm your fan.

1065
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,333
- You're so gorgeous.
- Thanks.

1066
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,634
Ms. Oh Ji-ran, this seat is empty.

1067
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,000
Please.

1068
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:56,533
Alright.

1069
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,566
Hello.

1070
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:03,066
- Hello.
- It's our honor.

1071
01:08:05,633 --> 01:08:07,967
Ji-ran, I'm your big fan!

1072
01:08:08,033 --> 01:08:10,934
Why, I only drink the soju that
you advertise!

1073
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,967
Same with me!

1074
01:08:12,033 --> 01:08:14,167
Thank you, thank you so much!

1075
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:17,000
Though it might be
rude of me to ask,

1076
01:08:17,066 --> 01:08:19,000
but can I get a picture?

1077
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,634
Sure!

1078
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,634
Thank you.
Man, you're so beautiful

1079
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,934
not only on the outside
but on the inside, too!

1080
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,133
Alright, here we go!
One, two...

1081
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:32,300
- Thank you.
- So, Ji-ran.

1082
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:33,933
Whose guest are you?

1083
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,166
Who are you here to congratulate?

1084
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,434
I'm not here to
congratulate anyone,

1085
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,400
I'm here to get my revenge!

1086
01:08:43,466 --> 01:08:45,267
I trusted Mi-so...

1087
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,366
What a liar!

1088
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,566
She told me that
she's not dating Young-joon...

1089
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:53,234
I'm going to get my revenge!

1090
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,300
Here I am, in a white dress,

1091
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:58,866
and ready to steal all the
attention from the bride!

1092
01:09:00,966 --> 01:09:02,466
Tsk.

1093
01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:05,434
Hello, hello.

1094
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,000
- Yes, hello.
- Ms. Seol!

1095
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:10,534
Huh?

1096
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,867
Aren't you Oh Ji-ran?

1097
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:13,066
Don't... Don't!

1098
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:15,367
Yes.

1099
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:17,567
I'm your big fan!

1100
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:19,434
Wow, you're much prettier than me.

1101
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,433
Oh my goodness!
It's so nice to see you!

1102
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:23,734
Oh my goodness!

1103
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,933
Oh no!

1104
01:09:25,766 --> 01:09:29,134
Are you crazy? Oh no...

1105
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,800
I need to get my revenge...

1106
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,433
Ji-ran, you forgot your purse...

1107
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,934
- I'm so sorry...
- Yes, goodbye.

1108
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,967
It's all good,
I got a picture with her.

1109
01:09:44,033 --> 01:09:45,167
Tsk.

1110
01:09:45,233 --> 01:09:47,000
- I got a picture!
- Tsk.

1111
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,200
Are you alright?

1112
01:09:55,266 --> 01:09:56,700
Please get ready.

1113
01:09:57,966 --> 01:09:58,833
- Yes.
- Yes.

1114
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:02,300
Let's go.

1115
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,000
The ceremony will begin soon.

1116
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:24,034
May we ask all our
guests to be seated, please.

1117
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,300
I'm looking so forward to this.

1118
01:10:25,633 --> 01:10:27,200
I'm so jealous.

1119
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,900
Awww, my hero!

1120
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:52,100
Then we'll begin the
wedding ceremony for

1121
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:55,133
our groom, Lee Young-joon,

1122
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,366
and our bride, Kim Mi-so.

1123
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:28,933
I'll protect you forever,
like this.

1124
01:11:32,966 --> 01:11:34,566
I promise.

1125
01:11:40,766 --> 01:11:42,034
What is it?

1126
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,300
You think I won't be
able to keep my promise?

1127
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:47,000
No.

1128
01:11:47,066 --> 01:11:49,500
I know very much well

1129
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,400
how well you keep your promises,
more than anyone.

1130
01:11:56,266 --> 01:11:58,500
After all, you've kept
all the promises we made

1131
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:02,166
when we were little, right?

1132
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,666
Promise me, quick.
That you'll marry me!

1133
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,234
I can't.

1134
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,767
Why not?

1135
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:14,766
Because you should only marry
your love once you're an adult.

1136
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:19,466
Then once you're an adult,
you could love me!

1137
01:12:22,866 --> 01:12:24,266
Alright, I'll marry you.

1138
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:27,767
Then it's a promise!

1139
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:30,100
I'll come to
see you again, Mi-so.

1140
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,900
Really? You'll really
come and see me?

1141
01:12:32,966 --> 01:12:34,333
