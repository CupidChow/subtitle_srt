(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,253
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,386
Didn't he look cold?

8
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,253
He's weak against the cold.

9
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,186
What if we catch a cold?

10
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,120
I'm fine!

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,553
I don't mean you, I mean me.

12
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:01,120
What if I catch a cold?

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,620
Oh…

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,653
That's right. You get cold easily.

15
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,686
I won't ever forget
your name, then!

16
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,020
Your name was… Lee…

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,220
Dummy, there you go again.

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,620
That's not what my name is.
My name is Lee Sung…

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,933
How was he?
How was my Hyeon?

20
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,266
Yes. She definitely said
"Hyeon," back then.

21
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:31,220
Did I remember it wrong
because I was so young then?

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Because the pronunciation was
so similar?

23
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,800
Sung… Sung-hyeon?

24
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,733
What?

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,753
I clearly said 'Sung-hyeon,'

26
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,633
so why did you answer
to that name?

27
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,153
Mr. Lee, did you…

28
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,466
…Ever change your name?

29
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,033
Was your name
Lee Sung-hyeon in the past?

30
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:44,866
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,986
When I talked to your mother
about the kidnapping incident,

32
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,920
I clearly heard her say…

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
…'My Hyeon.'

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,900
I want to know the truth.

35
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:05,966
Ms. Kim,

36
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:11,100
don't get so serious over
my sleeptalking.

37
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,753
I heard your voice,

38
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,000
so I just answered
like I always do.

39
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,233
Let's go. I'll take you home.

40
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,700
But he sounded so natural like
he was answering to his name.

41
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,653
When I talked to your mother
about the kidnapping incident,

42
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,620
I clearly heard her say…

43
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,033
…'My Hyeon.'

44
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,400
I want to know the truth.

45
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,953
Come with me.
I don’t want to go alone.

46
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,433
- Come with me.
- No!

47
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,000
You don’t need to know that.

48
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,520
No, oppa!

49
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,266
Don’t leave me.

50
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,153
I don't want to…

51
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,600
…Make you cry again.

52
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,800
(Episode 10)

53
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,053
What brings you here
so early in the morning, Ms. Kim?

54
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,766
Seems like something's up,
for you to come here at this time.

55
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,953
There's something I want to ask.

56
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,166
Go on.

57
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:47,100
Has… Mr. Lee ever
changed his name?

58
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,066
Sorry?

59
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:57,320
I clearly heard you say 'Hyeon'
last time,

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,233
and I was wondering whether
you meant Mr. Lee.

61
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,220
Just what…

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,533
You probably just misheard me.

63
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,086
No. I'm sure of it.

64
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,653
You clearly said,
'How was my Hyeon?'

65
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:16,866
While we were talking about
the kidnapping incident.

66
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:27,920
I don't know
what you'll think about this,

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,566
but I think this 'Hyeon'
is Mr. Lee.

68
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,100
Now why would you think that?

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,586
I know this is a difficult favor,

70
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,420
but if there's
something I still don't know,

71
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,600
could you please tell me?

72
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:01,086
The person you were with
when you were little is…

73
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,666
…Definitely my Sung-yeon.

74
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,900
I have no idea who
this 'Hyeon' is.

75
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,500
You simply misheard me.

76
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,220
- But…
- Ms. Kim?

77
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,266
I'm feeling a bit tired.
Can I ask you to leave?

78
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:23,333
Ah… yes, ma'am.
Then please excuse me.

79
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,233
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

80
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,886
I was just here to
see your mother.

81
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:05,720
Well, great timing.
I was just about to call you.

82
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,886
For what?

83
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:09,166
I need to return something to you,
don't I? Your diary.

84
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,220
Oh.

85
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
Wait right there.
I'll bring it right now.

86
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,533
Um…

87
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,600
Did my diary trigger anything?

88
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,666
Well…

89
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,300
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,720
That woman who abducted us…

91
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,853
You don't even remember
what she was wearing?

92
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:40,100
Or what she looked like,
or even how long her hair was?

93
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,100
I don’t remember a thing.

94
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,020
Any memories of
how you were abducted,

95
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,633
or how we made it out?
Anything?

96
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,233
Why do you ask, all of a sudden?

97
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,786
Well, uh…

98
00:08:56,866 --> 00:09:00,653
I feel like my diary hasn't
done any good.

99
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,766
Because it hasn't
helped you at all.

100
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:09,986
Well…

101
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,386
Maybe it's not that
I don't remember,

102
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,600
but maybe I'm trying not to.

103
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,366
Like an unconscious
self-defense mechanism, maybe?

104
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,400
Because it probably was
that traumatizing.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,386
Wait in the living room, then.

106
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,733
I'll bring it right over.

107
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,720
Why does it feel like
all of Sung-yeon's memories

108
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,100
were told to him
by a third person?

109
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,020
Sorry to keep you waiting.

110
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,533
Here, your diary.

111
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,300
Um…

112
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,000
Which one is you?

113
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,800
Why, I'm right here.

114
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,433
That's me on the left.
Don't you remember?

115
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:40,566
Mi-so, I thought hard about this,

116
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,686
and the reason I like you

117
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,566
isn't simply because we shared
that experience in the past.

118
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,753
I'm not asking for
an answer right away,

119
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:54,366
but I just… Want you to
know how I feel about you.

120
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,120
Ji-ah, did everything go
alright with your moving?

121
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,986
Yes! And it only takes me
5 minutes to come to work!

122
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:28,186
My place is so spacious
and it's so cozy, too.

123
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:31,166
Then when are you planning to
invite us to your cozy place?

124
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,866
- Sorry?
- I meant, a housewarming party!

125
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:41,486
But it's a one-room apartment
and it's so cramped!

126
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,353
And I'm a bad cook, and…

127
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,320
Sweetie!

128
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,653
We're not asking for much!

129
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,620
(Uncomfortable)

130
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,653
(No!)

131
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,386
I guess some chicken, boiled meat,

132
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:52,786
(Crunchy Chicken)

133
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:53,320
(A lump of colagen)

134
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,720
(Chewy sweet and sour pork)

135
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,920
sweet & sour beef, braised ribs…

136
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,900
(Braised Short Ribs
Wow~)

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,753
Just order us something,
and we'll be fine.

138
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,586
We're an easy bunch, right?

139
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,166
(Very easygoing)

140
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,953
You're lucky to have us
as your mentors!

141
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,986
Hey, it just happens that
tomorrow's the weekend!

142
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,086
Why, perfect timing!

143
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,300
- So, what do you say?
- It's on!

144
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,533
It's on…

145
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,253
Ah, Ms. Kim!

146
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,620
Good morning.

147
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,800
Ji-ah's having a housewarming
party. Can you come?

148
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,220
Oh, I have
a family reunion tomorrow.

149
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,533
Alright, then!

150
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,320
So, how much should we each pay
for the housewarming gift?

151
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,253
Well, with Mr. Yang…

152
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,953
That's five of us,
so what about $20 each?

153
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:43,286
But Mr. Yang is always on call,
so he probably can't come.

154
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:46,286
And what, are you not
up to date with things?

155
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:50,253
We can't get anything nice
with just $20 each.

156
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,286
- Our smarty pants, Mr. Park said…
- What?

157
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:56,453
Shouldn't it be at least
$24.90 each?

158
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:59,800
Alright then, tomorrow it is!

159
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,553
Woo-hoo, I'm all excited now.

160
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,720
What should I wear?

161
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,466
Let's all work hard today!

162
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh... What am I supposed to do?

163
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,233
As I thought. Mr. Lee was
the boy I was looking for.

164
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:26,786
But why does everyone say
it was Sung-yeon?

165
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,766
Did Mr. Lee really
lose his memory?

166
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,633
I should just pretend
I know nothing, right?

167
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,733
Good morning, Ms. Kim.

168
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:04,753
You have meetings with our
affiliates from 3 p.m.,

169
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,953
and after that, you'll be
dining with the board.

170
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:09,233
Ms. Kim Ji-ah will
support you today.

171
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,220
Does that mean I won't be able to
see you until the evening?

172
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,366
No.

173
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:17,200
Too bad.

174
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,686
Then come to my place tonight.

175
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,800
What? At night?

176
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,866
What's in your head right now?

177
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:43,320
Well, I guess that suggestive
nuisance surrounding

178
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,120
those two words,
'night' and 'my place'

179
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,633
gets your naughty
imagination going.

180
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,153
Well, I've never been to
a creativity academy

181
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,786
like you did, sir,

182
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,933
so I'm not that imaginative.

183
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,286
That's too bad.

184
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,220
I wanted to tidy up the
documents in my study.

185
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,953
You can't help me?

186
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,700
Of course I can…

187
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,900
…Oppa.

188
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,266
What?

189
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,133
What did you just call me?

190
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,853
I just wanted to
try calling you that.

191
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,500
'Oppa.'

192
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,020
You may keep it up.
I will specially allow it.

193
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,666
No, once is enough.
Then please excuse me.

194
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,433
You can keep on…

195
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,100
Maybe I should've recorded that.

196
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:56,433
Mr. Lee!

197
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,633
Mr. Lee?

198
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,966
You're here early.

199
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,200
Ah…

200
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,200
Oh, I see.

201
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,486
It'll be too much for your heart
if you see my abs beneath this,

202
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,633
so let me go get changed.

203
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:31,066
Could those scars be from…
When he was tied up?

204
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,500
It must've hurt so much…

205
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
Why am I crying?

206
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,553
Hey, Sis.

207
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,186
Mi-so, where are you?

208
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,520
At Mr. Lee's place.

209
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,786
What? Why are you there?
Do you know what time it is?

210
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,786
Are you really dating your VP?

211
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,200
That selfish, egoistic bastard?

212
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:24,220
Sis, Mr. Lee, he…

213
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,886
He's not selfish.

214
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:30,433
He was a much better person
than I thought he was.

215
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,786
So…

216
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:37,033
Please don't worry
about us so much.

217
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,086
Whatever. Anyway, we leave at
12 o'clock tomorrow.

218
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,953
Alright? Don't be late.

219
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,833
Alright. Bye.

220
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:03,133
This is too hard for me…

221
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,166
Is she crying because
they're that against me?

222
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,586
But why?

223
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,566
When they should be putting up
welcome banners instead!

224
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,066
Could it because
they think I'm too perfect?

225
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,266
Ha…

226
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,820
Young-joon, you…

227
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,500
Why can't you be
slightly less perfect?

228
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,700
God, I hate myself
in times like these.

229
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,333
Ms. Kim.

230
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,120
Everything will soon be settled.

231
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,886
Yes, once we shred all the
documents older than 10 years,

232
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,653
except for the confidential files…

233
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,986
I don’t mean that.

234
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,753
I mean all your dilemmas.

235
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,200
They will all soon be settled.

236
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:16,753
Just what…

237
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,020
I overheard your
phone conversation.

238
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,753
Looks like your sisters are
worried for us,

239
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,653
but I'll make sure that
they stop worrying very soon.

240
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:31,086
You know me.
I have that aura that…

241
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,533
…Dazzle people.

242
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:42,666
I'll use all means and methods to
win over their trust.

243
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,200
So don't cry from now on.

244
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,686
You didn't need to take me home…

245
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:04,286
This is so we can be
together even just a bit longer.

246
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,466
If we said goodbye at my place,
wouldn't that be disappointing?

247
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,866
I mean, for you.

248
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,420
Yes, you're right.

249
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,020
My schedule's free tomorrow.
Want me to date you?

250
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,386
Oh, I can't tomorrow.

251
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,053
I have a family reunion.

252
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:24,386
Oh, is it that one weekend
you ask for leave, each year?

253
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:25,153
Yes, sir.

254
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,620
Heading down to
Jebudo Island again, are you?

255
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,333
Yes.

256
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,833
Then good night, Mr. Lee.

257
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:37,900
Oh, that's right. Mr. Lee?

258
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,300
Here you go.

259
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,866
What is that, Ms. Kim?

260
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,786
Then good night!

261
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:16,200
Ah… I can't believe
what I just did!

262
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,900
Good night.

263
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,520
'Is something wrong?'

264
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,520
is what you want me to
ask you right now, isn't it?

265
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,620
Yes.

266
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,120
Please ask me.
I want to let it all out.

267
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,186
Then go on. Let it all out.

268
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,433
Can I?

269
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:06,520
A few days ago, I saw my ex-wife.

270
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,486
She was with some other guy.

271
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,753
And ha… She looked so happy.

272
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,620
But you look unhappy.

273
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,086
Yeah.

274
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,520
If there was a contest for
the unhappiest man of this month,

275
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,753
I'm confident I'll rank in
the top 3.

276
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,453
I mean, how could she already
see someone else?

277
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,520
How?

278
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,620
You should've been good to her.

279
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,566
But I was!

280
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,320
What more could I have done?

281
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,853
I'd buy her new handbags regularly,

282
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,286
I'd buy her jewelry regularly,

283
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,286
and I'd even make breakfast!

284
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:37,886
I even told her she looks
beautiful without makeup on!

285
00:22:37,966 --> 00:22:39,286
And not just her.

286
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,333
I was so good to
her family as well!

287
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,120
To her family as well?

288
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,820
So goes the saying,

289
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,600
be good to your wife's family
if you want a happy marriage.

290
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,186
So that's exactly what I did.

291
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:54,186
Her father, mother
and her siblings…

292
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:56,420
They were all like,
'My son-in-law is the best!'

293
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,653
'You're so good to us!'

294
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,600
They'd coo over me like,
'Awww! Awww! Awww!'

295
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:05,220
- Over you?
- Yes, over me.

296
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,453
What did you do?

297
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,553
What, you don't believe me?

298
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm not asking
because I don't believe you.

299
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,720
I wanted to know your know-hows.

300
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,000
So her family…

301
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:23,786
Wait. You want to win points from
Ms. Kim's family, don't you?

302
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:25,666
Ha, whatever.

303
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:36,066
Man, how do I make it
simple enough so you understand?

304
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,786
Alright, Mr. CEO.

305
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:44,453
You know how our venders are
always doing their best to

306
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,620
win the bid for our projects?

307
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,520
They always try so hard to
prove themselves,

308
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,553
to appeal that
they're not so bad.

309
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:53,420
- Yes.
- That's how this is.

310
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,720
Mr. CEO, you are
a start-up venture that is

311
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,920
facing evaluation from
a large conglomerate

312
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,720
that is Ms. Kim's family.

313
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,120
You've only just gone public,
so their trust level is 0.

314
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,486
So from now on, you need to
appeal to them to prove that

315
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,733
you're really not a bad guy.

316
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,586
Now that you put it that way,
I think I finally get it.

317
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,000
So what did you do?

318
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,400
What I did was…

319
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,933
…Bow 45 degrees,

320
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,466
put my two hands together, and…

321
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,753
'Yes, yes! Why, of course!'

322
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,353
'Of course! Yes!
I'm all good with that.'

323
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,400
I said yes to everything and
did whatever they told me to!

324
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,266
What?

325
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:42,286
In other words,
when meeting with her family,

326
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,366
I left my pride back at home.

327
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,553
Ha… Do you really have to?

328
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:49,020
You really have to,

329
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
in order to earn points from…

330
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,753
Wait a second.

331
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,886
This was supposed to be
you hearing me out,

332
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:58,986
but why am I suddenly
listening to your problems?

333
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,133
Oh what?

334
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,533
Winning the trust of
your girlfriend's family, huh?

335
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,886
I just cleaned the place,
so just relax.

336
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:19,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

337
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:28,820
- Ah…
- Ah, this is so relaxing!

338
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,866
After coming here every year, this
place feels like our second home.

339
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,986
So, Mi-so.

340
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,453
Why do you look so down?

341
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:43,553
Why the long face?
Is something up?

342
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,053
Nothing's up.

343
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,386
Is it because of
what I said yesterday?

344
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:49,620
Because I gave you a lecture about
dating the VP?

345
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,953
- It's not that.
- Mi-so.

346
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,086
Now that mom's gone,
I'm playing that role.

347
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,686
And here's our baby,
jumping into fire,

348
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,686
and I can't just
sit and watch, can I?

349
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,566
No matter how I think about it,
your VP is a definite no.

350
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:04,686
Ha… It's because
you've never met Mr. Lee.

351
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,720
He has so many good points.

352
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,420
Wow, Mal-hee! Did you lose weight?

353
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,386
You look much thinner than
the last time I saw you!

354
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,553
- Really?
- Yes!

355
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:13,086
But I put on 2 kg!

356
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:16,966
Wow, it must be because
I'm wearing black.

357
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:23,520
Anyway, whatever it is…
Cheer up, Mi-so.

358
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,420
Because we need to have
fun today, right?

359
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,320
Alright, let's have fun!

360
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,900
Let's all have fun!

361
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:34,433
- Woo-hoo!
- Ah…

362
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:39,220
Let's have a blast at
Ji-ah's new place!

363
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,866
Woo-hoo!

364
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,186
Is it far from here?

365
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:45,153
No, no. We're almost here.
Here we are.

366
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,486
- Oh, here?
- Ah I see.

367
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:48,253
Why, aren't you the girl
from the third floor?

368
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,620
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.

369
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,520
Looks like you have guests.

370
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,386
Yes, for a housewarming.

371
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:58,520
Oh, then I guess you could
use the rooftop.

372
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,586
Well, have fun!

373
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:03,153
See you!

374
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,986
Rooftop! That sounds nice.

375
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:07,720
Drinking out in the open air…

376
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,320
That'll call for more alcohol!

377
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,086
The rooftop, when it's so hot?
Let’s just…

378
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,486
…Go to my place.

379
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,153
Why not? It's a nice day,
and it's perfect weather for

380
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,820
having a drink outside!

381
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,953
Let's go, then.

382
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,386
Up to the rooftop,
as high as my CSAT score!

383
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,120
But…

384
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,120
We'll trouble my neighbor
who lives on the rooftop.

385
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,886
Come on, it's not like
we're here every day.

386
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:31,353
Your neighbor will understand when
we say it's for housewarming.

387
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:32,320
- So let's go!
- Let's go!

388
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Uh… Wait!

389
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,653
Then… can you drop by to
my room and

390
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:39,820
bring all the food I ordered?

391
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,520
I'll head up first and
wipe the table.

392
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,520
It's really dirty, haha.

393
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,086
Please take your time.

394
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,986
Oh, alright, alright. Geez.

395
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,020
She's a good girl.

396
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,553
Yes, she is. Hey, don't worry!

397
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:51,986
- Let's go, let's go!
- Rooftop! Nice!

398
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:54,466
She really put
a lot of effort into this.

399
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,820
Grow, grow, grow!

400
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,053
Just because you're
cherry tomatoes,

401
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,100
you don't need to stay
the size of cherries!

402
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,020
Emergency!

403
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,920
What, are all your colleagues
rushing over here or something?

404
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,420
How did you know?

405
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,620
They're all on their way here!

406
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,153
They're here for
my housewarming party,

407
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,653
and they want to
come up on the rooftop!

408
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,020
- What?
- There's no time! Hide!

409
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,253
Why should I hide?

410
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,953
It's more like
you shouldn't bring them here!

411
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:28,033
Wow, what is all this?

412
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,786
Eh… Owww! Ouch!

413
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:32,533
Come on!

414
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,620
Oh man!

415
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,666
Oh no… What do I do?

416
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,100
- Tsk!
- Where are you going?

417
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,033
Wow, this is a nice place.

418
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,753
Ouch, my back!

419
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,553
Why did you come up already?

420
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:51,886
I asked you to drop by to
my room and bring the…

421
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:55,420
Hey, you think I'll be doing that
with all my underlings here?

422
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,953
And I'm just not fit for
carrying heavy things!

423
00:28:58,033 --> 00:28:59,220
My bones are so thin…

424
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,220
You know me.
I'm so delicate and fragile!

425
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,220
Ah… I'm out of breath!

426
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,220
Wow, this bench is really nice!

427
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,253
Ah, there you are!

428
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,253
Whoa! Hey!

429
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,386
Wow, the view up here I great!

430
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:17,220
I bet you have a great view
of the night sky, too!

431
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,786
Then we should stay here
until nightfall!

432
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:21,120
Until nightfall?

433
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,386
What, until nightfall? Ugh…

434
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:25,300
Come on, have a seat.

435
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,820
You didn't have to
order so much, Ji-ah.

436
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,553
Oh man…

437
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:33,066
Let's set this up.

438
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,533
Hurry, mix it!

439
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,100
- Done.
- Yes!

440
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,533
Mr. Lee?

441
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,300
Why are you…

442
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,900
Nice to meet you.
I'm Lee Young-joon.

443
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,453
What happened?

444
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:34,786
You said you always stay
at the same inn

445
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,853
every year down on Jebudo Island.

446
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:39,120
And that you sprained your ankle

447
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,353
playing badminton
at a primary school

448
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:42,720
right next to it.

449
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,986
So I searched for one that's next
to a primary school and voila!

450
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:47,286
What I mean is…

451
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:48,886
Why are you here?

452
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:51,120
When my sisters are here.

453
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,666
That's why I'm here.

454
00:30:54,033 --> 00:30:56,853
They're worried about you
seeing me,

455
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,266
so I came to
extinguish those worries.

456
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,020
I'll do my best to

457
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,600
- win over your sisters'…
- Mi-so.

458
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,100
Pil-nam.

459
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:12,453
It can't be that you're here to
give her work.

460
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,166
So may I ask why you're here?

461
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,700
Are you two really going out?

462
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,353
- Well, uh…
- Yes.

463
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:22,633
We're going out.

464
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,653
I know you're worried about her
seeing me.

465
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,020
But there's no need to worry.

466
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,366
Because it's much more
serious than you think it is.

467
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:39,166
From Ms. Kim's side, that is.

468
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:50,620
Oh, of course,
it's the same for me.

469
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,720
Why don't we have this
conversation elsewhere?

470
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,986
I prepared a suite at
one of our resorts nearby.

471
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,620
We're fine.

472
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,286
You told me not to
worry about you two,

473
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:01,753
but I don’t think I can.

474
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,520
Because you're from
a different world to ours.

475
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,886
That's why I'm not
so comfortable about this.

476
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,033
About you suddenly
turning up here.

477
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,520
Pil-nam…

478
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,086
You said you were hungry.
Come on, let's go eat.

479
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,353
Then why don't we
all go for lunch?

480
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:18,586
I booked the finest restaurant

481
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,553
- around here.
- No, we're fine.

482
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:23,566
We already have
a reservation, too.

483
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,800
Then let me join you.

484
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,866
What?

485
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:31,533
You'll really join us?

486
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,466
I'm not sure about this…

487
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:42,433
(Unlimited Marinated Crabs)

488
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:46,353
Wow.

489
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,386
Looks like you're in shock.

490
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,253
Is it because it's only $19.90 per
person when it's unlimited?

491
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:56,020
Yes. I can't believe
they still make a profit.

492
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,020
It's called a quick-return.

493
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,066
They keep the costs low
and the sales volume high.

494
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,120
But I'm not sure whether these
cheap crabs will suit your palate.

495
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,753
Because I bet you only had
top-quality ones until now.

496
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:10,153
If this is too uncomfortable for
you, you may leave.

497
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,753
No, I am from the
same world as you.

498
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,533
I don't find this
uncomfortable at all.

499
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,620
Mr. Lee, I think
you should go back.

500
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,420
No, I'm going to have
those marinated crabs.

501
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,833
As much as I can.

502
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:45,820
I'll do it, Ms. Kim.

503
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,153
You're dating, and
you still call her Ms. Kim?

504
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:50,866
And you call him Mr. Lee?

505
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,486
Thanks for pointing that out.

506
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:01,086
I was starting to think
we needed to fix this.

507
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,766
So just call me
oppa already, Mi-so.

508
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,633
Pil-nam, that's for us to decide.

509
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,486
I'm so full already!

510
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:15,000
I feel like I'm stuffed with
crabs up to here.

511
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:21,266
Guess I need to
fill them up to here now.

512
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:27,520
Why's she eating when
she just said she's full?

513
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,866
To get our money's worth.

514
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,286
Sorry?

515
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:32,866
Might as well as eat more for
the same price, right?

516
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,320
Oh, that's right!

517
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,886
Guess you'd never understand.

518
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:39,853
That feeling of wanting to
get your money's worth,

519
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,686
even it means eating until
you burst your stomach!

520
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:42,733
Oh, I do.

521
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:47,153
You've heard of the saying,
'The have's are worse?'

522
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:48,586
Well, that'll be me.

523
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,853
I'm going to get more than
my money's worth today.

524
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,266
Alright, in we go.

525
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,900
Wow, that's juicy!

526
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Hey!

527
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,666
Then… One more plate!

528
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,686
You over there!

529
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,253
What, is this your last day
eating marinated crabs, ever?

530
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,786
You're almost risking your
life there, eating them!

531
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:14,600
Tsk, tsk…

532
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,253
You can stop now.

533
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:22,153
You've eaten more than
your money's worth.

534
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:23,433
Oh. Did I?

535
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,286
Well, let me stop here for today.

536
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,000
Now I feel like
I finally got my money's worth.

537
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:48,020
Ha… Did I eat too much?

538
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,200
I feel like all my
insides are full of crabs!

539
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,886
Here you go, some water.

540
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:57,633
Don't tell me
you have indigestion?

541
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,653
I'm Lee Young-joon,
who's talented in everything.

542
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,433
Including digesting food.

543
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Since we're done,
why don't you now go…

544
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,700
Bleh… Ah…

545
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,386
What's with that fashion?

546
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:21,066
Oh, we're going digging for clams.

547
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:23,653
Every year when we're down here,

548
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:25,466
we always dig them and
eat them later.

549
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:28,253
What?
Why force labor onto yourself

550
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,553
when you're here on holiday?

551
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:32,353
Well, what would you know,

552
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,353
when you've got
all the chefs cooking up

553
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:36,986
all the freshest ingredients.

554
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:38,986
You'd never understand
why we go digging for clams.

555
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:41,533
It's because we want
fresh clam noodles!

556
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:46,486
This is why I said
he's from a different world…

557
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:47,820
Tsk.

558
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,366
Let me join you! For clam-digging!

559
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,866
What?

560
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:55,520
Forget it.

561
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,386
You probably only walked on
red carpet all your life,

562
00:37:57,466 --> 00:37:59,753
so you think you can
handle a mud flat?

563
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,133
I can.

564
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:03,886
As long as I'm with Ms. Kim,

565
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:06,700
be it a mud flat or a thorny path,
I'm not afraid!

566
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,333
Off to the sea!

567
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:21,853
Mud flat!

568
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,533
To the mud flat!

569
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:26,786
Wow, this is delicious.

570
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:28,653
Yes, it's so good.

571
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:31,153
Hey, you know what?

572
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:33,520
Since this is
Ji-ah's housewarming party,

573
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,820
let's all drink to her!

574
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,586
Shall we? Woo-hoo!

575
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,420
To Ji-ah's happy life here!

576
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,166
- To Ji-ah!
- To Ji-ah!

577
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:43,100
Bottoms up!

578
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,953
Man! Alcohol tastes
so sweet today.

579
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:51,986
This place is no nice!

580
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:53,286
Hey, my bag!

581
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:55,566
Wait!

582
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,653
Huh?

583
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:00,320
Let me get you something to
wipe that with.

584
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,120
Tsk… This is an expensive purse!

585
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,533
Thanks, Ji-ah. You're sure great!

586
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:06,820
I thought it was going to be
nice and breezy today,

587
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,986
but the sun's too strong.

588
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:10,553
Shall we move over to that shade?

589
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:13,120
Yes! Because UV rays are
your skin's worst enemy.

590
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,653
- Let's move right now!
- Let's go!

591
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:16,333
Alright, everyone. Come down.

592
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:18,386
I think this way.

593
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:19,553
Alright, that way it is.

594
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,120
- Watch it.
- Yes, sir.

595
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,800
Alright, here we go.
One, two, three!

596
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:24,666
Let's go that way.

597
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:32,933
- One, two! One, two!
- One, two!

598
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,133
Oh man…

599
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:39,553
Surprise!

600
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,286
Mr… Koh?

601
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:43,020
What are you doing here?

602
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,686
I told you, surprise!

603
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,253
'Surprise?'

604
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,153
Yes. I was invited to
the housewarming, too.

605
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:52,686
But I'm such a creative person

606
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,720
who thinks you need fresh ideas

607
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,520
even when you're having fun.

608
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,253
So I thought
I should surprise you.

609
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,553
That's why
I planned this with Ji-ah,

610
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,353
and hid under here.

611
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,120
While listening in and
waiting for the perfect timing…

612
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,953
You just happened to
lift that bench in time!

613
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,366
Haha, nice timing!

614
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,986
Well, back to our food!

615
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:25,953
Join us, Mr. Koh.

616
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:27,300
- Let's all sit.
- Sure!

617
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,853
Mr. Koh, do you want some…

618
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,786
Oh. Looks like
we'll need more beer.

619
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,986
That's all we have.
I'll go get some more.

620
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:35,953
No, let me!

621
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,586
I saw a big supermarket
on the way.

622
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,320
Let me go grab some from there.

623
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,286
What's up with you,

624
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:42,286
volunteering like that…

625
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:43,320
If I want to drink more,

626
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,520
I need to take a break to
digest, you know.

627
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,586
Then go and digest!

628
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,686
Alright, I'll make it quick!

629
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:50,700
- Enjoy yourselves in the meantime.
- Alright!

630
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,720
Hey, that looks delicious.

631
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,986
- Hello.
- Can I try one?

632
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,686
Of course. It's buy one,
get one free!

633
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:15,333
- Really?
- Yes.

634
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:20,253
Wow, that's so delicious!

635
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,920
Let me have one more.

636
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,653
Lady, you can't take
all three for yourself!

637
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,200
It's not like
you're going to buy any.

638
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,766
She is!

639
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:34,633
One, two, three!

640
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,086
We'll take as much as three!

641
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,366
So don't you
embarrass her like that.

642
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:45,820
Let's go, Ms. Bong.

643
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,700
Ah, sure…

644
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,220
Ugh…

645
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,420
So is your VP coming or not?

646
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,986
I know, right? Why did he bluff,
if he wasn't confident?

647
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:11,686
Pil-nam!

648
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,420
What's with that glare?

649
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,420
But aren't you being
too harsh on him?

650
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,020
I know you're in shock because
he suddenly turned up to

651
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,053
announce we're going out, but…

652
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,253
It's not like you to
be so rude!

653
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,620
Mi-so! I was only worried for you.

654
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,086
I said, there's no need to worry!

655
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,786
Mr. Lee isn't the person
you think he is.

656
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:28,420
He protects me
when I get scared,

657
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,586
and always looks out for me.

658
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,200
You know nothing about him.

659
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:40,453
Oh my goodness!

660
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:41,966
I can't believe this!

661
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,633
Sorry I'm late.

662
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:14,453
Mr. Lee, where did you
get all that?

663
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:17,953
It's my principle to be
perfect at everything I do.

664
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:20,553
Having the right tools isn't
all there is to this.

665
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:23,253
It's all about the expertise
and the know-hows

666
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,400
which we built over
all these years!

667
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,000
Sis!

668
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:32,986
Then… How about a battle?

669
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:34,353
- A battle?
- Let's team up like this,

670
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:35,453
us against you.

671
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,686
The losers have to grant the
other team's wish. How about it?

672
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:38,766
Bring it on!

673
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,600
Whatever.

674
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,653
Ms. Kim,

675
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,320
I'm going to do my best
since this is a competition,

676
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,620
but what is your wish?

677
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,100
Oh. I'm going to
ask them not to hate you.

678
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:13,566
That just washed away
all my fatigue.

679
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:25,333
Ha! Nice!

680
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,533
Pebble…

681
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,933
Guess this is not the place.

682
00:44:48,466 --> 00:44:49,700
There we go!

683
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:52,766
Clams!

684
00:44:54,766 --> 00:44:55,633
Clams!

685
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:58,900
Oh man…

686
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,333
Alright, now just the
collecting to do.

687
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:15,620
So we won, right?

688
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,986
Yes, yes.
Congratulations, Mi-so.

689
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:20,266
Mr. Lee?

690
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:23,386
So?

691
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:24,853
What's your wish, Mi-so?

692
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,666
Well, my wish is…

693
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:33,366
…For you to not hate Mr. Lee.

694
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,153
No,

695
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,486
you can hate me if you want.

696
00:45:40,566 --> 00:45:44,020
But please…
Keep watching over us.

697
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,520
Let me prove to you incessantly

698
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,400
that I'm serious about Mi-so.

699
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:56,833
Alright. Let's go.

700
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:58,420
Oh my gosh!

701
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,466
Ah…

702
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:02,566
Are you alright?

703
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,066
Yes.

704
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:09,600
By the way,
why are your hands so cold?

705
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,733
Let me see.

706
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:15,666
Is from your indigestion?

707
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:17,720
I knew it from when you were

708
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,086
stuffing those crabs into you…

709
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,186
Well, uh…

710
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:23,653
Come on. Let's get you
some medicine.

711
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:24,586
Uh, Ms. Kim? I'm…

712
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:25,753
- Let's take those clams first.
- No.

713
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,233
- The clams!
- Come on!

714
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:33,120
I guess it's from
eating all those crabs to

715
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,220
win points from us, huh?

716
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,486
Well, no one told him to
eat that much.

717
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:43,153
To be honest, I'm a bit surprised.

718
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,586
He looked so full of himself
on the news, but...

719
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,253
Here he is, trying so hard,

720
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,420
even putting up
with your bullying!

721
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,453
He really must be
serious about Mi-so.

722
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:55,600
Don't you think so, too?

723
00:46:57,633 --> 00:47:02,220
It's just the sexual dysfunction
part that bothers me,

724
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,886
but I think overall,
he's not a bad person.

725
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:09,020
Besides, his sister-in-law is
an expert so he'll get over it.

726
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,633
What? 'Sister-in-law?'

727
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,320
Come on. I like the guy!

728
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,300
So you try opening
your heart, too.

729
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,433
Whatever. Hey, it's hot.
Let's go.

730
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,800
- Take that.
- But this is the heavy one!

731
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,533
Ugh.

732
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,266
Give me your hand.

733
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:34,620
I'm alright.

734
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,753
Whatever. Pricking your finger is
the best way to beat indigestion.

735
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,000
But still…

736
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,320
Hey, a UFO!

737
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,353
Where?

738
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:44,020
Argh! Ouch! Blood!

739
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,600
Um… blood. I'm bleeding.

740
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,020
Go get some rest.

741
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,753
You're not well.

742
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,686
No. I'm all better now.

743
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:56,086
Let me help.

744
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,920
No, leave this to us.

745
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,286
Then can you knead this for us?

746
00:48:01,366 --> 00:48:02,753
This is usually Dad's job,

747
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:05,320
but he couldn't come today
because he had a concert.

748
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,933
Gosh, it's so tough
with my frail arms.

749
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:13,500
Oh. Let me take that for you.

750
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,800
Um, Mr. Lee? Be a little gentler.

751
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:32,466
You know, I really think
that did the trick.

752
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:36,900
Then… I'll prick it for you
again next time.

753
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,000
Gently, a little more gently.

754
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,786
Then shall we all go
have some beer?

755
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,420
There's a bar just around here.

756
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,000
- Then let's go.
- Let's go!

757
00:49:08,766 --> 00:49:10,920
Where are you all going?

758
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,553
It looked like it was
going to rain,

759
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:14,853
so we're heading indoors.

760
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:17,420
Then you should've called!

761
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,700
You made us spend money for…

762
00:49:20,366 --> 00:49:25,553
I mean, I guess this could be our
housewarming gift for JI-ah.

763
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:28,120
What, this much?

764
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,533
- Then let's go!
- Let's go!

765
00:49:41,866 --> 00:49:43,286
Is it because
we're the only ones here?

766
00:49:43,366 --> 00:49:44,586
It's so quiet in here.

767
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:47,553
Right? Why are you
all silent today?

768
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:50,420
Anything interesting to tell?

769
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,920
Like there is,

770
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,420
when we're always
stuck with each other.

771
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,153
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

772
00:49:57,233 --> 00:49:58,653
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

773
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,120
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

774
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,153
You heard about a park project
just around here, right?

775
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,753
Can you sign here to
say you agree?

776
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:08,553
Hey, aren't you the girl
from room 301?

777
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:10,820
Can you sign this, too?

778
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,420
I just need your signature and
that guy on the rooftop's.

779
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,453
Oh, is that right?

780
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:17,786
Um… Here.

781
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:20,866
- Thanks!
- Bye.

782
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,420
Uh, what are you doing?

783
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,786
Hiding behind that squid…

784
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:29,266
Well, uh…

785
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:32,886
'Masked Singer!'

786
00:50:32,966 --> 00:50:35,786
- What, 'Masked Singer?'
- Yes.

787
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,953
You were just asking whether
there's anything,

788
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:43,800
so I thought I should
sing a song for you.

789
00:50:44,466 --> 00:50:46,233
Then here I go!

790
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,786
Stop, stop!

791
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:58,053
Why, what is it?

792
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:00,220
I know you're eager to
climb the corporate ladder,

793
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,086
but do you really have to do this?

794
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,853
What do you mean?

795
00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:06,520
You probably heard that
the VP's Office is the

796
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,620
shortcut to the top, huh?

797
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,253
That's why you want to
transfer here.

798
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,686
And who do you have to
flatter to do that?

799
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:18,286
You got thinking, and then…
Eureka!

800
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:22,420
You probably came to the
conclusion to flatter me,

801
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,586
because I'm the boss
in this place.

802
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,700
Am I not right?

803
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:28,953
No way.

804
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:30,666
But it is!

805
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:35,166
I mean, I went to KORI, too!

806
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,386
So you probably first tried the
'I went to KORI too' card,

807
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:43,386
then tried to earn points by
singing a tune for me.

808
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:45,753
It's all to get into
my good books, isn't it?

809
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:48,766
Am I not right, Mr. Koh?

810
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,300
You're right, sir. Yes!

811
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,966
Whoa! Be careful, Ms. Bong.

812
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:08,620
No, you be careful.

813
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,620
What should I be careful about?

814
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,020
Just… Everything!

815
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,186
Don't try to come onto me,
picking up my pads,

816
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:21,086
and don’t buy me those
3 packs of sausages.

817
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:24,666
And don't seduce me

818
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,253
Why are you following me?

819
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,220
Because you look like
you're drunk.

820
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,653
In case you fall over.

821
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:44,853
There you go again!

822
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:47,300
Then come on! Protect me!

823
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,486
That's strange.

824
00:52:55,566 --> 00:53:00,666
I have extremely high standards,
but I kind of like Mr. Yang.

825
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:04,353
Should I ask him out?

826
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:05,586
No, no.

827
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,253
It's too embarrassing,
so I'm not saying it first.

828
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:12,020
How can a girl ask
a guy out first, right?

829
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,586
Let's not throw your pride away!

830
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:15,700
Whoa, whoa!

831
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:44,653
What do you think?
With the clams we dug up,

832
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:47,386
we made clam noodles
and even pancakes.

833
00:53:47,466 --> 00:53:48,753
Delicious, huh?

834
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:53,020
Yes. I'll make sure to
join you next year as well.

835
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,986
We'll see, not just yet.

836
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,033
Alright.

837
00:53:59,266 --> 00:54:02,053
So… Do you always
spend your holiday here,

838
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,653
digging up clams?

839
00:54:03,733 --> 00:54:06,700
Yes. Usually, Dad's always
here with us, too.

840
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,753
What a unique family tradition.

841
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,033
Is it?

842
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:18,720
We promised Mom.

843
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,986
Promise?

844
00:54:21,066 --> 00:54:23,400
It was when Mi-so was 4 years old.

845
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:28,986
Dad had wanted to try out for
the beach music festival,

846
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:32,500
so we'd even borrowed
our neighbor's car.

847
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,553
I'm going to win
no matter what and

848
00:54:35,633 --> 00:54:39,386
give that trophy to your Mom
as her birthday present!

849
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:44,020
And during my acceptance speech,

850
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,500
I'm going to shout out your name!

851
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,653
- I'll look forward to it.
- Please do.

852
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:51,066
The sea!

853
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,086
- Hey, it's the sea.
- It's the sea!

854
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,800
Wow, so pretty!

855
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,120
Looks like
we still have some time.

856
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,166
Can we drop by?

857
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,120
Sure.

858
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,220
Kids, shall we all go
drop by the beach?

859
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,366
- Yes!
- Yes!

860
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,466
Alright, let's…

861
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,700
Why? Did you lose something?

862
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:45,086
The car key.

863
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:46,566
What?

864
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,920
I'm the worst husband.

865
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,620
I wanted to give you that
trophy for your birthday,

866
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,020
but instead I ended up
giving you worries.

867
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,353
This is the worst birthday for
you ever, right?

868
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:13,353
No, honey. I'm sure you're more
disappointed about the contest.

869
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:14,320
Found it!

870
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,453
I found it for you!

871
00:56:15,533 --> 00:56:17,266
Really? You did?

872
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,220
Oh, you didn't mean
you found the car key,

873
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,053
but a clam.

874
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:27,153
Yeah! It's my first time
seeing one for real!

875
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,466
Let's cook this!

876
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:33,766
But we'll need
a little more for that.

877
00:56:34,533 --> 00:56:37,220
Kids, shall we all go
digging for clams?

878
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,066
- Yes!
- Yes!

879
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,933
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

880
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:48,686
Oops, sorry.

881
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:49,986
You keep looking for the key.

882
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:52,020
I'll look after the kids.

883
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,786
No. Michael J. Fox once said,

884
00:56:55,866 --> 00:56:57,420
'Family is not an important thing.

885
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,433
It's everything.'

886
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,420
I can just call car service,

887
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,286
and always participate in that
contest next year.

888
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:06,953
So today, I'm going to
focus on my everything.

889
00:57:07,033 --> 00:57:09,033
My family.

890
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,153
But will it really be alright?

891
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:15,900
Of course. Besides, I was too busy
recently to spend time with them.

892
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,466
Maybe this happened today

893
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,100
so we can all have fun.

894
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,186
You're not the
worst husband in the world,

895
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:29,520
and this isn't
my worst birthday ever.

896
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,286
Because thanks to you, honey,

897
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,066
we're all having fun.

898
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,700
So said the legendary
heavy metal vocalist, Rob Halford.

899
00:57:40,566 --> 00:57:44,653
Pee! I need to pee!

900
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:48,466
Your daughter says
she needs to pee.

901
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,433
Alright, let's go!
Daddy will take you.

902
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,100
Shall we all come down here
on my birthday each year?

903
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,200
Really? Yay!

904
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:12,020
Mom kept that promise
until the following year,

905
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,700
and passed away.

906
00:58:15,466 --> 00:58:17,366
Hold on.

907
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:19,753
Then today is…

908
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,766
Yes, it's Mom's birthday.

909
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,386
Though we still have
vivid memories of Mom,

910
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:35,920
Mi-so was too young then to
remember much about Mom.

911
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,800
It hurts me
when I think about that.

912
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,233
I'm sorry if I hurt you today.

913
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,586
But we could see that
you truly are a good person.

914
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,233
And that you love
Mi-so very much.

915
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,853
But I…

916
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:58,120
I want Mi-so to have
a loving family,

917
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,386
because she lost her
mother so early.

918
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:03,686
That's why I was worried when
I heard she's seeing

919
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:05,533
who is far from average.

920
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,286
I won't make you worry.

921
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:13,020
It's also my wish
as much as yours,

922
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,133
to see Ms. Kim happy.

923
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,020
That woman who abducted us…

924
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,820
You don't even remember
what she was wearing?

925
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,986
Any memories of
how we made it out?

926
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:37,153
Anything?

927
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:40,000
Which one is you?

928
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:02,220
I don't know
what you'll think about this,

929
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,100
but I think this 'Hyeon'
is Mr. Lee.

930
01:00:12,466 --> 01:00:14,733
What are you doing?

931
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:23,186
And what's with that look?

932
01:00:23,266 --> 01:00:25,966
Why? What is it this time?

933
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:30,620
Honey.

934
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,820
I think…

935
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,900
…It's time we be
honest with our kids.

936
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,086
What?

937
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:41,366
I don’t think we can
keep it from them anymore.

938
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,120
Looks like I've managed to
get some points.

939
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,200
It does, yes.

940
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:04,553
This makes me happier than

941
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:07,400
when I was named the
'Top CEO in his 30s.'

942
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,733
But there's just one thing.

943
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:17,320
If I'd known it was
your late mother's birthday,

944
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,653
I wouldn't have followed you here.

945
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:23,533
Because this day should be spent
just with your family.

946
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,753
No.

947
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,320
You coming here,

948
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,353
and doing all that for me
made me really happy.

949
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:33,153
And I'm sure

950
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:35,453
it's the same for my sisters too,
now that they know

951
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:36,700
what a good person you are.

952
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,486
Our family usually spends the
saddest day on

953
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:45,266
Mom's late anniversary, and the
happiest day on her birthday.

954
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:49,186
Everyone in your family are
all good people.

955
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:52,633
I bet it was the same for
your mother, too.

956
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:57,033
You're right.
She was a great person.

957
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:05,020
Shortly after
we came to this beach,

958
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,500
Mom suddenly collapsed,
when she was so healthy.

959
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,966
Dad was tied up to the hospital,
always nursing her.

960
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,966
So I was always alone.

961
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,686
Watching the other kids
play with their moms,

962
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:25,533
I used to get so envious…

963
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:34,400
Then one day…

964
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,933
Play with me!

965
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:45,886
You can cover that now!

966
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:47,400
Mi-so!

967
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,566
Mom!

968
01:02:57,933 --> 01:02:59,720
Mommy!

969
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,320
Let's play chase!

970
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,420
You chase me, Mom.

971
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,153
- Shall I?
- Yeah!

972
01:03:05,233 --> 01:03:07,866
Alright, let's go!

973
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:18,653
I was so happy that
Mom had come back.

974
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:20,366
I'd been so happy.

975
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:25,820
But it turned out…

976
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,653
…That was the day
she chose to come home

977
01:03:28,733 --> 01:03:30,533
after hearing that there was no
more that the doctors could do.

978
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:36,853
It must've been so hard,

979
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:38,433
running around in her health…

980
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:47,520
But if not for that…

981
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,720
I would've forgotten
all about Mom.

982
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,553
I was too young,

983
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:56,400
and I didn't have
many memories with her, so…

984
01:03:59,566 --> 01:04:00,900
I see.

985
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,653
So Mr. Lee,

986
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:07,620
if you also have
a painful past of your own,

987
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,866
I hope I'll be able to
hear it from you someday.

988
01:04:12,733 --> 01:04:15,666
Whenever that day is,
I'll be waiting.

989
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,733
Because from now on,
I'll forever be by your side.

990
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:49,586
You should stay longer,
since you came all the way here.

991
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:52,466
We told you already.
He has a showcase to attend to.

992
01:04:53,466 --> 01:04:55,753
I'll visit you
officially next time.

993
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,086
Enjoy yourselves, then.

994
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,686
Safe driving!

995
01:04:58,766 --> 01:05:01,020
Please take good care of
Mi-so for us.

996
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,066
- I will.
- Bye!

997
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,433
You don't look so well.
What's this about?

998
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:26,400
Don't get so confused,

999
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:33,333
and don't feel so
burdened by guilt.

1000
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,666
But just listen to what I say.

1001
01:05:41,533 --> 01:05:44,800
That day, 24 years ago…

1002
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,900
That day, 24 years ago…

1003
01:06:07,466 --> 01:06:09,100
It wasn't you…

1004
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,433
…Who was kidnapped.

1005
01:06:16,433 --> 01:06:17,700
It was me.

1006
01:06:19,233 --> 01:06:21,820
It has to be.

1007
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,000
I did go through all that.

1008
01:06:29,566 --> 01:06:33,186
Now introducing the
grand revolution in software.

1009
01:06:33,266 --> 01:06:34,853
The AI analysis tool,

1010
01:06:34,933 --> 01:06:37,500
B-DATA!

1011
01:06:51,933 --> 01:06:53,920
What are you eating?

1012
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,253
Sorry, I was a bit hungry.

1013
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:59,353
Are you done with all the photos?

1014
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:01,186
Only just.

1015
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:03,153
It's too crowded in here.

1016
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,253
I just want to go home and rest.

1017
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:07,253
We've just the performances left,

1018
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:08,620
so hang in there for a bit more.

1019
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,186
There's nothing
after this, is there?

1020
01:07:10,266 --> 01:07:11,853
No, I purposely left it blank

1021
01:07:11,933 --> 01:07:14,386
because I knew you'd be tired.
Don’t worry.

1022
01:07:14,466 --> 01:07:16,266
I knew I could count on you!

1023
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,733
Mr. Lee Young-joon!

1024
01:07:22,466 --> 01:07:24,086
Have a rest over there.

1025
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:25,266
Alright.

1026
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,453
Up next is a special performance
for our UK Software Showcase!

1027
01:07:35,533 --> 01:07:39,820
Choi Hyun-woo's magic show!

1028
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,600
Please give him a warm welcome!

1029
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:20,533
How did you…

1030
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,966
They told me
my memories aren't real.

1031
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:32,800
Is that what you think, too?

1032
01:08:41,566 --> 01:08:45,053
You can't even give me
a straight answer to

1033
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:46,633
my question, can you?

1034
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:52,253
Alright, then. Introducing our
special guest for this evening,

1035
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,100
Ms. Kim Na-yeon, who is
also a professional model.

1036
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:19,233
Does that mean
my memories are all wrong?

1037
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:29,653
Sometimes…

1038
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:33,600
I dream about my childhood
which I can't quite understand.

1039
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,686
If…

1040
01:09:36,766 --> 01:09:38,133
If really…

1041
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,486
…Those dreams are…

1042
01:09:40,566 --> 01:09:42,320
Daddy's gone to work!

1043
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,153
What nonsense are
you talking about?

1044
01:09:44,233 --> 01:09:46,833
Auntie's gone weird, oppa.

1045
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,286
No, Mi-so. That's not Auntie.

1046
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,653
That's a spider. A huge spider.

1047
01:09:52,733 --> 01:09:54,620
Oppa, I'm scared.

1048
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,353
Mi-so, stay right there.
Don't come here.

1049
01:09:58,433 --> 01:10:02,553
No, oppa!
Don't leave me here!

1050
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:04,300
Don't come here, dummy!

1051
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,900
I remembered.

1052
01:10:21,866 --> 01:10:23,986
Mi-so! Mi-so!

1053
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:25,820
Mi-so, wake up! Mi-so!

1054
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,000
Kim Mi-so!

1055
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,953
Ms. Kim, can you hear me?

1056
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:34,966
Kim Mi-so!

1057
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:37,666
Kim Mi-so!

1058
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,820
(Many thanks to Lee Min-ki, Jung So-min,)

1059
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,433
(and Charming Choi who guest-starred)

1060
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,900
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

1061
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,766
Do you know who I am?

1062
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,553
What did you say to Mi-so?

1063
01:11:27,633 --> 01:11:29,366
What did you say to her that
she fainted like that?

1064
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,000
You can't hide anything forever
in this world.
