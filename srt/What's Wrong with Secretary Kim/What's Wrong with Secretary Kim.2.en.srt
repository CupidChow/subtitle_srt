1
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,300
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,253
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,400
What?

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,786
You asked your secretary to
marry you?

9
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,686
Yep.

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,186
And what did she say?
Did she say yes?

11
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,486
Well...

12
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:38,233
She was silent for a while...

13
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,900
Then she leaned toward me, and...

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,286
And then? What happened?

15
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:52,053
Then she dove her face
against my neck, and...

16
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,953
Yes, that tickles.

17
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,033
Then she started sniffing me.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,320
Sniff...

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,633
Sniff you?

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,953
'Are you drunk?'

21
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,466
That's what she said.

22
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,066
Secretary Kim said that to
you, Lee Young-joon?

23
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:29,353
My stomach hurts!

24
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,766
Was it something I ate?

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,853
Does that mean she wanted
a proper marriage proposal?

26
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,086
- What?
- But then, I understand.

27
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,020
I must've caught her by surprise.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,833
I mean, she probably knew
she was way out of my league.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,753
Are you serious?

30
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,853
She was probably wondering
whether this was a dream.

31
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,953
Alright, I understand!

32
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:51,566
- Hey, Mr. CEO.
- What?

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,586
Maybe it's not because
she was surprised,

34
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,766
but because she doesn't have the
intention to marry...

35
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,833
But who wouldn't, in this world?

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,066
(Episode 2)

37
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:13,166
He didn't seem drunk...

38
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,186
What?

39
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,600
Marry him?

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,820
Wait, why am I even
thinking about this?

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,253
He probably didn't even
mean it when he said that.

42
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,200
Gosh.

43
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:29,800
Who is it this time?

44
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:33,933
Who is it?

45
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,300
What a day...

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,733
Ugh!

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,453
Where is he? Where?

48
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,900
Come on, where is he?

49
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,266
Hey, where is he?

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,020
I saw Young-joon come here
with my own eyes!

51
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,120
Ms. Oh Ji-ran.

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,720
The Vice President already left
half an hour ago.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,820
Didn't you see him?

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,153
- No!
- What were you doing then?

55
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,700
Ugh, I was updating
my social media.

56
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,853
Just what is...

57
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,286
...Waiting and love?

58
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,766
Here we go! Say cheese!

59
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,620
Who are you?

60
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,020
What are you to him, to make him
come here at this hour?

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,320
And what were you two doing
in a place like this?

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,986
Ms. Oh Ji-ran.

63
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,186
The Vice President and I...

64
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:33,620
We're not what you think you are.

65
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,820
If there's really nothing,
then why won't he...

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,286
Why won't he sleep with you?

67
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,353
When it's already been a month?

68
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,320
What?

69
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,853
'Then who is he sleeping with,
if not me?'

70
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,233
That's what you want to know,
isn't it?

71
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,500
No one.

72
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,186
He sleeps with no one.

73
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,786
He just has a drink, goes home,

74
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,886
and sleeps by himself.

75
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,100
Well, how do you know that?

76
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,033
Ms. Oh Ji-ran.

77
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,233
I'm six years older than you.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,900
So let's use honorifics, alright?

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,600
Alright.

80
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:19,153
So, have you ever met the VP
one-on-one?

81
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,153
No.

82
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,653
Then has he ever
allowed you to touch him?

83
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,286
Well...

84
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,053
Mr. Lee goes to social gatherings

85
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,586
every other Tuesdays and Thursdays
if his schedule allows it.

86
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,866
For networking. In other words,
it's really for business.

87
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,886
You are one of the invitees to
the Tuesday gathering,

88
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:37,686
and there are other girls
who go to the Thursday ones.

89
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:38,986
And one of the girls from
the Thursday club

90
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:41,520
asked me the same thing
as you did just now.

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,786
But Mr. Lee found out,
and he cut her off right away.

92
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,586
Now do you understand?

93
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,200
Oh...

94
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,420
In the past 9 years
I've worked with him,

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,720
Mr. Lee has never dated anyone,
not a single person.

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
Of course there were
many rumors, yes,

97
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,653
but he's never dated or
slept with any one of them.

98
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,553
And I know.

99
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,586
No way!

100
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,333
But how can there be
a man like that?

101
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,320
Don't tell me...

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,253
No. He's not dating me.

103
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,220
- Then...
- No, he's not gay either.

104
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,186
Oh, what?

105
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,666
Mr. Lee is...

106
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:17,586
He's someone who can never
be in a relationship.

107
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,420
Why not?

108
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,486
- Because...
- Because?

109
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,086
Because he's too perfect!

110
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,300
So no one will do for him.

111
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,066
What?

112
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,166
Mr. Lee is...

113
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,353
I'm too good for anyone.

114
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,966
It'd be such a waste to
give myself to someone else!

115
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:41,986
The narcissist of the Century!
Mr. Self-obsessed!

116
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,153
Do you know what the
first thing he said to me

117
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,586
when I first met him?

118
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,833
Well...

119
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,333
For Yumyung Group!

120
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,633
(9 Years Ago)

121
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,266
- Welcome.
- I'll be in your care.

122
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,200
So what is your name?

123
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:07,086
Oh, it's Kim Mi-so.

124
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,186
- Ms. Kim Mi-so.
- Yes?

125
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,766
Do you know who I am?

126
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,300
It was like...

127
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,153
'I'm the President's son.'

128
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,253
That's the aura he emitted.

129
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,220
As if the entire world
ought to know him!

130
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,966
Yes, yes! I know what you mean.

131
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,286
But that's what every girl
finds so sexy about him.

132
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,853
You still haven't
come around to it, have you?

133
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,320
He may be rich and dazzling,

134
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,153
but he doesn't care about
anyone else but himself.

135
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,120
Ms. Oh Ji-ran,

136
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,253
you should find a guy who
genuinely loves you.

137
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,453
I'm so touched.

138
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,766
Thank you so much!

139
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,953
And don't forget,
the most important thing

140
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,520
in this world is yourself!

141
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,766
Alright!

142
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,653
You really think
it was a rejection?

143
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,920
Yeah.

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,986
It might seem unbelievable,
but in my opinion, yes.

145
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,653
No way.

146
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,753
- You're being obsess...
- Obsession?

147
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,353
...Maybe not obsession.

148
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,853
Alright, so Secretary Kim is
smart and competent.

149
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:20,820
Yes.

150
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,520
But let's be honest, you can find
a secretary like her any day.

151
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,353
Besides, her resume
wasn't all that impressive.

152
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:27,653
Education history
and qualifications...

153
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,486
They mean nothing
as long as she's competent.

154
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,733
Anyway, what I know is...

155
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:33,620
...I need Ms. Kim.

156
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,320
Be honest with me now.

157
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,420
You like her, don't you?

158
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,986
- I do.
- No, no!

159
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,486
What I mean is,
not as your employee,

160
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,620
but as a woman.

161
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,620
What are you talking about?

162
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,753
Do you like her not just as your
secretary, but as a woman?

163
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,453
I'm asking not our Vice President,

164
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,933
but you, Lee Young-joon, a man.

165
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,853
I need Secretary Kim.

166
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,233
Yes, so why?

167
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02,600
She's like...

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,533
A tailor-made suit for me.

169
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,620
Because I don't have eyes for
mass-manufactured suits

170
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,153
nor do they fit me perfectly.

171
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,186
Well...

172
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,300
Gotta go.

173
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,553
Ha! He's comparing
people to suits?

174
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,120
Hey, Young-joon!

175
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,666
Work hard!

176
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,086
Thank you so much!

177
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,886
Can I call you later for
advice again?

178
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,266
Take care!

179
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:40,520
So, what about you?

180
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,253
Have you found someone like that?

181
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,966
A man who's considerate!

182
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,920
(To Oppa)

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,953
(Today Dad bought caramel)

184
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:12,986
(I left some for you)

185
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,186
(but Pil-nam and Mal-hee
tried to eat them)

186
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,233
(Still, I managed to
save them for you!)

187
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,153
I want to have
a normal life like other people.

188
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,786
Get married, have kids,
and build a happy home.

189
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,500
Ms. Kim, you're very selfish.

190
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,053
Then what about me?

191
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,366
Sorry?

192
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,486
We've worked together for
nine years!

193
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:44,386
You were my hands and feet from
when I first started until now,

194
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:46,800
so if you're to quit
so suddenly like this, I...

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,566
- I?
- I...

196
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,333
I...

197
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,433
Well, it'll be so
inconvenient for me!

198
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,333
Did I stutter back there?

199
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,133
Well, it's true that
things will get inconvenient.

200
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,253
Ms. Kim Ji-ah!

201
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,720
Ah, Ms. Kim! Good morning!

202
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,653
You're here early.

203
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,153
Well, this is
my first day, after all.

204
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,453
I'm just so excited!

205
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,320
Excited, and a bit nervous.

206
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,833
I'm sure you'll do great.

207
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,366
Thank you.

208
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,986
Thank you. Goodbye.

209
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,586
Say hello, everyone.

210
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,853
This is Ms. Kim Ji-ah,
who'll be replacing me.

211
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,333
Hello! I'll do my very best.

212
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,653
Ji-ah, that's Mr. Jung Chi-in,

213
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,053
Ms. Bong Se-ra, Mr. Park Jun-hwan,

214
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,220
and Ms. Lee Young-ok.

215
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,986
I'll be in your care from now on.

216
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,786
Same with us, Ms. Kim.

217
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:04,266
Hey, Ms. Kim!

218
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,653
So Ms. Kim will be
replacing Ms. Kim!

219
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,353
Wow, what a coincidence!

220
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,920
Or is this destiny? Hmmm?

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,533
With another young blood
joining our team,

222
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,533
suddenly even the
air feels so different.

223
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,053
Ms. Kim?

224
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,386
I'm an elite from the
best school in the country

225
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,553
so you might find me
a little hard to approach.

226
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:29,220
But I'm really the
guy-next-door-type,

227
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,886
so if you ever
run into any trouble,

228
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,453
don't be afraid to
come ask for advice.

229
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,020
Sure, I'll do that.

230
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,020
I might have some trouble at first
so please help me out!

231
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,786
What, you should
solve your own problems.

232
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,920
Why ask us for help?

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,520
This is a place for professionals,
not a varsity club.

234
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,420
- Come on!
- But did I say anything wrong?

235
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,420
A new employee means more work.

236
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,420
And what are you planning to do
with someone so young like that?

237
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,286
I'll really do my best!

238
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:56,186
I'll train her perfectly
before I leave.

239
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,153
So please rest assured.

240
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,500
Why couldn't you just
have me replace you instead?

241
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,433
It's just that... I'm worried.

242
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,800
The Vice President is here.

243
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,433
Good morning.

244
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,753
Is it just me or
is he in a bad mood today?

245
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,233
No. I felt it, too.

246
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:44,353
Is she really going to refuse me?

247
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:45,520
How dare she be so shameless,

248
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,933
and as a human being, too!

249
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,366
Ow, I got aphthous ulcer!

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,866
How dare it makes me
go through such pain.

251
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,753
Ji-ah, these are the records of
Mr. Lee's past schedule.

252
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,586
And these are records of
his overseas trips.

253
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,520
And these are the meeting records.

254
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,186
And these are the records of
his schedule for the next 6 months

255
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,986
so make sure to
memorize them as soon as possible.

256
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,633
All of them?

257
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,533
Plus those.

258
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,786
Oh, and...

259
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,386
This is a list of tea preferences
for each board member,

260
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,500
so memorize them,
and they'll appreciate it.

261
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,420
So I have to
memorize even all these...

262
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,453
Oh, and this is very important.

263
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,020
Cable ties are a big no for
Mr. Lee, so please remember.

264
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,466
I will.

265
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,166
Hmmm?

266
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:56,820
There are even photos
in the daily records.

267
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,600
Oh, we always take photos
whenever there's an event.

268
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:03,386
Huh? When was this?

269
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,920
You both look so young
in this photo.

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,686
Oh, this must've been
about 9 years ago?

271
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,920
It was when I was in the
States with him.

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,866
When I had just started work
like you, Ji-ah.

273
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:17,020
I bet you were perfect at your job
even back then.

274
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,720
No, I'd make
mistakes all the time!

275
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,153
Lies.

276
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,953
I mean it.

277
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,120
But...

278
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,486
I tried my best
not to hold him back,

279
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,020
and found myself
getting better at the job.

280
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,920
So don't be too scared, Ji-ah,

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,553
and give it a try.

282
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,153
Thank you for your advice.

283
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,120
I really will try my best!

284
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,620
Oh, can you bring this to
Mr. Jung?

285
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,933
Sure, just leave it to me.

286
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,200
Can't you even get this right?

287
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,286
Do you know how important
this dinner was?

288
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:08,420
How could you make
a simple mistake like that?

289
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,020
You couldn't even
get the dress code right,

290
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,420
and now things have
turned out like this!

291
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,466
Can't you even speak
basic English?

292
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,586
I'm sorry, sir.

293
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,086
Ms. Kim Mi-so.

294
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,786
What did you say when you
applied for this position?

295
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,186
Didn't you tell me that
you'll try your best,

296
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,886
even though you're behind on
other candidates?

297
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,620
But how many times has it
been now already?

298
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,766
And today's one cost me a lot!

299
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,366
Ms. Kim.

300
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,053
Is this really
the best you can do?

301
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,386
Is it really?

302
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,133
But what more
do you expect from me?

303
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,020
Ever since coming to the States,

304
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,320
I only had 2-3 hours of sleep,
studying English and what not.

305
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,720
I desperately miss
my sisters and my father,

306
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,400
and I really can't
get used to the food here...

307
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,520
Yet, here I am,
trying to do my best

308
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,120
but you just have to
scold me like that every time.

309
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,686
What, were you always perfect?

310
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:00,486
Didn't you ever make
a mistake in your life?

311
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,186
No, I was born perfect!

312
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:03,653
And I never make mistakes.

313
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,886
If you're not happy with my answer
then you get it right!

314
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,886
If you don't want to be scolded,
then try being perfect like me!

315
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,286
You're really full of yourself.

316
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,786
I've never met such
a narcissistic person as you!

317
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,120
Oh, but you'll just have to
put up with it!

318
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,320
You think I'm crazy?

319
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,453
No way. I'm going to quit
and go back to Korea.

320
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,900
So find someone else, you bighead!

321
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,666
"Bighead..."

322
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,120
I must've been out of my mind.

323
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,333
Why did I say I'll quit?

324
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,753
What about the debt and
my sisters' college fees?

325
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,100
Stupid!

326
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,686
I'll give you credit for being
bold enough to talk back at me.

327
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,466
I want you in the office by
5 a.m. tomorrow.

328
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:10,420
Thank you, thank you!

329
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,600
Thank you!

330
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,066
I'm saved!

331
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,586
Let's at least put the
tie on perfectly for him.

332
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,066
At least the tie.

333
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,233
Huh? This isn't how it goes.

334
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,133
No, this isn't it.

335
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm going to tie it perfectly.

336
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,686
Please, spare me this once, sir.

337
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,866
I'll do my best in
whatever you tell me to do.

338
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,486
Who said I was going to kill you?

339
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,233
Just bring me today's schedule.

340
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,020
What are you doing, daydreaming?

341
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,366
Mr. Lee.

342
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,220
Oh, I was just training
your new secretary.

343
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,386
What?

344
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:39,533
Tr...

345
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,220
Training?

346
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,600
Yes.

347
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,320
Would you like a cup of tea?

348
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,900
Forget it.

349
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,386
Mr. Lee?

350
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,720
It's about the dinner with the
President of Daein Group.

351
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,653
He's not feeling well,

352
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,753
so would like to re-schedule it.

353
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,653
Please do so.

354
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,833
Yes, sir.

355
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,520
Then... Mr. Lee?

356
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,286
That's it for your schedule today,

357
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,233
so may I go home early?

358
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,166
What? "Go home early?"

359
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,086
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes.

360
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,753
How's the progress on the
Illusion Hotel Acquisition?

361
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,553
Call Mr. Park right now, and...

362
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,886
I already got the proposal,
and it's right there.

363
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,500
- Oh, so it was.
- Yes, sir.

364
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:37,820
Then what about headhunting
Dr. Bacheslav?

365
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,986
I've scheduled
a meeting for next week.

366
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,320
Then what about renovating
the study?

367
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,486
I already selected some
renovators for you.

368
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:44,753
Then what about my insomnia?

369
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,853
I got your prescription for
sedatives from Dr. Jung.

370
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,686
Alright, alright.
Why do you have to be so verbose?

371
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,853
Just answering your
questions, sir.

372
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,353
See? You keep talking back to me.

373
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,000
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes.

374
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,020
I'm not happy with this.

375
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,153
If you're done, may I go?

376
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,100
- Go.
- Thank you.

377
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,020
What, do I have to
eat lunch with my boss?

378
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,433
Lunch is part of your work.

379
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,586
Oh, so it is part of my work.

380
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,753
So, about the Illusion Hotel
that we're thinking of acquiring.

381
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,920
Their weakness is F&B.

382
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,053
This is the hottest
restaurant these days,

383
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:30,420
and the Chef here is
from Le Cordon Bleu.

384
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,720
The food isn't bad,
and presented neatly.

385
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
- Look into bringing him.
- Sure thing.

386
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,033
Yes, sir.

387
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:42,886
So, what's your opinion?

388
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,620
I also think we should
bring him in.

389
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,920
No, I mean about Secretary Kim.

390
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,086
It really looks like
she's going to quit.

391
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,066
What do I do to stop this
unspeakable situation?

392
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:00,133
Well, I'll help you solve this
unspeakable situation.

393
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,353
But uh... Well.

394
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,353
Can't you sound more desperate?

395
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,620
Like, say...

396
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,266
What will you be willing to
do for me instead, Mr. CEO?

397
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,553
Those eyes!

398
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:18,133
Those eyes from when you
acquired CS 5 years ago...

399
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:22,253
What, is keeping her here on the
same level as an M&A deal?

400
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,366
What?

401
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,066
Pow!

402
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,920
Who'd like it if you just
intrude in like that, huh?

403
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,286
Alright. Look here, Mr. CEO.

404
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,820
How are we approaching this
hotel acquisition again?

405
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,320
We're making adjustments and
pouring in the effort.

406
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,486
- Right?
- Right.

407
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,286
But here you are,
trying to acquire Secretary Kim,

408
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,586
ignoring those steps altogether!

409
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,266
You still don't get what I mean?

410
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,586
- No.
- You don't have a clue as to

411
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,386
what she really wants and desires,

412
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:53,933
and here you are, asking her to
marry her, just like that!

413
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,320
Like she'd say yes right away.

414
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,620
It's called,
taking it one step at a time.

415
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,233
The relationship comes first.

416
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,266
Relationship, huh?

417
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,686
Will you be long with the coffee?

418
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,653
Well...

419
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:23,986
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:26,320
I've actually never done this, so...

421
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,500
What?

422
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:31,766
Then how are you going to
be Mr. Lee's secretary?

423
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,066
Move aside.

424
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,386
You put this here,

425
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:38,886
put the tea cup on here,

426
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,200
and do this, like this!

427
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,853
Wow, look at you!

428
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,386
I respect you, Ms. Bong.

429
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:49,653
Respect me for something trivial
like making coffee?

430
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,420
I really mean it!

431
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,486
I honestly was lost,
wondering what to do,

432
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,153
but you are so amazing.

433
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm not just amazing.

434
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,053
I'm beautiful!

435
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,353
Alright, come here.

436
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:03,553
Watch.

437
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,853
Put the cup here,

438
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,620
and see? So easy!

439
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,720
Wow!

440
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,920
You're like the barista I met
during my Milan trip.

441
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,686
Can I take your picture and
keep it for myself?

442
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:17,086
Awww, I just can't help it.

443
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,900
I look better on my left,
so take this side.

444
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,766
Mmmm, smells so good.

445
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:26,486
Hello?

446
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:29,066
Ah, yes. Yes, sure!

447
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,520
Um, Ms. Kim's calling for me.

448
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,486
Can I ask you to
do the rest for me?

449
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,720
Sure, don't worry. Just trust me.

450
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,186
And hey, take it easy.

451
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:39,600
Thank you!

452
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,786
Hold on.

453
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:52,833
Why am I doing this?

454
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,286
What? A group dinner?

455
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:04,686
Yes, to welcome Ji-ah.

456
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:06,320
We haven't had one for
a long time now.

457
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,320
It's because you were
busy all the time,

458
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,586
with Mr. Lee calling you out
just at any time!

459
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,486
So is tonight really fine?

460
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:15,200
Yes, Mr. Lee's dinner appointment
has been canceled.

461
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:18,120
Hey, perfect timing!

462
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,320
But what should we eat?

463
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,300
How about that place? That place!

464
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:24,453
By "that place..."
You mean the barbecue, right?

465
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,253
That place that ships
fresh meat from Jeju Island,

466
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,653
marinates in sweet sauce for
one day,

467
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,186
and grills it over hot charcoal...

468
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:35,520
Wrap two pieces of meat
in lettuce and perilla leaves,

469
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,700
along with garlic, some sauce,
and pop it into your mouth!

470
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,186
- Kyah!
- Mmmm!

471
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:42,953
So is everyone up for
the barbecue?

472
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,966
- Yes!
- Woo-hoo!

473
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh, you're here, sir.

474
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,833
I'm so excited!

475
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:14,200
For Ms. Kim!

476
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,453
- Let's enjoy!
- Let's enjoy!

477
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,253
Looks delicious!

478
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,400
Thanks.

479
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,653
Why aren't you
eating galbi, Young-ok?

480
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:33,020
You said you were
dying for galbi back then.

481
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,886
Oh, but it only takes a minute for
me to pile on weight...

482
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,786
I'm really fine. Go ahead.

483
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:40,053
Hello, can I get
some more lettuce?

484
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,053
Hey, have some meat.

485
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,533
Cows are herbivores too, you know.

486
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,053
Is this galbi or steak?

487
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,153
Don't cut them so big like this!

488
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:52,486
Now how are you planning on being

489
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,086
Mr. Lee's secretary
if you can't even do this?

490
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,300
Oh, I'm so sorry.

491
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,733
Ugh, just give them to me.

492
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
Look here.

493
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,453
Like this!

494
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,453
Like this!
Just cut them like this.

495
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:08,286
3 cm by 3 cm. Bite-sized pieces!

496
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,866
Is that so hard?

497
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,620
You're really amazing!

498
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,686
I really do respect you, Ms. Bong.

499
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:17,853
Respect me for something trivial
like cutting up meat?

500
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,853
No, I really mean it.

501
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,753
Whenever I see someone who's
great at what I can't do,

502
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,520
I just can't help but
respect them.

503
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,686
Well...

504
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,886
Can I take a picture again?

505
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:29,186
Well, guess I can't help it.

506
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:31,353
You remember, right?
That my left side's my better side.

507
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,466
Yes.

508
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,766
Hello?

509
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:47,086
Wow, good job, Ms. Bong.

510
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,353
You should open up
a barbecue place.

511
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:49,986
- Have some of this.
- Ah, thanks.

512
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,086
- Ms. Bong?
- Yes?

513
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,720
You should have some, too.

514
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,453
At this rate, you won't have any.

515
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:55,533
Oh...

516
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,253
Ugh.

517
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,700
What am I doing?

518
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,500
Ugh!

519
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:08,020
Whoa, you surprised me.

520
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,553
No, you're the one
who surprised me.

521
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,820
I can't believe
you're such a sly fox.

522
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,020
Sorry?

523
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,453
But come on!

524
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,286
Going on about
how you respect me and all,

525
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:20,020
so you can work me!
That's your plan, huh?

526
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,086
No!

527
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,853
I'm going to watch you
closely from now on!

528
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,700
With my doe-eyes!

529
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,953
Hey, thank you!

530
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:32,886
Alright, let's eat!

531
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:33,853
Come on!

532
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:34,920
Everyone, now!

533
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,866
Cheers!

534
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,166
Oops, why did this break?

535
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,420
Uh, hello?

536
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,920
Ugh, please!

537
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,286
Mr. Jung!

538
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:46,966
Are you alright?

539
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,653
Ms. Kim, you have
a hole in your tights.

540
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,400
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

541
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,133
Ugh.

542
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,986
Is this a premonition?

543
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:00,053
I'm not feeling so
good about this.

544
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:02,066
Don't scare me now!

545
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:33,533
Alright, everyone
raise your glasses!

546
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,766
Mr. Lee, how did you...

547
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,166
Good evening.

548
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:45,620
I overheard that you're all
going to be here tonight.

549
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,220
I'm your direct boss,

550
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,153
so how can you
leave me out, right?

551
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,333
Sorry?

552
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,153
Or you want to
keep me standing here?

553
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm sorry, sir. This way, please.

554
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,186
- Please take a seat.
- Please take a seat.

555
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:00,020
Can you make room for
another seat here, please?

556
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,300
- Hurry.
- We need new glasses!

557
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:14,220
Are you into places that are

558
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,086
crowded and with no ventilation?

559
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,286
Are you...

560
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:18,666
...Not comfortable here?

561
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:22,500
No.

562
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:28,333
Let me pour
a glass for everyone here.

563
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,720
How about Macallan, 55 years?

564
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,853
Is whisky fine for everyone?

565
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,420
Whisky? What whisky?

566
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,620
We only got soju and
beer in our place!

567
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,500
Just have some soju bombs, kid.

568
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,020
Since we're on the topic of
alcoholic beverages...

569
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,186
Our department's sales are
not doing so well in that area.

570
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:57,466
What do you think is
the problem here?

571
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:09,553
Well...

572
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:13,000
Mr. Lee? Talking about
work now is a bit...

573
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,420
Then what do you talk about,
if not about work?

574
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,686
Are drinks after work
always this boring?

575
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:21,186
Boring?

576
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,220
You find it boring, sir?

577
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,086
Then how about we play a game?

578
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,653
- A game?
- What about 3, 6, 9?

579
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:29,566
Or the bunny, bunny game?

580
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:38,953
Or how about the Son Byung-ho
game? You know that one, right?

581
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,400
Alright!

582
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,286
Is there a Mr. Son Byung-ho
in our department?

583
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:47,120
Then how about we
praise each other?

584
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,020
That game where we go around,
complimenting each other.

585
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,353
Compliments? Why, I'm tired of
hearing them all the time,

586
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,820
but alright. Let's do that, then.

587
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,220
Then let's start with
our newest recruit!

588
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,933
Yes! Well...

589
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,620
I'd like to compliment Ms. Kim.

590
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,486
I was so nervous today,

591
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:16,633
so thank you for guiding me
through so kindly.

592
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,220
I see.

593
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,753
So you're guiding her through
nicely, are you?

594
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:23,866
Yes.

595
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:35,120
I'd like to compliment you,
Mr. Lee.

596
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,286
You're smart,
and speak 5 languages.

597
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:40,853
- And you're so handsome!
- Thank you.

598
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,720
And you look so great in a suit.

599
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,520
I say wealth is
part of your competence.

600
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,886
I'd like to
compliment you for

601
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:49,966
being the wealthiest
thirty-something in Korea.

602
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,453
Well...

603
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,586
Anything from you, Ms. Kim?

604
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,086
For example,
my generosity and tolerance for

605
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,220
putting up with your incompetence?

606
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,820
Yes, I'd like to
praise myself for

607
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,286
giving it my very best until now,
and for now being ready to

608
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,686
put everything down.

609
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,233
A-ha! Haha!

610
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:23,286
Mr. Lee, you look pretty tired.

611
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,433
I think you should go home now.

612
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:28,853
What, so that's it?

613
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:32,333
I thought it was
always karaoke next!

614
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,120
- Ms. Kim Ji-ah?
- Yes?

615
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,600
Hey, shut your mouth.

616
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:39,066
Karaoke?

617
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:46,266
Well, I'll make time for it.

618
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,700
Sorry?

619
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,500
Alright, let's go!

620
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,100
(Karaoke Bar)

621
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,786
Stop!

622
00:32:55,866 --> 00:33:01,420
Woo-hoo! So refreshing.

623
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,186
Ms. Kim.

624
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,086
Yes, sir.

625
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,120
About this karaoke place...

626
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,420
How entertaining is it anyway for

627
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,886
people to even ignore
such unsanitary conditions?

628
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:11,253
Then why don't you just go home?

629
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,600
I don't like how you're
trying to order me around.

630
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,533
What's up with him today?

631
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,420
I didn't want to look like
I was ordering you around

632
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,053
so I just kept quiet,

633
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,486
but I really don't think
this is the way to go.

634
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:41,353
Ms. Kim.

635
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,533
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

636
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,486
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes, sir.

637
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:48,153
Go book the Valencia in
Cheongdam-dong, now.

638
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,600
Yes, sir.

639
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,720
You look like you're having fun.

640
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,320
Is it perhaps because I'm here?

641
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,033
Yes, well...

642
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,886
Doesn't it suit your taste?
Should I throw it away?

643
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:47,933
What are you talking about?
This is for you. For. You.

644
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:52,133
Oh... Thank you.

645
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,933
Thank you.

646
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,786
Oh, that wasn't water,
but alcohol.

647
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:32,586
That's the whisky we couldn't have
back at the barbecue place.

648
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,133
Doesn't it already smell different?

649
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,933
Yes, this is
a taste I'll remember for life.

650
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:46,066
If you want,
I'll get you some more later.

651
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,366
Uh...

652
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,566
Oh.

653
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,153
Here's our next performer!

654
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:01,020
Our rising star...

655
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,586
R.S.! R.S.!

656
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:03,933
Give her a big hand!

657
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,420
Young-ok!

658
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,633
There she goes again.

659
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,420
Control yourself!
What if you lose it?

660
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,253
Hey, don't worry.

661
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,300
Have you ever seen me
do something stupid, drunk?

662
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:01,566
Move aside!

663
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,253
I'm going to sing from now on.

664
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,353
Mr. Chu!

665
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:13,353
Shake it, shake it, shake it!

666
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:14,400
Mr. Chu!

667
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,620
Hey!

668
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,120
I want to be your secretary too!

669
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,733
Me!

670
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,500
Oh man...

671
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,986
Stop it already.

672
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:37,553
Hey, let go of me!

673
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:41,786
Come on, what does Ms. Kim have,

674
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:44,986
or Ms. Kim Ji-ah have,
that I don't have?

675
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:47,666
What, huh?

676
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,500
Mr. Lee...

677
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,300
Mr. Lee!

678
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,600
Mr. Lee...

679
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:10,853
Drag her away.

680
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:11,933
Yes, sir.

681
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,153
So, about those drinks after work...

682
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:34,233
They're really tiring.

683
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:36,966
Now will you explain yourself?

684
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:41,100
- Explain what?
- On what got into you today.

685
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:54,520
Then see you tomorrow, sir.

686
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,820
Ms. Kim.

687
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,920
Yes, sir?

688
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,366
Wasn't I all sweet today?

689
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:03,986
- Sorry?
- I joined you for the drinks,

690
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,933
and even went out of my way to
bring you home like this.

691
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:11,353
With me, every day from now on

692
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,833
will be a happy one, filled with
romance like today.

693
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,833
I'm sorry, but I don't quite...

694
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,433
I'm saying, I'll go out with you.

695
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:29,400
Why, are you touched?

696
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,433
Uh, Mr. Lee?

697
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:36,033
You're not my type.

698
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,586
What?

699
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,953
You're not my type of guy.

700
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:48,386
My type of guy is someone who's
nice, kind and considerate.

701
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:53,753
Oh. Well...

702
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:57,686
How can you say that after
all I did for you today?

703
00:39:57,766 --> 00:40:00,320
I tried so hard today to
adjust myself to your life!

704
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,120
How is this not being considerate?

705
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,586
That's not the consideration
I wanted.

706
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:08,020
If I don't want it,
that's not considering me at all.

707
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,100
I hope you find someone else
who suits you better.

708
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:32,153
Ha! Relationships and marriages...

709
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,600
How can he just talk about them
like they're nothing?

710
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:40,066
(Vice President)

711
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,900
He's still here.

712
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:03,233
Just what is wrong
with you, Ms. Kim?

713
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,153
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were being serious

714
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,520
when you asked me to marry you.

715
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,353
And now you asking me out...
I don't know what to say.

716
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,653
Forget about what's gone past.

717
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:19,520
What's that about
me not being your type?

718
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,500
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

719
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:25,766
Ha!

720
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:29,686
Mi-so, can you send me
more hearts for that game?

721
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:31,900
I want to take a break
and recharge myself.

722
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,200
(Pil-nam)

723
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,320
What don't you like about me?

724
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,920
It can't be my appearance,
abilities or wealth...

725
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,400
I mean, just what is there
that you can't not like about me?

726
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,753
You're always about yourself.

727
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,686
You never think about others,

728
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:51,753
you just make decisions on
your own, and give orders.

729
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,100
Just like now.

730
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:58,353
After 9 years,
are you protesting that

731
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,966
you've had it hard, because of me?

732
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:05,100
It's not like...

733
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,386
I'll be honest,
yes, it was kind of hard.

734
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:17,686
You're egoistic, selfish,

735
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,520
and an obsessive-compulsive
perfectionist.

736
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,286
Do you know how hard it was
being a secretary for you,

737
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:24,453
who gushes in front of
the mirror, all day?

738
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,086
And you'd call me out
whenever you feel like it,

739
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:28,053
so I never had time for myself,
not even once,

740
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:30,286
because I had to polish apples
for you, who were giving orders!

741
00:42:30,366 --> 00:42:33,133
So of course it was hard,
when I had to do it or 9 years!

742
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,833
You never said you didn't want to.

743
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,653
What?

744
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,886
If you said you didn't want to,
I wouldn't have asked all that.

745
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:54,100
Oh, maybe except for
driving me home.

746
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,833
Ha...

747
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,920
Well, as you said,
what's gone past is the past.

748
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,853
So all I want now is
ordinary romance

749
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:06,020
with an ordinary guy.

750
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,353
You asked me to marry you,

751
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:08,920
but let's be honest.

752
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,020
Romance is impossible for
someone like you.

753
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,833
Unless it's romance with yourself.

754
00:43:17,366 --> 00:43:19,620
Is that what you really think?

755
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,966
Yes. Not only that, you've no
consideration for others!

756
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,920
Mi-so, hearts for
the game, please!

757
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,700
Oh, you and your hearts...

758
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,833
(Send hearts?
Confirm)

759
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:42,733
He's gone.

760
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,153
There are two people in this world
who can't even mention the word

761
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:52,220
"consideration" in front of me.

762
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,820
One's my brother,

763
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,853
and the other one is...

764
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,386
you, Kim Mi-so.

765
00:43:57,466 --> 00:43:58,766
Remember that.

766
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:02,866
What's he on about now?

767
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:13,633
Oh what?
Who did I send the hearts to?

768
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:27,853
How dare she send hearts

769
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:29,733
when we were having
such a serious conversation!

770
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,820
Should I say it was a mistake?

771
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,633
That I'd actually meant to
send it to my sister?

772
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,300
No, no...

773
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,933
Oh, I don't know.

774
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,366
Hey, kid.

775
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,186
(Lee Sung-yeon:
You're probably asleep,)

776
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:39,866
(when I'm going through so much...)

777
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,200
Uh...

778
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,800
Let me...

779
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,133
You want to tie it for me?

780
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:43,786
There are two people in this world
who can't even mention the word

781
00:47:43,866 --> 00:47:46,586
"consideration" in front of me.

782
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,986
One's my brother,

783
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:49,986
and the other one is...

784
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:51,486
you, Kim Mi-so.

785
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:52,653
Remember that.

786
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:54,320
One's his brother,

787
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,700
and the other is me.

788
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:00,733
What does he mean?

789
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,920
The current updates for
each department.

790
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,066
Thank you.

791
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,786
- Uh, Mr. Jung?
- Yes?

792
00:48:10,866 --> 00:48:13,153
You've been here for
some time now, haven't you?

793
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:14,833
Yes, it's been 12 years.

794
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:19,320
Have you ever seen
Mr. Lee's brother, then?

795
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,720
No, I've never seen him,

796
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,933
but I did hear that
he's abroad right now.

797
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:29,153
Do you know if this is
anything to do with his family?

798
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:31,586
Anything you know?

799
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:34,720
How am I supposed to know
if you don't know?

800
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,953
But it's strange, right?

801
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:41,053
That he's the eldest, and he's not
involved in the company at all!

802
00:48:41,133 --> 00:48:42,420
I mean, it's a bit...

803
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,233
Yes. Thank you.

804
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,486
Alright. Thank you.

805
00:48:47,566 --> 00:48:49,466
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

806
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:06,253
Oh my God.
I can't believe I did that!

807
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,886
How am I supposed to
face Mr. Lee now?

808
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:10,720
No, wait.
Does that mean I'm fired?

809
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,320
Should I print your
resignation letter for you?

810
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,286
Ugh!

811
00:49:14,366 --> 00:49:16,886
Oh no...

812
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:18,633
The Vice President is here.

813
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:22,333
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

814
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,533
He looked this way.
What do I do now?

815
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:47,286
I saw you're not
wearing your tie today.

816
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:49,933
Here's a red one for today.

817
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:52,300
Forget it.

818
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,266
You don't have to do this anymore.

819
00:49:56,466 --> 00:49:57,500
Sorry?

820
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,020
You were right.

821
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,120
I'm not sure what you...

822
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,553
I am egoistic, and selfish.

823
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:10,320
I think I finally understand

824
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,866
why you're quitting,
even just a little bit.

825
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:14,420
Uh... Mr. Lee?

826
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,720
I didn't quite mean it
when I told you that...

827
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,086
Now I understand.

828
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:21,120
That simple, obvious
piece of truth.

829
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,666
That I can't have
all that I want to have.

830
00:50:26,233 --> 00:50:28,686
I'll let you go, Ms. Kim.

831
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:31,166
Just please do your best for
another month with the training.

832
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:43,533
Thank you for your work until now.

833
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:45,733
I truly mean it.

834
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,333
That's all. You may leave.

835
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,420
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes.

836
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
- Ms. Kim Ji-ah.
- Yes, sir.

837
00:51:31,033 --> 00:51:33,586
So what's the current issues with
the Brand Development team?

838
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:36,586
Well, uh...

839
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,520
I heard it, but...

840
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,686
I don't quite remember...

841
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:41,020
Let me tell you, sir.

842
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,120
I'm not in a rush,

843
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,833
so Ms. Kim Ji-ah,
summarize it in a report for me.

844
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:13,566
Very relaxing.

845
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,120
The new furniture we launched have
been received very well.

846
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,120
We're currently top in sales
in the industry, too.

847
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,986
- And what comes after this?
- Sorry?

848
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:31,086
It's only obvious that the
current project is a success.

849
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,486
So I'm asking,
what your next steps are.

850
00:52:33,566 --> 00:52:34,320
Well, uh...

851
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,520
It's the younger generation
where we saw success,

852
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,553
so we're planning to launch
new designs for newlyweds.

853
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:42,253
But the younger generation these
days are about practicality,

854
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,266
so we'll fit our designs around...

855
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:49,033
Is that really the current trend?

856
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:52,500
Do you have the data to
support your arguments?

857
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:56,166
Huh? Well, uh...

858
00:52:56,933 --> 00:52:58,686
That's still...

859
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:02,100
But isn't that basic knowledge?

860
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,553
Just how are you training
our new secretary?

861
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:07,000
Sorry?

862
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,386
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Is this what you call training?

863
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:14,133
Don't disappoint me,
and get it right.

864
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,866
I'm sorry.

865
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:39,400
Is he mad because of
what happened yesterday?

866
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:50,120
Did you call for me, sir?

867
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,966
Have Ms. Kim Ji-ah in here.

868
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:55,053
Uh, Mr. Lee?

869
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:57,086
When exchanging texts
yesterday, I...

870
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,820
Let's keep business as business.

871
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,200
Sorry?

872
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:07,533
Oh. Yes, sir.

873
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,486
Ji-ah, he wants to see you.

874
00:54:16,566 --> 00:54:18,266
Alright.

875
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,333
Did he have to do that?

876
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,200
Man... How am I going to
last another month?

877
00:54:51,966 --> 00:54:55,100
Mr. Lee? Why did you...

878
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:57,486
Oh, it's nothing, really.

879
00:54:57,566 --> 00:54:59,586
Just sit over there for 5 minutes,
then you may leave.

880
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:00,000
Sorry?

881
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,400
Oh.

882
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,620
So, uh...

883
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,320
What is it?

884
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,386
I saw that

885
00:55:10,466 --> 00:55:13,053
some private things were
included in the job description.

886
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:14,153
Does that mean I also...

887
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:17,520
What do you mean by
"private things?"

888
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,186
Like tie your tie?

889
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:22,220
Oh. I refuse.

890
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,453
Sorry?

891
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:26,220
Then what should I do from...

892
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,986
Just support Ms. Kim Mi-so
with her work.

893
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:29,686
Sorry?

894
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:34,886
Pretend you're on training for
just one month, like now.

895
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:36,466
Pre... "Pretend?"

896
00:55:42,033 --> 00:55:44,620
Here you are. Take the ones
with your name on it.

897
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,520
So you're really getting married!

898
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,920
So where's your wedding?

899
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,286
Whoa, this is a fancy place!

900
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:52,820
So, Mi-so!
When are you getting married?

901
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,786
Marriage?

902
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:56,386
Hey, she's been single
all her life!

903
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:57,486
Oh right.

904
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:59,720
You should start with
dating first.

905
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,100
No need to mention that.
I'm going to get a boyfriend.

906
00:56:02,266 --> 00:56:03,420
Really?

907
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,653
Then do you want to
go on a blind date?

908
00:56:04,733 --> 00:56:05,753
Jae-young's friend

909
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,653
saw your photo on my social media,

910
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:09,253
and he's been begging me to
introduce him to you.

911
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,920
- Great news!
- Lucky girl!

912
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,520
He's considerate, which is
what you're looking for,

913
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,853
and he's also handsome and
his family's not bad, either!

914
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:18,100
Huh?

915
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:29,053
So what does he do?

916
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:32,320
- A journalist!
- Hey, not bad!

917
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,920
A journalist?

918
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,833
Then can he look up some
cases in the past?

919
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:39,620
Excuse me.

920
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,986
We're holding surveys for
our customers here today.

921
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,353
Would you have some time?

922
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:47,186
There's one free side-dish for
every participant.

923
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:48,920
Oh, really? Then please.

924
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,033
Thank you.

925
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,433
Hey, Eun-jung.
Shouldn't you tick "married?"

926
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,466
(Customer Survey/Kim Mi-so)

927
00:57:01,466 --> 00:57:03,553
1. Write down the place
you'd like to go to

928
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:05,086
with the opposite sex
you're interested in.

929
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:07,153
2. Write down the things
you want to do

930
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:08,553
with the opposite sex
you're interested in.

931
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,586
3. Write down the gifts
you'd like to receive

932
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:13,433
from the opposite sex
you're interested in.

933
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,733
What's with this familiar
authoritative language?

934
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:26,100
(Customer Survey/Kim Mi-so)

935
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:32,086
You want me to find
Ms. Kim's survey from here?

936
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:34,420
Why can't you just
ask her directly,

937
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,000
instead of scheming with the
restaurant for this survey?

938
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:40,386
Uh, Mr. CEO?

939
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:41,820
I'm a president, you know!

940
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,920
Don't you think you're
wasting talent here?

941
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,733
Just think of this
as overtime work.

942
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,186
Overtime work?

943
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,200
You mean just
prolonged frustration!

944
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:57,920
Alright, I'll find it for you.
Since it's serious business.

945
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,920
It's not Jo Yi-ra,

946
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,353
nor is she Kim Min-sook,

947
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:03,020
Kim Young-mi,

948
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,920
Kim Mi-so...

949
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,200
Found it!

950
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:12,333
- Alright, she...
- What did she write?

951
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:14,753
How childish.

952
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,933
Why did you even
ask her this anyway?

953
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,066
Don't tell me,
you'll do exactly this?

954
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,866
What, me?

955
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:36,553
Just how are you training
our new secretary?

956
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,386
- Sorry?
- Is this what you call training?

957
00:58:38,466 --> 00:58:40,086
Don't disappoint me,
and get it right.

958
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:43,386
When exchanging texts
yesterday, I...

959
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:45,700
Let's keep business as business.

960
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:41,020
Let's clean this place up.

961
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,300
All up!

962
00:59:53,233 --> 00:59:54,433
Anything more to do?

963
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:09,286
Well, since I have
a lot of free time now,

964
01:00:09,366 --> 01:00:10,666
let's find Oppa.

965
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,086
Yes, Mr. Park.

966
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,433
Tomorrow?

967
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:30,020
Yes, Mr. Park. I'm on my way.

968
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,400
Yes, sir.

969
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,833
Where is he?

970
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:59,253
Is Mr. Park becoming like Mr. Lee?

971
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:02,033
Why's he calling me out
on the weekend now?

972
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,820
And why is it so dark?

973
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,433
There's no one around, either.

974
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:24,720
Ms. Kim.

975
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,066
Did you wait long?

976
01:02:27,566 --> 01:02:28,566
Huh?

977
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:06,000
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

978
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,120
I just took you out on
a blockbuster date.

979
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,120
So...

980
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,353
You're going on a blind date?

981
01:03:13,433 --> 01:03:14,866
We'll keep it a secret!

982
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:19,900
Argh! You scared me, Ms. Kim.

983
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:22,420
You're really beautiful.

984
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,186
If you're so worried,
just call her now already!

985
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:25,366
No.

986
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,620
Who the hell is that?

987
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,620
Whoa, hot!

988
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,620
Blinded by jealousy...

989
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,000
Ms. Kim!
