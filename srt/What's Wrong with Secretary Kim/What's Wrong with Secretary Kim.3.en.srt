00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:05,733
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,500
(AURA)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,666
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,320
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,733
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:26,033
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,066
Where is he?

8
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,020
Is Mr. Park becoming like Mr. Lee?

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,366
Why's he calling me out
on the weekend now?

10
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,586
And why is it so dark?

11
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,966
There's no one around, either.

12
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:02,986
Ms. Kim.

13
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,133
Did you wait long?

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,086
Why are you here, Mr. Lee?

15
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,153
I'm here because
Mr. Park called me, but...

16
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,486
Mr. Park won't be coming.

17
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:10,753
It was me who
asked him to call you out.

18
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,033
Sorry?

19
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,686
But why...

20
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,920
You could've
just told me directly.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,833
But that would've
made you uncomfortable.

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,553
First, just come with me.

23
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,766
Oh, but this place is
already closed for the day.

24
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,900
Closed?

25
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,086
Why is that a problem?

26
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,600
When you have
the free pass right here.

27
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,433
Oh no, oh no!

28
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,500
Ah!

29
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,400
Mr. Lee.

30
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,620
I really... I...

31
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,920
- This is...
- Don't decline, now.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,786
Just enjoy yourself.

33
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,220
But still, this is a bit...

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,420
This is a bit too...

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,686
Mr. Lee?

36
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:20,166
I... I didn't mean...

37
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,833
Mr. Lee!

38
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:24,933
Enjoying yourself?

39
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,333
Yay!

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,133
Yay!

41
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,366
Ms. Kim, you sure know
how to have fun.

42
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,220
I'm sorry!

43
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,253
Help!

44
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,253
Ms. Kim, this time
let's go on the Hurricane

45
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,066
that rotates 360 degrees
at 17m above the ground...

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,300
What is it, Ms. Kim?

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,166
I'm too scared.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,186
Then why did you get on that,
when you were scared?

49
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,053
You said let's get on.

50
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,166
I thought you'd like it.

51
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,533
Ha...

52
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,900
(Episode 3)

53
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,700
Are you alright?

54
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,866
Yes, well...

55
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,533
But are you alright, sir?

56
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,220
No way.

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,020
You went on it twice,
and you're still not scared?

58
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,266
Of course not.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,286
You see, fear is

60
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:39,553
something that
these lame rides can't evoke.

61
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:42,266
Then what are you scared of?

62
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:45,633
Well...

63
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,766
No need for you to know that.
Let's go.

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,353
For a ride on the Hurricane?

65
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,386
No.

66
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,100
This time, on what you want.

67
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,066
Mr. Lee!

68
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:24,620
Giddyap!

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,766
Giddyap!

70
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,053
Mr. Lee!

71
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,253
Join me!

72
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,900
It's not scary, come on!

73
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,766
This is nice.

74
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,153
You're really not going to?

75
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,320
But it's really fun!

76
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,353
It's alright.

77
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:23,953
I enjoyed myself watching you
ride it seven times,

78
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,820
and that's quite enough for me.

79
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,820
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
You did say to go ahead,
and I guess I lost myself.

81
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,153
Was it that fun?

82
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:36,653
Yes! I've always wanted to go
on the Merry-Go-Round.

83
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,553
I came here with my family
when I was little.

84
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,186
Back then, I wanted to
go on this so badly

85
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,966
but at that time,
I could only stand and watch.

86
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,353
Why?

87
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,786
Because it's too expensive to get
free passes for all three kids!

88
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:51,186
And besides, even if
I did get a free pass,

89
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,653
I was too little
and a scaredy-cat too,

90
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,666
so I wouldn't have gone on
that many rides, anyway.

91
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,933
Still, my long wish has
been granted today.

92
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,400
Glad to hear that.

93
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,533
I'm alright.

94
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,653
I think the steak's
a little tough.

95
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,086
Should I call the chef?

96
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,666
No, just enjoy your dinner.

97
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,086
You'll find it hard
to cut that steak.

98
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,666
Thank you.

99
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,020
If I knew we would be coming here,

100
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,320
I would've dressed properly.

101
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,933
It's alright.
Besides, there's no one else here.

102
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,886
You're right,
it's really just us two.

103
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,386
I rented out the place.

104
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:52,733
What?

105
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,666
Mr. Lee, what's going on today?

106
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:01,520
Nothing much, really.

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,253
Just realized I never
properly thanked you

108
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,433
after all your long service.

109
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,720
It's a gift from me to
thank you for all these years.

110
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,166
Gift?

111
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,500
Or is it still not enough,
after seven rides?

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,833
I think it was about where the
Merry-Go-Round is...

113
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,420
This used to be a residential area
that got redeveloped.

114
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,553
And I used to live there.

115
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:48,166
I think the Merry-Go-Round is
where my home was.

116
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,986
Who knows?

117
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:56,486
It could be the Haunted House,
or the public toilet now.

118
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,220
You're really mean!

119
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,033
Just kidding.

120
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,553
Anyway, it kind of felt unreal,
hearing that your home would

121
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,553
become a theme park.

122
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,186
I was 5 years old then,

123
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:14,753
so that means you were
around about nine?

124
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,020
Guess so.

125
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,320
I wonder what you were
up to back then.

126
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
Even back then,

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,300
I was a genius who excelled at
everything, like I am now.

128
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,533
Oh, sure.

129
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,320
But...

130
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,620
It wasn't all that fun.

131
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,900
When I was in 4th grade, I mean.

132
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,320
How rare of you to get it wrong.

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,133
Mr. Lee, at nine years old,
you're in Grade 2.

134
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,453
Like I'd ever be wrong.

135
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:52,753
I was in Grade 4.

136
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,066
I was too smart, so
they moved me up two years.

137
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:05,053
But why wasn't it fun for you,
when you were so smart?

138
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,920
Because I was in the
same class as my brother.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,653
The grown-ups probably thought
that was being considerate,

140
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,886
but it made things worse.

141
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:14,653
Why?

142
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,453
I quarreled a lot
with my brother's friends.

143
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,486
They'd pick on me,
saying I was an arrogant brat.

144
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:24,200
But at least you were with
your brother, thank goodness!

145
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,253
No.

146
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,520
He was worse.

147
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,466
A total jerk, he was.

148
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,186
Ah, it's late.

149
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,720
Oh, let me take you back.

150
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,986
No, we have somewhere else to go.

151
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:42,353
So go on and finish your dinner.

152
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,766
Sorry?

153
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:01,386
It's...

154
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:02,253
Really chilly.

155
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,933
Yes. It is chilly.

156
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,700
Ah.

157
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,033
It's alright,
pink's not to my taste.

158
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,100
Oh. I took this out for myself.

159
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,853
Um...

160
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,086
Mr. Lee?

161
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,753
At times like this, it's the men
who care for the women.

162
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,566
Like by taking off
their jackets for them.

163
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,633
Isn't that being sexist,
when we're equally cold?

164
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:36,766
Guess you're right.

165
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,766
Brrr, it's cold.

166
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,400
Hey... wow!

167
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,600
Wow!

168
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,586
Wow!

169
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,920
There must be some kind of
an event going on tonight.

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,220
No.

171
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,886
I prepared all this.

172
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,800
- Sorry?
- I told you. It's a gift from me.

173
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,720
This is so nice.

174
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
Don't you think it's pretty?

175
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,886
Yes.

176
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,233
Very pretty.

177
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:55,786
I'm fine.

178
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,066
Didn't you just say it's the men
who take off their jackets?

179
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

180
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,033
I guess you were cold
because of me tonight.

181
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,353
No, not at all.

182
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:53,453
I'm tired of that jacket.

183
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,500
Throw it away,
or use it to cover yourself up.

184
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,200
Alright.

185
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:03,866
Anyway, thank you for tonight.

186
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,086
I really had a great time.

187
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:12,353
Thanks to you, all my wishes
came true this evening.

188
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,166
- Of course.
- Sorry?

189
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:25,820
Number 1. Write down the place
you'd like to go to

190
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,666
(Number 1. Write down the place
you'd like to go to)

191
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,786
A theme park?

192
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,000
Closed?

193
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,853
Why is that a problem?

194
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:33,166
When you have
the free pass right here.

195
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:45,186
Number 2. Write down the things
you want to do

196
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,933
(Number 2. Write down the things
you want to do)

197
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,433
Fireworks!

198
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,153
There must be some kind of
an event going on tonight.

199
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,586
No.

200
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,353
I prepared all this.

201
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,866
The theme park,
and the fireworks... No way.

202
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,220
Thank you for taking me home.

203
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,600
But uh... Mr. Lee?

204
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,220
- Could it be that...
- Hold on.

205
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,600
I have something for you.

206
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,953
Number 3. Write down the gifts
you'd like to receive

207
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,500
(Number 3. Write down the gifts
you'd like to receive)

208
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,500
A huge stuffed toy!

209
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,700
Don't tell me...

210
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,500
Is there a big
stuffed toy in there?

211
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,553
You're right.

212
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:45,086
There is.

213
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:49,500
It's a gift from me to you, for
working you like a cow.

214
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,866
The name's 'Thank-cow.'

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,686
I did think that was
a strange customer survey.

216
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:00,266
I wanted to give you
something you wanted.

217
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:02,986
Thank you.

218
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:05,086
For going this far, just for me.

219
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,320
Don't mention it.

220
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,620
This is only the basics,
when it's all for you.

221
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,220
You know that
you're completely mistaken

222
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,620
if you thought I'd say,
'I'll work for you forever,'

223
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,133
with just this, right?

224
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,220
I knew you were a tough opponent.

225
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,566
Then I'll really get going.

226
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,366
Wait.

227
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,186
There's still one more.

228
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,453
From your list.

229
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,800
Sorry?

230
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,353
Number 3. Write down the gifts
you'd like to receive

231
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,886
A huge stuffed toy! And...

232
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:45,433
...A romantic kiss
in front of the gate.

233
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,566
Good night!

234
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,486
You know that
you're completely mistaken

235
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,820
if you thought I'd say,
'I'll work for you forever,'

236
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,166
with just this, right?

237
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:33,800
I knew you were a tough opponent.

238
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,386
Tough opponent? Ha!

239
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:40,286
The Blockbuster's Curse has
already begun, you know.

240
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:41,966
Though you might've
not realized it yet.

241
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,233
(Eun-jung)

242
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,020
Mi-so.

243
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:03,986
(Mi-so.)

244
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,386
(You remember you have
a blind date tomorrow, right?)

245
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,253
You remember you have
a blind date tomorrow, right?

246
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,933
With that journalist!

247
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:07,900
(With that journalist!)

248
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,066
Oh, that's right.

249
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,020
Didn't you say you have
something to ask him, too?

250
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,220
(Didn't you say you have
something to ask him, too?)

251
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,633
Anyway, wish you luck!

252
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,766
(Anyway, wish you luck!)

253
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,253
Giddyap! Giddyap!

254
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,700
Superman!

255
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,020
Oppa, you get on this time.

256
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,953
I'll push you,
just because it's you.

257
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:57,020
Thanks.

258
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,553
But it's too bad...

259
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,220
I have to get going now.

260
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,453
Already?

261
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,053
Can't you just stay here?

262
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:07,020
Sorry. But I'll come to
see you again, Mi-so.

263
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,786
Really?

264
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:11,420
- You'll really come to see me?
- Yes.

265
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,186
I won't ever forget
your name, then!

266
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:16,853
Your name was... Lee...

267
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,053
Dummy, there you go again.

268
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:22,000
That's not what my name is.
My name is Lee...

269
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,666
Lee... Lee...

270
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,600
Ah, I don't remember.

271
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,100
Whoa, I'm late!

272
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,933
Thank-cow, watch the place
while I'm gone.

273
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,266
Oh what?

274
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:05,733
Mr. Lee.

275
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,420
There's something I want to ask.

276
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,953
I found this on the
stuffed toy you gave me.

277
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:14,886
I'm sure you did,
because I put it in there.

278
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,320
Is it for me?

279
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,053
Then would it be for Thank-cow?

280
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,600
I guess.

281
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:25,420
But I never wrote about
a necklace in the survey...

282
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,933
I'm someone who
exceeds expectations.

283
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,053
Why?

284
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,853
You think I'm dazzling,
and can't get enough of me?

285
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:37,520
Your tie's crooked.

286
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,866
Oh, I see.

287
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:05,653
Then I'll get going.

288
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:07,166
- Ms. Kim?
- Yes?

289
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,053
Hey, Eun-jung.

290
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:34,386
Hey, why did you ignore my text?

291
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:35,753
Didn't you see my message
last night?

292
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,220
Oh, that's right.

293
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,486
Don't tell me that you forgot
about the blind date, too!

294
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:40,820
No, it's not like that.

295
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,286
Anyway, good luck.

296
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:45,120
If you two get married,
buy me a purse.

297
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,253
Hey, it's just a blind date,
you're taking it too far.

298
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,000
Anyway, alright. Okay, take care.

299
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,933
Ms. Kim, you're going on
a blind date?

300
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,920
You must be so nervous
and excited!

301
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,553
Uh... Ji-ah?

302
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,786
I'm kind of
embarrassed about this.

303
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:07,600
Can you keep this a secret?

304
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,786
- Sure.
- Thanks.

305
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,420
It's a secret!

306
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,266
Of course! We'll keep it a secret!

307
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,720
My goodness. you were too busy to
even dream about a blind date!

308
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,720
Ms. Kim, this is your
first blind date, isn't it?

309
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,053
What? It's your first!

310
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:29,186
No way!

311
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:32,420
Take this chance to bid goodbye
to being single all your life!

312
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,733
Single all your life?
Unbelievable!

313
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,253
Enough already.

314
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,353
Alright!

315
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:43,486
Oh, but first blind dates can
feel really awkward.

316
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,920
Why don't you ask your date to
invite a friend?

317
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
And I'll come with you.
So it'll be a double...

318
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,200
I guess she's not
really up for a double date.

319
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:55,620
- You think that's funny?
- No.

320
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,533
Wait for me, Ms. Kim!

321
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,653
Ah... I want to go on
a blind date, too.

322
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,020
Hello!

323
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,120
I'm Bong Se-ra.

324
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,633
I really want to say that.

325
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:14,453
Hey,

326
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,720
did you write the speech draft for

327
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,353
Mr. Lee at tomorrow's Sports Day?

328
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:19,420
Of course!

329
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,420
Mr. Jung, I got a great score on
my essay when I got into SNU.

330
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,120
So I prepared a perfect speech,
based on that experience.

331
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,586
A perfect speech, huh?

332
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,720
Well, whether it's perfect or trash,
that's up to me to judge.

333
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,253
Print it and bring it to me,
right this minute!

334
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,220
Yes, sir!

335
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,186
And you.

336
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:37,453
Did you prepare those gifts for
all our employees tomorrow?

337
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,420
Of course!

338
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,386
They'll be delivered to the
gym by 10 a.m. tomorrow.

339
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,653
Okay! Good work!

340
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:46,220
Now, Mr. Lee is all about

341
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,086
getting close with his employees

342
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,586
but there's not many chances to,
except for Sports Day.

343
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,953
So everyone, let's prepare for
a perfect day tomorrow!

344
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:55,853
Yes, sir!

345
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:57,233
- Now move it!
- Yes, sir!

346
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,086
What about Ms. Kim?

347
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,020
Oh...

348
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,820
Should I join you?

349
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,253
Then let me get my tea, too!

350
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,786
No, that's not what I meant.

351
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:16,953
Where is Ms. Kim Mi-so,

352
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,520
and why are you here,
Ms. Kim Ji-ah, instead of her?

353
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,420
I'm asking about her whereabouts.

354
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,953
Oh...

355
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:25,600
Ms. Kim said this is my work now.

356
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,533
Oh, did she now?

357
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,953
I know I have
a lot of catching up to do.

358
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,986
So I'm going to
work very hard from now on,

359
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:44,186
looking up to Ms. Kim Mi-so
as my role-model.

360
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,286
I mean, when I heard that
Ms. Kim is

361
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:48,353
finally going on her first
blind date because of work,

362
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,153
I really reflected on myself.

363
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,666
Yes, well...

364
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:56,700
Did you just say, "blind date?"

365
00:27:58,866 --> 00:27:59,933
No?

366
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,420
Alright, so the meeting with the
Illusion Hotel board has been set,

367
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,320
and the Yumyung Art Hall is
all set to open.

368
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,566
While...

369
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,366
...Ms. Kim is going on a blind date.

370
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:17,453
How dare she go on a blind date
with that necklace I got for her

371
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:18,833
around her neck?

372
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,420
Yes, well... Even if she did...

373
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,720
A couple will be born!

374
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,766
What?

375
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,986
But come on, isn't it obvious?

376
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:33,853
Her date is likely to be
some average guy.

377
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,353
But wasn't that what she's after?

378
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:38,066
To date and marry an average guy.

379
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:40,586
No way.

380
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,920
See, Ms. Kim is
already under a curse.

381
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,466
The "Blockbuster Curse."

382
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,866
You keep going on
about this curse...

383
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,200
What is this curse, anyway?

384
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,453
Ms. Kim Mi-so?

385
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:06,486
Yes?

386
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:09,220
I recognized you right away from
your photo on social media.

387
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,766
I'm Park Byung-eun,
your date for today.

388
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:14,020
Oh, I see. Nice to meet you.

389
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,986
You must be hungry.

390
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,253
I did some research
around this place,

391
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,420
so let's go.

392
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,300
- This way.
- Sure.

393
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,986
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

394
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:32,186
This place is really popular and
doesn't take reservations.

395
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:33,953
It's okay. We can wait.

396
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:38,653
Then why don't we save
some time by looking at the menu?

397
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,520
- Sure.
- I'll bring the menu.

398
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,466
Sorry to keep you lonely,
but please wait.

399
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,386
This place is
supposed to be real good.

400
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:58,186
24 layers of meat,
stacked together and deep-fried

401
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:00,153
and served in the
authentic Japanese cutlet-style.

402
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,653
This place is really trending.

403
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,200
Ah, I see.

404
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,033
Hold on.

405
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,033
Here, why don't you take this one?

406
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,266
Thank you.

407
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,066
You'll find it hard
to cut that steak.

408
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,286
I might put you off for
saying this on our first meeting

409
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:28,586
but you really are
beautiful, Mi-so.

410
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:29,620
You're...

411
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,520
- Ah, hot!
- ...Very hot!

412
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,133
- Sorry?
- Uh...

413
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,153
Oh, I'm sorry.

414
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,153
I meant you're very elegant.

415
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,320
Oh... Thank you.

416
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,733
Sure...

417
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,253
Welcome!

418
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,420
Can you clear table 2?

419
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,620
Mi-so.

420
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,886
It's a bit noisy in here,
isn't it?

421
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,733
Yes, it kind of is.

422
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,053
Oh my!

423
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,220
I'm so sorry.

424
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,220
It's alright.

425
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,753
- You should watch out.
- Hey!

426
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,153
Aren't you a troublemaker?

427
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:03,320
Sorry about that.

428
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,933
Just hurry along!

429
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,386
Sorry, I was too loud there.

430
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,153
But she was really
getting on my nerves.

431
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:10,633
Yes, it's alright.

432
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,920
You're right,
it's really just us two.

433
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
I rented out the place.

434
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:27,820
That's...

435
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,953
- ...My cutlet.
- Sorry?

436
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,586
The part I love the most.
Deep-fried crispy on the outside,

437
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,733
but tender and juicy
on the inside...!

438
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:38,786
I think you took the wrong one.

439
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:40,320
Oops, sorry.

440
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,686
Here, I'll return it.

441
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,000
Please.

442
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,086
Thank you.

443
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:48,020
- Would you like mine, too?
- No, I have plenty, thanks.

444
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,200
What? He's making me feel awkward.

445
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,120
Why are you here, Mr. Lee?

446
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,286
I'm here because
Mr. Park called me, but...

447
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,233
But that would've
made you uncomfortable.

448
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,420
What's wrong with me?

449
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,166
Why do I keep
thinking about Mr. Lee?

450
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,433
What the "Blockbuster Curse" is...

451
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,320
Let's say you watched
a high-budget, well-made

452
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,053
blockbuster action movie.

453
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,453
Straight after that,

454
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:37,986
You go see a flimsy,
low-budget B-grade movie.

455
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,686
So, would that second film
meet your standards now?

456
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:43,686
It could feel quite boring.

457
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:46,120
Exactly! I just took Ms. Kim on
a blockbuster date

458
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,986
by renting out a theme park,
a restaurant, and a cruise ferry!

459
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:54,820
So do you think she'll be
able to date an average guy now?

460
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,953
Yep.

461
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:57,786
I mean, isn't that
why she went on a blind date?

462
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:58,953
What?

463
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:01,266
Besides, I'm into those dull,
low-budget films.

464
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:04,533
Let's go!

465
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,466
Tell me if you're going to start.

466
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,886
The coffee's really
good here, right?

467
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:29,253
I clicked away so many times to
find this place, you know.

468
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,566
The aroma's really fragrant.

469
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:35,733
I wonder what's good around here...

470
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,453
Hey, it's Ms. Kim!

471
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:41,686
Someone you know?

472
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:44,920
Yes. She's our
vice president's secretary.

473
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,666
Oh, really?

474
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:49,620
- Uh, Mi-so?
- Yes?

475
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,620
I think there's
something around your ear.

476
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,186
Here?

477
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,153
- No, under the ear lobe.
- Here?

478
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,120
- On the earrings?
- Here....

479
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,053
Just turn 45 degrees, and...

480
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:58,020
No, up a bit more.

481
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,486
- Here?
- Is it the cutlet?

482
00:33:59,566 --> 00:33:59,953
What is it?

483
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,466
- Is there a mirror...
- No need.

484
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,520
Excuse me for a second.

485
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,720
Whoa!

486
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,286
She must be on a date!

487
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:08,833
She's so pretty.

488
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,266
Okay!

489
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,253
I should tell the people
in my department about this.

490
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,253
There you go,
there was "beauty" on you.

491
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,353
Ah, it's really alright.

492
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,933
Thank you.

493
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:22,666
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:27,920
I wonder if Ms. Kim is
still on her blind date, huh?

495
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,986
Be honest with me now.

496
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,786
You can't stop
thinking about it, huh?

497
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,320
No, not at all.

498
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm telling you, she's under the
Blockbuster Curse.

499
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:37,900
Ha...

500
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,833
Oh what? What did my
secretary send me now?

501
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,786
Hey... Take a look at this!

502
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:48,166
What is it now?

503
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,466
Hey, looks like her
blind date is going real well!

504
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,853
Breaking news!

505
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,986
I'm here at the Cafe Street
on Garosu-gil with a friend,

506
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:00,520
and spotted Secretary Kim
on a date with her boyfriend!

507
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,000
They wouldn't take their
eyes off each other!

508
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,753
I'm sorry, Mr. Park!

509
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,086
I meant this for someone else,
I made a mistake.

510
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,053
Ugh, that secretary of mine...

511
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,586
Last time, she sent me
pictures of her having a barbecue!

512
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:16,066
When will she get it right, huh?

513
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,353
Anyway, if they're already
like this on their first date,

514
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:22,520
wouldn't this be like
a 100% success?

515
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,420
I wonder if you've
ever had this feeling.

516
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,086
Of your heart beating like crazy,

517
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,366
when you've just met
the one for you!

518
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:33,986
But of course.
I guess all you know is

519
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,533
'This is the project for me!'

520
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,886
If you're still anxious,
why not just call her?

521
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:41,453
Tell her to cut her date short
and come here.

522
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,186
What?

523
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,633
Anxious?

524
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,653
You've been working on
your humor, haven't you?

525
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,353
How about a career switch?

526
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:55,386
- To a comedian.
- Huh?

527
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:58,300
I'll welcome your
resignation any time.

528
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,800
Mr. Lee! I guess I have
finally found my talent, after all.

529
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,766
Why can't I get
Mr. Lee out of my mind?

530
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:20,653
Whatever, let's just concentrate on
the blind date.

531
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,386
How do you find your work?

532
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:23,986
You said you were
a journalist, right?

533
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:27,053
Yes. I'm pretty known for
my speedy, accurate coverage.

534
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,886
Do you remember that
politician's drug scandal

535
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:32,153
- a few months back?
- Yes.

536
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,420
I was the one who got the scoop!

537
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,053
Oh, I see.

538
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:39,486
There isn't a thing in this world

539
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:40,700
that I can't find out.

540
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:46,386
Then... Is it possible to
look into past cases?

541
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:49,620
It's an abduction case that
happened around 1994.

542
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,653
An abduction?

543
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:53,786
Oh no, it's not me.
This happened to a friend.

544
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:55,953
But no one made
a big deal out of it,

545
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,086
so I couldn't find anything out
on my own.

546
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:02,820
It happened at the redevelopment
area where Yumyung Land is now.

547
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,100
The time was... Around late fall?

548
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,766
Because I was born in early 1990...

549
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:12,953
Oh, just kidding.

550
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:14,220
Oh, I'm sure.

551
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,353
That's quite some time back, so...

552
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,133
- It'll be hard, right?
- It's possible!

553
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,920
This is a request from you,

554
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,386
so I'll do my best to
look into it, Mi-so.

555
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,786
- Will you?
- Yes.

556
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:27,753
- Thank you so much!
- It's nothing.

557
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,286
Alright, let's do a toast.

558
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:31,633
- Then please.
- Sure!

559
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,986
- Ugh, it's hot!
- Watch yourself.

560
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:35,400
I'm alright.

561
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,720
Uh...

562
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,886
I'm not sure
if you enjoyed it today,

563
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:45,786
but I'd like to see you again.

564
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,166
Sorry?

565
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,466
Hey...

566
00:37:58,666 --> 00:37:59,553
Oops!

567
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,720
Sorry, this is from my job.

568
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,133
Ms. Kim!

569
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:10,666
Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry.

570
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,733
Mr. Lee, why are you...

571
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,486
I'm disappointed in you, Ms. Kim.

572
00:38:25,566 --> 00:38:27,353
That unfaithful attitude of yours...

573
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:29,620
I'm truly disappointed!

574
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,686
I'm sorry, sir.

575
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,453
If you felt that way,
I guess it was my doing.

576
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:37,700
But may I ask what this is about?

577
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,800
Did I miss any details?

578
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:48,086
Or was there a delay in
preparing for Sports Day...

579
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,700
No?

580
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,620
Or could it be...

581
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,653
...Because I went on a blind...

582
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,066
No way!

583
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:02,953
Whether you go on
a blind date or not,

584
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:04,286
how is that my concern?

585
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:06,353
That's not what I meant.

586
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,586
I just thought you were mad for

587
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,686
seeing me spend
so much time on my private life

588
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,853
when the big Sports Day is
coming up tomorrow...

589
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,500
So you know!

590
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,386
You know how much
I care about Sports Day!

591
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,820
So how can you go on
a blind date the day before?

592
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,920
You think this is acceptable?

593
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,233
I'm sorry, sir.

594
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,120
Why are you laughing?

595
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,520
Oh, but a leaf just dropped
into your pocket,

596
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,633
and it looks like a handkerchief...

597
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,466
Let me take it off you.

598
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:11,666
How dare that leaf get on my suit...

599
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,586
Anyway, it's not long to go
until you leave.

600
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,653
I want you to be perfect
at your job until the end.

601
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:21,386
Yes, sir. I'll delay all my
private affairs like blind dates

602
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:22,620
to after I leave the company.

603
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,766
Just don't.

604
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:25,300
Sorry?

605
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,733
Did you mean my resignation,
or the blind date?

606
00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:43,000
Mi-so.

607
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:44,553
Pil-nam!

608
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:45,900
How about some chicken and beer?

609
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:51,553
Whoa!

610
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,653
He crashed your blind date?

611
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:55,753
Your vice president?

612
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,486
Yes, but I was at fault.

613
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:59,053
How are you at fault?

614
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:02,286
Hey, is it a crime to go on
a blind date after work?

615
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:04,553
But it is the big day
tomorrow at work...

616
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:05,886
I should've been more thoughtful.

617
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:06,953
So it was my fault.

618
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,686
- But...
- But?

619
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,220
You know,

620
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,553
I can't quite figure out
the Vice President these days.

621
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:15,586
Or ever since I told him
I'm quitting.

622
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:16,733
Huh?

623
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:21,100
One day, he'll be all cold...

624
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,053
Just how are you training
our new secretary?

625
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,986
- Sorry?
- Is this what you call training?

626
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,520
Don't disappoint me,
and get it right.

627
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,686
Uh, Mr. Lee?

628
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,886
When exchanging texts
yesterday, I...

629
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:33,453
Let's keep business as business.

630
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,320
But another day,
he'll be so sweet.

631
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,320
Wow!

632
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,786
There must be some kind of
an event going on tonight.

633
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:39,753
No.

634
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,220
I prepared all this.

635
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,953
- Sorry?
- I told you.

636
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,300
It's a gift from me.

637
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,520
Oh, my God!

638
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,253
Maybe the news of your resignation
shocked him so much that

639
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,520
he ended up like this?

640
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,420
Do you really have to
put it that way?

641
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,853
But many people are like that,
after they receive a big shock!

642
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,153
Hey, that Vice President of yours...

643
00:41:57,233 --> 00:42:00,553
You don't suppose he was
shocked to hear you're quitting?

644
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:01,986
I'm not sure whether he's shocked,

645
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,353
but I think he hasn't
fully accepted it yet.

646
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:05,933
He hasn't accepted it?

647
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:07,786
But then again.

648
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,020
You really a great job
being his secretary.

649
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,720
I bet he was gloomy,
thinking about you being gone.

650
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,653
But that's what puzzles me.

651
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:16,453
Because someone like him can
get a secretary

652
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,386
who's more qualified than I am!

653
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:20,920
So why is he doing this to me?

654
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,286
That Vice President of yours...

655
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:25,053
He's someone who has to get
everything he wants, right?

656
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:26,020
Yep.

657
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,620
If he wanted a company,
he'd have taken it

658
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,820
through an M&A or whatever, right?

659
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,620
- Yes.
- And if he wants anything,

660
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,086
he would've bought it
right away with money.

661
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,653
No doubt about that.

662
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,366
Then there you go!

663
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,920
He's just being possessive.

664
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,786
Possessive?

665
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:43,420
Yes, possessive!

666
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,486
That's what you are
like to that Vice President!

667
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:48,553
You're like this thing that
he wants to have!

668
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:49,553
Thing?

669
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,853
Something that's very convenient
and still useful.

670
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:57,386
But now this thing is
telling him she's calling it quits.

671
00:42:57,466 --> 00:42:58,920
No wonder he's fuming!

672
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,700
I bet he's desperate to
clutch onto this thing now.

673
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:04,553
You think so?

674
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:05,920
Of course!

675
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,433
There's a reason why
I'm a psychologist!

676
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,020
Anyway, quit your company
as soon as you can.

677
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,286
If the symptoms get any worse,

678
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:15,900
he'll try to control you for life.

679
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,700
Oh what? Why are you crying now?

680
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:30,800
Because I pity my sister!

681
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:35,886
Working 9 years under that
possessive jerk,

682
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:37,633
to pay for your sisters'
college fees!

683
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,986
I really don't know
how to face you anymore.

684
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:44,720
Hey, how did you
come to that conclusion?

685
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,500
I just feel so guilty, that's why!

686
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,300
Do you have soju?

687
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,866
Let's make some soju bombs.

688
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,366
Hold on, I'll go look.

689
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:06,553
By the way, Mi-so.
What's that necklace?

690
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:07,520
It's really pretty.

691
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,853
Don't think I've seen it before.

692
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:11,053
Oh, this?
Mr. Lee bought it for me.

693
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:13,466
Ha! So it's a dog collar!

694
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,353
He put a collar on you,
so you wouldn't run away!

695
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,000
A dog collar?

696
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:36,986
Good morning, Ji-ah.

697
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:39,033
Good morning, Ms. Kim.

698
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:44,453
Huh? Isn't this
the new book by Morpheus?

699
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:46,586
I thought it's due out next month!
Where'd you get it?

700
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:49,053
Oh, it was already
published in the U.K.,

701
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:51,853
so I got a copy from
a friend who's studying there.

702
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:54,253
I'm guessing you're his fan, too?

703
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,486
To know that his new book's
coming out next month!

704
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:59,466
Of course.
He's my favorite novelist.

705
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,866
(Morpheus)

706
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,066
All his books
end up as a bestseller,

707
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,100
(Visible moments)

708
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:04,733
(Visible moments)

709
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,220
and the hottest movie
these days is

710
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:09,000
(Day in abyss)

711
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,000
also based on his novel...

712
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,166
He's just so awesome!

713
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,253
Are you a Morphen, by any chance?

714
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,253
Morphen? What is that?

715
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:21,386
Oh, it's his fan club.
I guess you didn't know.

716
00:45:21,466 --> 00:45:22,820
He has a fan club?

717
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,953
Of course!

718
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:26,486
Morpheus isn't just
a novelist now, is he?

719
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:28,586
He's an international star,

720
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,720
and not only that,
he's so hot as well!

721
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,033
You've seen his face?

722
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:34,920
But he's never done interviews
or appeared in public.

723
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,520
Nothing's known about him, except
that he's a man in his 30s.

724
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,786
Come on!

725
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,920
His photo was already
shared by the fan club.

726
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,666
I'm one of
his earliest fans, you know.

727
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,633
If you're so curious,
you want to see his photo?

728
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,166
Yes.

729
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:52,920
Keep it to yourself, alright?

730
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,500
Alright!

731
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,553
You can tell he's handsome,
from this?

732
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:03,486
Yes!

733
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,920
His silhouette
just says "handsome."

734
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,933
And look at those legs!

735
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,553
Oh, a new picture was
also uploaded last night.

736
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:14,586
Someone said she saw him at
once of the French airports.

737
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,520
- Really?
- Yes.

738
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,553
She saw him once
during the contract signing

739
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:20,286
before he got famous,
so recognized him at once!

740
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,420
Would you like to see that, too?

741
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,833
Yes.

742
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:26,666
Here.

743
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,500
You can tell he's handsome,
from this?

744
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:33,620
Yes. His chin
just says "handsome."

745
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,886
And his skin's so perfect, too!

746
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,386
You can tell that?

747
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:37,800
Look here!

748
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,420
'Saw Morpheus at the
Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport.'

749
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,653
'Not only that, we're on the
same flight bound for Korea!'

750
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:47,686
'We're taking off soon!'

751
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:50,753
'In 11 hours,
we'll be landing together.'

752
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:51,653
'Is this for real?'

753
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:54,186
'I'll take your word for it,
on my way there now!'

754
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:57,166
'I should look for a man
wearing a black fedora hat, then.'

755
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

756
00:47:14,466 --> 00:47:16,666
I think you'll suit this hat.

757
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:21,300
(Desperately waiting for Morpheus)

758
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,220
I'm finally seeing him.

759
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,853
I want to see him.

760
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:25,486
Ah... Morpheus!

761
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:26,986
When will he be here?

762
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:29,086
Hey, there he is!
The black fedora hat!

763
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:30,800
It's Morpheus!

764
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,100
It is you, right? Morpheus?

765
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,853
Oh what?

766
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:41,533
What did you say?

767
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,633
(Calling.../Mother)

768
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,153
Hello?

769
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:56,286
Where are you?

770
00:47:56,366 --> 00:47:57,586
I've just arrived in Korea.

771
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,753
What, really?

772
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,920
You're in Korea right now?

773
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,286
Why didn't you
tell me this beforehand?

774
00:48:03,366 --> 00:48:06,153
Your father and I are
down on Jeju Island!

775
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:07,953
Oh, really?

776
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:10,720
Just wait. I'll catch the
next flight up.

777
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,753
It's alright.

778
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,520
Just enjoy your time there,
as you planned it.

779
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,653
Your father's no help!

780
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:19,286
He dragged me all the way here,
saying he wanted to play golf!

781
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,720
And now I can't see my son's face
when it's been years...

782
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,820
Should I just dump him in the sea,

783
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,053
and cry out, 'Nice shot?'

784
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:28,166
You two are the same as ever.

785
00:48:29,133 --> 00:48:32,386
By the way.
Is Young-joon doing well?

786
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:33,686
Young-joon?

787
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:37,353
Of course. He's busy,
running the company.

788
00:48:37,433 --> 00:48:39,220
Why, he'll even be at
Sports Day today,

789
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,153
on behalf of your father.

790
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,366
Is that so?

791
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:46,766
Looks like Young-joon is
doing well.

792
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:54,486
Wow!

793
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:56,653
Ms. Kim, you look great
in your track pants.

794
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,886
Your legs are beautiful.

795
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:59,533
Thanks.

796
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:10,586
Is everything all set
with Sports Day?

797
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:13,820
It starts at 10 a.m.,
so we'll leave after 30 minutes.

798
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,686
What were you two
participating in again?

799
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:18,186
Mine is obstacle course,
and the three-legged race, sir.

800
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:20,053
And mine's knee wrestling,
and table tennis.

801
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:21,653
I see.

802
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:24,253
Are you two prepared to
win first place?

803
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,320
Sorry?

804
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,786
I thought this was
all about participation.

805
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,986
That's just a pathetic excuse
by the losers.

806
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:33,186
Death or victory!

807
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:34,953
I'd rather see you die,
than see you lose.

808
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:36,953
So bring me victory,
no matter what.

809
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:39,386
You haven't forgotten
your oath, have you?

810
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:40,920
Of course not, sir.

811
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,233
I'll see you later, then.

812
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:46,286
Gosh, Mr. Lee...

813
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:49,553
Like anyone would risk their
life for some Sports Day.

814
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,233
Right, Ms. Kim?

815
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,420
- Sure.
- Let's get ready to go.

816
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,100
Send Mr. Lee's
itinerary to Mr. Yang.

817
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,520
Ms. Kim!

818
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,833
Huh?

819
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,720
I got rid of it, sir.

820
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,020
Are you alright?

821
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,466
Who was it?

822
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:35,486
I must've been too busy
and made a mistake.

823
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,100
I'm sorry, sir.

824
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,353
Ji-ah,

825
00:50:57,433 --> 00:51:00,453
didn't you learn the
manual I gave you?

826
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:04,186
I thought I wrote on there,
that cable ties are a no.

827
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:06,153
I'm sorry.

828
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:07,953
I was only trying my best,

829
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:10,820
and I thought cable ties would
tidy them up better...

830
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,466
But don't you think he was
making a fuss over nothing?

831
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:16,120
Ms. Kim Ji-ah.

832
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,553
How could you say such a thing?

833
00:51:17,633 --> 00:51:19,386
You're the one
who made a mistake here.

834
00:51:19,466 --> 00:51:20,500
Sorry?

835
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:22,886
I hate spiders.

836
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:24,486
Whenever I see a spider
hanging down from the ceiling,

837
00:51:24,566 --> 00:51:26,486
I freak out to the point
where I might just collapse.

838
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:28,686
Everyone has one or two things
that they hate.

839
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:29,653
So I don't think you should
grumble about

840
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:32,120
him getting mad over it.

841
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,320
I'm sorry.

842
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,120
- Are you, really?
- Yes.

843
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,153
Then let me Morpheus'
new book from just now.

844
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:38,400
Alright.

845
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:40,900
Huh?

846
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,366
Alright.

847
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:03,853
Mr. Lee.

848
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:05,453
This is chamomile tea.

849
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,233
It'll help you to calm down.

850
00:52:21,133 --> 00:52:22,820
I'm sorry.

851
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,400
This won't happen again.

852
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:28,833
How can you be so sure,

853
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:32,600
when you're going to leave?

854
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,053
Maybe he's not being possessive.

855
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,633
Maybe he truly needs me.

856
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:58,820
(Yumyung Holdings Sports Day)

857
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,320
(Fighting, Team Passion!
You don't want to lose now!)

858
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,120
(Challenge! Victory is ours,
and the dinner, too!)

859
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,633
(The one and only chance to
talk down to the VP!)

860
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:10,933
(The 23rd Yumyung Holdings
Sports Day)

861
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:13,686
So.

862
00:53:13,766 --> 00:53:15,053
I'd like to announce

863
00:53:15,133 --> 00:53:20,200
the start of the 23rd
Yumyung Holdings Sports Day.

864
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:22,820
Be careful as not to
injure yourself,

865
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,086
and hope you enjoy this
meaningful time, becoming one.

866
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,420
So,

867
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,866
let's get started!

868
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,566
Are you all ready?

869
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:52,086
Get set...

870
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,420
Way to go, Ms. Kim!

871
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,100
Way to go!

872
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,020
Now that's why I like Ms. Kim.

873
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,453
That fiery, persistent spirit,

874
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:03,953
who gives it her everything
in whatever she does.

875
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,533
So that's why you like
Secretary Kim?

876
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,153
Not as a woman. As an employee.

877
00:55:08,233 --> 00:55:09,833
But look!
Just splendid, isn't she?

878
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:13,933
Ms. Kim.

879
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:16,153
I heard a lot about you.

880
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,600
That you're a perfectionist.

881
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,920
Who is that?

882
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,920
And just as I heard,
you're talented in sports, too.

883
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,986
Ah, thanks.

884
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:24,286
So, you had something to say?

885
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:26,220
Oh, the three-legged race
that's coming up...

886
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,486
I'm your partner.

887
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:30,253
Oh, I see.

888
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,833
Let's do this, then!

889
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:33,920
Thank you.

890
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,266
Way to go!

891
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,553
What was that?

892
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:46,086
What were you talking to
Koh Gui-nam about?

893
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,320
Koh Gui-nam?
Do you know him?

894
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,553
Do we know him?

895
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:53,853
He won Mr. Popular in our company!

896
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:54,653
Mr. Popular?

897
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:55,920
He beat Mr. Lee?

898
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,420
Well, Mr. Lee is just too perfect,

899
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,120
whereas Koh Gui-nam is hot and

900
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,953
still within our grasp!

901
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,520
But I hear he's such a workaholic

902
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,953
and won't even give
the girls a chance.

903
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:08,000
Not even me!

904
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:09,820
Wow.

905
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,933
And he just fell for Ms. Kim?

906
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:15,320
Fall for who?

907
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,520
But he just brought
Ms. Kim some water.

908
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,000
Isn't that saying something?

909
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:20,720
Oh, no no.

910
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,353
He's my partner for the
three-legged race, so...

911
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:25,886
I see.

912
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,953
And since you're on the subject,

913
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:30,686
can I take your place?

914
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:34,300
I... I haven't been all that good,
so I want to turn things around...

915
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,666
Oh what? Why won't she
ever hear me out until the end?

916
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:42,653
I want to do that
three-legged race, too!

917
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,386
Me!

918
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:47,053
I want to run that
three-legged race,

919
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,300
and feel my heart flutter, too!

920
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,966
Mr. Koh Gui-nam?

921
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:57,220
Mr. Koh Gui-nam, have some water.

922
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,253
No, take this one.

923
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,320
Take this one. And I'll take that.

924
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,033
Let's take a selfie together!

925
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:04,400
Can you take one with me?

926
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:06,433
You're so handsome!

927
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:10,086
Mr. Popular?

928
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,033
I'd say Mr. Popular is more like...

929
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:18,653
Oh my God.

930
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,586
Who did I just think of?

931
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:22,633
I must be crazy!

932
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,453
Let's start the three-legged race!

933
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:27,786
Ms. Kim.

934
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:29,320
Should we move to
the starting line?

935
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,700
Sure.

936
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:32,553
Hmmm?

937
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:34,253
Looks like the
three-legged race is next.

938
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,966
I wonder how many
couples will be born from this one.

939
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:41,553
You see, this game has
a couple success rate of 80%!

940
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:42,700
What?

941
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,653
So, are you ready?

942
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,800
Ready, get set...

943
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,966
They look so nice together.

944
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:10,133
Hey, they're getting closer!

945
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:16,700
Go, go, go!

946
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,020
Team 3, what teamwork!

947
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,886
They're in the lead! In the lead!

948
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:28,386
Who knows,
Team 3 might just claim victory

949
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:30,700
and claim love, too!

950
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:38,433
And they're in!

951
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:43,986
Should we all cry out together?

952
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:47,120
Ask her out! Ask her out!

953
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,766
- Ask her out!
- Ask her out!

954
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:59,886
- Ask her out!
- Ask her out!

955
00:58:59,966 --> 00:59:04,033
Ask her out! Ask her out!
Ask her...

956
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:07,320
Let's all cry out together!

957
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,320
Come on, ask her out!

958
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,520
Ask her out!

959
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:26,633
- Ask her out!
- Ask her out!

960
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:30,253
Sports Day is
banned from next year.

961
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,800
Ugh, so childish!

962
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:34,720
You're the one
who's being childish.

963
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,333
Blinded by jealousy...

964
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:43,866
Are you alright, Young-joon?

965
00:59:44,966 --> 00:59:46,053
Didn't you say to
watch out for injuries and

966
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:49,486
spend a meaningful time together,
becoming one?

967
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:51,553
So why are you like this now?

968
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,286
Ugh.

969
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:54,600
Let me see.

970
00:59:55,366 --> 00:59:57,500
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

971
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:10,900
- Let me take a look.
- Hey.

972
01:00:13,033 --> 01:00:14,386
Were you drunk?

973
01:00:14,466 --> 01:00:15,520
No.

974
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,953
Then what?

975
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:19,520
How did you manage to
slip from the stairs?

976
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,120
I just tripped, that's all.

977
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,800
Stop making a fuss.

978
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:25,353
- Let's go to the hospital.
- It's alright, just take me home.

979
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:27,486
What are you talking about?
We need to get you treated.

980
01:00:27,566 --> 01:00:29,620
I'm not even that hurt.

981
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,720
No. I'll get the car ready, so...

982
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,920
Hey,

983
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,900
just a cold pack,
and I'll be all better.

984
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,720
Can you stand?

985
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,920
I'm fine.

986
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,600
I can walk.

987
01:00:42,633 --> 01:00:43,653
Mr. Lee, I...

988
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:44,886
Whatever!

989
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:46,420
Here, lean on me.

990
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,300
- I'm really fine.
- Come on!

991
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:53,120
You better stop right there.

992
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,086
Unless you want to be
transferred to our India branch.

993
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,466
Hmmm?

994
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:16,166
Take your socks off,
and put your leg up here.

995
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:28,400
Or what? Do you want me to
take them off for you?

996
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:31,253
Just do it like this.

997
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,433
What, over the socks?

998
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:36,486
What are you talking about?

999
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:38,466
That's not the proper way to
do a cold pack.

1000
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,520
It's fine, just do it like that.

1001
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,520
No.

1002
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,653
Come on.

1003
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:44,653
I'm really fine.

1004
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:47,133
Don't say you're fine, when...

1005
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:13,053
Come on, what are you doing?

1006
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:14,320
Oh.

1007
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,833
Sure.

1008
01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:25,586
What was that scar?

1009
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:27,800
It seemed like
he got it a long time ago.

1010
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:38,620
Did you enjoy Sports Day?

1011
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,653
- Sorry?
- You looked like you did.

1012
01:02:40,733 --> 01:02:43,166
Especially the three-legged race.

1013
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,586
Like that was all that fun.

1014
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:51,853
All I did was to run like crazy to
come in first.

1015
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:53,086
Run like crazy?

1016
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:55,820
Sports Day is
all about participation.

1017
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,520
Who gets fired up for
something like that?

1018
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,633
You're so naive.

1019
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,053
What?

1020
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:02,453
I guess I remember it wrong, then.

1021
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,453
Because I was sure
a certain someone told me to

1022
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:06,686
bring back victory,
else it's death!

1023
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:08,886
Who takes that seriously?

1024
01:03:08,966 --> 01:03:10,653
You've really no flexibility.

1025
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:12,720
Ha!

1026
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,633
My God.

1027
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:18,120
It's hot in here...

1028
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,286
Oh, that's right.

1029
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:20,986
If it's for victory,

1030
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:22,753
you'd be willing to
cling onto a complete stranger

1031
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,486
any time, huh?

1032
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:25,553
Of course!

1033
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:27,720
Better than being a loser.

1034
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,720
Oh, I see!

1035
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,920
So you don't care about

1036
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,320
getting all touchy with someone,
if you can win, huh?

1037
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,633
No.

1038
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,753
Even if it's this close?

1039
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,366
Of course.

1040
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,186
Or this close?

1041
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:48,833
I really don't mind.

1042
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,733
What about now?

1043
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,300
(Thanks to  Mr. Park Byung-eun for
a special cameo appearance)

1044
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:44,800
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

1045
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,386
If a boss is going to
give work to his secretary,

1046
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,120
of course he needs to know
what she's up to.

1047
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,286
Love?

1048
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:51,786
No way...

1049
01:04:51,866 --> 01:04:53,720
Ms. Kim, have I ever told you that
you're actually quite pretty?

1050
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,253
Suddenly, my heart...

1051
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,786
You'll trip like that.

1052
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:59,153
What a sweet guy.

1053
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,853
Unlike someone, that is.

1054
01:05:00,933 --> 01:05:02,253
Ms. Kim, are you wearing perfume?

1055
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,600
No, I don't wear perfume.

1056
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:07,066
You think I'll ask her out?

1057
01:05:08,066 --> 01:05:09,153
You were right.

1058
01:05:09,233 --> 01:05:10,753
That darkness

1059
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:13,266
heightens your senses.
