00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,300
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,267
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,633
Who is it?

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,000
It's me.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,766
Mr. Lee?

10
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:40,333
Why did you come...

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,200
Because you said
you didn't want to.

12
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:43,200
Sorry?

13
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,434
Because you said you didn't
want to come to my place,

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,333
I thought I'd come here
and sleep over.

15
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,700
I'm moving in.

16
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,500
Let's sleep together tonight.

17
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,633
What do you mean,
'Let's sleep together?'

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,433
What nonsense are you...

19
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,333
How is this nonsense?

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,333
Of course it's nonsense.
You're saying you...

21
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,666
...You want to move in!

22
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm only going to spend a few days
so it's not as much as moving in.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,800
I'd say... Half-moving in?

24
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,100
What's with that?

25
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,100
Besides, my place is
a one-bedroom apartment

26
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,934
and there's just one room.
So you can't stay here.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,700
That's why I suggested
we go to my place,

28
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,300
but you were the one
who turned me down.

29
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:33,467
That's true, but...

30
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,300
Then can you step out of the way?

31
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,733
It's going to take forever to
unpack, otherwise.

32
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,366
What...

33
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:45,067
What do I do?

34
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:52,200
Let's see...

35
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,266
You... You can't just...!

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,534
Not many shoes.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,133
Thanks to you,
I'll have plenty of space.

38
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:10,933
Here.

39
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,466
Ah...

40
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,566
I know this space very well.

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,500
What...

42
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,166
With that, there's plenty of
space in the closet, too.

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,333
Um...

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,433
The dressing table also has
plenty of space.

45
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:40,200
Ms. Kim, are you a minimalist?

46
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:43,000
You know, living with less.

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
I just couldn't
afford to buy things

48
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,866
when I had debt to pay off.

49
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,800
Oh.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,866
Don't tell me...

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,633
Are you nervous?

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,366
Thinking about
being with me tonight?

53
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,466
Ha...

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,966
No, it's not like that.

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,533
Then don't get nervous, Ms. Kim.

56
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm here tonight to...

57
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,634
...Be by your side,

58
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,200
so you'll have
a good night's sleep.

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,433
That's all.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,634
And I also brought something to

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,900
help you get a good night's sleep.

62
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,733
It is...

63
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,933
Top-quality foot bath, containing
salts from the Dead Sea.

64
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:08,200
A foot bath?

65
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,200
A foot bath warms up your feet

66
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,200
and helps to
improve your circulation.

67
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,034
That helps your system to
excrete toxins and waste,

68
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,134
so you'll have
a good night's sleep.

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,700
Ah.

70
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:20,166
Then shall we have
a foot bath time?

71
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,067
Yes.

72
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,266
Let's go.

73
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,800
Hmmm. It's not
quite what I had in mind.

74
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm sorry. I don't have a bathtub.

75
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,634
It looks like you're not
too comfortable here,

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,400
so why not just
go back to your place?

77
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:50,933
It's not that I'm uncomfortable.
I'm just not used to this.

78
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,334
But what makes me uncomfortable is

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,634
thinking about how you'd be
terrified without me.

80
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,767
So don't mind me,

81
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,033
but just relax and
enjoy your foot bath.

82
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,400
Whether it's the bathtub
or just a tub,

83
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,933
the effects are
bound to be the same.

84
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,733
Yes, sir.

85
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,066
Ah...

86
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,833
How... How did that...

87
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,733
Ah...

88
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Great water pressure.

89
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,200
Thank you.

90
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,533
Does your toilet get
blocked often?

91
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,500
No way.

92
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:39,967
So?

93
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,667
Did that help
improve your circulation

94
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,167
and your system to
excrete out toxins and waste

95
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,766
so you'll get a good night's sleep?

96
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,700
Yes, that was really nice.

97
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,666
I think I'll sleep
very well tonight.

98
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,400
That's great to hear.

99
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,733
Then shall we go to bed?

100
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,633
Then... Good night.

101
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,633
Yes, good night to you too,
Ms. Kim.

102
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:33,033
What's with that look?

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Well, why are you...

104
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,933
Then where else shall I go?

105
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:44,600
Then... It'll be like this?

106
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,033
Of course.

107
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,233
There's just one bed, isn't there?

108
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,500
That's true, but...

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,133
Alright, since you supplied me
with a comfortable bed,

110
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,434
I'll supply with
a comfortable pillow.

111
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,900
But I already have a pillow.

112
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,500
Forget about that,
I have a special pillow ready

113
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,366
to help you get
a good night's sleep.

114
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,666
My arm.

115
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:45,866
Just...

116
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,166
Just... What are you doing?

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,633
I suddenly can't sleep, so I
thought I should watch some TV.

118
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,766
This is a nice angle,
but TV? At this hour?

119
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,833
Yes.

120
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,166
Well, uh...

121
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:07,266
What was that movie channel again?

122
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,933
There it is.

123
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,066
Haha! Let's watch some soccer.

124
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,800
The Europe Premier League...
Shall we watch this?

125
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,933
Is that so fun?

126
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,634
Ms. Kim, don't tell me...

127
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,166
Is it because you're uncomfortable
being in the same bed with me?

128
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,700
Not really uncomfortable...

129
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,166
More like... Awkward?

130
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm just so nervous that
I don't think I can fall asleep.

131
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,933
Then let's have a glass of wine.

132
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,633
A glass of wine?

133
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,267
Wine lowers your body temperature

134
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,867
and stimulates
sleep-inducing hormones,

135
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,067
helping you to get
a good night's sleep.

136
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,733
Sounds good.

137
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,867
Oh, but I don't have wine.

138
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,600
I thought so.

139
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,033
That's why I brought one with me.

140
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,466
This is kind of like
a rooftop wine bar.

141
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:39,567
A glass of wine
in the open air at night,

142
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,400
followed by a good night's sleep.

143
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,133
It can't get any more
perfect than this.

144
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,933
You're right.

145
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,000
So... Where's the wine opener?

146
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,900
There is no such thing
at my place.

147
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,266
Then... Does that mean
we can't have this?

148
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,133
No, there is a way.

149
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,267
I saw this on the TV once:

150
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,800
how to open a wine bottle
without an opener!

151
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,233
Ms. Kim, you've been certainly
working on your jokes.

152
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,133
Opening a wine bottle
without an opener...

153
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:21,400
What, is this magic?

154
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,633
No, it's called skills.

155
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:27,533
May I borrow one shoe?

156
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,700
Shoe...

157
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,833
Fine, I'll trust you.

158
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,433
Thank you.

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Just wait.

160
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:47,933
Like this!

161
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,733
Ms. Kim? What are you doing?

162
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,467
With that, the cork
should pop out.

163
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,200
So just hold on.

164
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,033
Oops, sorry.

165
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,133
You know what, Ms. Kim?

166
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:10,466
Yes?

167
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,100
That wine.

168
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,366
It's worth $20,000.

169
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,566
I apologize.

170
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:32,566
Good work, Ms. Kim.

171
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,733
1757!

172
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,200
Who's the owner of
car number 1757?

173
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,167
- Such rude neighbors.
- 1757!

174
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,600
I mean both that lady
who's screaming at this hour,

175
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,033
and the owner of the
car 1757.

176
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,834
Hold on.

177
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,900
1757... Isn't that your car?

178
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,533
1757!

179
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,334
Excuse me, is this your car?

180
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
- Yes.
- This is reserved parking.

181
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:05,000
You can't just
park your car anywhere!

182
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,666
Oh. Reserved parking...

183
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,533
I'm extremely sorry.

184
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:13,333
Ha! What's with this fancy car
when you live in a one-room flat?

185
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,367
Mr. Lee, I think
you should move your car...

186
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,334
I'm just saying this
because you're like my son,

187
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
and I'm worried for you.

188
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,834
People should know their level.

189
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,800
All this vainglory
won't do you any good.

190
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,600
Vain...

191
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,700
Vainglory?

192
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,367
See, unlike you,

193
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,600
my honest son
studied so diligently

194
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:43,300
and he just got a job offer from
that big company, Yumyung!

195
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,167
And the person who leads this
Yumyung Group is me.

196
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,066
Ha!

197
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,333
Haha!

198
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,134
Don't drive
if you're drunk, alright?

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
Hey, you should drive instead.

200
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,266
Hey, son. Still in the office?

201
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:07,333
Why does your company
give you so much work?

202
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,667
I'd like to see the face
of your selfish boss,

203
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,766
so I can give him a lecture.

204
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Sel... Selfish?

205
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:14,833
Yeah!

206
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,934
Ms. Kim, go ahead first.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,400
I'll move my car to
a paid parking spot

208
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,833
and get a wine opener.

209
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,300
No, sir. It looks like
you're not comfortable here

210
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:33,634
so why not go back to
your place now and...

211
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,034
I told you, didn't I?

212
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,366
That I won't feel comfortable
leaving you alone tonight!

213
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,967
So let's go.

214
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,434
Let's go to your place, Mr. Lee.

215
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,034
Go to my...
Did you say my place?

216
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Yes.

217
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,700
You made a wise decision.

218
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,834
We could've just
stayed at your place.

219
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
No, sir.

220
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,034
It's cramped, and there aren't
a lot of things there,

221
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,634
so I think I would've
stayed up all night,

222
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,933
worrying that
you won't be able to relax.

223
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:09,433
Do you think I'm being persistent?

224
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,466
Even if you do, I can't help it.

225
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:18,167
I was so traumatized
by that incident and

226
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,100
it was very hard for me,
more than you think.

227
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,000
But...

228
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,100
Thinking about how you, Ms. Kim,

229
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,966
might experience the
same pain that I did...

230
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,400
I got so worried that I couldn’t
focus on anything else.

231
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,000
I know how you feel.

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,800
Which is why I'm heading to
your place

233
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,666
with you, right now.

234
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,166
I'll sleep in the guest room tonight.

235
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,434
The guest room?

236
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,633
Yes. Good night, sir.

237
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,033
It's kind of scary.

238
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,766
Argh!

239
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,366
Ms. Kim, are you alright?

240
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,166
You scared me. Why are you here?

241
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,400
I can't help it.

242
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:13,000
Your house was tiny,

243
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,000
so I could see what you were up to

244
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:15,900
at all times,

245
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:18,066
but not in my place
because it's so spacious.

246
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,500
This is the first time I've found
"spacious" to be a hindrance.

247
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,867
And?

248
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:27,133
I want to keep you by my side to
make sure you're sleeping alright.

249
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,200
By... By your side?

250
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,567
Since there's no sofa here
and if I sleep on the floor,

251
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:36,400
you'll be troubled all night...

252
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,966
I'll sleep in the
same bed, with you.

253
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,800
I know what you're thinking.

254
00:16:56,866 --> 00:17:00,367
But! My head is full of
worries about you, Ms. Kim,

255
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,700
that there's no room for
any other thoughts.

256
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,533
So don't worry, and just sleep.

257
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,666
Well, after what he said...

258
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:11,434
...Things will get even more awkward

259
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,766
if I were to
reject him again, right?

260
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,600
Come on, say something. Please.

261
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,867
What should I say?

262
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:45,366
To end this awkwardness.

263
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,566
Come on, work!
You special brain of mine.

264
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,167
Ms... Ms. Kim?

265
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:52,366
Yes, Mr. Lee.

266
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Shall I sing you a lullaby?

267
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,900
That's cringy, but yes.
Anything, please.

268
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,433
Yes, please.

269
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,033
Though this is embarrassing,
let's at least do something.

270
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,633
Alright.

271
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:20,766
I'll sing it, especially for you.

272
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,600
After...

273
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,000
After...

274
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:47,500
After a long, hard day...

275
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,700
Two figures under the moonlight,

276
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,966
but one shadow...

277
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,566
When you close your eyes,

278
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:13,333
happiness feels like

279
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:21,400
it's within your grasp.

280
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:27,600
But your heart has been hurt

281
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,500
and shadows have been cast

282
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:36,166
over your dreams.

283
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,066
Still, please remember.

284
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:47,200
That next to you is

285
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:51,733
someone who loves you to death.

286
00:19:52,133 --> 00:20:00,200
This road might seem to
go on forever,

287
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:07,800
and so you might
shed tears of sadness.

288
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:15,700
But until all this
becomes a memory,

289
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:19,466
let's...

290
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:25,766
Let's be each other's shelter
and resting place.

291
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:39,533
When I'm walking with you...

292
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,866
This is enough for tonight.

293
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,000
Why are you up already?

294
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,566
I was up all night.

295
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,766
Why?

296
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:31,633
I was trying so hard not to
disrupt your sleep.

297
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,033
Ms. Kim.

298
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:56,500
I can't guarantee
the same for tonight.

299
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,300
Oh man...

300
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,433
(Young-joon, you!)

301
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,000
Jesus, you!

302
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,767
- You... Devil of lust!
- Oh yeah!

303
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:30,966
Go away, you!

304
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:33,100
(What about tonight?)

305
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,433
Go! Go to Ms. Kim!

306
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,133
(And tomorrow night?)

307
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,333
Go get her!

308
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:47,800
Mmm, so fragrant.

309
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,433
So why did Mr. Lee
stay up all night?

310
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:01,800
And what does he mean by he can't
guarantee the same for tonight?

311
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,766
Don't tell me...

312
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,700
Oh my God!

313
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,000
(Ms. Kim)

314
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,066
Go away!

315
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,833
(Mmm ah)

316
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:20,400
No, I wasn't thinking about that!

317
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,766
Who do you take me for? Go away!

318
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,366
(Sneaky)

319
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,766
(Recipe of making omelet for my boyfriend)

320
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:59,533
It looks so easy in the video...

321
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,800
What are you doing?

322
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,900
Ah, Mr. Lee!

323
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,066
Why are you making
breakfast, Ms. Kim?

324
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,100
Well, I was just
so grateful for you yesterday,

325
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,400
doing all that for me, so...

326
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:23,034
I wanted to something for
you as well,

327
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,400
so I made this omelet.

328
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,766
Is this what they mean by
repaying good with evil?

329
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,966
I'll throw it away.

330
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:40,266
It's mine now.

331
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:44,700
You made this for me,
so it's mine.

332
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,334
Let me at least fix that up.

333
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,666
Don't touch it anymore.

334
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,533
Thanks for the breakfast.

335
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,367
Have some coffee, too.

336
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:18,034
You must be tired after
not getting any sleep.

337
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,600
Thank you.

338
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,100
Oh no. Do you want a new cup?

339
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,166
It's alright.

340
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,566
But I better be careful today.

341
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,566
Oh. A chipped cup means
bad luck for you, right?

342
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,166
It's nice, going to
work together like this.

343
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,433
Ah... Ouch!

344
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,800
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

345
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,467
Did you sprain your ankle?

346
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,267
We should go to the hospital
before we go into the office.

347
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,334
Oh. My ankle's fine.

348
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,534
My heel's just scratched,
that's all.

349
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,533
But a scratched heel for me
means bad luck.

350
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,967
What? A jinx?

351
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,267
Yes, a jinx.

352
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,800
Whenever I my cup or
dish is chipped for no reason,

353
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:34,233
something bad always
happens to me.

354
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:39,166
And for me, it's a scratched heel.

355
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:45,300
Well. I don't really believe in
that kind of stuff.

356
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,434
But you know, I did see
a crow this morning

357
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,200
and broke my glass while
drinking water.

358
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,066
Oh, and I scratched my shoe
against the door.

359
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,400
But nothing bad has
happened so far.

360
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:58,933
On the other hand,
I had good luck come my way.

361
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Good luck?

362
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:03,634
Yes, I just had a meeting
with Yumyung Bio and

363
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,767
they say our new drug has
lots of promise.

364
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,234
That's because I'm competent.

365
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,800
Anyway!

366
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,000
Jinx and all that...
It's just superstition!

367
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,467
So let's not get
held up by that kind of stuff.

368
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:17,100
We live in an advanced nation!

369
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,200
Oh, by the way, Ms. Kim.

370
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:21,234
Can you cancel all my
appointments this evening?

371
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,000
You cancel yours, too.

372
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,534
- Why?
- You know Kim Sung-ki?

373
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
He's been admitted to the
hospital for lung cancer.

374
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,000
He's looking forward to
his surgery very soon.

375
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:31,234
What? Lung cancer?

376
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,200
That's one of your acquaintances
from your study abroad, is it?

377
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:35,767
Yes, that's right.

378
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:39,166
At least it's still in the
early stage, so he'll be fine.

379
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:40,634
That Sung-ki...

380
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,334
After all those packs of
cigarettes a day, I knew it!

381
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,366
You two take care of
your health too, like me!

382
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,067
Your problem is that
you go overboard with it.

383
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:53,600
Best to go overboard than
not do anything.

384
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:54,600
Take a look around you.

385
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,000
So many have died so young
after not taking caution!

386
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,667
You know the saying.

387
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:02,100
You only realize what you've lost
after you've lost it.

388
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,966
And do you know how lonely I was

389
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,966
after my wife left me?

390
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,633
In the end,
it's back to your ex-wife.

391
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,600
Oh, about Mr. Park...

392
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,566
He always talks about
his ex-wife nowadays.

393
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:24,866
Like you'd know how I feel!

394
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,800
Sorry, I guess I was too loud.

395
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:34,000
How I was supposed to
know he was his cousin?

396
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,200
I had to rashly fire away about

397
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:37,267
how she got a new boyfriend,

398
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,867
and missed my chance to
make up with her.

399
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,666
Like you'd understand
how I feel!

400
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,866
Yes, there's no saving me.
You go ahead first.

401
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,100
Ugh, that Ms. Seol...

402
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,966
Why aren't you taking the call?

403
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,466
It's my ex-wife.

404
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,733
Hon...

405
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:11,434
...Hello?

406
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,767
I felt bad about parting ways
like that yesterday,

407
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,766
so I called.

408
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,533
Yu-sik...

409
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,900
Could it be that you were there
because you were thinking of me?

410
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:25,433
Yes. I thought...

411
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,900
...Maybe, I could
catch a glimpse of you there.

412
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,366
Yu-sik...

413
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,533
Are you free this evening?

414
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,100
Yes. Tonight...

415
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:37,800
What, how about
some cocktails together?

416
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,233
Hey, what are you doing?

417
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,067
I'll see you tonight.

418
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,133
Yes.

419
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,134
Oh, I'm really sorry but

420
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
can we make it
a little late tonight?

421
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:01,800
I have to go to the hospital.

422
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:03,566
What? Hospital?

423
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,966
Why, are you sick?

424
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,266
Well, uh...

425
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Sung-ki's really sick

426
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,933
so I need to...

427
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:17,434
Oh, no! No, no!

428
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,767
I don’t mean that Sung-ki,

429
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,233
but the other Sung-ki...

430
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,467
I don't mean the other Sung-ki,

431
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,467
but there's this Sung-ki...

432
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,267
He's an acquaintance from
back in school.

433
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,334
Hello? Seo-jin?

434
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,433
Seo-jin? Hello? Honey!

435
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,166
The crow, chipped cup,
scratched shoes...

436
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,933
Which do you suppose was my jinx?

437
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,800
- All of them.
- All of them.

438
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,466
Be good to her
when she's still with you.

439
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,066
Don't lose her and
regret it like me.

440
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:05,933
Ah.

441
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,567
Anything this morning?

442
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,634
No.

443
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,967
Here. I finished the
next week's schedule sheet.

444
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,100
Good work.

445
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:19,566
Thank you.

446
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,434
Then... I'll be off to
a meeting with Planning.

447
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,766
Sure.

448
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:37,933
Here's your schedule for
next week.

449
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:45,734
Forget about this. Do you remember
what Mr. Park said earlier?

450
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
What?

451
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,600
'Be good to her
when she's still with you.

452
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,300
Don't lose her and
regret it like me.'

453
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,533
Those words
really got me thinking.

454
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:58,133
About how much you'll regret it,

455
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,933
should you leave me.

456
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,566
So be good to me
while you're still with me.

457
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,966
I think that applies to us both.

458
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:10,600
But I'm already
doing very well, aren't I?

459
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:13,133
And of course,
I intend on keeping that up.

460
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,233
Well, I have to admit it.

461
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,533
What's my schedule like
for lunch today?

462
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,134
The luncheon with the
Jungyeon Group has been postponed,

463
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,766
so there's nothing for today.

464
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:25,734
Then join me for lunch.

465
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,133
Since I need to be good to you
while you're still here,

466
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,600
I plan on taking you
somewhere very nice.

467
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:39,833
Well, then let's wrap up for now.

468
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,200
- Oh, Ms. Ji-ah.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:45,467
The files I gave you
are confidential,

470
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,167
so please shred them
on your way out.

471
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,100
Yes, I'll shed them
right away, sir.

472
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:52,034
Thank you, everyone.

473
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,434
- Thank you.
- Thank you everyone.

474
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,067
Hello?

475
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,533
Hey, Eun-jung.
Did you say Saturday?

476
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:01,033
Sure, I'm totally free that day.

477
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,800
Alright. Then let's go to
that same place,

478
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:05,266
and have some egg benedicts!

479
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:07,400
It's been so...

480
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:08,600
Hey! I'll call you back!

481
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,600
Oh no...

482
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,100
No!

483
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,233
Come back out!

484
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,966
Did something happen?

485
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:19,466
Well...

486
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,500
Instead of
shredding confidential papers...

487
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:27,066
I shredded the
meeting minutes from today.

488
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,434
I need to report it to
Mr. Lee later,

489
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,900
so what do I do?

490
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:35,100
Whoa, whoa! Stop.

491
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,666
Move aside.

492
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:43,300
Oh no. It's turned into powder!

493
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:45,933
Calm down. Calm down!

494
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,434
I saw that you were
using a ball point-pen to

495
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,333
take those notes down.

496
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:54,867
Yes. He doesn’t like that
keyboard tapping sound,

497
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:56,434
so I wrote it down by hand.

498
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,133
You're so down to detail,
so how did you make this mistake?

499
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,767
Anyway, all you have to do is
find the bits with letters

500
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,200
written with a ball-point pen.

501
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:09,466
Come on, then!
Let's find those bits.

502
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:14,300
Sure.

503
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:23,200
I think the next one's this one.

504
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,400
No, have a good look.

505
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:29,200
Here, like this.

506
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:33,433
'Next steps for our core project
and new growth strategies.'

507
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,067
There. Now it makes
sense, doesn't it?

508
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,366
Wow.

509
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:39,933
You know that

510
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:42,400
this is only possible because
I thoroughly understood

511
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,400
and remembered the
contents of our meeting, right?

512
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:47,066
Yes, you're truly amazing.

513
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,200
Well... Haha.

514
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:55,400
Well, there you go.

515
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:58,566
Wow! Thank you.

516
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:07,567
To be honest with you,
I'm under extreme stress,

517
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,333
working under Ms. Kim,
who's so perfect.

518
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:12,433
I want to do a good job too,
but I'm having trouble getting there.

519
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,800
On top of that, I had to make
a silly mistake like this,

520
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:18,234
so I was so worried about

521
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,966
how I'm going to report this...

522
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,633
So thank you so much for
helping me out like this.

523
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:34,533
Well, that's what
neighbors are for.

524
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,066
Ah! Oh no.

525
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,433
This bit has been smudged...

526
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,266
R&D budget...

527
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,067
How much were we going to
increase it by?

528
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:51,134
- 5.8.
- Five point... Sorry?

529
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,733
By 5.8%.

530
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:55,833
Wow!

531
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:58,766
You even remembered those numbers.

532
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:01,233
It's only the basics.

533
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,566
Then... I have work to take care of.

534
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,566
So please excuse me.

535
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:10,466
Thank you...

536
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,966
So there's a reason why
he's most eligible bachelor.

537
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,266
Thank you.

538
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,566
Hey, it's caramel!

539
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,133
Do you love caramel that much?

540
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,300
To me, caramel is like
food for my soul.

541
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,233
Food for your soul?

542
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,767
Remember how you gave me
that last caramel to me,

543
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,833
when we were little?

544
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,400
That would pop up in my mind
from time to time.

545
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,200
What you did for me then would
always cheer me up.

546
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,400
By the way, I have a question.

547
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:19,866
Why did you change
your name from Sung-hyeon?

548
00:38:25,466 --> 00:38:26,700
And...

549
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,300
How did your brother come to
mistake your memories for his?

550
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,100
Oh...

551
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:42,500
You don't have to tell me now.

552
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,900
We've many more days
together ahead of us,

553
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:46,700
so you can take it slowly.

554
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:53,900
By the way, there's a place
I want us to go together.

555
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,700
A place for us to go together?

556
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,500
Yes.

557
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,600
Ah, 10 minutes until
lunch ends! I'm so sad.

558
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,834
I wish we could have like
3 hours for lunch.

559
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,133
I know, right?

560
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,134
- Why...
- Did you hear about how

561
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Mr. Choi and Ms. Kim
are going out?

562
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,434
What, really?

563
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,200
How nice...

564
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,700
I'm so jealous!

565
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,200
If you're so jealous,
then what about you?

566
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:23,500
You said your crush is
just like a superhero.

567
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:28,600
My crush? Ha! It looks like
he's too busy saving the world,

568
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,567
because no word from him yet!

569
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,300
- What, still?
- Oh, I don’t know!

570
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:33,700
Oh, what? What happened?

571
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:35,000
- Hey, about this day.
- Yes.

572
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:36,834
I told you to draft up the
schedule for the overseas trips.

573
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,834
Yes, I did.

574
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,900
- You did?
- Yes.

575
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:39,934
- But sir...
- Where is it?

576
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,466
Could you review the
report I submitted last time?

577
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:48,133
What, Mr. Yang?

578
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
Is that hamburger your lunch?

579
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:55,666
Oh. It's because Mr. Lee is
off to a private lunch today.

580
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,566
(Olive Old: 50% off all items!
Excludes accessories)

581
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,900
Damn it.

582
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:07,834
Oh my goodness!

583
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,967
Just what to do...

584
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:10,900
Why, what is it?

585
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,800
Well, this is a guy from
my neighborhood,

586
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:15,867
and he keeps on
asking me out to dinner!

587
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:18,833
I already told him I'm busy,
but he's so persistent...

588
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:20,700
Really?

589
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:23,167
Based on my clever analysis,

590
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,800
I say that
he has a thing for you, Ms. Bong.

591
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,834
You think so?
You think he likes me?

592
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,300
Of course!

593
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:34,400
Even I'd say that he's into you.

594
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,433
As a potential client for
his insurance business!

595
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,934
Well, from what you said,

596
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,466
it looks like he's trying to
sell you insurance!

597
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,367
He works for
an insurance company, right?

598
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,800
Hell no!

599
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:49,667
I think this is because
he knows I'm single.

600
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,734
If only a certain someone could

601
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,700
just ask me out right now,

602
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:57,900
then he wouldn't be so persistent...

603
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:03,500
How can you just drink that coke
like this is nothing?

604
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,534
Whoa, he almost
choked on that thing.

605
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,366
Why are you taking it
out on Mr. Yang?

606
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:12,133
Well...

607
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,734
It's just that I like coke, too.

608
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
But he's not sharing, so...

609
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:20,500
Damn it!

610
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:23,067
I'm going to go brush my teeth.

611
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,367
What's with her?

612
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,366
I guess she really loves coke.

613
00:41:38,366 --> 00:41:40,233
Dating your colleague
must be so nice.

614
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,400
Oh, whatever!

615
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,466
If you break up,
it'll only get awkward.

616
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,866
So even if someone does
ask me out, I'll refuse!

617
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,466
Whoa!

618
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,966
What's this?

619
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:57,900
Don't share it with anyone else.

620
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:02,233
Don't.

621
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,466
Alright?

622
00:42:08,933 --> 00:42:11,500
What? So he got me this coke

623
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:12,900
after what I said to him
about not sharing?

624
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:15,833
Ha! I didn't ask for this.

625
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:20,500
And what does he mean,
don't share it?

626
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:30,300
Ms. Bong...

627
00:42:30,566 --> 00:42:32,366
Huh?

628
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,700
You're so cute.

629
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,666
Do you want to go out with me?

630
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:57,933
What... What's with this coke?

631
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,300
So the place you wanted to go was

632
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:15,634
our rival's department store?

633
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,634
Why? Here for market research?

634
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,334
No, I just needed something

635
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,467
but if we go to
a Yumyung department store,

636
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:23,066
all the staff there will
tense up, so...

637
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,900
So what is it that you need?

638
00:43:26,966 --> 00:43:27,966
There it is!

639
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,400
How about this one?

640
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:40,200
I wanted to give you
a pretty cup as a present.

641
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:41,800
A present?

642
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:45,000
I felt bad about that
chipped cup this morning.

643
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,434
So I wanted to give you
a pretty new cup

644
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,266
that'll have you
forget about your jinx.

645
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:51,766
We'll take this one.

646
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:54,200
Certainly.

647
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:57,700
We also have a whole dish set,

648
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:58,900
would you like to
take a look at that, too?

649
00:43:58,966 --> 00:44:00,666
It's really popular
among the newlyweds.

650
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:01,800
Newlyweds?

651
00:44:01,866 --> 00:44:03,234
We'll take the whole set!

652
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,900
No, we'll just take that mug.

653
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:06,433
Alright, then.

654
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:09,567
Why? I want that dish set that's

655
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:11,100
highly popular
among the newlyweds.

656
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,367
Unnecessary expenditure
isn't good.

657
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:14,866
Why do you think
this is unnecessary expenditure?

658
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,833
You've half-moved in,

659
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:20,000
so aren't we kind of
like newlyweds?

660
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:21,867
Can you stop using that word?

661
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:23,567
I'm scared someone might hear us.

662
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:25,300
Which one? Newlyweds?

663
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:26,333
Dish set?

664
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,400
Anyway, I said no.

665
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:35,700
Newlyweds! Dish set!

666
00:44:37,766 --> 00:44:39,000
Anyway, how strange.

667
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:40,900
I've just been told off,

668
00:44:40,966 --> 00:44:42,600
but it doesn't feel bad at all.

669
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:47,466
I like these very much.

670
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,000
You should put them in already.

671
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:51,633
No. I'm going to
look at them some more.

672
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:56,034
That's right. I also thought
hard about your jinx,

673
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,000
and came up with
some possible solutions.

674
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,534
Solutions?

675
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,033
Number 1. Have all employees
come to work in sneakers.

676
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,967
That way, you won't need to
wear heels again,

677
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,533
and so you won't end up
with scratched heels.

678
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:10,633
All employees in sneakers...

679
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,233
I think that's going
a bit overboard.

680
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,834
Number 2. Minimize your walking.

681
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,367
For my girlfriend's safety,

682
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:20,534
I'll supply you with
a car and a chauffeur.

683
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,700
Oh, but no selling
the car this time.

684
00:45:26,966 --> 00:45:29,733
I think that's going
a bit overboard, too.

685
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:33,966
Number 3. I also get you
pretty new shoes.

686
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,366
So that you can forget all about
your jinx in your new shoes.

687
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:40,933
I think that's the
best solution, too.

688
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,033
I don't want us to
be tied down by jinxes.

689
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:48,967
As long as we're together,

690
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:50,433
it should be all fine.

691
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:56,566
Then... Shall we go get your shoes?

692
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:58,433
I'll get all the shoes you want.

693
00:45:58,866 --> 00:45:59,867
I thought I told you already,

694
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:01,767
that unnecessary expenditure
isn't good.

695
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:04,033
I'm going to get
just one pair, alright?

696
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,867
Alright.

697
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:09,900
I won't act like the
typical chaebol, then.

698
00:46:20,866 --> 00:46:21,834
Ms. Kim...

699
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,267
Ms. Kim, Ms. Kim, Ms. Kim!

700
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,333
Ah!

701
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,734
I was about to call you.

702
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
The President and madam are here.

703
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:50,700
Ji-ah.

704
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,900
I have a meeting with
Marketing right now,

705
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:54,766
but could you go in my place?

706
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:57,167
All you need to do is
take the meeting minutes.

707
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,633
Oh, sure.

708
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,233
- Then I'll be back.
- Thanks.

709
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,600
Young-joon...

710
00:47:24,933 --> 00:47:26,833
I heard from Sung-yeon.

711
00:47:27,766 --> 00:47:29,067
He said...

712
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:33,600
...That you didn't lose
your memories. Is this true?

713
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,866
When our mature and
thoughtful son said that

714
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,300
he'd lost just those memories...

715
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:58,266
I should've known.

716
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,233
No, it's all my fault.

717
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,666
When you said we should...

718
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:07,600
...Get Sung-yeon hospitalized...

719
00:48:08,533 --> 00:48:11,366
...I should've listened to you.

720
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:15,433
It's all my fault.

721
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:18,300
Young-joon.

722
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:21,966
Can you tell us why?

723
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,133
Why you chose to act that way,

724
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,333
and just what had happened?

725
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:34,166
Though we've no right to...
We'd like to ask.

726
00:48:48,266 --> 00:48:49,534
What is this?

727
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,533
I told you there's no such thing
as a theme park here.

728
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:53,300
Just a little more.

729
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:55,034
Dae-cheol said he saw one.

730
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,333
He's lying.

731
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:59,300
They said we're still
bidding for the land.

732
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:01,666
I want to go home.

733
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:06,900
What, after going to all that
effort to try lose the chauffeur?

734
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:07,900
Are you scared?

735
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:09,600
No!

736
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:11,733
Anyway, can you
give me some water?

737
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:13,000
I don't have any.

738
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:15,833
But I'm so thirsty.

739
00:49:17,066 --> 00:49:19,567
Then just wait here.

740
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:21,400
I'll go get us some drinks.

741
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,300
I'll come with you.

742
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:25,400
Why? Scared to be alone?

743
00:49:25,466 --> 00:49:27,000
I said, I'm not!

744
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:31,166
Go, then. But no fizzy drinks.

745
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,000
They're bad for your teeth.

746
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:35,933
Stay right there then,
so I can find you again.

747
00:49:38,966 --> 00:49:41,533
Come back soon!

748
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:49,966
That's strange.

749
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,400
We've walked for quite a bit,

750
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:56,666
but why haven't I seen anyone?

751
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,300
Hey, kid!

752
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,934
I hurt my leg,

753
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,433
so can you help me carry this?

754
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,366
To where?

755
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:16,700
My house is up there.

756
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,733
Just up to there.

757
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:22,033
But I have to get home soon.

758
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:24,933
Oh, no...

759
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,466
But my daughter's waiting for me
at home, all by herself.

760
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,866
She's been running
a fever all morning.

761
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,166
So I need to get to her quick,
but I hurt my leg...

762
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,733
I'll help you carry it, then.

763
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:44,666
You're a good boy, aren't you?

764
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:49,800
Do you want this?

765
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:51,666
It's to say thanks.

766
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:53,833
No, it's alright.

767
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:57,333
Don't say no.
It's my token of appreciation.

768
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,300
Then... Thank you.

769
00:51:13,966 --> 00:51:16,300
All my belongings in here...

770
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,233
Can you move them to
Young-joon's room?

771
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:21,633
Huh?

772
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,600
Why all of a sudden...

773
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,766
Because that's my room, isn't it?

774
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:31,000
Just what are you...

775
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,500
That's actually my room,

776
00:51:36,633 --> 00:51:38,333
and this was actually Young-joon's.

777
00:51:49,033 --> 00:51:51,000
You knew everything, didn't you?

778
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:56,733
Because you've been here
ever since I was little.

779
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,533
Then...

780
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:08,466
...I'll have everything moved
by this weekend.

781
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,033
It was all his.

782
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,500
This room,

783
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:26,400
and the memories from that day...

784
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:30,067
Where did you leave him?

785
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:31,933
Come on, tell us!

786
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,634
Sung-yeon, there's no time.

787
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,200
Tell us, now! Where?

788
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,433
Where, Sung-yeon?

789
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:39,800
Tell Daddy.

790
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:42,400
- Sung-yeon, say it!
- Ma'am...

791
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:47,633
Sung-hyeon...

792
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:57,200
The scars may remain
for his whole life.

793
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,766
It's all my fault...

794
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:13,366
Still, I can't believe
I deceived myself...

795
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,200
Back then,

796
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:30,200
after I had been
discharged from the hospital,

797
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,033
I was greeted at home with
something I never expected.

798
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:42,800
What are you doing in my room?

799
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:47,566
Why are you wearing my clothes?

800
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:49,600
I told you not to touch my things!

801
00:53:50,866 --> 00:53:52,333
Why did you come into my room?

802
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,300
What do you mean, your room?

803
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,866
- This is...
- Get out!

804
00:53:58,266 --> 00:53:59,500
Because of you, I...

805
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,633
I was locked up there
for three days.

806
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,400
Three days! I almost died!

807
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Get out.
Get out of my room, now!

808
00:54:09,366 --> 00:54:12,766
Damn it... Get out!
Get out of my sight!

809
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:15,200
Out! Get out!

810
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:18,733
Get out! I hate you!

811
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,466
It seems like
due to extreme guilt,

812
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,666
he took on his brother's memories.

813
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,667
He strongly believes that

814
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:29,500
it was him who was kidnapped.

815
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,167
He's even got very
aggressive and defensive,

816
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:34,366
that people around him are
trying to deceive him.

817
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:42,233
Get lost! I don't want to see you!

818
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,866
Get lost!

819
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:46,034
Go!

820
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,966
The shock I felt at first...

821
00:54:50,066 --> 00:54:53,000
...Eventually turned into
anger and sadness.

822
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,500
It was me
who'd gone through all that.

823
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,466
And I was still traumatized and
yet to get over it.

824
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,200
Yet he had made me the offender.

825
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,566
I hate you!

826
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,633
Ouch! Ugh...

827
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,100
- Oh, what?
- Come here!

828
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,800
- Hey, I said that hurts!
- I told you to get lost!

829
00:55:15,866 --> 00:55:17,366
Hey, I said, don't!

830
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,200
I hate you!

831
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:22,700
So by the time I realized it,
I tried to fight back.

832
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,500
In the end, things got so bad that

833
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:27,700
others had to step in
to try and stop us.

834
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:31,866
We'd become so aggressive.

835
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,800
Mental hospital?

836
00:55:34,866 --> 00:55:36,367
How could you say that?

837
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,934
Sung-yeon's just a delicate boy.

838
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,233
It's because he feels so guilty.
They said it's only temporary!

839
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:43,667
So how could you...

840
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:46,466
Didn't you see him with
the baseball bat yesterday?

841
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:50,434
And we need to think of
Sung-hyeon, too.

842
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,000
How will he overcome his trauma,
in this environment?

843
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:55,266
At this rate,
they'll both be hurt!

844
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:59,200
Still, we can't send him to
a mental hospital...

845
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,733
Why did this have to happen to us...

846
00:56:03,933 --> 00:56:05,400
Ah...

847
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:09,700
I want to die.
This is just too hard for me.

848
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:16,300
To me, death was...

849
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,133
...No longer an abstract concept.

850
00:56:24,033 --> 00:56:25,666
The death I knew

851
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,166
had a shape,

852
00:56:30,466 --> 00:56:32,066
a sound,

853
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,700
and even a smell.

854
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:41,433
And they were so vivid.

855
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,400
Where's Sung-yeon?

856
00:56:56,133 --> 00:56:57,700
Let's eat.

857
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,566
Oh my...

858
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:06,133
Sung-hyeon!

859
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:11,233
Sung-yeon was kidnapped?

860
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:15,933
Because I left him there?

861
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,766
I really don’t remember.

862
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,400
I'm sorry...

863
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,500
I'm sorry, Sung-yeon.

864
00:57:38,266 --> 00:57:39,566
Back then...

865
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,234
I thought...

866
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,400
...That was the only way for
us to all live.

867
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:50,366
I'm sorry, Young-joon...

868
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,666
It's all my fault.

869
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,966
You were the one
who had it the hardest,

870
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,166
yet I had to say that...

871
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,000
With Sung-yeon...

872
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,700
Even though he believed
he'd gone through it,

873
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,834
he didn't experience it himself,

874
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,667
so we thought
his trauma won't be so great.

875
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:25,234
That's why we thought

876
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,833
this was the only way to
protect you both.

877
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,133
But if we had
set it right back then...

878
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:36,400
I guess you would've been
much happier.

879
00:58:38,033 --> 00:58:40,066
I lived all my life to,

880
00:58:42,066 --> 00:58:44,733
burdened with that guilt.

881
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,133
It's all our fault.

882
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,633
We left you with
a big burden on your shoulders.

883
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:57,333
We're truly sorry.

884
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,600
No, it's okay.

885
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,267
I understand.

886
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,500
No.

887
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:09,566
Don't try to
understand us, Young-joon.

888
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:14,166
Blame us, even if it's too late.

889
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,433
Tell us you've had a hard time,

890
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:21,600
and that you were
so lonely, all on your own.

891
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,200
It's okay to.

892
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:27,366
It's okay to say it, Young-joon.

893
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,866
Ms. Kim.

894
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:39,733
Please take good care of...

895
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:42,133
...Young-joon for us.

896
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,633
Don’t worry, ma'am.

897
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,033
Mr. Lee, what shall we have for
dinner tonight?

898
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,333
Well...

899
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:16,634
You really seemed to
enjoy that omelet this morning.

900
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,100
Should I make you another one?

901
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,467
Or... I know!

902
01:02:22,533 --> 01:02:24,100
We have that wine
left over from yesterday.

903
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,200
How about a movie over wine?

904
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,233
How's Sung-yeon doing?

905
01:02:34,266 --> 01:02:37,533
He's going back to France soon.

906
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,766
And just maybe...

907
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:44,566
...He'll be there for a long time.

908
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:19,100
What is it?

909
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,966
In the end...

910
01:03:26,233 --> 01:03:27,533
...You choose to run away again?

911
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:30,366
What?

912
01:03:33,466 --> 01:03:34,466
Yes.

913
01:03:35,966 --> 01:03:37,000
I bet in your eyes,

914
01:03:37,066 --> 01:03:38,500
I was always weak and pathetic.

915
01:03:39,433 --> 01:03:40,800
That's why,

916
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:44,533
you probably made that arrogant
decision back then, too.

917
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,233
But back then...

918
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:51,233
...You should've believed in me!

919
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:54,034
You should've believed in me
that I'll overcome it,

920
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,600
and you should've kept on
fighting me, to the very end!

921
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,266
Instead of covering up the truth!

922
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:01,800
You probably pretended
you lost your memories,

923
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:03,134
thinking that you're the only one

924
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,334
who was capable of
solving this mess.

925
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,400
But I!

926
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,966
Because of your arrogant decision,

927
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:13,000
I spent more than half my life,

928
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:15,400
hating you and feeling sorry
for myself. Did you know that?

929
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,766
I'm sorry.

930
01:04:28,066 --> 01:04:29,400
What?

931
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,133
I...

932
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,467
I thought it was
best for everyone that

933
01:04:35,533 --> 01:04:37,566
I just pretend I lost my memories.

934
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:42,300
I thought things would
all be alright,

935
01:04:42,366 --> 01:04:44,033
if I started a new life
as Lee Young-joon,

936
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:46,900
and throw away that name,
Lee Sung-hyeon,

937
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,666
that only confused you.

938
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:51,900
I thought, with my sacrifice...

939
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:55,066
...That all will be alright.

940
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:01,433
But today...

941
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,534
After hearing our mother say

942
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,266
she lived all her life in guilt...

943
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:09,966
I thought, maybe...

944
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,600
Even if it was the painful way...

945
01:05:15,066 --> 01:05:18,633
...We should've all
overcome it, together.

946
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,600
Because that's family, right?

947
01:05:29,266 --> 01:05:30,533
Just like you said,

948
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,200
I was proud and arrogant.

949
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:38,100
I'm sorry,

950
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:40,400
for robbing you of that
chance for a happy life.

951
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,033
You...

952
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,133
How can you forgive me?

953
01:05:50,966 --> 01:05:52,833
After I tortured you,
for such a long time?

954
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,533
I would be lying if I said

955
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:02,600
I didn't have a hard time.

956
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,300
But...

957
01:06:05,566 --> 01:06:07,166
It wasn't because of you.

958
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,233
I was just traumatized from
what happened that day.

959
01:06:18,066 --> 01:06:21,167
It wasn't because of you,
from the very beginning.

960
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:24,300
So there's nothing to
forgive you for in the first place.

961
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:27,433
So you...

962
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:30,033
...Though it'll be hard...

963
01:06:31,566 --> 01:06:34,333
I want you to let it all go
and just have it easy.

964
01:06:38,033 --> 01:06:39,066
Not for myself,

965
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,800
but for you.

966
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,066
I'm sorry.

967
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:00,966
Back then, I...

968
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:05,733
I couldn't be myself.

969
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:13,333
That was the only way
for me to live.

970
01:08:38,066 --> 01:08:39,700
What's with that laugh?

971
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,767
I thought after the
truth was finally out,

972
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,833
it'll only get uncomfortable. But...

973
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,200
It's exactly the opposite.

974
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,166
I'm glad I came out honest.

975
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:58,900
Of course. There's nothing better
than being honest.

976
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,966
Do you really think so?

977
01:09:10,933 --> 01:09:12,033
Then...

978
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:18,866
Can I be honest...

979
01:09:19,533 --> 01:09:21,433
...About how I feel right now?

980
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,533
I don’t want...

981
01:10:08,766 --> 01:10:11,866
