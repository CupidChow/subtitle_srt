00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,300
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,700
(AURA)

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,253
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,720
What would you know?

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,333
You know nothing about love.

9
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,020
Then do you, Ms. Kim?

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,233
When you've been
single all your life.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,786
I've read about it in books,
you know!

12
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,266
Good for you.

13
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,700
Ah, the water's boiling.

14
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,000
Why is Thank-cow
facing down like that?

15
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,286
No, not there!

16
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,700
Not over there!

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,600
A little longer.

18
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,466
Just a little longer.

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,766
I thought maybe
I should try this love thing.

20
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,700
With you.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,486
...Said that childish book
over there.

22
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,100
Is this what they call 'romance?'

23
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,933
Oh...

24
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,353
You memorized the whole book
in that short time?

25
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:33,500
Your memory surprises me
every time.

26
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,220
Um...

27
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,233
Is that water still boiling?

28
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,800
- Help yourself.
- Ah.

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,386
My principle is not really
eating MSG and

30
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:18,653
other chemical additives,

31
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,933
but since you went to the effort,
I will eat it this time only.

32
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,433
Yes, it'll be my honor.

33
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,333
How is it?

34
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,453
Not bad.

35
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,766
Really?

36
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:52,066
Oh, ramen is best with
some kimchi.

37
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,820
Sodium and sodium?

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,966
Does that make sense,
in terms of nutrition?

39
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,420
Thanks for the ramen today.

40
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,286
Right.

41
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,986
After calling it a bowl of MSG,

42
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:41,220
you downed the whole thing!

43
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,086
Because it was my first time
having you cook for me.

44
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,400
Was it?

45
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,120
Oh, make sure to
disinfect your cut.

46
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,966
and apply some ointment
before going to bed.

47
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,000
Alright.

48
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,933
Thank you...

49
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,766
...For today.

50
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,233
(Episode 5)

51
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,520
Now that he mentioned it,
that really was a first.

52
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,433
To have him in here.

53
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,133
Mr. Lee?

54
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,333
Hmmm? But he didn't
forget anything.

55
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,020
Oh!

56
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,086
Ta-da!

57
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,200
Sis.

58
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,320
Hey, what brings you here?

59
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,720
What, can't I?

60
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,886
Or do I have to
make an appointment?

61
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:13,920
Oh.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,753
Here. You've got beer, right?

63
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,933
Yeah.

64
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:20,653
Oh what?

65
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,520
Was someone here?

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,233
Huh? What?

67
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:27,853
Oh...

68
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,553
Just Mr. Lee.

69
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:32,586
Oh my goodness! You must be crazy!

70
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,120
You let a man inside your house?

71
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,686
No, he was only
staying for some ramen.

72
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,233
What? Ramen?

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,300
Not some other noodles, but ramen?

74
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:47,120
What, is there something
so special about ramen?

75
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,786
Of course!

76
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:54,353
When a girl says,
'Oppa, you want to stay for ramen,'

77
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,953
she means, 'After you finish that,
we're now dating.'

78
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,320
That's what it means!

79
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,653
In other words, 'I like you!'

80
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,920
What, not even caviar or truffles,

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,820
but just instant food that's
bombarded with MSG?

82
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,786
Asking to stay for that
had such a deep connotation?

83
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:11,853
God, you're so naive!

84
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,586
The ramen's just an excuse.

85
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,820
Put a man and a woman in
an enclosed space,

86
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,800
and they'll eventually
want to hold hands.

87
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,733
And hug, and...

88
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,233
- Why, what is it?
- Huh? It's nothing...

89
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,620
Is this perhaps about you
and Ms. Kim?

90
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,420
Just what are you...

91
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,033
You think we've got
that much free time?

92
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,133
This is about my cousin's
friend from his college.

93
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:43,320
Then do I look like I've got
too much free time?

94
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,933
To listen to your cousin's
friend from college's story?

95
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,586
Hey.

96
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,653
You like Mr. Lee, don't you?

97
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,253
No way!

98
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,033
Hey, what is with that?

99
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:04,986
Mi-so,

100
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,420
let me tell you something.

101
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,100
You need to date
your own kind to be happy.

102
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,686
This doesn't apply to just humans,
but to all living things!

103
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,920
Did you ever see that
dog and the bird

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,653
that are always together,
on 'What in the World?'

105
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,066
Dog-bird...

106
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,786
I wasn't trying to swear.

107
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,820
So you're saying that
this dog and a bird are together.

108
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,486
Yes. It weirds you out too,
doesn't it?

109
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:36,586
Just makes you say,
'What in the world,' huh?

110
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,220
Well, that's what this is.

111
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,466
Two different kinds,
trying to be a couple.

112
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:45,653
What, are you saying Mr. Lee is
a dog, and I'm a bird?

113
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,120
Kind of.

114
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,520
Because he's a chaebol
while we're average citizens.

115
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
You're two different kinds.

116
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,986
I mean,

117
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:00,786
if you were to tell him about how
we always fought over the drumstick

118
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:03,553
do you think
he'll ever understand? Huh?

119
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,686
I mean, over a drumstick,

120
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:07,500
and not over some stock share!

121
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,220
In other words,
he's from a different galaxy.

122
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,366
A galaxy with
a distance you can't close in.

123
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,353
You know I'm saying this
because I'm worried about you, right?

124
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,266
In case you'll only
end up hurt later.

125
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,400
I know.

126
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,333
But...

127
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,333
This is my problem.

128
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,253
Take care.

129
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,886
Text me once you get home.

130
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:05,086
Alright, I'll get going.
I'll leave you to get some rest.

131
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,266
Bye.

132
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,066
Ha... I don't have
a good feeling about this.

133
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,420
Mom!

134
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,166
Mom! Dad!

135
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,953
Where are you?

136
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,766
I'm so scared...

137
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:57,133
So scared...

138
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,166
(Mr. Lee)

139
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,553
Yes, Mr. Lee.

140
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,253
Where are you?

141
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,486
I'm still at home, did you need...

142
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:35,253
Are you ready to
come into work?

143
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,320
Yes, I was just about to step out.

144
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,953
Then make it quick.

145
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,766
Yes, sir. Uh... what?

146
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
What?

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,966
Oh my, why are you...

148
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,133
I'll be right out, then.

149
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,520
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

150
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,166
Oh my God!

151
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm so sorry.

152
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,266
- No need to be sorry.
- Sorry?

153
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:41,766
- What?
- Sorry?

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,086
Oh...

155
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,200
Oh, I see.

156
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,366
Ms. Kim, where are you going?

157
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,553
To the driver's seat.
Since Mr. Yang isn't here...

158
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,266
No, I'll do the driving.

159
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,766
Sorry?

160
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,933
Get in, Ms. Kim.

161
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,566
Watch your head.

162
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,033
You look pretty today...

163
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,253
...Is what you want to hear,

164
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,853
then I suggest you pay
more attention to your fashion.

165
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,220
- Sorry?
- That blouse.

166
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,520
You wore that
last Wednesday and Friday.

167
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,200
Someone might mistake it for
our company's uniform.

168
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,053
Wednesday, and Friday...

169
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,086
How do you remember all that?

170
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,286
It pains me, too.

171
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,153
This great memory of mine.

172
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,933
See, sometimes I'd rather
forget some things, you know?

173
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:09,600
Here.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,853
What's this?

175
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,986
Croque Monsieur, made by our chef.

176
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,120
You may have it if you want,
if you haven't had breakfast.

177
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, thank you.

178
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,966
You may also drink that coffee.

179
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,820
- Alright.
- Oh, and that shopping bag!

180
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,566
- You may also have it, too.
- Sorry?

181
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,733
Thank you.

182
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,500
What, now?

183
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,200
Let's go, then.

184
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,953
Me first?

185
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,333
Yes.

186
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,853
Young-ok, how do I look?

187
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,620
I got a new BB cream!

188
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,753
Tsk, sweetie.

189
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,853
Rub your eyes before
you rub that BB cream on.

190
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,220
You have sleep in your eyes.

191
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,233
When did that...

192
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,166
Oh, you scared me!

193
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,853
From 10 minutes ago.

194
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:41,166
Why are you only
telling me this now? Ugh.

195
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,933
Good morning, sir.

196
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:48,733
Good morning.

197
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:54,486
'Good morning?'

198
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:57,153
What, isn't this the first time
Mr. Lee greeted us...

199
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,686
- ...So gently?
- No.

200
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,220
He was always nice to me.

201
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,586
Oh, really?

202
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,320
Then why not me?

203
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,120
Are you sure you weren't
dreaming, Ms. Bong?

204
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,753
Hey, come on!

205
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,600
By the way, did something
good happen to Mr. Lee?

206
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,886
Well... who knows?

207
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,920
Who knows?

208
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,520
Alright, let's start!

209
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,886
- Alright.
- Thank you for this.

210
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,353
Ms. Bong, have some of this
and come to your senses.

211
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,766
- Alright, you can stop.
- Thank you!

212
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,966
Don't give me
something you've been eating.

213
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:35,053
Young-joon, you perfect man!

214
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,286
Not only are your looks perfect,

215
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:40,433
but you have a warm heart that
knows how to love.

216
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,733
Mr. Lee? How about we apply that
ointment again on your cut?

217
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:24,966
Or would you
rather do it yourself?

218
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,366
You can just keep going...

219
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:33,986
Oh, did you already go over
our next quarter's plans?

220
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,366
I'll tidy them... ouch!

221
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:38,720
Are you alright?

222
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,300
I'm alright.

223
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,600
I can do it myself.

224
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,466
This is for treating my cuts.

225
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm precise with this
'give and take' thing.

226
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,486
From now on, I'll have to
use tablets to check documents.

227
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:31,486
Sorry?

228
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,033
Paper is dangerous.

229
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,366
Oh... Sure.

230
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,666
Just what is wrong with me?

231
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,633
Ms. Kim? What are you doing?

232
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,753
Huh?

233
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,966
- What...
- That...

234
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,520
Oh my!

235
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,633
Why is this in...

236
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,333
I didn't know you made mistakes.

237
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,133
- Here.
- Thank you.

238
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,653
Are you alright,

239
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:07,733
honey?

240
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,420
Do you think I am?

241
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,686
I have just two son, and
they're worse than strangers.

242
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,166
I can't take this anymore.

243
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:25,620
Go shopping or something,
to take your mind off things.

244
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,220
Yes! What was it again?
You had that purse you liked.

245
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,053
That limited edition!

246
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,420
Why not treat yourself?

247
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,420
Forget it.

248
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,220
Why not? It's not like you don't
have the money or elegance.

249
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,953
Go and get that purse right now!

250
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,053
I said, forget it.

251
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,466
Hey.

252
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,186
Mr. Choi? Go to the
department store right now, and...

253
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,153
I said, forget it!

254
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,620
But how can I?

255
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,153
Just go get that purse!

256
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:53,766
I already did!

257
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,586
- What?
- I got it when it hit the stores.

258
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,133
Last week.

259
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,200
Oh, is that right?

260
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,433
Oh...

261
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,253
When are you planning to
apologize to Young-joon?

262
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,400
Sorry?

263
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,533
Well...

264
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:32,453
Hey, your mother is
having trouble sleeping.

265
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:36,166
Make up, so she can
get that burden off her chest.

266
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,253
Yes, Father. I understand.

267
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,500
Hmph.

268
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,920
Oh, and...

269
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,553
Don't interrupt Young-joon for
trivial things.

270
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,720
We've many important
projects going on right now.

271
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,586
If he loses his footing,

272
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,133
that'll put all our families
under us in danger.

273
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,866
Yes, sir.

274
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,353
Ms. Kim, you have
a guest waiting at the lobby.

275
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:11,186
A guest? What was the name?

276
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,853
Oh... I forgot to ask.

277
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:16,253
Next time, make sure to ask who.

278
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,233
I will. Sorry.

279
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:36,453
You are my guest?

280
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:37,833
Yes, Ms. Kim Mi-so.

281
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,533
How did you know
my name and my workplace?

282
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,053
You don't seem so happy to see me.

283
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,953
Of course not.
Because I have no reason to.

284
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:47,953
I thought you were pretty rude

285
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:51,453
when you were so persistent,
asking for my number, but...

286
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:54,853
I think this is no manners to
even come to my work!

287
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,020
Then should I just get going?

288
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,786
Yes, please.

289
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:00,486
You're so cold-hearted.

290
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,520
And who was the one who sent me
an e-mail asking to meet you?

291
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,920
When did I?

292
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,886
You asked me to do a book concert
at Yumyung Art Center.

293
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:08,000
When did...

294
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,486
No way.

295
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:17,466
Are you Morpheus?

296
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,033
Eh!

297
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:26,753
I'm so sorry.

298
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,986
I'm your big fan,

299
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:32,520
but I was so rude just now
because I didn't know your face.

300
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,100
Enough apologizing, let's eat.

301
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,553
I saw you weren't
able to enjoy your meal

302
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:41,086
because you kept
checking to see if I'm mad.

303
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,366
Yes...

304
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,633
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

305
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:12,120
How may I help you?

306
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,420
Could you move this vase to
somewhere else?

307
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,686
My company has hay fever.

308
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,666
Right away, sir.

309
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,053
How did you know I have hay fever?

310
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,153
How can I not?

311
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,153
You kept sniffling and
looking around,

312
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,820
then when you spotted
those flowers over there...

313
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,386
Your face said, 'Oh, that's why!'

314
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:37,586
Oh.

315
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:40,533
No wonder you're a writer,
you're very observative.

316
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,100
So, did you read my proposal?

317
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:47,886
Well...

318
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:49,053
Kind of.

319
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,420
Then...

320
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,700
...Your answer, is?

321
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,986
Do I have to answer you now?

322
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,366
Sorry?

323
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
What is it, Mr. CEO?

324
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,386
I just bit on sand.

325
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:07,820
Oh, really? Why that...

326
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,566
It's alright.

327
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,086
Were you always this forgiving?

328
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,400
Everyone makes mistakes.

329
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,886
Ha, you even seem to be
in a good mood.

330
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:21,053
Looks like...

331
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,120
...Something good happened.

332
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
Something good?

333
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,100
Finally dating?

334
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:31,953
What?

335
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:35,986
Well, I mean your cousin's
friend from college.

336
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:38,120
So is he going out
with that girl he had ramen with?

337
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,753
No, not yet.

338
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:40,886
'Not yet?'

339
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,620
Man, that guy sure can't act, huh?

340
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,000
It's obvious.

341
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:52,333
- He doesn't know girls.
- What did you...

342
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,433
Hey, are you done?

343
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,853
I meant your cousin's
friend from college.

344
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,253
Why are you getting
so mad over this, Mr. CEO?

345
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,766
He's a good friend of mine!

346
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,666
Don't call him a...

347
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,953
It's just frustrating to
hear that, you know.

348
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,420
No need, he'll confess soon.

349
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,420
Then tell him to hurry up,
if he's made up his mind.

350
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,220
Because girls hate it
if you drag it on for too long.

351
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,466
Really?

352
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,133
Enough with this topic that
doesn't interest me at all.

353
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,400
Sure.

354
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,800
Then please do consider it,
I'll be waiting.

355
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,433
This time, you'll give me
your real number, right?

356
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,000
Of course.

357
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,766
Here.

358
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,300
A confession...

359
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,520
All I want is an ordinary romance

360
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,633
with an ordinary guy.

361
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,933
Then does she want
an ordinary confession, too?

362
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,386
As a person who's been
special all his life,

363
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:21,333
I just can't get my head around
what "ordinary" is.

364
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,620
Ms. Kim Ji-ah?

365
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,100
Yes, sir. Did you need anything?

366
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,533
Well, uh...

367
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,033
There's something I want to ask.

368
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,653
Oh. Mr. Lee?

369
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,353
- Is there anything...
- Huh?

370
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,620
Oh, he said he had
something he wanted to ask.

371
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,100
Please go on.

372
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,166
Well, uh...

373
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:12,053
How are things coming along for
the Art Center opening?

374
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,853
Well, the Planning Team will be
having a meeting soon.

375
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,366
Alright, take care.

376
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,720
Did you meet that guest just now?

377
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,420
Yes, well...

378
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,753
Who was it?

379
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,120
Your crush?

380
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,186
No way! It's not like that.

381
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:35,653
Just someone... That you'll be
delighted to see, too.

382
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,920
Is it someone I know?

383
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,666
I'll tell you once I'm sure of it.

384
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:50,220
Mr. Jung.

385
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,720
There's something I want to ask.

386
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,820
Yes.

387
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,800
Anything, sir.

388
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,386
What is the
hottest restaurant these days that

389
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,153
ordinary people like to go to?

390
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,020
Sorry?

391
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,333
A restaurant where you can
talk over important things.

392
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,653
There's this really
hot barbecue place

393
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:14,086
near Hapjeong-dong.

394
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,486
- Barbecue?
- Yes.

395
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,353
While the meat's grilling,

396
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:21,086
order a glass of soju, and
that just sets the mood.

397
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:19,633
(The mood)

398
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,686
Oh, and they also make
fried rice with kimchi afterward,

399
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:22,500
(I'M Kimchi)

400
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:25,666
and that is a must!

401
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
(Proud)

402
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,853
Maybe not that,
but somewhere that's more special,

403
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,353
but still ordinary.

404
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,953
Ordinary, but special...
Ordinary, but special...

405
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,020
Oh!

406
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,086
Then how about that
special barbecue place

407
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,033
near Gangnam station?

408
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:49,053
They have a whole set with
all the intestines you can find!

409
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,186
This place serves up
all those rare parts that

410
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,200
you won't find elsewhere.

411
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,386
Anything other than
animal intestines?

412
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:01,733
Sorry? Well...

413
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,566
Well, uh...

414
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,800
- Forget it.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,053
Good morning, Mr. Lee.

416
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,453
Is Mr. Park inside?

417
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:26,900
Yes, he's inside.

418
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,233
(President Park Yu-sik)

419
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,653
He's not inside.

420
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:35,966
Then where did he go?

421
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:40,900
How would I know?

422
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,066
Now where did he go...

423
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:48,033
Tsk.

424
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:56,866
Uh...

425
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:02,253
There's something I'd like to ask.

426
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,753
Yes, please go ahead.

427
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,820
What's the hottest restaurant that

428
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,620
ordinary people like to
go these days?

429
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,286
A trendy spot that's
frequented by young women.

430
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:11,900
Young women?

431
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,453
Did you get a girlfriend?

432
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,233
No, it's not like that...

433
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,253
I'm thinking of
a new franchise project,

434
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,053
and our target are women
in their 20s and 30s.

435
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,766
Oh...

436
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:25,453
Oh, I have a place in mind!

437
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,053
Let me show you the photo.

438
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:30,086
I went there yesterday and
took photos for social media!

439
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:33,733
What the young women are
into these days, is...

440
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,700
- ...Spicy chicken feet!
- Ugh.

441
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,520
If that's not to your taste, then...

442
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,900
spicy chicken wings?

443
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,366
Forget it.

444
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,333
But this place is nice.

445
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,866
Mr. Yang, do you know any
restaurants that women might like?

446
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,633
Actually, like you would.

447
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,286
Chef Raymon's restaurant in
Sinsa-dong,

448
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,500
and Chef Kim Won-seok's
restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.

449
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,633
They're the top trending places.

450
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,933
Ji-ah?

451
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,686
Let's go to that meeting with
the Planning Division.

452
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:20,933
Ah, yes.

453
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,353
Wow!

454
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,253
Mr. Lee...

455
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,686
He's always so dazzling,

456
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:33,400
and so sexy when he's working.

457
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:45,786
Don't you think he is, Ms. Kim?

458
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:46,753
Well...

459
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,233
Maybe it's because
I always see him, but...

460
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,133
- Oh. Let's go.
- I'll be back!

461
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:24,853
(An ordinary but a special place)

462
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:26,400
(that's great for
love confessions)

463
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,000
(A special place to
make love confessions)

464
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,700
Perfect!

465
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,720
Oh man.

466
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,133
We won't be able to rest until
the Art Center is open.

467
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,653
Hello.

468
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:51,066
Oh, hello.

469
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,066
Uh, you've rice...

470
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,433
Then...

471
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:18,553
I hear he has 10 exact same suits,

472
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,120
and he just rotates them around!

473
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,086
Because he'd rather
do more work than

474
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,120
waste time on
picking out his outfit!

475
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,566
Unbelievable!

476
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,320
Alright.

477
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,100
That stain is
so from the rice grain.

478
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,753
If he had ten suits,
then he has enough for every day.

479
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,066
Are they sure about him
and his ten suits?

480
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,500
Oh, sorry.

481
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,920
Shall we start, then?

482
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,833
- Yes, please.
- Alright.

483
00:35:57,433 --> 00:35:58,566
Shall we?

484
00:36:01,566 --> 00:36:02,600
Yes, Mom.

485
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,053
What, a blind date for
marriage again?

486
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,420
What does he do?

487
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,820
Do you have his photo?

488
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,533
Send it to me, quick. Alright.

489
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,286
Thank you.

490
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:14,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

491
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:22,986
What is that?

492
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,653
It fell off from
Mr. Koh Gui-nam's suit.

493
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,320
Woo-hoo, score!

494
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,886
I'm going to use this as an
excuse to ask him out for dinner.

495
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:31,353
Just give it to him now.

496
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,320
He'll be in trouble
without that button.

497
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,953
Because it looks like
he has just one suit.

498
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:37,320
What, that again?

499
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,953
Don't create rumors about him
having just one suit!

500
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,653
I'm not, this is the fact!

501
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,053
He had a rice grain stuck on
his suit for two days,

502
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,620
(day-1 Rice grain)

503
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,433
(day-2 At same place, Same grain of rice)

504
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,586
and while it looks like that
rice grain is off now,

505
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,286
the stain's still there.

506
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:48,833
(A trace of getting rid of it)

507
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:51,600
Which means he wears the
same suit for a whole week.

508
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,133
Sherlock Holmes, are you?

509
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,153
I'm telling you,
he has ten of the same suit!

510
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,553
One.

511
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,153
Ten!

512
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:06,653
He has just one.

513
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:07,620
You two, just stop.

514
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,853
So what if he has just
one suit or ten suits?

515
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:10,986
Is that so important?

516
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:13,486
Well, I guess you can say that.

517
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:16,653
After all, you're so competent
when you don't have many clothes.

518
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:17,653
- Sorry?
- That blouse.

519
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:20,366
You wore that last Wednesday
and Friday, right?

520
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,086
That blouse.

521
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,420
You wore that
last Wednesday and Friday.

522
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,353
Someone might mistake it for
our company's uniform.

523
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:33,120
Yes, and you wore it
last, last Thursday, too.

524
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,220
Hey.

525
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,720
And last, last Tuesday...

526
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,353
Stop it.

527
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,053
Does it matter
what you wear, anyway?

528
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,433
Why does everyone
care so much about clothes?

529
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,786
Ji-ah, pour that water, quick.

530
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:43,900
Alright.

531
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:47,700
Ah!

532
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:03,820
Did you say the dinner with
the CEO of UK was tonight?

533
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,633
Yes, at 6 p.m.

534
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:09,120
It looks like the CEO has
something to say to me,

535
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,453
so no need to
accompany me tonight.

536
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:14,786
- Yes, sir. Then I'll...
- What about 8 p.m.?

537
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,100
Sorry?

538
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,266
Let's have a glass of wine.

539
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,533
I have something to say.

540
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:30,733
Something to say?

541
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,920
Then I'll book the
Illusion Hotel lounge

542
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,653
that we recently acquired.

543
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,020
So you can also
check it out on the way.

544
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,986
No.

545
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:48,020
I already booked elsewhere.

546
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,586
Sorry?

547
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,833
You made a booking yourself?

548
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:43,686
Excuse me.

549
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:44,833
Ah, yes.

550
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,386
Can I try this on?

551
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:48,653
Oh, sorry.

552
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,666
We're out of size S.

553
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:52,966
But you can make an order.

554
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,386
It's alright, then.
I need it right now, so...

555
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:58,120
- Oh, right now?
- Yes.

556
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,400
Going on a date, are you?

557
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:03,966
A date?

558
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,866
No, it's nothing like that.

559
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,300
It's okay, I can look myself.

560
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,186
Yes, Morpheus.

561
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:27,053
Are you off work?
What are you up to?

562
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,986
I have an appointment, so...

563
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,986
Really? Where?

564
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:32,686
At the M Hotel Lounge.

565
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:33,720
Hey.

566
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,353
I just happened to be
around there.

567
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,286
Can I see you for a second?

568
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,120
Right now's a bit...

569
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,020
Like I told you,
I have an appointment.

570
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,153
I wanted to give you
my answer for your proposal.

571
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:47,720
Don't blame me if I end up
changing my mind.

572
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,953
Wait!

573
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:50,853
But I don't have much time.

574
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,420
Just 10 minutes,

575
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,120
don't feel so pressured.

576
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,700
Alright.

577
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:07,786
The Dom Perignon Limited Edition
you asked for, sir.

578
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,066
Please serve it with
the cake later.

579
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,300
A champagne's a must when
there's a reason to celebrate.

580
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,233
Ms. Kim,

581
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:23,120
congratulations!

582
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,653
For being the only woman

583
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,366
who'll receive my ordinary,
yet wholehearted confession.

584
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:33,000
Looks like she'll be here soon.

585
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,400
Huh? Morpheus!

586
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:50,553
Wow.

587
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,400
You were stunning before,
but even more so now.

588
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,920
Looks like it's
an important date today?

589
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,100
Sorry?

590
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,533
Well, uh...

591
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,920
I know this isn't something
we should discuss right here,

592
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,820
but I have no time, so...

593
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,786
So, did you make up your mind?

594
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:10,786
Yes.

595
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:13,453
I thought I'd take your word
and give it a go.

596
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:14,833
Really?

597
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,386
Thank you so much!

598
00:42:17,466 --> 00:42:20,033
This is why I wanted to see you,
because I knew you'd be happy.

599
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:22,700
Oh.

600
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,333
(Once in a Lifetime)

601
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,653
Huh? Isn't this your new book
that's coming up next week?

602
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:31,853
It's for you.

603
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,420
As token of our new partnership.

604
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,100
Wow, thank you.

605
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:39,653
If you open it, you'll have
more reasons to thank me.

606
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:41,133
I even signed it for you.

607
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:44,820
(A meeting that began
with coincidence)

608
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,266
(might just be fate
Lee Sung-yeon)

609
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Mr. Lee!

610
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:02,766
Mr. Lee, what was that for?

611
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,453
Will you please explain
your actions just now?

612
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:15,120
Why don't you do the explaining?

613
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,766
About that situation just now.

614
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,920
That was the Morpheus,
the novelist.

615
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,953
He came to say yes to
a proposal I made

616
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,766
about a book concert at
our new art center.

617
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:25,953
Since when did this
project go ahead?

618
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:27,420
I mentioned it to you last time.

619
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,953
About inviting
a bestselling author

620
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:30,920
for our library's opening event.

621
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,886
Is that the bestselling author

622
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:33,986
- you were talking about?
- Yes.

623
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:36,086
Then why did you
never report this to me?

624
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:39,586
I thought it was meaningless to,
unless I was sure.

625
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,886
Don't.

626
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:41,886
Sorry?

627
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:43,733
- But why...
- Just don't.

628
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:46,353
May I ask why?

629
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:49,066
Do I have to make you understand
every little thing?

630
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,766
If I say no, it's a no.

631
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:05,966
If this is nothing urgent,
then can I hear it next time?

632
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,366
Fine. It wasn't anything
important anyway.

633
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:19,200
Then I'll get going, sir.

634
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:48,553
Are you alright?

635
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:49,520
Sorry.

636
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,033
I'm fine.

637
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:53,000
I got my hopes up
and only hurt myself.

638
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,353
What's this?

639
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:01,966
You asking to see me?

640
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:08,953
What are you planning?

641
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,320
Just.

642
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,586
Thought I should
contribute to the company.

643
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:14,586
What?

644
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,620
Apparently, me stepping forward
will be a great help.

645
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,133
Mi-so said so.

646
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:27,120
What's with that expression?

647
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,620
Don't tell me...

648
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,053
...Are you scared?

649
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:34,020
That you'll lose Mi-so to me?

650
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,020
No way.

651
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,053
I don't think so.

652
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:42,300
If you're so scared,
then should I just refuse?

653
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:46,120
No.

654
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,153
Go for it.

655
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:49,186
What?

656
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:50,286
It doesn't concern me,

657
00:46:50,366 --> 00:46:51,786
whether you do it or not.

658
00:46:51,866 --> 00:46:56,320
If you think this project will
influence the company or Ms. Kim

659
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,133
in any way, then you're
overestimating yourself.

660
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,533
Because you're not capable.

661
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,853
Ms. Kim.

662
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:45,300
I had my reason yesterday for
getting mad at you.

663
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:51,653
Ms. Kim.

664
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:53,453
If you apologize to me for
getting mad at me,

665
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:55,200
then I might just forgive you.

666
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,053
Ms. Kim.

667
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:00,366
I'm sor...

668
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:13,420
I might as well as
go escort her, right?

669
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,353
Then let me wait outside.

670
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:17,500
Young-joon, you!

671
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:24,353
As token of our new partnership.

672
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:25,853
Wow, thank you.

673
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:27,786
If you open it, you'll have
more reasons to thank me.

674
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,366
I even signed it for you.

675
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,953
Mr. Lee is here.

676
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:47,900
Good morning, Mr. Lee.

677
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:53,986
He said good morning yesterday,

678
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:55,353
so is today
a bad morning, or what?

679
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,620
Right. He's a bit
different from last time.

680
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,453
It's been a while,
you and your frivolous act.

681
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:00,800
What is it this time?

682
00:49:02,633 --> 00:49:06,453
I got big news once again!

683
00:49:06,533 --> 00:49:08,733
Gather around, if you think
you can handle it.

684
00:49:09,266 --> 00:49:11,033
- Come on, gather around!
- Oh, what is it?

685
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:12,986
Listen to this.

686
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:16,000
For our library's opening event,

687
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:20,120
we're going to have
a book concert with Morpheus!

688
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,853
- What?
- No way.

689
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:22,953
Just empty rumors again, huh?

690
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:24,286
Why won't you believe me?

691
00:49:24,366 --> 00:49:25,453
- Geez.
- But I just...

692
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,353
- Mr. Jung.
- Yes?

693
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:29,320
Where did you hear that?

694
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,786
From Marketing.

695
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:33,420
Mr. Lee told them
himself, apparently.

696
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,220
To prepare the
press release materials.

697
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,400
What?

698
00:49:58,066 --> 00:49:59,920
The book concert with Morpheus.

699
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,300
Is it true you gave a go on it?

700
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,266
It's true.

701
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,486
May I ask why, all of a sudden,

702
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:21,466
when you said it's a firm no
only yesterday?

703
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,386
Oh,

704
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:28,186
but there's no reason for you to
explain every detail for me.

705
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:29,500
Isn't that right?

706
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:35,800
Then please don't
cross the line from now on.

707
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,653
To be honest, I...

708
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:41,153
I misunderstood some things.

709
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:42,786
After the marriage proposals
and asking me out,

710
00:50:42,866 --> 00:50:45,133
and your sudden change of
attitude, I thought maybe...

711
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,933
...That you meant it.

712
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:51,920
Ms. Kim...

713
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,266
Don't...

714
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:56,033
...Shake me up again.

715
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,620
Exactly!

716
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,333
It's Mr. Koh Gui-nam!

717
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:21,286
Oh no.

718
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:23,486
I forgot to bring that
button from yesterday.

719
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:25,820
You need to
give it back to him, quick!

720
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,820
That's his only suit,
so it'll be hard for him.

721
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,353
Ji-ah, aren't you obstinate?

722
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:31,086
Why do you keep on saying
he has just one suit?

723
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,800
Because there are clear evidence...

724
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,986
How about a bet?

725
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:38,520
Since he lost that
button yesterday,

726
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,120
I bet his jacket is
missing a button.

727
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,953
Why?

728
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,720
Because he only has one suit.

729
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,700
I think I should clear that up.

730
00:51:46,766 --> 00:51:48,300
Hello.

731
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:50,720
Have a look.

732
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,633
See if there's
a button that's missing.

733
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:55,020
Uh...

734
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,353
Alright, here's four.

735
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:58,686
And here's four.
And here's two.

736
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:01,220
And one each,
on the inner pockets.

737
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,300
And...

738
00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:05,533
I even have spare buttons!

739
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,186
I have all my buttons.

740
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:10,620
I'm sorry. I made a big mistake...

741
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,086
How about I buy you a drink to
apologize for my colleague?

742
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,533
It's alright.

743
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,020
But please refrain from

744
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,733
making up rumors from now on.

745
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:20,820
I'm sorry.

746
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,453
Instead of rumors,
how about just beer?

747
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:24,520
If you're not into beer,
then soju?

748
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,353
Or makgeolli?

749
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:27,553
Ugh!

750
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:28,786
What did I tell you?

751
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:30,666
I told you to
stop playing detective!

752
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:54,653
Looks like she's quite mad.

753
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:56,066
What should I do?

754
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,553
Ugh, my head.

755
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,666
I have a headache...

756
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,320
Hello, Dr. Park?

757
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,320
Mr. Lee has a headache.

758
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,786
Can he come in for
an appointment at 10...

759
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:33,253
No, it's not that bad.

760
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,986
He says it's not that bad.

761
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:36,433
Yes, doctor.

762
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:15,686
I sent the opening speech for
the welfare center opening

763
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:18,033
to your e-mail. Please check.

764
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:24,866
It seems my tie's loose...

765
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:47,333
Ms. Kim!

766
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:52,820
I have big news, once again!

767
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,853
What?

768
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:58,366
While talking with Marketing about
the book concert with Morpheus,

769
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:01,000
I heard something unbelievable!

770
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:03,166
Ms. Kim.

771
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:07,053
Do you think you'll be
able to handle it?

772
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:08,253
I'll try my best.

773
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:09,920
Don't be shocked.

774
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,953
But Morpheus is...

775
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:13,600
...He's Mr. Lee's older brother!

776
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:17,800
What?

777
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:19,120
Is this true?

778
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,753
Yes, it's true!
Of course it's the truth!

779
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:24,653
Morpheus was the elder son of
Yumyung Group...

780
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:29,600
Now isn't that big news?

781
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:36,020
Well, I remembered you
asking me about Mr. Lee's brother,

782
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,666
so I ran here to tell you!

783
00:55:42,566 --> 00:55:45,766
The eldest son that's been missing
has finally appeared...

784
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:49,686
Maybe that means
looks like they'll be

785
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:52,600
some shifts to the
company succession plans?

786
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,453
I quarreled a lot
with my brother's friends.

787
00:56:04,533 --> 00:56:07,986
They'd pick on me,
saying I was an arrogant brat.

788
00:56:08,066 --> 00:56:11,953
But at least you were with
your brother, thank goodness!

789
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,300
No.

790
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:15,386
He was worse.

791
00:56:15,466 --> 00:56:17,700
A total jerk, he was.

792
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,533
It seemed like things weren't
good with his brother.

793
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,453
What?

794
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:26,733
How to say sorry?

795
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,953
How is that so hard?

796
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,253
Just say, 'Sorry!'

797
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,033
Do you know what
'sorry' is in Spanish?

798
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,486
It's 'Lo Siento.'

799
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:40,953
Try saying it.

800
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:43,033
Lo... Lo Si...

801
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,666
Oh, forget it.

802
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:47,820
Doesn't really
roll off your tongue, right?

803
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,286
Because you've never said it.

804
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,386
That's what the word
'sorry' is like to me.

805
00:56:52,466 --> 00:56:54,553
I've never said it.

806
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:56,286
Oh!

807
00:56:56,366 --> 00:56:58,053
Or is there a way to
patch up relationships

808
00:56:58,133 --> 00:57:01,086
without saying sorry?

809
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,766
No.

810
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:06,466
Then...

811
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:09,920
What if I never say it?

812
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,866
Then you'll lose this person.

813
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:25,600
Ms. Kim.

814
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:48,166
Did you have something to...

815
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,800
I...

816
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,086
I apologize.

817
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,266
Huh?

818
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:04,300
I'm sorry.

819
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:10,786
No, I'm sorry.

820
00:59:10,866 --> 00:59:13,753
You're not someone to
get mad without any reason,

821
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,633
and I took it too personally.

822
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:27,520
But please understand..

823
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,833
That I did it, all for you.

824
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:36,666
Even I know that much.

825
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,686
To apologize,

826
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:33,353
I'd like to take you to dinner
at a nice restaurant.

827
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:35,553
But there's just so many
things to be done right now.

828
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:36,866
I'm fine.

829
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:38,920
Of course you should be.

830
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,220
It was because I was too
preoccupied with you.

831
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,433
What?

832
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:10,220
Would you like some coffee?

833
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,300
- I have one right here.
- Oh.

834
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,786
Should I open the window?
It's getting hot.

835
01:01:15,866 --> 01:01:17,800
- It's already open.
- You're right.

836
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,100
Ms. Kim.

837
01:01:39,633 --> 01:01:40,900
Yes?

838
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,800
Earlier on...

839
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:50,286
You told me not to
shake you up anymore.

840
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:53,200
Yes, well...

841
01:01:58,866 --> 01:02:00,000
Well...

842
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:08,166
I want to shake you up.

843
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:11,886
Sorry?

844
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:13,900
Well, that's...

845
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,466
Ms. Kim.

846
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,366
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?)

847
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:49,953
It sounds like
sexual desire disorder.

848
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:51,520
Sexual... what?

849
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,420
You've got it wrong!
It's not like that.

850
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,086
- Ugh, that Mr. Lee.
- Did you call me?

851
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,733
Give me a chance to
make things up.

852
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,600
How much does this machine cost?

853
01:04:04,766 --> 01:04:07,953
I think I was trapped in
an empty house for a week.

854
01:04:08,033 --> 01:04:11,000
Next to me was a boy...

855
01:04:12,366 --> 01:04:14,633
You were right beside me,
all this time...
