00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,800
(A legendary secretary)

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,267
(Brother)

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
(Friends)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,233
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?)

7
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,066
Mr. Lee.

8
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,366
You need to get ready for work.

9
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,266
I didn't know that shirt
was so dangerous.

10
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,100
Dangerous?

11
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:29,000
It could almost have the board
fire me for

12
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:31,600
neglecting my duties.

13
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,433
You look too beautiful in it that
I don't want to go to work.

14
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,733
It's testing my patience
and restraint.

15
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,733
These days I wonder

16
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,000
if you're really the person
I've known all this time.

17
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,300
What does that mean?

18
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,500
That I like you even more.

19
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:18,333
Still, you need to
get ready for work.

20
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:36,233
(Episode 14)

21
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,700
Thank you for breakfast.

22
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,766
Here.

23
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,067
Until now, I boasted perfection in

24
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,400
appearance, wealth and competence.

25
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:11,200
And here I am, about to
try my hand in consideration too,

26
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,733
so why won't you accept it?

27
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,900
What do you mean?

28
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,734
This salad just now.

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,700
It was for you.

30
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,766
Oh, really?

31
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,766
Your kindness has gone
off the chart these days.

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,167
I want you to give me chances to

33
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,233
look after you sometimes.

34
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,766
It's still a bit awkward.

35
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,834
I guess it comes with my work.

36
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,433
It's become a habit to
always look after others first.

37
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,200
It comes with my work too,

38
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,734
getting used to
have people around me

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,366
serve me.

40
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,133
Still, I…

41
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,033
I'm making an effort, like this.

42
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,833
For you, Mi-so.

43
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,534
Of course, I understand that
it's hard for you to

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,933
make me do anything
since I am born to be served.

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,400
Still, I want you to ask me to
do this and that,

46
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:06,400
including asking me for help.

47
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,066
I'm saying I'll allow that,
especially.

48
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,033
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:20,733
But your face is saying,
'No sir, I won't have that.'

50
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,434
- When are your dates, Ms. Bong?
- I'll take these.

51
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,566
- 28th, 29th, 30th. Perfect!
- They do sound good.

52
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,767
What are you doing?

53
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,300
Oh, planning out
the summer holidays.

54
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,834
Gui-nam, you already have your
dates set from Planning, right?

55
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,966
When are you going on your break?

56
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,334
I don't go on holidays.

57
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,267
Going to bed after
a hard day's work.

58
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,666
Any more breaks than that
are unnecessary.

59
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,966
Well, you seem to say things
that are unnecessary

60
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,733
Good morning, sir.

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,900
Ms. Kim!

62
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:16,500
Will you not be taking days off
this summer again?

63
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey, Ms. Kim won't need to
go on a summer holiday.

64
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,933
She'll be leaving soon, anyway.

65
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,500
Right. Being a SKY graduate,

66
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,134
from my brilliant memories

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,000
she has about a week to go
before she leaves.

68
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,400
Oh, that's right.

69
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,167
Ah, that's too bad.

70
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm really sorry to hear that.

71
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,633
I'd forgotten about it
for a while.

72
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,100
That I'll be leaving very soon.

73
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,867
We've worked together for
nine years!

74
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:04,800
You were my hands and feet from
when I first started until now,

75
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,200
so if you're to quit
so suddenly like this, I…

76
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:10,733
I?

77
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,166
Well, it'll be so
inconvenient for me!

78
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,800
He'll probably try to
stop me again.

79
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,800
Maybe even more so now since
he's in the bulldozer mode.

80
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,434
Hi.

81
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,834
Oh, I just got the contract from
our strategy department.

82
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,333
Thanks for that.

83
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
This is the final contract

84
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,200
after the final negotiations
in Paris.

85
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,500
Legal team has reviewed it,

86
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,534
and additional clauses
were included

87
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,133
so that they cannot request
another re-negotiation.

88
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,366
That was beautifully done.

89
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:59,267
Just like my face. Do you agree?

90
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,500
I do.

91
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,167
What's my schedule like for lunch?

92
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,800
Today you'll be
visiting the restaurant

93
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,066
that your acquaintance has
recently opened.

94
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,033
Then why don't you join me?

95
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,967
Me?

96
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,000
I want to introduce my friend
to you, too.

97
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,400
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,500
Wow, so many unique and
pretty restaurants.

99
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,334
You're right.

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,500
When I heard this was
your acquaintance,

101
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,534
I'd imagined a big, fancy place

102
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,133
somewhere in Cheongdam-dong.

103
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,333
My friend is a bit unique.

104
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,734
And was supposed to
inherit Jinyoung Group,

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,066
but refused.

106
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,866
An heiress of Jinyoung Group?

107
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,666
Are you guys close?

108
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,267
Our parents know each other,

109
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,067
so we've been friends
since we were young.

110
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,066
We even went to the
same MBA school in the States.

111
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:53,833
You must be excited to
see your friend in a long time.

112
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,000
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,600
Ah, there my friend is.

114
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,666
Young-joon!

115
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,834
How have you been?

116
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,133
It's been such a long time!

117
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,500
You look like
you're doing much better.

118
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,500
No, I've always
been like this. Always.

119
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,133
Whatever.

120
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,534
When he first said acquaintance,

121
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,067
I thought it'd be a man,

122
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,500
but it's a woman.

123
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,200
And this is?

124
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,733
Oh. My girlfriend.

125
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,133
Girlfriend?

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,233
Hello, I'm Kim Mi-so.

127
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,534
I'm Jung Yu-mi.

128
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,234
I've been friends with
Young-joon since we were five,

129
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,600
and it's the first time
he's introduced his girlfriend,

130
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,366
so I'm kind of speechless.

131
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,700
Wow, you're so pretty!

132
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,267
Of course.

133
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,167
She's a perfect fit for
my perfect appearance.

134
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,533
And you're still
as narcissistic as ever.

135
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,166
Do you still do that thing?
'Aura!'

136
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,400
I don't do it
so frivolously like that.

137
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,767
'My aura!'

138
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,266
It's done with dignity.

139
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,334
It makes me laugh
every time I see you do it.

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,900
Don't you agree? Isn't this funny?

141
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:22,966
Yes, well…

142
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:27,833
I see. So he's done it in front of
other women, too.

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,900
Well, let's go in.

144
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Please go ahead,
before they turn cold.

145
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Thank you for the meal.

146
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,933
I'm so glad you have a girlfriend.

147
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,733
I was starting to get worried that

148
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,166
maybe you'd fallen for me instead.

149
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,767
Why worry about something

150
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,433
based on groundless assumptions?

151
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,533
Hey, you even asked me to
marry you once.

152
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,900
Oh, that was when we were five.

153
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,600
Oh, I see.

154
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,566
I see you two have
a lot of memories together.

155
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,134
Excuse me,
can we have more pickles?

156
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,733
Sure, one moment.

157
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,033
It's getting a bit chilly in here.

158
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,766
What's with that look?

159
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,366
What about my look?

160
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,167
With me in front of you,

161
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,400
you should have
a big smile on your face

162
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,133
but instead you're all stiff.

163
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,433
That's just your misunderstanding.

164
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,034
By the way, Mr. Lee.

165
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,966
I guess you were
more open when you were little.

166
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,400
Why do you say that?

167
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:57,000
You asked her to marry you,
when you were just five?

168
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,700
Or maybe… I should say loose?

169
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:07,066
You also asked me to marry you
when you were five!

170
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,500
Ha! Like that puts me
on the same level as you!

171
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,000
I said that
out of my innocent feelings

172
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,900
because I was so grateful for
you having rescued me.

173
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,200
Whereas you… You just…

174
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,367
You were just flirting with girls.

175
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:20,633
Flirting?

176
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,766
Ms. Kim, are you jealous?

177
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,833
What? Jealous?

178
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,033
Do you think I'm a kid?
That's ridiculous.

179
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,766
No way.

180
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:52,734
I thought I asked you to

181
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
give me chances to look after you.

182
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm still not used to it.

183
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:07,733
Can you open this for me?

184
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,967
Pay me if you're going to
make me do work.

185
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,400
I earn millions per hour,

186
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,666
so my rates are millions per hour.

187
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:19,500
What? Just open it
before I smack you!

188
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,233
So? Do you think
my place will be alright?

189
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:46,366
Well, I say you'll be able to
pay your rent just fine.

190
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,066
That's a huge compliment, right?

191
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:55,234
Wait a moment.

192
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
You must really love
your girlfriend.

193
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,934
I can see love in your eyes.

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,034
Really? I used to be
just handsome,

195
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,700
but I guess there's now
love in my face, too.

196
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,467
You…!

197
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,766
Anyway, you look happy.

198
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,533
That should be my line.

199
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,133
Is it because you're doing
something you want to?

200
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,266
To be honest, it was stressful
inheriting the company.

201
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,100
I kept thinking that

202
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,700
this wasn't the life
I wanted to live.

203
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,767
Though others would

204
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,300
probably never
understand my decision,

205
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,767
it made me satisfied.

206
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,134
I really am happy,

207
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,700
doing what I want to do
and living my own life.

208
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,833
Young-joon, open this for me.
Come on, open it!

209
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:06,466
Can you open this for me, oppa?

210
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,400
What… What did you just say?

211
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:21,666
I said, can you
open this for me, oppa.

212
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Wait.

213
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,533
Say that one more time
so I can record it.

214
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,700
I need to record this.

215
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,800
You said you wanted to
look after me, too.

216
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,833
So I'm giving you a chance now.

217
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,333
You said you're not used to this.

218
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,400
Well, I need to keep trying
so I can get used to it, won't I?

219
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,033
Oh, and that "aura" thing.

220
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,600
Don't ever do that in front of me.

221
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,900
Because it's not fun anymore.

222
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,400
I really want to save this.

223
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,900
- Save what?
- This you, right now.

224
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,234
I've never even desired
those famous masterpieces,

225
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,434
but I really want to keep your
jealous face all to myself.

226
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,033
Ha! What? I'm not jealous.

227
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:11,600
Why are you laughing?

228
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,534
Because you're so cute,
when you're jealous.

229
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,566
Jealous? Ha…

230
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:17,834
Ball of jealousy.

231
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,467
- Whatever!
- Jealous bulldozer.

232
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:20,733
I said, I'm not!

233
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,100
Come on.

234
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,066
Jealous? Ha…

235
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,566
That bag… It looks heavy.

236
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,066
Want oppa to carry it?

237
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,766
What are you trying?

238
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,066
You look like you're tired, Mi-so.

239
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,033
Want oppa to carry you?

240
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,600
Please just stop.

241
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,433
Oh no!

242
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,367
You look like
you're really angry, Mi-so.

243
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,733
Want oppa to make you
feel all better?

244
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,934
I guess I said some
unnecessary things.

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,633
Please just stick to your old ways.

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,266
Mi-so, wait for oppa!

247
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,366
(Once in a Lifetime)

248
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,467
This is so nice, going shopping
with my eldest son

249
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,900
in a long time.

250
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,000
I had fun too, Mom.

251
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:35,766
Oh my.

252
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,667
Looks like your father was
reading your novel.

253
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,600
Oh. But seems like he fell asleep
after turning a few pages.

254
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,200
Tsk, that means he was
pretty immersed in it.

255
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,600
See, he hardly lasts
more than 5 pages.

256
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,900
Then how did he ever
run our group?

257
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,167
It's a mystery.

258
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:01,466
That's why, out of all the
presidents, he's…

259
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,566
- Shhh.
- Shhh!

260
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,200
Mr. Yang,

261
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:23,733
what is it?

262
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:26,534
If you have time tonight,

263
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,833
why don't we go see that musical?

264
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:31,367
I got tickets for
"Phantom of the Ball."

265
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,534
Wow! I've always
wanted to see that.

266
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,534
That's why I clicked away like mad

267
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,266
to try get us good seats.

268
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:43,534
Mr. Yang, you always save me,

269
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,800
and this time you
got me tickets, too?

270
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,466
You're always such a superhero.

271
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,100
Mr. Yang, you're my hero!

272
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,733
My very cute hero!

273
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,934
Ugh, it's so hot!

274
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Why do you insist on
taking the stairs, huh?

275
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,100
You better watch it!
Do that one more time,

276
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,100
and your cheeks…

277
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,733
I'll rip them apart! Got it?

278
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,933
Oh man.

279
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,634
That's scaring the crap out of me.

280
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,833
I mean, what…

281
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,934
What did he do so wrong now, huh?

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,167
I know, right?

283
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,334
If there was a counseling center
for violence here,

284
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,767
I say this is
something we should report.

285
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,667
This is between us,

286
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:29,200
so please just
mind your own business.

287
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Yes, it was all my mistake.

288
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,300
Well, alright.

289
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:41,200
But if you ever want to
talk to me about something…

290
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:43,200
Or want a drink…
Just say so, alright?

291
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,233
Ms. Bong, be more gentle!

292
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,700
I'm so sorry.

293
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,867
Dating my colleague is no problem,

294
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:58,300
but I wanted to
keep it a secret, so…

295
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:00,866
Are you alright?

296
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,166
That hurt, right?

297
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,566
It's alright.

298
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,666
But though my cheeks are fine,
my heart isn't.

299
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,100
I mean, must you really do this?

300
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:23,566
Oh no…

301
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,666
My hero!

302
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,233
That temper of yours!

303
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,133
Goodbye, sir.

304
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,466
Mr. Lee has been going home
on his own lately.

305
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,300
Right? At this rate,

306
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,666
Mr. Yang will be out of work!

307
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,634
Hey, don't say that!

308
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,134
Do you know how much my Mr. Yang

309
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,133
does for this company?

310
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,433
What's with the "my" Mr. Yang?

311
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,666
Well, uh…

312
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:17,067
He's my colleague,

313
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,533
and not someone in
some other department, right?

314
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,566
Can't I say that,
when we're both in the same team?

315
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,400
Right, "my" Mr. Park?

316
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,967
Oh what?

317
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:30,900
Just then you were
almost beating him up

318
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,233
and now you're all protective?

319
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,366
You know me, I don't hold grudges.

320
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,000
Then please excuse me.

321
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:47,233
Man, I can never figure out
that Ms. Bong.

322
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:50,634
Mr. Yang, you had it
pretty tough just then.

323
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,767
So how about a drink…

324
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,533
No, I'm fine, sir.

325
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,467
I see.

326
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:57,533
Then how about…

327
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,933
It's alright, sir.

328
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,433
To the hospital to
see your father, is it?

329
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:07,934
Yes.

330
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,600
But I could've just caught a bus.

331
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,734
No, since you're tired,

332
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,934
you should just let
oppa drive you.

333
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,266
- Please stop.
- Alright.

334
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,334
Will you be staying at
the hospital all night?

335
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,934
No, today is Mal-hee's turn

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,733
and I'm just dropping by to
see him.

337
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,334
You and my sisters-in-law…

338
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,566
You're doing so much for
my father-in-law.

339
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:34,700
Sister-in-law? Father-in-law?

340
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,466
Of course.

341
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,066
Aren't you going to marry me?

342
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,266
Don't tell me, that
you're not serious with me!

343
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,700
Don't say that.

344
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,066
But uh…

345
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,967
Will it be alright, marrying me?

346
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:52,967
Don't you already have a fiancee

347
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,667
since when you were five?

348
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:56,467
Why don't you stop, too?

349
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes, sir.

350
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,100
You could've just dropped me off.

351
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,066
I said, I'll stay with you
a little longer.

352
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
So…

353
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,666
You're still not going to
introduce me to your father?

354
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,233
Oh… I think it's too
early for that, so…

355
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,867
But I'll try to find time
once he's discharged…

356
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,266
Mi-so!

357
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:27,800
Dad!

358
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,366
Wait…

359
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,100
Oh my, I'm so sorry.

360
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,366
Dad?

361
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,566
Um, hello.

362
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:38,766
Um, uh…

363
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:51,900
I heard a lot about you
from my daughter.

364
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:54,533
So you're the boss who

365
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,400
works my dear daughter to death

366
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,334
without even giving her a break.

367
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,466
You're that Mr. Lee bastard,
are you?

368
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,600
I mean, "Mr. Lee."

369
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,434
Yes, I'm that Mr. Lee bastard…

370
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
I mean, Mr. Lee.

371
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,733
I'm sorry for the
delayed introduction.

372
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,400
Well, uh…

373
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:18,066
Thank you for this fancy room.

374
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:22,834
I take it it's all thanks to
my daughter's hard work,

375
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,666
so I'll accept it gladly.

376
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,267
Of course. And please,
no need for honorifics.

377
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,134
Oh no, I can't do that
to my daughter's boss.

378
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,500
No, you can really be
more comfortable with me.

379
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:33,734
No, I can't do that.

380
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,933
Please, you can.

381
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:40,434
I apologize for
informing you like this,

382
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,633
but…

383
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,200
I am seeing your daughter.

384
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,566
What?

385
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,434
By "seeing" her,

386
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,834
do you mean that kind of seeing?

387
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,267
Dad, what happened to
your honorifics?

388
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,766
I mean seeing,
as in a relationship.

389
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:01,100
We are in a relationship,
Father-in-law.

390
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,700
Father-in-law? Why, you…

391
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:06,033
You're blatant, aren't you?

392
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:10,267
Well, uh…

393
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,400
Let me be
direct with you too, then.

394
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
I'm…

395
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:19,033
…Against you two.

396
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,500
Hello, sir.

397
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,866
Yes, hold on.

398
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:35,766
It's Mr. Park.
He has an urgent question.

399
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,366
I'm sorry,

400
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,633
but please excuse me.

401
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,834
Dad, why are you against us?

402
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
What's your reason?

403
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:59,666
That guy, I'm liking him
more and more.

404
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,200
What? But you just said
you're against us.

405
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,233
I was just faking it.

406
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,700
I'm just acting, for your sake.

407
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,567
Just what…

408
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,167
He probably never imagined

409
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,766
our family will be against him.

410
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,600
He probably thought that
just because he's a chaebol,

411
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,334
we'd put our hands up, and…

412
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,100
…Give him a big welcome.

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,733
But I know
people like him very well.

414
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,067
Their desire to win over something

415
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:31,366
grows when they see a barrier.

416
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,634
Just you watch.

417
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,800
He'll be more desperate to
win over you now.

418
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,333
Just what are you…

419
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:45,500
Well, uh…

420
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:46,966
How about a coffee with me,
from the vending machine?

421
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,967
Yes, gladly.

422
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:51,033
Alright.

423
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:54,500
Dad…

424
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:12,866
So, how much do you
know about my Mi-so?

425
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,900
I've worked with her for 9 years,

426
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:19,433
so I know quite a bit.

427
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,700
My Mi-so, she…

428
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,366
She's a good girl,
never given me any trouble.

429
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,233
She never once complained about
wearing hand-me-downs

430
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:37,333
and always came top in class
without private lessons.

431
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:42,833
She was my youngest,
but was like my eldest.

432
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,566
The day I was conned by my friend

433
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:50,466
and we almost
ended up in the streets,

434
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,033
that day just happened to be…

435
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,400
…When Mi-so got her CSAT scores.

436
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:02,567
She could've gone to university

437
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,500
on a full scholarship, but…

438
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,033
But she refused.

439
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:11,633
Instead, she said
she'll make money.

440
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,366
Do you know what she said to me,

441
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:20,533
when I was crying out of guilt?

442
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,466
'It's alright, Dad.'

443
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,766
That's what she said to me,
with a smile.

444
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:40,500
But inside, her heart must've
ripped to pieces.

445
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,700
Even now,
whenever I see her smile…

446
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:49,933
It still pains me inside.

447
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,266
So…

448
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:57,734
Don't ever trust that
she's alright,

449
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,900
even though she's all smiles.

450
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,333
Because even in the
toughest situations,

451
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,633
she'll just smile and bear it.

452
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,166
Yes, sir. I know that very well.

453
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:17,900
So I heard she's quitting.

454
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,334
You must've worked her to death

455
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,800
for that girl to call it quits!

456
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:28,533
I…

457
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,834
Though it might be late,

458
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,533
I want Mi-so to do
what she truly wants to do

459
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,600
and be happy.

460
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,300
Wait here.

461
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,800
I'll send Mi-so down.

462
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:52,933
Yes, sir.

463
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,834
Oh. That's so you can
take her home safely.

464
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,866
It doesn't mean
I still approve of you.

465
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,200
Of course.
I'll see you again, sir.

466
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,134
What, then why are you quitting
without any plans?

467
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,733
Well, I need to
go find my life now.

468
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,900
A life that's not as
someone's secretary,

469
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,466
nor as a breadwinner.

470
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,300
Just a life as me, Kim Mi-so.

471
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:42,034
Though others would probably
never understand my decision,

472
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,200
it makes me satisfied.

473
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,267
I really am happy,

474
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,400
doing what I want to do
and living my own life.

475
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:48,433
Though…

476
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,867
Though it might be late,

477
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,566
I want Mi-so to do
what she truly wants to do

478
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,966
and be happy.

479
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:11,400
What's taking them so long?

480
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:13,133
What could they be talking about?

481
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,500
What took you so long?

482
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,133
And where's Mr. Lee?

483
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:30,300
We had a guy's talk,
that ran very deep.

484
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:34,400
But I made sure
he still hasn't lost that tension.

485
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,434
Oh. He's waiting in
the lobby downstairs.

486
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,033
You should go down.

487
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:45,766
What's with that laughter?

488
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,066
I can't believe my daughter's
dating Yumyung Group's VP!

489
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,066
You looked so serious
all throughout our drive.

490
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:15,066
You don't mean seriously handsome?

491
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:20,967
Did…

492
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,200
Did Dad say something
unnecessary to you?

493
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,134
It's not like that.

494
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,966
I just needed to
think over some things.

495
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,566
But I've made my mind up.
How about we go for a walk?

496
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,466
Shall we?

497
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,200
Ms. Kim, are you still…

498
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,400
…Set on leaving the company?

499
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,033
Yes, sir.

500
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:56,300
But what will you do
after you leave us?

501
00:31:57,033 --> 00:32:01,400
Well, I don't have
a concrete plan just yet.

502
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,534
As soon as I graduated
from high school,

503
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,967
I had no time to
think about my dreams.

504
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,933
I just sent my resume
wherever I could.

505
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:21,033
And after that, I was too busy
making money.

506
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,366
So to be honest with you,

507
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:30,833
I still don't know
what I want to do.

508
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:43,100
Then take your time,
thinking about it.

509
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,800
About what you
want to do from now.

510
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:50,366
Until now,

511
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,267
it's true that
I stopped you from leaving

512
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,466
out of my pure selfishness of

513
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,366
wanting to keep you by my side.

514
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:03,533
But I feel like
that's not necessary anymore.

515
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,634
Because whatever you're up to now,

516
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,500
you'll always still be with me.

517
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,366
Mr. Lee…

518
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:20,933
For the past nine years,

519
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,166
you were loyal, faithful,

520
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:25,100
and a perfect secretary.

521
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,200
But it's now time to let you go.

522
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:36,600
Thank you for all your hard work.

523
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,267
However, if you do
discover your dream,

524
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,566
I have to be the
first one to know, alright?

525
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,800
Because whatever it is,
I'll be rooting for you.

526
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:11,033
Yes, sir.

527
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,867
Is anyone here?

528
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:48,566
Come on, what is it this time?

529
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,167
This is top secret stuff

530
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:54,233
that really shouldn't go around!

531
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:55,733
Ha…

532
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,366
Gather around, if you think
you can handle this.

533
00:34:58,966 --> 00:34:59,800
Come on, come on!

534
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:01,734
By big news, what is it?

535
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,100
Did our stocks hit the ceiling?

536
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,166
Don't worry, Mr. Koh.

537
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:09,534
Mr. Jung always does this,

538
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,933
but nine out of ten,
they're just empty rumors.

539
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,134
It's not just a rumor this time!

540
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,566
There's even a witness!

541
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,667
That means there's ground.

542
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:20,900
Alright?

543
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
Well, uh…

544
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We have a most
unimaginable couple

545
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,266
in our very own team!

546
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,600
Please don't say it. Please!

547
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,433
As for who it is…

548
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:41,866
Please stop!

549
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:46,633
It's Mr. Lee and Ms. Kim!

550
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:50,900
Ms. Kim?

551
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:54,800
What? Is this for real?

552
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,533
- Yes.
- No way!

553
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:59,033
Who's the witness?

554
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:00,933
The new employee
in Business Management.

555
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:03,934
A few days ago,

556
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,867
she said she saw
with her own eyes,

557
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,467
Mr. Lee and Ms. Kim on a date,

558
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,834
holding their hands tight!

559
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,166
No way! Goosebumps!

560
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,600
Good morning.

561
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,166
Good morning!

562
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,933
Did something good happen?

563
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,566
Yes!

564
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,433
Because it is a good morning.

565
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,400
Well, then.

566
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:30,700
Good morning!

567
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,366
- Good morning!
- Yay!

568
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:37,000
Oh man, that was close.

569
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,167
If the rumors are true,

570
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:43,100
then if we get in her bad books…

571
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,466
…That means bad news, right?

572
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:49,466
Right. We can't ever
get in her bad books.

573
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,266
Uh, ji-ah?

574
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:57,567
Did you finish that report on
Yumyung Bio?

575
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,266
Ms. Bong and I have
a meeting soon.

576
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,733
Yes, I'll just go
get it from my desk.

577
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,567
Alright. Let's work harder!

578
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,533
- Let's do this!
- Yes, I'll work harder!

579
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,034
Here are the reports for
the opening event of

580
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,633
the new department store on
Dongseong-ro.

581
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,533
That's on the fifth, is it?

582
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,534
Yes. Would you like to

583
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,100
go down for a final check?

584
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,367
Though I don't think
it'll be necessary,

585
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,400
since Mr. Park will be
going down next week.

586
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,600
Then I'll do as you say.

587
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:35,933
Yes, sir.

588
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:45,700
What's with that look?

589
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Well,

590
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:55,800
when I think about

591
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:57,800
I won't be seeing you
anymore at work soon,

592
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,200
every moment…

593
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,000
…Becomes that much dearer.

594
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,200
Then.

595
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,400
Wait.

596
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:38,867
What do we do now?

597
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:42,000
This is what they mean by
there's no turning back.

598
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,400
We're busted, Ms. Kim.

599
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,233
If we can't avoid it,
there's just one way.

600
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,666
To take it head on.

601
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,433
What are you thinking?

602
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,100
What did I just see?

603
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,133
See? I told you so!

604
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:11,533
Please come in.

605
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:14,733
I think we should talk.

606
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:29,934
That romantic scene
you just saw now.

607
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,700
Yes, your assumptions are true.

608
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:36,366
Though this might be
an unexpected surprise,

609
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:38,734
Ms. Kim and I…

610
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,533
Yes, we're in a relationship.

611
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:45,900
Wow, congratulations!

612
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,400
Please be happy!

613
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:48,900
Wow!

614
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,266
I really didn't know.

615
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,566
Like there's a problem with that,
is there?

616
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,400
Or if there is, please say so.

617
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,966
Problem? What problem?

618
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:06,800
There's nothing like that. Do you?

619
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:11,200
No, not at all.
What about you, Ji-ah?

620
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,366
No, none at all.
What about you, Ms. Kim?

621
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,000
…Of course not.

622
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:22,334
Then…

623
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,933
Ah, yes. Please excuse us.

624
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,333
That actually makes things
a lot better.

625
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:43,200
I'm so embarrassed to ask you this

626
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:45,100
but could you keep this a secret?

627
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,266
I want just you three to know.

628
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:53,100
Well, uh… Ms. Kim…

629
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:56,900
It looks like the rumors have
spread already.

630
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,100
What? But how…

631
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:00,500
Well, uh…

632
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,934
It looks like someone saw
you two on a date.

633
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,100
So we had a hunch.

634
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,733
Oh…

635
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:16,200
Yes, Mr. Park.

636
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,033
I'm on my way with the contract.

637
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:27,534
Isn't that the Ms. Kim?

638
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,900
Yes, that's Ms. Kim.

639
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,333
Well, she is pretty.

640
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,200
Did you hear that?

641
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:43,366
The VP, going out with Ms. Kim.

642
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,600
Oh, I heard.

643
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,834
Everyone's talking about it.

644
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,733
But to be honest, I had a hunch.

645
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,600
I thought it was strange
how she became his secretary

646
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:55,466
and rose to the top when
she didn't even go to college.

647
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,466
Anyway, there was always
something between those two.

648
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:01,500
Well, I hate those girls

649
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:04,167
who have nothing to boast
except for their faces.

650
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,767
It's not like I can't
do that too, you know!

651
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,033
But that'd be stooping too low!

652
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:09,633
Excuse me!

653
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:10,800
Oh my…

654
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:11,867
You should watch your words!

655
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:13,800
Ms. Kim isn't like that at all!

656
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,400
She's right!

657
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:17,400
She's the most perfect person

658
00:42:17,466 --> 00:42:19,400
after Mr. Lee, you know!

659
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:22,200
Don't talk like that

660
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:23,633
when you don't even know her!

661
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:28,000
What's with those didactic lines

662
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:29,866
like they're straight from
a public service ad?

663
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,767
Mind your own business!

664
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,867
Who cares if we do talk
behind their backs?

665
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:36,200
Actually, you two are smart.

666
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:38,200
Already lining up to see
if you can get something

667
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:39,700
if things work out well between

668
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,166
Mr. Lee and Ms. Kim, huh?

669
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:46,267
A secretary who's trying to
seduce the VP,

670
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,467
and her colleagues who are
lining up for favors…

671
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,400
You're all the same!

672
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,734
You and your filthy mouth…

673
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,300
Hey! Watch what you're saying!

674
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:56,533
Filthy mouth?

675
00:42:57,466 --> 00:43:00,100
You want me to show you
what a filthy mouth really is?

676
00:43:10,866 --> 00:43:12,166
- Oh what?
- What?

677
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,600
Ms. Bong! Ms. Bong!

678
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,167
What's going on?

679
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:36,533
Ms. Bong! Ji-ah!

680
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:40,600
What's going on?

681
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,366
What happened?

682
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,300
Oh man…

683
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,666
Oww, ouch! Oww!

684
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm so sorry,
this is all because of me.

685
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,567
You should've just ignored it,

686
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,300
instead of wasting
your time on them.

687
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,467
But it makes me so mad!

688
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:03,966
Them talking about you,
when they know nothing.

689
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:06,700
I mean, I know better than
anyone else

690
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:08,133
how hard you've worked
at your job.

691
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:10,700
Ms. Bong's right. Ms. Kim,

692
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:11,934
you're making a grand exit

693
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,100
after all your hard service…

694
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,133
And yet all those people…

695
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:18,366
They think you're quitting
because you're getting married.

696
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,866
And I just hate that!

697
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,534
I know, right?
It's like putting a dent on

698
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,200
Ms. Kim's career of 9 years!

699
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:29,400
Anyway, thank you for
taking my side.

700
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,700
Don't mention it.

701
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:34,800
Anyway, this is why you should
never go public about

702
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,067
dating your colleague.

703
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,666
This is exactly the reason
why I'm not.

704
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:44,467
I mean…

705
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:49,700
I won't ever tell anyone
if I ever do date a colleague.

706
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:53,900
Anyway, Ms. Kim.

707
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:55,300
Why don't you
report this to Mr. Lee and

708
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:57,567
have them transfer them to
some faraway country?

709
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:58,500
Let's get our revenge!

710
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:02,734
Oh, please don't tell Mr. Lee.

711
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,633
I don't want him
minding trivial things.

712
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:09,133
It's love, is it?

713
00:45:15,033 --> 00:45:17,266
What? A catfight?

714
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,134
I heard from Ms. Seol,

715
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,866
but it looks like
the employees from your team…

716
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,233
…Had a fight with some
other female employees,

717
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:31,800
who were talking behind
Ms. Kim's back about

718
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:33,333
dating you.

719
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,166
And Ms. Kim was there too,
trying to calm them down.

720
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,833
What… Is she hurt anywhere?

721
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,933
Probably her heart.

722
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:47,434
Apparently, they said
something about

723
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,433
her flirting and seducing you.

724
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:52,167
But do people have to
say that much

725
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:54,100
about us seeing each other?

726
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:57,933
Well, people like to
talk about other people, so…

727
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,833
But how dare they, about my woman…

728
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,900
That's because she's yours.

729
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,067
Because she's the
girlfriend of Mr. CEO.

730
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:06,166
How jealous and envious
would they be now, huh?

731
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,266
How pathetic. They should just
use that time to be productive.

732
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,266
After all, that's
why I'm paying them.

733
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:15,866
Whoa, what? Where are you going?

734
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,766
To see Ms. Kim.
To make sure she's alright.

735
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,933
Well, uh…

736
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:23,033
Apparently she begged everyone.

737
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,034
She doesn't want you to know,

738
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,200
because then you'll start to
mind every trivial thing.

739
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:33,800
Then how did it come to
reach my ears?

740
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,534
Rumors are like that.

741
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,900
They go around,

742
00:46:37,966 --> 00:46:39,400
until the person in the center
of that rumor finds out

743
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:41,200
and makes him go crazy.

744
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,933
Anyway, pretend you don't know
since that's what she wants.

745
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:51,466
Because it's Ms. Kim who's
probably having the hardest time.

746
00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:53,866
I know.

747
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:56,400
That's what's driving me
even more crazy.

748
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,566
Ms. Kim.

749
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,267
Mr. Lee.

750
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,434
Get ready to go down to
Daegu, now.

751
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,833
Right now?

752
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,833
I want to do a final check
before the opening.

753
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,967
But this morning, you said
you won't go.

754
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,566
I changed my mind.
So get ready, now.

755
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,900
Hey, what happened?

756
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:44,067
Everyone's been talking about
how you got into a fight

757
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:47,333
trying to shield Ms. Kim.

758
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,233
Well, they were talking when

759
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:53,333
they knew nothing about Ms. Kim!

760
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,500
they knew nothing about Ms. Kim!

761
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,966
I couldn't hold back anymore,

762
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,400
so Ji-ah and I
told them otherwise!

763
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:06,233
Wow, you two are so loyal.

764
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,167
Right? You two are amazing!

765
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,300
That's our team, alright?

766
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:15,233
Are you two hurt anywhere?

767
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:18,200
Well, I'm alright.

768
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,900
I got hurt, though.

769
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,866
Look, a scratch on my arm!

770
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:26,633
Ouch!

771
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,866
I'm alright.

772
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:51,434
- Huh?
- Ms. Bong.

773
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,100
(Ms. Bong)

774
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,866
Open your drawers.

775
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,700
(Open your drawers)

776
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:56,666
(Pain relief pads/Band-Aids)

777
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:14,033
I couldn't make it obvious,
so I put them in your drawers.

778
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:12,400
(I couldn't make it obvious,
so I put them in your drawers)

779
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:13,566
(Please don't hurt yourself)

780
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,066
Please don't hurt yourself.

781
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:40,834
Any more adjustments
with the interior design?

782
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,600
No, we received their
final confirmation on the weekend.

783
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,567
Since this store will be
Korea's first for this brand,

784
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,600
the French HQ will look into
every little detail.

785
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:49,133
So please pay attention.

786
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:52,500
Looks like everything's all set.

787
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:56,433
Yes. This is why I said there was
no need to come down.

788
00:49:58,133 --> 00:49:59,966
Since we're ahead of schedule,
how about a date?

789
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,966
A date?

790
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:05,433
Um, Mr. Lee…

791
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:19,033
These stairs are
as beautiful as you, Ms. Kim.

792
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:25,066
Stand over there.

793
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:26,934
Let me, the world's
best photographer,

794
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,133
snap a picture of you.

795
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:30,066
Um…

796
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:32,666
Come on!

797
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:44,600
Mi-so, smile.

798
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:52,433
That's a good shot.

799
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,866
Let me take a look.

800
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:07,333
Oh, the heart…

801
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,600
Shall we make it bigger?

802
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:29,500
This scenery is just like you.

803
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,833
Absolute perfection.

804
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:35,000
While this observatory is
just like me.

805
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,166
It's standing on top of the world.

806
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:47,933
You brought me down here
on purpose, right?

807
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,133
To cheer me up.

808
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,233
That's right.

809
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:58,833
I came to hear about
what happened today,

810
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:01,600
so I wanted to cheer you up,

811
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,233
and help you get some fresh air.

812
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,566
Why don't you just
quit the company sooner?

813
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,800
No, I don't want to do that.

814
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:14,967
I'm going to do my best at my job

815
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,633
until the day I promised to.

816
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,967
Criticisms from people that
don’t concern me

817
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:23,866
aren't important to me, anyhow.

818
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:27,367
Still, I…

819
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:29,566
I'm worried that you'll get hurt.

820
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,367
I'd been prepared for this,

821
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:34,833
ever since I decided
I'll start anything with you.

822
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,433
'Even if people find out,'

823
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:39,466
'and there are
misunderstandings and criticisms…'

824

'Let's not get hurt.'

825
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,000
'Let's not run away.'

826
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:54,133
I braced myself
before falling in love with you.

827
00:53:20,466 --> 00:53:21,800
How about we…

828
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,366
…Go on a more fiery date?

829
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,733

(Spicy Chicken Feet
and Rice Balls - $5)

832
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:47,233
Is this what you mean by fiery?

833
00:53:47,866 --> 00:53:50,200
Yes, it's fiery-spicy.

834
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:51,800
Go on, try it.

835
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:54,167
Come on. Say ah!

836
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:56,100
- Ah!
- Ah.

837
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,266
Boom!

838
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:03,733
What do you think?

839
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:08,600
It's not bad.

840
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,066
Right?

841
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,600
You try some too, Ms. Kim.

842
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:23,733
Not bad, huh?

843
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

844
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,733
This is pretty, right?

845
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:33,133
How much is this?

846
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:37,133
Hold on.

847
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:40,633
Can I have one of these? How much?

848
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:45,366
Thank you.

849
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Ms. Kim, here.

850
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:52,400
I said, you don't have to!

851
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:54,433
Let's go.

852
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,233
Let's not get hurt.

853
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,700
Let's not run away.

(With a focus on portability)

- What do we do?

857
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,066
Good morning everyone!

858
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,200
No, it's not a good morning.

859
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:34,500
It's an emergency, Ms. Kim!

860
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:36,633
Why, what is it?

861
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,400
Remember the laptop that'll be
launched next week?

862
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:40,833
I think our design's been stolen!

863
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,400
What?

864
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:43,367
Take a look.

865
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:44,467
This is the notebook that'll be

866
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:46,567
released by UK next month,

867
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:48,100
and it's exactly the same as ours.

868
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:51,366
Ms. Kim.

869
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,633
Call up the board, now.

870
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:56,200
Yes, sir.

871
00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:02,000
- You're here.
- Mr. Lee.

872
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,366
Please take a seat.

873
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:10,367
Let's get down to business,
since there's no time.

874
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,867
What just happened?

875
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:14,234
Well, there's one month to go

876
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,534
before UK's release date,

877
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,234
and I think they expected this
copyright controversy

878
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,033
for them to reveal their design
so early at this point.

879
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,766
Is it possible to
change our designs?

880
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,733
Well, uh…

881
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:28,400
If we delay our dates to
change our design.

882
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:30,734
that'll affect the models
scheduled for the next quarter.

883
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,500
So realistically, that's not possible.

884
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:33,334
Then any other alternatives?

885
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,300
How about lowering our prices to
beat competition?

886
00:56:38,366 --> 00:56:39,600
You mean lower our
factory price,

887
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:41,767
even before they
reach the consumers?

888
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,300
This isn't stock clearance!

889
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,800
You call that an option?

890
00:56:49,933 --> 00:56:51,834
If we can't change our design,

891
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,566
then we need to differentiate
in terms of function.

892
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,534
Are there any functions

893
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,800
we can pull from
our next-year models?

894
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,067
Yes we do,

895
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:01,834
but that'll affect
our next models…

896
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,533
How can we guarantee
there'll be a next?

897
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:06,734
Increase SSD write speed by 30%,

898
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,767
and power saving by 20%.

899
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,434
Do all you can to

900
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,066
improve product quality,
design and functions.

901
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,566
I'll see everyone back tomorrow.

902
00:57:20,966 --> 00:57:22,500
- Ms. Kim.
- Oh, Ms. Kim.

903
00:57:22,566 --> 00:57:25,500
We only just found out
about this now, too.

904
00:57:25,566 --> 00:57:27,034
Mr. Lee called a meeting

905
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,600
before we even had time to
come up with alternatives,

906
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:29,834
and it was all
just too sudden, that's all.

907
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,867
So please don't let
Mr. Lee get the wrong idea.

908
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:34,334
Don't worry, I'm sure
he knows as well.

909
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,967
And he'll probably ask about
our strategies for

910
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,966
handling the media response.

911
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,067
So I suggest
you have the press materials

912
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:42,000
ready to support our
claims for plagiarism,

913
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:43,467
and the dates for when the
design patent was registered.

914
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:44,600
Alright, thanks Ms. Kim.

915
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:45,933
Alright. Let's go!

916
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,467
Mom?

917
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,533
Sorry?

918
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,367
Well, you just reminded me
of my mother

919
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:56,266
who'd comfort me after
my father told me off.

920
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:01,267
Mr. Koh,

921
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,334
please check the progress
on each team

922
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,834
and Ms. Bong and Ji-ah,
please join the legal team to

923
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,834
discuss how
we'll prepare this lawsuit.

924
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,634
- Yes.
- Mr. Park and Young-ok,

925
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,667
please join Planning and
take down meeting minutes.

926
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:12,900
- Yes.
- And Mr. Jung,

927
00:58:12,966 --> 00:58:14,900
please lead the team and
make sure you're updated.

928
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:16,033
Alright.

929
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,633
- Let's go, then.
- Yes.

930
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:26,234
Mr. Lee, I just
had a chat with Development,

931
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,633
and they said the upgrades
you mentioned are possible.

932
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:31,167
So that's already been
taken care of?

933
00:58:31,233 --> 00:58:32,167
Yes.

934
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:33,934
And this is the
Legal's opinions on

935
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,333
pursuing that
design plagiarism lawsuit.

936
00:58:35,733 --> 00:58:37,634
And these are the
press materials for

937
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,667
how we'll respond to
this plagiarism incident.

938
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:41,534
And this is the plan for the

939
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,700
additional budgets from Planning.

940
00:58:43,966 --> 00:58:45,366
That was done
faster than I'd expected.

941
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:48,933
I still have a lot more to go
in order to catch up to you.

942
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,633
A secretary like you…

943
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:05,800
Do you think I'll find one?

944
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:12,433
The more you're like this,
the more I hate to send you off,

945
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,766
but now I finally realize it.

946
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,800
On how comfortable
you made my life.

947
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:25,266
Thank you.

948
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:27,800
For staying by my side,
all this time.

949
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,400
Pizza's here.

950
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:43,100
Have some pizza!

951
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,100
Ah, it's here!

952
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:45,633
It's here!

953
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:49,333
Man, I'm so hungry.

954
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,766
Wow, this looks delicious.

955
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:54,334
Here, have some. Mr. Yang.

956
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,766
Mmm, so good!

957
00:59:56,066 --> 00:59:57,500
You're only eating now?

958
00:59:57,966 --> 01:00:00,966
Yes, we only just finished,
and so we're taking a break.

959
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,734
Thank you so much for today.

960
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,134
You were all great,
handling that emergency.

961
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,134
No, you did everything.

962
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,967
Those girls who were talking about

963
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:14,900
how you had nothing
but your face to boast -

964
01:00:14,966 --> 01:00:16,734
they should've seen you today!

965
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,967
Then they'll know that

966
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:20,467
you made it this far
with just your talent!

967
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,233
Please! Why do you have to
bring that up now?

968
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,900
It's alright,
I heard it too, anyway.

969
01:00:26,966 --> 01:00:28,734
As long as it's not true.

970
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,066
You have such big heart!

971
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:34,333
But the real emergency starts now.

972
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:37,633
What will we ever do without you?

973
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:45,200
Mr. Lee, please join us.

974
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,500
Have it while it's hot.

975
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:48,034
No, have it with some sauce.

976
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,300
That way, it's even more delicious.

977
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:52,700
No, sir, it's all about quantity.

978
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,466
I'm alright…

979
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,966
Please enjoy, after
all you've been through today.

980
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:01,533
Let me go back to my office.

981
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:34,166
(Your head should be cool, your
heart warm, and your feet burning)

982
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,800
(Overseas Trip Records)

983
01:02:19,466 --> 01:02:20,967
Ah, Ms. Kim.

984
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:23,033
Shall we head home?
I'll drive you.

985
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,333
Good work today.
You should go get some rest.

986
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,700
Mr. Lee.

987
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:48,566
I have something to say.

988
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,266
Yes?

989
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:55,533
I…

990
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,400
I don't think I'll quit after all.

991
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:07,033
What do you mean?

992
01:03:08,566 --> 01:03:09,800
It's just as I said.

993
01:03:10,966 --> 01:03:14,600
I want to remain your secretary
by your side.

994
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:20,066
Is this…

995
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:23,266
…Because of what happened today?

996
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,400
Don't worry about us.

997
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,267
Mr. Lee.

998
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,500
As you know,

999
01:03:29,566 --> 01:03:32,500
I'm also quick to adapt,
even faster than the others.

1000
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:35,766
So though I'll feel your absence,

1001
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,300
I'll be alright in no time.

1002
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,333
So go find
what you really want to do.

1003
01:03:43,966 --> 01:03:45,400
I've found it.

1004
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:50,300
I think what I want to do is

1005
01:03:50,366 --> 01:03:52,266
being your secretary, Mr. Lee.

1006
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:57,866
Just maybe…

1007
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:00,134
I've been doing something that

1008
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,533
best suits me and best
brings out my abilities,

1009
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,566
but I hadn't realized it because
I'd gotten too used to it.

1010
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,200
I feel that sense of
satisfaction and achievement

1011
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:16,966
from supporting someone to
solve a problem.

1012
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:20,500
Ms. Kim.

1013
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,366
And…

1014
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,066
I don't like seeing
my loved one in trouble.

1015
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,400
Let's be honest.

1016
01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:37,533
Who can handle you, if not me?

1017
01:04:45,266 --> 01:04:48,166
Just as how you tried to
let me go because you love me,

1018
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:52,900
I want to remain by your side,

1019
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:56,633
because I love you.

1020
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,300
You're yet to have dinner, right?

1021
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,333
Shall I stay for ramen?

1022
01:05:14,633 --> 01:05:16,266
Sounds good.

1023
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,966
Looks like I'm out of ramen.

1024
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,900
Ah.

1025
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:33,567
I've just one left.

1026
01:05:33,633 --> 01:05:36,067
If I add some frozen dumplings,

1027
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,866
then that should be
enough for two of us.

1028
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,800
Ramen with dumplings?

1029
01:05:39,866 --> 01:05:41,467
If you add rice cakes,
then that's ramen with rice cakes.

1030
01:05:41,533 --> 01:05:42,800
And if you add cheese,
then that's cheese ramen.

1031
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:45,167
Just like a chameleon, huh?

1032
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,600
What amazing instant food
with MSG!

1033
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:55,100
Why do I feel so happy?

1034
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:58,466
It's always been
my dream, you know.

1035
01:05:58,966 --> 01:06:00,300
Spending the evening with

1036
01:06:00,366 --> 01:06:02,966
my husband after work,
enjoying a simple meal.

1037
01:06:11,366 --> 01:06:12,866
Ah, why does it feel so
hot in here?

1038
01:06:19,066 --> 01:06:21,866
That dream…
Let me make it come true.

1039
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:26,333
Let's come home
together every day,

1040
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,400
and let's have ramen
together every day.

1041
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,533
I don't care if my body ends up
filled with MSG.

1042
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:40,966
I…

1043
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,366
I want to be your husband.

1044
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,800
I want to marry you, Mi-so.

1045
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,666
Why? Any objections?

1046
01:07:10,066 --> 01:07:12,266
- I do!
- Dad!

1047
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,400
Mr. Kim…

1048
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,033
I have an objection to

1049
01:07:18,433 --> 01:07:21,600
you two getting married!

1050
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:29,367
(Thank you to Ms. Jung Yu-mi,
Ms. Kim Ga-yeon and)

1051
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:31,033
(Ms. Lee Se-young for
their cameo appearances)
