Pretend you didn't see anything.

564
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,710
Help me!

565
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,080
I said, let her go.

566
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,010
Save me!

567
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,250
Do you hate me?

568
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,770
No.

569
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,550
I'll never hate you.

570
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,940
Don't worry,

571
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,750
I'm prepared.

572
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,100
The police can't do anything to me tomorrow.
