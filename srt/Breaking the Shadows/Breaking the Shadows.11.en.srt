00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,220
is suspected of getting involved in a major case.

379
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,380
I'm gathering evidence against him.

380
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,700
Those photos you took of him before

381
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,230
will also serve as solid evidence to bring him down in the future.

382
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,150
I don't think Dong Jie knows

383
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,830
what else Chen Bin is doing

384
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,640
besides messing around with women.

385
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,610
Also, she might not be aware

386
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,250
that what Chen Bin is doing

387
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,860
could potentially put her in danger.

388
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,730
So I really hope you can help me,

389
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,360
which would also be helping Dong Jie.

I'm here for you.

What's the matter?

Someone wants to see you.

401
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,640
Sorry for the suspension.

402
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,490
What's going on?

403
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,270
And what are you doing?

404
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,890
You've been suspended.

405
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,240
Yet instead of reflecting at home properly,

406
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,190
you're out here investigating the case on your own.

407
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,870
I know you're not happy about that.

408
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,120
But the eavesdropping app

409
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,510
was found on your phone after all.

410
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,330
I must suspend you.

411
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
Otherwise, things would be messed up.

412
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,590

Why do you have nothing to say?

415
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,540
If you've been wronged, you should speak up.

416
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,970
Don't tell me

417
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,840
you want to imitate Song,

420
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,200
Director Hou,

421
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,110
you know

422
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,980
Song was made a scapegoat?

423
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,460
I also know it's not only you and Song

424
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,640
but also

425
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,360
Zhong Wei having been made the scapegoats.

426
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Then Zhong Wei has still become a suspect?

427
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,350
Some people wanted it this way,

428
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,470
so I had to fulfill their wish.

429
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,100
Once they got what they wanted,

430
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,200
they'd let their guard down and slip up.

431
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,990
And we'd have a chance to catch them.

432
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,130
What do you think?

433
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,170
Director Hou,

434
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,620
please stop making me guess what you mean.

435
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,900
So what's that all about?

436
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,310
Y-You're really like an impatient vanguard.

437
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,070

438
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,750
to keep people in suspense?

439
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,370
You were not like this

440
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,880
before you became the director.

441
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,880
I have an idea.

442
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,370
It can let you continue investigating this case

443
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,140
without causing trouble in the team.

444
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,210
What is it?

445
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,660
By making you

446
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,760
an independent squad.

447
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,110
Independent? How?

448
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,520
Simply put,

449
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,670
it's separating you from the special task force

450
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,790
to investigate independently.

451
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,170
The purpose is

452
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,120
to avoid falling into an impasse

453
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,650
and to look at this case from a different perspective.

454
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,470
Because you're not working with the special task force,

455
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,220
your judgment won't get messed up.

456
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,490
Now

457
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
is the perfect opportunity.

458
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,700
Given your suspension,

459
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,860
you can't openly investigate the case.

460
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,850
The mole issue in the special task force

461
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,950
hasn't been solved either.

462
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,120
The progress of the case

463
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,950
is still at a standstill.

464
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,170
So I thought

465
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,560
maybe

466
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,860
we should try this new approach.

467
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,510
Am I the only one in this independent squad?

468
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,300
Lin Jiajia and Song are also in it.

469
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,770
I think

470
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,340
just Song and I would be enough.

471
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,240
I know what you're thinking.

472
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,270
First, you think Lin Jiajia is too young

473
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,110
and callow.

474
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,690
You're afraid he might drag you down.

475
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,170
Second, you don't trust him

476
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,340
as you know little about his background, right?

477
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,110
You specifically transferred him from the provincial capital.

478
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,790
I dare not doubt him.

479
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,030
You're indeed so sharp.

480
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,720
I'll level with you now.

481
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,860
I transferred Lin Jiajia here

482
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,280
just for Zhong Wei's disappearance case, actually.

483
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,210
As for the specific reasons,

484
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,680
I can't say much now.

485
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,300
It's not the right timing yet.

486
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,410
Lin Jiajia's true identity

487
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,260
is an outstanding talent from the provincial department of criminal police,

488
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,690
a key member in the bureau's training program.

489
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,950
I've assigned him to work with you

490
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,490
because you know Zhong Wei best,

491
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,200
and you've been

492
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,040
quietly investigating Zhong Wei's disappearance all along.

493
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,870
So I hope

494
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,450
Lin Jiajia can get

495
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,250
more valuable clues from you

496
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,420
to uncover the real reason behind Zhong Wei's disappearance as soon as possible.

497
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,590
Director Hou.

498
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,370
What is

499
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,460
your opinion

500
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,070
on Zhong Wei's chances

501
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,140
of survival?

502
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,290
No matter how slim the chances are,

503
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,570
I believe you

504
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,100
can find him.

505
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,640
Here you are.

506
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,550
[Police, Han Qing]

507
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,760
Thank you, Director Hou.

508
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,280
I will find him.

509
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,910

510
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,100
Impressive!

511

Your acting was quite good.

512
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,980
I'm flattered, Qing.

513
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,050
About Zhong Wei's case,

514
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,230
have you found anything that I don't know?

515
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,330
There's one thing you already know.

516
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,490
Song

517
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,290
has been secretly investigating the case for Zhong Wei.

518
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,850
What else?

519
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,130
The locker that Zhong Wei opened at Power Club

520
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,320
was once used by Chen Bin.

521
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,680
How did you find that out?

522
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,330
I looked into Power Club's employee records

523
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,390
and found info on several former employees.

524
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,810
I visited some of them.

525
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,370
A janitor who left two months ago

526
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,500
said he once saw

527
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,190
Chen Bin use Locker 1688.

528
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,780
He thought the number was quite auspicious,

529
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,070
so he paid special attention to it.

530
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,140
Anything else?

531
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,790
Well,

532
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,240
I also went to Lyu Jianmin's hometown

533
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,610
for a thorough investigation into Zhang Yong,

534
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,190
but it all led to nothing.

535
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,360
You've put in quite a bit of effort.

536
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,920
I did discover some issues though.

537
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,160
Especially about Song.

538
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,710
Why has he been refusing to explain

539
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,540
who he met that night?

540
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,820
And why

541
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,420
is he secretly investigating the case for Zhong Wei?

542
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,860
This wouldn't be necessary

543
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,870
unless he's hiding something he can't confess.

544
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,010
Song.

545
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,890
Han Qing,

546
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,410
I've found a new lead.

547
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,780
Come here to meet me.

548
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,490
Where are we, Qing?

549
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,460
It's the northwest suburbs, part of the Second Mine.

550
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,270
Song.

551
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,239
Hi, Song.

552
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,420
So what is it?

553
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,510
I received a text message.

554
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,510
It should be similar to the Power Club's coded message.

555
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,060
Another drug deal.

556
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,560
[Second Mine 13020404]

557
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,480
It's four digits shorter than the Power Club's code.

558
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,190
I've been searching around in the mine all afternoon.

559
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,139
And I

560
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,219
ended up here.

561
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,429
That lamppost.

562
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,790
The utility pole code?

563
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,790
These drug dealers have a wild imagination.

564
