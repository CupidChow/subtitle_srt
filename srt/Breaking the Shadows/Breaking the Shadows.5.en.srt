[Episode 5]

3
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,710
What are you looking at?

4
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,139
You startled me.

5
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,850
I'm listening to an audiobook.

6
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,610
It's an ongoing series. I've been listening to it.

7
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,510
The killer just went upstairs with a knife, about to murder someone,

8
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,520
and you suddenly...

9
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,790
You scared me to death.

10
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,240
You brought me tea leaves again, and so much of it?

11
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,720
I've labeled them for you.

12
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,880
Don't mix them up.

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,230
Xueman,

14
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,010
you don't have to always bring me such good tea leaves.

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,230
The people in our team

16
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,430
don't know how to appreciate tea at all.

17
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,520
They're all wasted.

18
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,329
I think you're being inconsiderate.

19
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,829
Don't worry about whether they drink or not,

20
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,510
it's a matter of courtesy.

21
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,550
Your job isn't something

22
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,710
you can do alone.

23
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,590
You'll need others' help someday.

24
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,990
I made you some duck soup for reducing internal heat.

25
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,390
Are you going to drink it in front of me,

26
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,840
or pour it out after I leave?

27
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,260
I'll drink it. I definitely will.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,630
I promise to finish every last drop.

29
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,520
You're quite busy yourself, Xueman.

30
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,460
You don't need to always come take care of me. It's too much trouble.

31
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,660
It's not troublesome.

32
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,960
You're my only younger sister,

33
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,020
and I'm your only elder sister.

34
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,570
Alright.

35
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,220
Go to bed early.

36
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,340
I'll get going now.

37
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,140
Don't be late tomorrow.

38
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,510
Where are you going?

39
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,510
Did you forget?

40
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,340
It's Dad and Auntie's death anniversary.

41
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,860
I saved it in my reminders.

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,810
Look,

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,650
the alarm hasn't gone off yet.

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,260
I never need an alarm.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,230
Every year at this time,

46
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,810
Dad would appear in my dreams.

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,170
In the past couple of years,

48
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,150
he always looks like he's hesitating to say something.

49
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,060
I know what he wants to say.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,200
He thinks

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,910
I haven't been taking good care of you.

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,230
Han Qing,

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,700
please don't think I'm nagging you.

54
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,430
See, girls at your age,

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,560
are usually finding someone to date,

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,829
have children with, get married to,

57
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,130
and live a normal life together.

58
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,810
But you are just doing this job.

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,829
I'm really afraid that one day you'll end up like Zhong Wei.

60
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,860
End up how?

61
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,220
End up dead.

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,480
You also think Zhong Wei is dead, don't you?

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,590
Remember to drink the soup.

64
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,459
When we got married,

65
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,180
you only told me you were divorced,

66
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,290
you didn't mention you had such a grown child.

67
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,870
Han Weiguo, you're nothing but a liar.

68
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,320
I didn't lie to you.

69
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,730
Haven't I explained everything to you already?

70
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,350
What's the point of you constantly harping on this?

71
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,470
Then what are you trying to do

72
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,990
by bringing her all the way here?

73
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,600
Are you trying to make my life miserable?

74
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,150
How many times do I have to explain?

75
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,150
Her mother is sick. Her mother is sick.

76
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,030
She can't take care of her anymore.

77
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,030
I'm her father.

78
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,090
If I don't take care of her, who will?

79
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,780
You're her father.

80
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,370
You can live alone with your daughter.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,590
We divorce.

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Get out!

83
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,680
You're too heartless. Divorce then.

84
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,830
Han Weiguo.

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,740
If you leave now, don't ever come back.

86
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,060
Mom!

87
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,310
Why did you throw my clothes?

88
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,400
Look, it's all dirty now.

89
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,470
I didn't throw it.

90
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,980
You did throw it. I saw it myself.

91
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,960
I've said, I didn't throw it.

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,250
Come back and apologize to me.

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,060
Why are you stepping on it? You're so annoying!

94
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,150
You're the annoying one! You're the annoying one!

95
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,659
My dad and mom always fight because of you.

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,159
They never fought before you came.

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,880
You're annoying! Annoying, annoying, annoying!

98
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,870
The other day when my mom was still lucid,

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:06,120
[Tomb of late father and mother, Han Weiguo and Ye Min]

100
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,430
she asked me to choose a cemetery for her.

101
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,270
I'll bring her here to take a look.

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,730
How is Mrs. Zhou doing?

103
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,510
Just the same.

104
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,490
Sometimes she recognizes people, sometimes she doesn't.

105
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,680
[Tomb of late father and mother, Han Weiguo and Ye Min]

106
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,110
Dad,

107
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,580
Auntie,

108
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,940
we've come to visit you.

109
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,940
We're both doing well.

110
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,690
Don't worry.

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,170
Dad has been appearing in my dreams lately.

112
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,660
He's not always smiling like he used to.

113
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,700
I understand what you mean.

114
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,160
You want me to take good care of Qing.

115
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,520
[Tomb of late father and mother, Han Weiguo and Ye Min]

116
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,470
Rest assured,

117
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,100
I'm looking after her.

118
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,390
Say a few words to Dad.

119
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,070
I...

120
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,590
I don't have much to say.

121
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,570
That's just her temperament.

122
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,770
It hasn't changed a bit after all these years.

123
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,409
I'll speak then.

124
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,580
Han Qing is doing well.

125
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,270
She's just completely focused on her work

126
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,520
and is hardly ever home.

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,280
Actually,

128
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,220
there's something else I want to tell you.

129
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,280
She's finally found someone she likes.

130
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,980
Xueman.

131
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,420
He's also a police officer.

132
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,650
His name is Zhong Wei.

133
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,540
He's Han Qing's partner.

134
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,400
He got into an accident.

135
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,510
Otherwise, this time,

136
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,620
you might have been able to meet him.

137
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,900
There are some things I've been wanting to tell you too.

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,180
I just never had the chance to say them.

139
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,430
You've been searching for two whole months.

140
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,410
There's no sign of him, dead nor alive.

141
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,430
I don't want to watch you obsess over this every day.

142
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,070
Stop searching.

143
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,190
Actually, after you've passed, Dad,

144
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,920
I've been feeling extremely guilty all these years.

145
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,840
Your family suffered so much,

146
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,860
been through so many disasters,

147
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,910
all because of my arrival.

148
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,870
Dad and Auntie got into a car accident while picking me up,

149
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,850
and now Zhong Wei has gone missing.

150
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,110
It's all because of me.

151
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,840
It's all because I appeared in your lives.

152
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,010
That's why, Han Qing, I've been desperately trying to be good to you.

153
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,640
I take care of you, clean your room,

154
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,790
cook for you, and make soup for you.

155
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,880
I just want to reduce

156
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,150
the guilt I feel inside.

157
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,580
Xueman, please stop.

158
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,310
I really can't bear to see you like this.

159
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,930
I hope you can look forward.

160
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,690
Please stop searching.

161
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,590
I'll wait for you in the car.

162
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,430
Dad, stop the car, stop the car!

163
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,700
I want to get out.

164
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,560
Be careful.

165
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,710
I know.

166
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,140
What time is it now?

167
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,150
Go and check on her.

168
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,110

If you want to go, then go yourself.

171

Han Qing.

Are you done yet?

Not yet, it's still early.

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,660
I'm fine.

I know, stop rushing me.

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,320
So what if she arrives? What's wrong with waiting a bit?

180
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,870
She's your daughter, but Han Qing isn't?

181
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,370
Do we really have to go to a restaurant to welcome her?

182
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,160
Isn't it expensive?

183
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,220
I don't take her out more than twice a year.

184

Han Qing goes there all the time though.

I've been calling you. Why haven't you answered?

Are you in a bad mood?

-Have something sweet.
-Do you need something?

191
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,760
I... I called Zhang Yong to verify.

192
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,010
Lyu Jianmin did indeed ask him for a loan,

193
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,930
but he didn't lend him any.

Zhang Yong has been in business for years.

He has no bad records.

It wasn't captured.

203
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,530
I followed this car the whole way,

just like the suspect of the dismemberment case,

he kept using the sun visor to cover his face.

338
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,380
These two girls are specially reserved for you.

339
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,550
They're great.

340
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,450
Drink up.

341
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,840
Come on.

342
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,710
Take good care of him.

343
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,550
How are you feeling? Happy?

344
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,130
Are you having fun?

345
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,980
Cheer up.

346
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,570
Yes.

347
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm happy, I'm happy.

348
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,720
Turn off the music first.

349
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,760
Step out, step out.

350
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,270
Step out for a moment. I'll call you back in a bit.

351
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,770
Brother,

352
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,190
you've been wronged, haven't you?

353
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,580
Brother, this, this, this...

354
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,660
-You can’t…
-Take it.

355
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,300
I can’t take your money.
Listen to me.

356
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,170
If it's not enough, there's more.

357
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,240
You must keep it.

358
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,480
Otherwise, I'll be angry.

359
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,040
My brother,

360
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,230
about your ex-wife's matter,

361
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,090
I'll definitely resolve it for you.

362
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,750
You must hold the line for me with the cops.

363
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,500
Don't mention a single word.

364
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,630
After the heavy rain,

365
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,720
the rafting activities in our city's tourists spots

366
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,280
have unexpectedly reached a peak.

367
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,520
The rise in water levels

368
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,020
provided tourists with

369
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,830
an exhilarating rafting experience.

370
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Both sides of the riverbank

371
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,120
are lush with greenery,

372
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,950
creating a perfect blend of scenic beauty and thrilling rapids,

373
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,420
complementing each other wonderfully.

374
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,940
The staff at the tourist spots

375
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,930
have strengthened safety patrols and lifesaving measures

376
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,390
to ensure that every visitor

377
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,830
can enjoy the fun of rafting

378
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,110
while also ensuring their own safety.

379
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,760
Many tourists expressed that

380
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,560
such outdoor activities not only relax the body and mind

381
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,660
but also increase their sense of closeness to nature.

382
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,310
Now, we interrupt with

383
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,020
a reward notice from our city's police department.

384
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,570
From May 5th to 10th, 2017,

385
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,190
our city has experienced three consecutive

386
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,580
major criminal cases.

387
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,690
After investigation,

388
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,570
it has been determined that all three cases

389
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
were committed by the same suspect.

390
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,530
The suspect is approximately 1.85 meters tall

391
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,600
and has a slim build.

392
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,530
He was wearing a realistic mask of an elderly person,

393
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,480
a grayish-brown leather jacket,

394
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,860
and black jeans.

395
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,570
During the course of his crimes,

396
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,090
the suspect kidnapped a 30-year-old woman surnamed Bai,

397
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,790
who is an employee of a fitness club.

398
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,660
To capture the suspect as soon as possible

399
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,000
and eliminate his threat to society,

400
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,420
we urge all citizens

401
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,820
to actively provide any information.

402
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,680
Anyone who reports to the police

403
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,630
and directly assists in the capture of the suspect

404
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,250
will be considered by the police

405
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,440
for a reward of up to 100,000 yuan.

406
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,230
The police sternly warn the suspect

407
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,230
to voluntarily surrender to the authorities

408
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,790
and seek lenient treatment.

409
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,990
Anyone who withholds information, harbors, shields,

410
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,990
or funds the suspect,

411
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,400
or helps the suspect

412
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,990
in destroying or falsifying evidence

413
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,750
will be strictly held accountable by the police

414
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,100
in accordance with the law.

415
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,520
These people are so powerful.

416
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,410
You're no match for them at all.

417
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,630
If they really want to deal with you,

418
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,980
it would be a matter of minutes.

419
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,170

420
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,570
Alright, you guys handle it.

422
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,310
Yes, it should be.

How come you have time today?

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,910
I feel like having a drink.

Let's sit at the usual spot.

435
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,350
and I'll go get the drinks.

-Okay.
-Okay.

What would you like to eat today?

442

Mr. Zhong?

Pass me the case files of yesterday's investigation.

Which investigation?

Comrade Han Qing's performance during her internship

00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,680
Here, the drinks are here.

508
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,420
Here's yours.

509
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,990
What are you thinking about?

510
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,340
Nothing.

511
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,140
How's Fei?

512
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,410
What's wrong?

513
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,190
It's nothing.

514
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,540
Still the same.

515
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,910
It's just that her mood has been fluctuating more lately.

516
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,150
Just think about it. Every day going from

517
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,910
hospital to home, and home to hospital.

518
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,930
She must be tired of it.

519
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,230
Once I get through this busy period,

520
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,740
I'll go visit her.

521
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,420
You focus on your work first.

522
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,820
We'll talk after you're done.

523
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,390
Where's Mrs. Zhao?

524
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,210
By the way,

525
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,790
speaking of Mrs. Zhao,

526
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,640
she said this morning

527
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,640
she saw Xueman coming back from outside

528
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,270
and going into a private room to cry.

529
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,950
Did something happen?

530
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,100
It's nothing.

531
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,300
Are you sure it's nothing?

532
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,390
Today is the death anniversary of my parents.

533
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,900
We went to visit their graves.

534
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,040
Are you okay?

535
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,260
I'm fine.

536
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,620
Here.

537
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,660
Do you not know how to smile?

538
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,730
I mean, you've been in the team for so long.

539
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,860
Apart from seeing you smile

540
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,310
out of politeness,

541
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,920
I've never seen you smile genuinely.

542
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,960
Why?

543
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,030
In the past, I...

544
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,250
Never mind.

545
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,220
No matter what happened in the past,

546
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,710
or what you've done in the past,

547
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,800
it doesn't matter.

548
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,450
From today on,

549
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,420
be a good cop and a good person,

550
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,700
and you'll be happy,

551
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,650
just like me.

552
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,400
From now on, I'll call you Unhappy.

553
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,240
You must have something on your mind.

554
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,180
Is it about the case?

555
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,720
You must be too tired lately.

556
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,130
I'm not tired.

557
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,630
Then what is it?

558
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,550
I think I'm a jerk.

559
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,390
How can you say that about yourself?

560
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,730
It's true, Mentor.

561
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,890
You know what?

562
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,900
I lost my temper with Captain Fang again today.

563
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,010
Why?

564
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,480
I just got agitated as I was talking.

565
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,690
I don't know why either.

566
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,580
I'm anxious.

567
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,990
I want to solve the case.

568
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,230
I want to be a good cop.

569
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,090
You know what, Mentor?

570
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,150
I have an informant who, in order to find clues for me,

571
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,170
got beaten up.

572
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,100
I told him verbally

573
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,640
to stop working as this

574
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,810
and that I would find him a proper job,

575
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,150
but in my heart, I still want him to continue working for me.

576
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,630
Aren't I a total jerk?

577
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,210
And then there's Zhong Wei.

578
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,350
It's been two months.

579
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,990
Sixty days.

580
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,200
I just can't find him.

581
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,420
Where do you think he is?

582
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,840
Qing, let's not talk about this anymore, okay?

583
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,830
-You drank too much today.
-Mentor, you know what?

584
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,550
I'll bring you home.

585
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,270
Originally, this case

586
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,240
was handled by him and me together.

587
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Do you know why I didn't participate?

588
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,050
In my opinion,

589
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,340
they should be split up

590
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,870
But they can't be separated.

591
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,550
[Police]

592
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,130
What do you mean by "can't be separated"?

593
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,360
Think about it yourself.

594
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:50,950
Han Qing.

595
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,670
Captain Fang.

596
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,370
What’s up?

597
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,090
Captain Fang.

598
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,580
Can you put me in charge of

599
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,610
the bathhouse murder case?

600
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,580
The bathhouse murder case

601
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,340
was assigned to you and Zhong Wei from the start.

602
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,950
Wan Haiqiang's case too.

603
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,830
I'm wondering if

604
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,080
Zhong Wei and I can split up

605
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,720
and each handle a case.

606
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,320
I'll take charge of the bathhouse murder case,

607
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,650
and Zhong Wei can handle Wan Haiqiang's case.

608
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,710
So the progress of both cases

609
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,990
can be guaranteed.

610
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,240
What do you think?

611
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,630
Sure, I have no objection.

612
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,010
You guys decide.

613
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,310
If

614
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,240
I had gone to investigate the case with him,

615
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,530
would he not have disappeared?

616
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,500
I'm just selfish.

617
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,890
I don't want others to gossip about me.

618
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,480
And my sister, Xueman,

619
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,380
I feel especially sorry for her too.

620
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,810
I always felt that because she came to our family,

621
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,610
my parents were always arguing about her.

622
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,280
I was very unhappy about this.

623
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,750
So when I was young, I always bullied her.

624
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,850
Today she said again, that it was because of her,

625
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,680
bad things happened to my parents.

626
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,530
But it's not like that.

627
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,270
I know it in my heart.

628
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,710
And my parents,

629
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,170
I feel I've really let them down.

630
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,300
I feel like I'm such a jerk.

631
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,150
Fei.

632
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,310
Qing, you're awake.

633
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,970
Why am I here?

634
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,500
You got drunk last night.

635
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,410
My dad was worried about you being alone at home.

636
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,730
so he carried you back here.

637
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,920
Oh ,right!

638
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,340
Drink this quickly.

639
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,070
What is this?

640
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,200
Honey lemon water.

641
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,680
I added a lot of honey for you.

642
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,070
It's very sweet. Drink up.

643
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,730
Thank you.

644
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,790
Where's Mentor and Mrs. Zhao?

645
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,140
My dad is making breakfast.

646
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,120
My mom is over there ironing your clothes.

647
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,340
Ironing clothes? For me?

648
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,950
You threw up on your jacket last night.

649
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,540
My mom washed it for you.

650
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,390
It didn't dry completely after hanging all night.

651
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,830
Now she's ironing it again.

652
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,800
Mom.

653
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:47,730
Mom,

654
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,580
is Qing's clothes done ironing?

655
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,870
It's done.

656
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,330
Hurry up.

657
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,560
Right away, right away.

658
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,750
Qing, wait a moment.

659
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,220
Qing.

660
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,920
Mrs. Zhao.

661
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,700
I've ironed it dry. Put it on quickly.

662
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,480
Here.

663
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,550
I'm really sorry. I've troubled you too much.

664
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,110
Don't say that.

665
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,770
If I don't iron it for you, who will?

666
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,230
If I don't care for you, who will?

667
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,320
That's the only thing my mom knows how to say, nothing else.

668
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,520
Qing.

669
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,400
Mentor.

670
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,220
It's time to eat.

671
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,430
Come quickly.

672
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,290
Your favourite scallion pancakes.

673
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,770
Your mentor made them specially for you.

674
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,830
Thank you, Mentor.

675
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,110
Hurry and eat.

676
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,340
