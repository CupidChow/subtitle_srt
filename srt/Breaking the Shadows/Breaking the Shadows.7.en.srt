[Breaking the Shadows]

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,979
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,070
When the car accident happened,

4
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,910
Zhang Yong's activity was detected

5
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,759
[March 6, 2017, Monday] [Second-floor corner]

6
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,210
within the signal location of 1508.

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,270
You called to tell me about the car accident.

8
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,590
Two minutes later,

9
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,690
Zhang Yong received a phone call.

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,630
Go wait for me outside.

11
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,340
According to the masseuse's testimony,

12
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,710
after Zhang Yong answered the call,

13
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,120
he immediately made another call.

14
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,150
Have you finished the call?

15
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,980
Yes, I have.

16
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,210
I still need to make another call.

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,280
Mr. Zhang, aren't you too busy?

18
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,730
Can't you just relax and enjoy the massage?

19
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,490
-Zhang Yong's expression changed as soon as he finished the call.
-Get lost!

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,390
Since he cursed at her, it left a strong impression.

21
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,210
The timing of Zhang Yong's call

22
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,550
perfectly matched when Lyu Jianmin received the call

23
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,470
from 1508.

24
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,190
Was 1508 Zhang Yong's phone number?

25
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,850
No.

26
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,400
Did Zhang Yong's registered phone number

27
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,070
have any call records

28
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,090
at 5:50 AM yesterday?

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,790
No.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,290
Did the signal location of 1508

31
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,420
ever appear near Zhang Yong's rental company

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,130
or his home?

33
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,910
No.

34
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,950
But, Captain Fang,

35
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,430
before Zhong Wei went missing,

36
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,190
he was already watching Zhang Yong.

37
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,030
The masseuse confirmed that

38
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,390
Zhong Wei was eavesdropping

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,140
on the next room.

40
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,680
She even

41
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,790
messaged her friend on WeChat about it.

42
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,860
This Zhang Yong

43
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,520
is definitely suspicious.

44
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,670
And he might be connected

45
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,310
to the case Zhong Wei was investigating.

46
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,520
Otherwise, Zhong Wei

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,190
wouldn't have looked into him for no reason.

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,490
But Zhong Wei never sent back

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,760
any evidence or investigation report

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
on Zhang Yong.

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,230
We also don't have solid proof

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,100
that Zhang Yong used 1508

53
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,310
to make those calls.

54
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,930
All of this is just your speculation.

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,960
You know the bureau won't issue

56
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,100
a search warrant.

57
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,600
I can try to fight for it

58
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,590
but don't get your hopes up.

59
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,600
How about this, Captain Fang—

60
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,940
just pretend you don't know.

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,880
No way. Absolutely not.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,770
Han Qing, don't be so stubborn.

63
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,790
Right now,

64
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,470
this is our only lead.

65
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,430
If we're right,

66
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,100
we can track down 1508,

67
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,590
find Lyu Jianmin, Bai Xiaohui,

68
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,670
and even the mole leaking information.

69
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,670
If we're wrong,

70
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,810
I'll take the fall alone. Deal?

71
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,070
No. No way.

72
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,730
Absolutely not.

73
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,140
Come in.

74
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,159
Yong.

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,280
Well...

76
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,870
Why'd you bring me to your company?

77
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,920
What are you panicking about? Sit down.

78
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,330
You're back home now.

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,700
This place is safe, don't worry.

80
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,010
The police won't find you.

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,000
The police are looking for me?

82
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,510
They've already issued a search notice.

83
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,230
Wait—

84
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,210
bro,

85
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,890
what's going on?

86
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,430
What do you mean by "hey?"

87
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,380
Did you send him away?

88
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,430
He's gone.

89
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,659
Better make sure he never comes back.

90
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,940
Don't worry.

91
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,680
I'll handle it.

92
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,330
Clean it up properly.

93
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,090
Understood.

94
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,150
Who was that on the phone?

95
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,850
My boss.

96
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,610
So what he just said

97
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,190
on the phone—

98
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,030
"Better make sure he never comes back."

99
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,940
What did he mean by that?

100
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,870
Jianmin,

101
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,110
I've been keeping you here in Dongzhou

102
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,380
without my boss knowing.

103
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,420
Otherwise...

104
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,960
Yong,

105
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,480
I've done everything as you requested.

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,310
But now...

107
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,330
What's really going on?

108
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,560
You're my boss.

109
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,630
You...

110
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,120
can do anything to me,

111
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,060
but I beg of you,

112
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,000
please take good care of my son.

113
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,090
Find his mother and bring her back.

114
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,600
Brother,

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,080
as for your family,

116
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,500
no one can take care of them better than you.

117
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,350
Just stay here and be at ease.

118
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,050
Chen Bin,

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,760
someone's looking for you.

120
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,740
What's up?

121
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,970
Come back home.

122
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,610
Give me my coat.

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,350
Get it yourself.

124
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,110
I'm leaving.

125
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,720
Chen Bin.

126
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,030
Let's go home.

127
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,710
Mr. Wang.

128
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,660
Ms. Han.

129
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,900
What are you doing here?

130
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,400
Weren't you living at the end of the alley?

131
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,050
Are you...

132
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,110
investigating a case?

133
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,510
Have you found Mr. Zhong?

134
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,560
Not yet.

135
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,670
I've kept the photo you gave me

136
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,140
on the counter.

137
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,160
I'll notify you as soon as I have any news.

138
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,120
Thank you.

139
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I won't bother you anymore.

140
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,670
Mr. Wang,

141
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,310
you dropped something.

142
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,730
I'm leaving then.

143
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
[Man Lost]

144
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm asking you a question.

145
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,230
What do you want?

146
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,330
How did you know I was there?

147
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,180
When did you find out?

148
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,670
The police are watching us so closely lately.

149
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,950
You'd better not go out recently.

150
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,070
What's the deal with the police?

151
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,240
I haven't broken any laws.

152
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,390
Why should I be worried about them?

153
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,110
Then why are the police watching us?

154
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,020
What are you trying to say?

155
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,980
I'm asking you to stay at home for now.

156
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,990
After the heat dies down,

157
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,020
you can do whatever you want.

158
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,780
Stop meddling in my affairs from now on!

159
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,530
You think I like to interfere?

160
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,370
Babe,

161
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,210
next time I'll spend more time with you, I promise.

162
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,000
You think I like to interfere?

163
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,400
You said on the phone

164
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,700
that you're also friends with Dong Jie, right?

165
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,810
Yes.

166
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,840
Actually, I'm not in that line of work.

167
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,810
I've known Dong Jie for a long time,

168
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,570
so I helped her out

169
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
as a favor.

170
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,440
You're also Dong Jie's friend.

171
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,780
If there's anything you need help with,

172
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I'll try my best.

173
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,860
Can you tell me

174
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,870
what kind of trouble it is?

175
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,910
It's Dong Jie's trouble.

176
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,060
I'm Han Qing,

177
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,830
from the Municipal Criminal Investigation Unit.

178
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,000
Don't worry, I'm not here to cause you trouble.

179
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,190
That's funny. What kind of trouble could I have?

180
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,970
You're in quite a bit of trouble.

181
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,870
Under the Public Security Administration Punishments Law,

182
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,830
Article 42,

183
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,090
anyone caught peeping, filming, eavesdropping,

184
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,740
or spreading another person's private information

185
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,070
could face detention for up to five days

186
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,490
or a fine of up to 500 yuan.

187
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,710
In more serious cases,

188
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,640
the punishment could include detention for five to ten days

189
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,430
