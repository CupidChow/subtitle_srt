00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,450
Speaking of Qi Hong coming to work for me,

194
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,230
I should thank Han Qing.

195
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,300
At that time, Qi Hong was laid off.

196
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,390
It was Han Qing who introduced her to me.

197
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,280
So it's actually thanks to my sister

198
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,800
that my business has been so successful.

199
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,650
Where is Chen Bin now?

200
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,790
He should have already left the country.

201
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,420
You can check my phone.

202
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,090
Where did you get the drugs?

203
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,910
What's the source?

204
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,290
How did they get transferred to you?

205
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,670
All from abroad.

206
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,830
My supplier is the drug lord Kyaw Myint Tun.

207
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,850
His nickname is Duya Tiger.

208
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,850
His people smuggle the drugs

209
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,030
into the country from Nangui.

210
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,170
Then there are people who rent cars to transport them to Mincheng,

211
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,190
where they're handed over to a person called Madam Xue.

212
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,030
Madam Xue will then

213
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,930
further sort and package these drugs.

214
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,000
Then they're delivered to Zhao Wenbin.

215
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,380
Bai Xiaohui, Fan Lingling,

216
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,770
Qiu Hailong,

217
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,440
Zhang Yong, and Feng Tianyi.

218
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,140
Was it you who ordered Wang Xuehua to kill them?

219
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,330
Yes, it was me.

220
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,380
Bai Xiaohui

221
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,870
found out that we killed Zhong Wei,

222
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,340
and she demanded one million from us.

223
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,110
We had no choice but to kill her.

224
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,570
Where were Bai Xiaohui and Fan Lingling

225
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,740
killed?

226
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,910
How were the bodies transported?

227
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,560
They both happened in the basement

228
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,360
of Wang Xuehua's hardware store.

229
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,820
Bai Xiaohui's case was special.

230
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,750
That day, we noticed that all your people

231
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,130
were in Limin Lane.

232
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,370
So Wang Xuehua and I

233
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,980
had to dismember her body,

234
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,440
put it in sealed bags, and vacuum seal them.

235
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,200
The next day, we mixed the bags into a box of tea leaves

236
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,270
and transported them out.

237
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,650
When we were transporting the body that day,

238
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,640
Han Qing happened to come to see me.

239
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,760
She also helped me move the box containing the body.

240
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,730
What's this? It's so heavy.

241
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,380
Come on.

242
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,450
Tea leaves.

243
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,060
For a big client.

244
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
What about Zhong Wei?

245
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,070
Was it also you who ordered Wang Xuehua to kill him?

246
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,220
Zhong Wei's case was special.

247
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,040
At that time, Zhao Wenbin

248
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,970
begged me to leave Zhong's body intact.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,030
I agreed.

250
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,910
So transporting his body

251
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,020
was more troublesome.

252
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,140
Wang Xuehua avoided the surveillance cameras

253
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,830
and transported his body out.

254
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,140
Zhao Wenbin buried him

255
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,920
on the mountain in the forest park.

256
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,380
He said he wanted Zhong Wei to be closer to home.

257
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,320
What's the deal with Zhong Wei's hair and Fan Lingling's blood stains

258
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,590
found in Unit A1, Limin Lane?

259
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,440
I had Wang Xuehua keep them.

260
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,620
I originally planned to

261
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,620
pin the murders

262
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,630
on Zhao Wenbin later,

263
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,160
because Zhao Wenbin was unreliable.

264
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,980
I was worried he might turn on us one day.

265
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,660
I didn't expect the incident with Bai Xiaohui to happen.

266
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,280
So I had to use it on Zhong Wei instead.

267
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,540
Zhong Wei was really pitiful.

268
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,340
He was in love with my sister.

269
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,590
I knew that too.

270
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,580
It's exactly because of this

271
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,840
that I had to kill Zhong Wei.

272
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,830
Because I think only in this way

273
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,490
could Han Qing

274
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,760
truly understand that kind of pain.

275
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,340
The pain of having your family taken away,

276
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,490
of losing your loved ones,

277
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,080
and of losing

278
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,230
an ordinary,

279
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,150
humble,

280
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,560
but once peaceful life.

281
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,390
I think Han Qing

282
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,630
should be able to understand that feeling now.

283
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,630
The court will now pronounce the verdict for this case.

284
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,180
The defendants, Zhou Xueman and Chen Bin,

285
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,690
[Presiding Judge] [Judge]

286
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,950
trafficked heroin,

287
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,820
methamphetamine and other drugs,

288
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,780
and their actions constitute the crime of drug trafficking.

289
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,530
The quantity of drugs trafficked is large,

290
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,400
causing severe harm to society,

291
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,910
and should be severely punished according to law.

292
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,740
The defendants, Zhou Xueman and Chen Bin,

293
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,110
intentionally and illegally deprived others of life,

294
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,630
resulting in multiple deaths,

295
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,630
and their actions constitute the crime of intentional homicide.

296
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,470
The circumstances are particularly serious,

297
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,090
causing extreme harm to society,

298
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,590
and should be severely punished according to law.

299
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,910
In accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law

300
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,440
of the People's Republic of China,

301
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,430
[Presiding Judge] [Judge]

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,440
specifically, Article 199,

Paragraph 1 of Article 48,

307
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,300
and Paragraph 1 of Article 55,

308
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,700
the verdict is as follows...

309
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,600
[Presiding Judge] [Judge]

310
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,370
All rise.

311
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,300
The defendant, Zhou Xueman,

312
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,070
is guilty of drug trafficking

313
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,450
and intentional homicide.

314
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,640
She is sentenced to death,

315
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,830
to be executed immediately.

316
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,780
She is deprived of political rights for life,

317
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,400
and all her personal property shall be confiscated.

318
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,210
The defendant, Chen Bin,

319
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,010
is guilty of drug trafficking

320
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,390
and intentional homicide.

321
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,440
He is sentenced to death,

322
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,830
to be executed immediately.

323
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
He's deprived of political rights for life,

324
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,380
and all his personal property shall be confiscated.

325
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,060
If you do not accept this verdict, defendants,

326
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,960
you may, within ten days

327
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,510
from the second day after receiving the written judgment,

328
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,710
file an appeal through this court

329
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,730
or directly to the Provincial

330
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,690
Higher People's Court.

331
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,010
[Presiding Judge] [Judge]

332
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,530
Defendants, have you understood clearly?

333
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,970
Understood.

334
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,500
Understood.

335
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,910
The court is now adjourned.

336
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,710
Take the defendants Zhou Xueman and Chen Bin

337
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,790
out of the courtroom.

338
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,330
Drive carefully on the highway.

339
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,450
The road is slippery when it rains.

340
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,160
It rained on the day I came, too.

341
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,670
I took Route Jiangping

342
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,810
and found Fan Lingling's dismembered body there.

343
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,760
I plan to take that road again today.

344
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,430
Why do you want to take the mountain road instead of the highway?

345
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,790
Besides, it's raining so heavily.

346
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,060
It shows how good my car is, don't you think?

347
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,910
By the way,

348
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,570
I have a gift for you.

349
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,950
What gift?

350
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,400
Why are you giving me such an expensive gift?

351
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,310
Take it.

352
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,100
Your old phone should have been replaced a long time ago.

353
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,830
Many things

354
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,320
should also start over.

355
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,410
Thank you.

356
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,790
Bye.

357
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,270
[Police]

358
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,420
[Dongzhou Detention Center]

359
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,070
Congratulations.

360
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,340
You've finally solved the case.

361
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,400
The two of us

362
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,040
can finally be honest with each other.

363
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,880
The day I was arrested,

364
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,960
you kept asking me why.

365
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,190
That's a question I've been asking myself too.

366
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,220
It must have been when I first came to your family.

367
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,280
Why couldn't you and your mother

368
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,470
be a little nicer to me?

369
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,830
I couldn't feel any warmth

370
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,680
or care from the family.

371
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,800
I felt like I was

372
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,780
an unwelcome, unlikable person.

373
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,650
I had no choice but to leave.

374
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,890
I wanted to be independent.

375
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,020
I wanted to make my own money.

376
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,170
I went to Yun'an.

377
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,360
I've never told you about

378
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,020
what happened to me in Yun'an.

379
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,460
There, I met

380
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,720
someone who could give me warmth,

381
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,120
Wang Xuehua.

382
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,460
You see,

383
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,620
the person I loved

384
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,900
died because of you,

385
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,270
and the person you loved died because of me.

386
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,170
So we're even now.

387
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,470
Actually,

388
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,860
the day Dad passed away,

389
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,350
I heard

390
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,290
what you said to Dad

391
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,480
in the ward.

392
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,630
[Ward 6]

393
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,790
Dad.

394
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,610
It was my fault that you and Mom died.

395
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,770
Dad.

396
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,290
I'm sorry.

397
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,290
I shouldn't have been so selfish and made you stop the car.

398
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,470
It was my fault.

399
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,540
It was all my fault. I'm sorry, Dad.

400
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,550
I'll get along well with Xueman from now on.

401
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,870
Dad. Please wake up, Dad.

402
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,410
Please wake up.

403
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,710
Dad!

404
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,200
All these years, I've been waiting for you

405
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,410
to take the initiative to tell me about this.

406
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,680
But you didn't.

407
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,070
Don't you think after that incident,

408
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,350
we both changed?

409
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,140
You've been acting,

410
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,630
and I've been acting too.

411
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,050
I've been playing the role of a caring

412
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,400
and nurturing older sister,

413
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,390
because I wanted you to depend on me.

414
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,820
I knew that's the only way

415
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,930
I could hurt you deeply one day.

416
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,940
I just wanted to take revenge on you, Han Qing.

417
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,180
That night when you came to see me,

418
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,480
I went to the kitchen to get some wine.

419
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,320
I put drugs in my glass.

420
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,620
I originally planned to

421
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,030
drink that glass of wine in front of you,

422
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,280
making you watch helplessly

423
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,030
as I died before your eyes.

424
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,760
To make you experience that feeling

425
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,440
that everyone you care about

426
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,030
will leave this world

427
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,420
because of your existence.

428
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,640
I didn't expect you to suddenly hug me

429
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,530
and say, "Xueman, I'm sorry."

430
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,220
At that time, I

431
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,940
was full of hope for the future.

432
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,300
Perhaps no one would know

433
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,640
my true identity.

434
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,360
I could continue to be your sister,

435
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,540
a real sister.

436
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,640
We could find a place

437
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,260
to start a new life together.

438
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,400
But it was all too late.

439
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,750
Han Qing.

440
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,310
I know you.

441
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,400
You'd definitely investigate until you get to the bottom of this.

442
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,970
Alright, I did as you wished.

443
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,120
I didn't leave. I waited for you at the teahouse.

444
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,020
That was the moment I'd been waiting for.

445
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,280
I'm about to die.

446
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,480
All the emotions of the world,

447
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,250
I will never experience them again.

448
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,710
But you're different.

449
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,890
You will continue to live alone

450
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,030
in this world pitifully,

451
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,170
with regret and guilt.

452
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,780
This is the outcome I wanted.

453
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,180
Xueman.

454
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,080
I might really have been too stupid.

455
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,510
I truly didn't feel that you hated me.

456
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,380
All that I felt from you

457
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,780
was care

458
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,540
and love.

459
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,600
For a long time, I was even grateful

460
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,230
that although I lost my parents,

461
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,880
I had a good sister.

462
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,420
All these years,

463
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,130
I've already

464
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,910
considered you as my real sister.

465
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,310
I don't hate you.

466
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,930
I don't.

467
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,000
I think if

468
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,780
time could flow backwards,

469
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,540
to when you first walked into my home,

470
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,030
I would hold your hand tightly

471
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,770
and call you "Sister."

472
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,990
I would not argue with you

473
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,470
or treat you unwell.

474
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,890
But Xueman.

475
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,840
Your experiences and sufferings

476
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,520
cannot be reasons to hurt others

477
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,260
or excuses for committing crimes.

478
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,940
Even in the darkest times,

479
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,290
we should strive to find light

480
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,900
instead of sinking into darkness.

481
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,250
Xueman.

482
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,890
I hope that in the last days of your life,

483
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,610
you can find

484
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,880
your inner peace.

485
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,630
Don't worry.

486
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,450
I'll take care of Mrs. Zhou.

487
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,230
In this lifetime,

488
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,570
it seems this is how it ends for us.

489
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,960
There's something in the tea leaves

490
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,480
I gave you.

491
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,010
Consider it a gift.

492
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,270
Live your life well.

493
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,260
Human emotions are just complicated.

494
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,970
That kind of feeling of loving and hating him at the same time,

495
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,790
wanting to kill him,

496
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,830
but unable to live without him.

497
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,310
Unhappy.

498
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,330
Are you happy today?

499
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,000
That night when we were having a late-night snack together,

500
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,960
you got drunk

501
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,360
and unintentionally

502
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,670
told me about your situation.

503
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,600
Only then did I realize

504
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,490
that there are indeed people

505
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,330
who don't choose to be unhappy,

506
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,470
but truly can't be happy.

507
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,800
Every time

508
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,260
I see you

509
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,870
staying at work after hours,

510
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,090
sitting there all evening,

511
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,410
I feel really sad inside.

512
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,970
I also feel really sorry for you.

513
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,370
I've always wanted to do something for you,

514
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,050
but

515
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,460
I didn't know where to start.

516
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,620
So,

517
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,310
I came here today.

518
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,270
Look.

519
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,070
Isn't it beautiful?

520
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,010
The sea.

521
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,620
Actually, whenever I'm in a bad mood

522
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,900
or when something's bothering me,

523
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,150
I like to

524
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,780
spend some time here.

525
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,920
Look.

526
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,630
Do you see those waves?

527
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,420
No matter what kind of marks

528
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,670
are left on the beach,

529
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,080
as soon as the water comes up,

530
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,960
it washes those marks away.

531
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,870
Then, the entire beach

532
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,730
looks brand new again.

533
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,210
I really like this feeling.

534
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,780
[Chen Bin] [Bai Xiaohui] [Dong Jie]

535
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,720
I know you probably

536
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,500
wouldn't come to the beach alone

537
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,630
for no reason,

538
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,600
so I recorded this video

539
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,630
to send to you.

540
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,460
When you're feeling down,

541
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,450
take a look at the sea,

542
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,330
and you'll feel much better.

543
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,570
You can quietly

544
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,680
play this video

545
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,380
and listen to the waves.

546
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,480
It can even help you sleep better.

547
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,640
Listen.

548
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,180
What I really want to say is,

549
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,790
they say

550
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,890
"Year after year, life is hard.

551
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,030
But year after year, we get through it."

552
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,750
Life is short.

553
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,980
Whether we're sad or happy, time passes all the same.

554
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,930
Why don't we try to make ourselves a little happier?

555
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,060
Now your secret

556
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,190
has been split in half.

557
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,340
You keep one half,

558
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,110
and I'll keep the other half.

559
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,260
You can keep it here

560
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,160
for as long as you want.

561
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,500
Together,

562
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,380
let's forget

563
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,970
all your painful,

564
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,410
regretful,

565
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,540
and bad

566
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,720
memories.

567
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,230
From now on,

568
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,900
in your life,

569
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,280
there will only be happiness

570
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,090
and beauty!

571
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,730
Han Qing.

572
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,120
Let's be together.

573
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:29,400
♫Listen, the waves of sound in the distance♫

574
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,060
♫Waves of♫

575
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,820
♫Low thunder growling♫

576
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,520
Unhappy.

577
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,620
♫We still don't want to leave♫

578
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,550
Are you happy today?

579
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,110
♫Until raindrops fall on our shoulders♫

580
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,210
♫The wind roars♫

581
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,600
Unhappy.

582
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,830
I knew you'd be here.

583
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,010
There's no case.

584
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,790
♫Dust swirls up, occasionally catching our eyes♫

585
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,350
Why are you here alone

586
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,500
for no reason?

587
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,050
I...

588
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,610
♫I can't help but slow down♫

589
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,150
The previous case

590
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,190
just ended,

591
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,410
and the new case

592
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,240
hasn't started yet.

593
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,720
I've seen you like this more than once.

594
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,540
♫No one talks♫

595
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,290
Whenever there's no case,

596
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,120
you seem lost.

597
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,570
♫Passing cigarettes silently♫

598
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,690
Actually,

599
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,460
♫Sharing bitter tea♫

600
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,130
in your life,

601
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,450
besides solving cases,

602
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:34,170
♫We share the sight of distant irises blooming capriciously♫

603
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,250
there are many other things you can do.

604
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,770
But that's

605
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,470
the only thing I want to do right now.

606
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,690
Although

607
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,970
I don't know

608
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,540
why you're like this,

609
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,170
♫Lying side by side like this♫

610
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,950
I believe

611
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,280
that one day,

612
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,810
your mind will change.

613
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:50,180
♫In the center of the vast wheat field♫

614
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,910
I'll wait to see that day.

615
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,180
♫Until no one can♫

616
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:05,270
♫Be closer to each other than us♫
