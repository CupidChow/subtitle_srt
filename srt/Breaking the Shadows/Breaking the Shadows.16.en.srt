Here, drink this first.

176
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,670
It's been a long time since I cooked.

177
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,050
I don't know if it tastes good or not.

178
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,660
I've made up my mind.

179
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,190
Let's go to Dali.

180
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,530
What for?

181
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,090
Didn't we agree last night?

182
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,600
We'll leave this place and start over.

183
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,530
I need to think about it more.

184
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,040
If I really quit my job as a police officer,

185
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,500
I don't know what else I can do.

186
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,690
I'm not like you.

187
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,210
You've been bold and good at business since you were young.

188
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,710
You even stopped studying back then

189
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,530
and went off to do business elsewhere.

190
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,160
Yes.

191
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,970
I remember

192
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,140
that summer

193
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,870
was particularly hot.

194
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,680
I went back home once before leaving.

195
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,160
Do you remember?

196
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,620
You're back.

197
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,090
I heard from Dad that you're going out to work.

198
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,620
Where are you going?

199
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,620
To Rongdu.

200
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,420
Is it far?

201
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,190
It takes a day and a night by train.

202
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,490
That's quite far.

203
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,510
Will you come back?

204
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,640
No.

205
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,030
That's pretty good.

206
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,460
I was really annoying back then.

207
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,780
Yep.

208
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,620
You didn't go alone, did you?

209
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
With your boyfriend?

210
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,230
I didn't have a boyfriend.

211
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,340
It was someone from my hometown.

212
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
Who? Do I know them?

213
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,360
You don't know them.

214
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,710
It was a relative from my mom's

215
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,460
hometown.

216
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,490
I remember after you went to Rongdu,

217
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,850
Dad often talked about you at home,

218
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,230
saying you gave up your studies

219
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,830
and went to do business elsewhere.

220
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,290
You were too young then.

221
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,470
You probably don't remember.

222
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,450
Every time I asked Dad for my tuition,

223
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,790
he would have a big fight with Auntie.

224
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,440
I didn't want to be a burden to anyone.

225
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,460
The world is so big.

226
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,950
I could totally earn money to support myself.

227
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,390
So I went to Rongdu with that relative,

228
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,190
hoping to earn money with my own labor.

229
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,570
Wen.

230
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,530
Come here.

231
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,550
A Mr. Zheng is coming to pick up some goods.

232
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,690
I need you to collect the payment for me

233
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,130
and give him the goods.

234
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,450
What kind of goods?

235
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,860
Wen, I can't do this.

236
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,260
I wasn't comfortable with it at first either.

237
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,440
But you get used to it over time.

238
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,640
But this is hurting people.

239
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes,

240
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,890
but it also makes a lot of money.

241
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,430
Girls

242
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,790
can also rely on themselves

243
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,910
to create their own world.

244
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,280
Even without a beard,

245
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,560
you can still be a king.

246
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,090
He gave me direction in life

247
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,730
and helped me grow up.

248
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,760
Gradually,

249
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,390
I started

250
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,780
learning how to do business from him.

251
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,290
What kind of business?

252
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,190
Selling construction materials.

253
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,160
He taught me how to negotiate and contend

254
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,930
with clients.

255
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,010
Soon, I was able to handle things on my own.

256
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,100
After that, the business

257
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,180
kept getting better.

258
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,200
We opened a storefront in the construction materials market

259
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,200
at Hongmenlou.

260
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
He asked me to manage it.

261
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,780
Then,

262
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,750
we moved to a

263
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,190
larger construction materials market.

264
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,370
He said he wanted to expand overseas,

265
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,780
so he went to Singapore.

266
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,920
He asked me to go with him,

267
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,910
but I didn't agree.

268
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,310
I didn't want to give up the business I had.

269
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,470
So, he left by himself.

270
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,000
For supplies, find Kyaw Myint Tun.

271
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,860
He's reliable.

272
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,040
After arriving in Singapore,

273
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,440
his business continued to thrive.

274
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,030
Later,

275
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,950
the next news I heard about him

276
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,580
was that he had moved from Singapore to North America.

277
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,350
Later, he passed away there.

278
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,180
What happened?

279
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,870
Cancer.

280
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,040
By the time it was discovered,

281
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,890
it was already in the late stages.

[Police]

283
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,550
He was afraid of worrying me,

284
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,270
so he arranged everything by himself.

285
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,280
Before he died, he entrusted me

286
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,190
to continue his life's journey

287
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,800
on his behalf.

288
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,300
What about you?

289
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,530
How did you end up in the tea business?

290
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,460
At that time, I really hadn't decided what to do.

291
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,170
I thought that if I came back,

292
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,440
I'd have to start all over again.

293
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,210
I was quite familiar with Rongdu,

294
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,470
so I stayed there for a while.

295
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,360
There were many teahouses there

296
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,540
and business was good.

297
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,510
As soon as I settled down,

298
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,030
I started to inquire about the market.

299

[Recording Hall]

300
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,010
I wanted to find a place to stock up.

301
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,600
I always wanted to prove

302
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,980
that I could run

303
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,470
a successful business by myself.

304
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,400
People there loved drinking tea

305
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,220
and the teahouse business thrived.

306
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,630
I thought this was pretty good,

307
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,560
so I found a teahouse

308
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,790
and started working there.

309
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,980
Later, I became good friends with the owner.

310
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,180
He taught me a lot about running a teahouse.

311
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,890
After that, I went to Yun'an.

312

Have you heard of it?

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,210
No.

317
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,350
I just heard

318
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,830
that there's a place in Yun'an

319
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,010
called Mengla.

320
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,230
That deceased hardware store owner, Wang Xuehua,

321
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,350
seems to have had something to do with that place.

322
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,120
We're investigating it.

323

Fu'er is famous for its ancient tree black tea.

327
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,480
When I arrived there,

328
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,250
I set my sights on a tea farmer.

329
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,930
I negotiated with him about becoming an agent,

330
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,670
but he thought I was too young and inexperienced.

331
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,710
He wouldn't give it to me.

332
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,060
So I just

333
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,250
refused to leave.

334
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,450
I picked and roasted tea,

working hard for the entire tea season.

336
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,280
Only then did he agree to give me the agent position.

so I came back.

344
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520

346
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,030
It's been so difficult.

347
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,060
Nothing in life is easy.

348
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,080
It's the same for you as a police officer.

349
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,120
You've sacrificed so much.

350
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,570
So, as we agreed yesterday,

351
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,970
about leaving this place

352
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,140
and starting over,

353
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,750
does it still stand?

354
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,540
Let me finish this case

355
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,440
completely first.

356
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,370
Okay.

357
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,510
I'll wait for your news.

358

[Exit] [Slow down]

361
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,360
Is that you in the photo?

362
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,330
Young lady,

363
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,620
where did you get that?

364
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,570
What about the person next to you?

365
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,420
Is that your girlfriend?

366
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,760
Why?

367
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,460
Are you interested in her?

368
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,710
She's my sister.

369
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Your sister?

370
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,370
Tell me about it.

371
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,840
What's the deal between you and my sister?

372
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,240
That's ancient history.

373
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,030
Why are you asking about this?

374
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,630
You dated my sister?

375
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,050
I guess so.

376
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,930
But not for long.

377
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,040
A flower can't bloom in cow dung forever.

378
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,030
You know what I mean?

379
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,140
Did you know Chen Bin back then?

380
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:32,970
Yes.

381
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,250
We were bouncers together at that time.

382
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,260
So my sister knew Chen Bin too?

383
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,300
Yes.

384
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,320
Why?

385
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,210
You and my sister broke up

386
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,540
because of Chen Bin?

387
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,480
It was between me and your sister.

388
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,510
We would have split up with or without him.

389
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,130
So he was involved.

390
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,230
If you say so.

391
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,330
Did my sister have a relationship with Chen Bin?

392
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,340
Chen Bin pursued her,

393
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,610
but it didn't work out.

394
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,270
Why?

395
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,350
You know your sister.

396
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,470
She's so strong-willed.

397
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,690
She would never go for

398
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,480
small-time thugs like me and Chen Bin.

399
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,820
She wasn't with us for long

400
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,730
before she left.

401
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,670
We didn't keep in touch after that.

402
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,100
I think she went out of town

403
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,220
to learn about business.

404
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,190
What kind of business?

405
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,190
I don't know.

406
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,690
Does Chen Bin know?

407
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,540
Not sure.

408
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,990
I never ask about

409
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,030
things that don't concern me.

410
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,870
Do you know about King of Hearts?

411
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,270
Who?

412
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,970
Is it related to me?

413
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,290
Chen Bin.

414
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,320
That's his nickname in the drug trafficking circle.

415
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,360
Chen Bin?

416
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,120
He's called King of Hearts?

417
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,200
You know what?

418
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,840
Given his luck with women,

419
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,270
that name suits him well.

420
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,000
King of Hearts.

421
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,990
Hello.

422
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,610
Hello.

The Mengba Prefecture Police Department

427
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,450
arrested a major drug lord from Sishiu named Tang Wen

428
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,460
[Mengba Substation]

429
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,750
in 1998.

430
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,430
He was executed in 1999.

431
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,500
The files mention he had two long-term associates,

432
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,530
a man and a woman.

433
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,870
The man was called Hua.

00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,140

436
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,070
Is there only a name?

437
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,690
What about other information?

438
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,510
Nothing else was mentioned.

439
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,200
The file only has this one sentence

440
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,940
about his associates.

441
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,810
But I heard from the old colleagues here at the bureau

442
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,000
that Tang Wen used to frequent

443

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,270
I'm planning to go there and investigate now.

446
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,440
Send me the relevant information about Tang Wen.
