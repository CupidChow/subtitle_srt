00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,250
Let's eat together in a bit.

191
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,480
No need; I have to leave soon.

192
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,510
You have to go so soon?

193
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,900
We have a mission today.

194
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,190
I made time to come here.

195
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,540
Fei.

196
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,910
Why didn't you call

197
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,210
to tell me about

198
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,160
something  this important?

199
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,930
I wanted to give you a surprise after the surgery.

200
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,670
Your mentor didn't want us to tell you.

201
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,340
He was worried it might affect your work.

202
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,980
Such a big deal,

203
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,750
and my mentor is still working today?

204
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,070
I just saw him at the courier station,

205
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,180
but he didn't say anything.

206
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,280
If he didn't work,

207
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,850
who else would earn money for Fei?

[Get Well Soon]

209
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,230
My dad is the best dad in the world.

210
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,260
He's earning money for my kidney transplant

211
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,220
and making my favorite food for me.

212
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,120
You're bringing so much stuff?

213
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,350
How long are you going for?

214
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,140
After the surgery, I'll have to stay in the hospital for observation,

215
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,790
checking for rejection reactions and such.

216
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,970
All together,

217
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,420
it'll be about half a month.

218
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,310
When is the surgery?

219
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,000
They say early tomorrow morning.

220
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,520
It depends on the situation at the donor hospital.

[Get Well Soon]

222
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,130
The kidney donor isn't in the same hospital as you?

223
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,190
No, it's not.

224
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,580
The surgery will be in the provincial capital.

225
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,600
The kidney donor is in Ningzhou.

226
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,140
They'll have to transport it from Ningzhou.

227
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,310
That complicated?

228
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,440
Qing, did you think

229
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,460
a kidney transplant would be as simple as arresting someone?

230
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,620
Just slap on the handcuffs,

231
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,450
and everything is okay?

232
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,310
Mentor,

233
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,410
are you off work?

234
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,930
How is it?

235
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,710
How's the case going?

236
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,330
After all our efforts,

237
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,640
they still slip away.

238
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,550
Don't be discouraged.

239
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,190
I think this case

240
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,960
will be cracked soon.

241
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,990
Mentor, I'll get going.

242
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,160
Okay, got it.

243
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,140
Han Qing?

244
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,580
Not everything

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,360
will get a good ending.

246
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,680
Sometimes, things might turn out badly.

247
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
So...

248
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,630
whether it's for the case, for yourself,

249
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,930
or for your people,

250
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,590
take it easy.

252
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,910
what do you mean by that?

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,910
Do you think...

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,190

255
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,880
No, no, no,

I-I-I...

257
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,700
I didn't mean that.

258
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,190
I-I-I just meant that...

259
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,930
no matter what happens,

260
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,300
it's not your fault.

261
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,910
Don't always be hard on yourself.

262
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,030
I understand.

263
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,260
Drive carefully.

264
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,470
This is from Han Qing and me.

265
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,130
Take it back.

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,790
Take it back!

00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,650
It's not for you.

268
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,160
What are you doing?

269
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,540
This is for Fei's medical treatment.

270
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:12,460
Please take it.

271
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,829
Mentor, please accept it.

272
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,980
This is our sincere gesture.

273
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,880
This is us. Just accept it.

274
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,490
Fei's matters are our matters.

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,839
We are her brother and sister.

276
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,450
If we don't help now, when would we?

277
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,589
It's for Fei, not for you.

278
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,560
And this is...

279
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,980
from Director Hou, Captain Fang,

280
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,080
and all the colleagues who pitched in.

281
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,080
In a few days,

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,170
they'll bring the leaders from the bureau

283
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,990
to visit you and Fei at home.

284
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,560
Now, everyone in the bureau,

285
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,510
including all the people in the criminal police team,

286
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,360

Don't worry too much.

288
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,330
And most importantly, don't rush into a decision

289
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,900
about early retirement.

290
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,630
Thank the bureau.

291
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,380
Thank you all for caring about me so much.

292
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,490
However,

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,260
for my daughter's medical treatment,

294
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,670
I can't always apply for subsidies

295
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,220
or rely on everyone's donations.

296
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,110
I don't want to cause this trouble for you.

297
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,280
[Loyalty, Justice]

298
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Thank you.

299
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,740
Thank you all.

300
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,480
Zhao!

301
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,740
Mentor.

302
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,770
What are you doing?

303
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,850
Go back and discuss it thoroughly with Mrs. Zhao again.

304
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,190
You still have several years before retirement.

305
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,540
No, why are you being so wishy-washy?

306
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,830
Let me tell you,

307
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,400
keep working hard under Captain Fang.

308
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,850
Don't cause any trouble.

309
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,910
Do you hear me?

310
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,330
Think about it again.

311
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,800
Just because you didn't become team leader

312
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,210
doesn't mean you have to retire early.

313
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,060
It has nothing to do with that.

314
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,930
I'm doing this for Fei,

315
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,250
understand?

316
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:04,920
Give it to me.

317
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,160
Give it to me.

318
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,750
Go back.

319
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,680
Dad, is it ready?

320
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,860
Almost done.

321
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,450
Here it comes, big wontons.

322
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:43,900
Try it.

323
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,500
It smells so good.

324
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,930
Shrimp wontons.

325
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,670
Are these really shrimp wontons?

326
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,080
Keep your voice down.

327
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,090
We're sneaking a bite.

328
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,990
Go ahead and eat up.

329
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,410
Eat up.

330
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,560
Make sure you eat your fill.

331
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,630
Did you hear me?

332
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,510
It's so delicious.

333
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,660
Is it really good, or are you just saying that?

334
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,880
It's really good.

335
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,960
If only I could eat this every day.

336
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,350
After my transplant surgery,

337
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,960
I still want to eat

338
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,730
your spicy diced chicken, sweet and sour fish,

339
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,430
and spicy chicken feet.

340
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,550
Sure, no problem.

341
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,830
Absolutely not.

342
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,450
Don't make such promises to her.

343
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,020
Let me tell you,

344
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,860
after the surgery, during your recovery period,

345
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,940
you'll need to follow the doctor's orders.

346
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,580
Eat only what the doctor allows.

347
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
None of what your father cooks is appropriate for you!

348
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,630
You're not allowed to eat this...

349
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,020
We're talking. You go back to your business.

350
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,550
Go on.

351
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,960
Listen, don't listen to your father!

352
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,930
Alright, alright.

353
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,520
Look how nagging my mom is.

354
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,040
Your mom is just concerned about you, you know?

355
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,790
I know.

356
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,320
After you've completely healed,

357
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,810
I'll make whatever you want to eat.

358
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,000
You have to promise me.

359
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,180
Do your best and stay strong.

360
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,530
No problem.

361
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,030
I love you.

362
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,160
It's so good.

363
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,010
It's okay.

364
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,370
Let's go.

365
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,710
Is this the place?

366
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,540
You there?

367
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,950
Just got here.

368
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,820
When can I leave?

369
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,350
Don't rush it.

370
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,690
All the police are looking for us now.

371
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,470
The police must have blocked all the roads by now.

372
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,750
Can I still get out?

373
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,300
Don't panic.

374
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,920
I'll figure something out.

375
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,850
Got it.

376
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,150
Brother Yong,

I want to take him with me

386

so that I can have a companion.

387

It'll be here in ten minutes.

Chen Bin.

409
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,810
So Chen Bin is the King of Hearts.

410
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,940

Is Chen Bin going?

417
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,410
He's not going.

418
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,810
He's going to Yun'an.

was the surgery successful?
