00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,470
Isn't it written right there?

I need to confirm this with you clearly.

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,470
During sentencing,

8
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,870
you must be very clear about it.

9
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,550
Don't try to scare me.

10
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,150
This stuff has nothing to do with me.

11
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,580
How does it have nothing to do with you?

12
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,790
I saw you take it out of the mailbox.

13
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,610
What I took was that promotional flyer.

14
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,980
How was I supposed to know that this stuff was in there?

15
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,470
Is that your mailbox?

16
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,390
No.

17
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,670
Then why were you taking things

18
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,380
from someone else's mailbox?

19
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,070
And you just happened to know where

20
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,110
they hide their mailbox key?

21
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,100
I was curious.

22
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,180
I saw someone put the key there, so

23
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,450
I opened it to take a look.

24
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,620
And then you just took

25
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,590
30 grams of high-purity heroin.

26
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,460
I was careless.

27
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,930
If I had known this was inside,

28
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,230
I wouldn't have taken it.

29
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,990

Li Xiaodong,

40
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,490
do you know the standard sentence for 30 grams?

41
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,640
For heroin, possession of 10 to 50 grams results in

42
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,350
a minimum seven-year prison sentence.

43
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,350
If you cooperate with the police

44
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,030
or assist in solving a major case, you may be eligible

45
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,180
for a reduced sentence.

46
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,080
Intentional concealment or refusal to disclose

47
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,800
will greatly increase the sentencing severity.

48
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,100
Well,

49
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,500
you're right at the 30-gram threshold.

50
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,080
There's room to go either way.

88

Do you always contact him by calling directly when you need goods?

113
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,310
Have you ever sent text messages or WeChat messages?

114

No.

115

120

was driving an unregistered vehicle

121

so we couldn't trace the owner's information.
