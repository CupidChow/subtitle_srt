He's just on a mission,

245
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,960
and none of you know about it,

246
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,510

He's not here.

266
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,950
He went to his father's place.

267

When will he be back?

268
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,970
It's hard to say.

269

Where does his father live?

270
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,550
His father lives in the provincial capital.

271
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,510
I called him,

272
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,800
but his phone has been turned off.

273
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,480
How can I get in touch with Song?

274
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,390
It's turned off, huh?

275
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,520
Do you have his father's phone number?

276
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,730
I'll call his father.

280
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
and I took it in for repairs.

282

283
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,110
that I urgently need to find him.

288
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,690
It's nothing.

289

Don't be so anxious, okay?

290
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,520
Do you know about the Wan Haiqiang case?

291
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,700
I've read the case files.

292
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,850
He disappeared after a transaction

293
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,790
and was eventually found dead in the southern suburbs.

294
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,600
At this year's meeting on tackling unsolved cases...

295
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,160
Zhong Wei and I

296
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,960
were jointly responsible for following up on this case.

297
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,380
Because there was another old case to follow up on,

298
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,080
I discussed with Zhong Wei

299
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
to let him mainly handle the Wan Haiqiang case

300
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,990
while I handled the other one.

301
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,860
If I had followed up on the Wan Haiqiang case

302
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,780
with Zhong Wei from the start,

303
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,190
perhaps he wouldn't have gone missing.

304
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,270
Zhong Wei's disappearance has nothing to do with you two

305
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,870
working on separate cases.

306
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,380
There must be a specific reason for his disappearance,

307
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,950
but that reason definitely isn't you.

308
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
That reason must have something to do with Chen Bin.

309
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,250
Captain He said it.

310
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,130
Black Cannon is Wan Haiqiang's successor.

311
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,830
Do you think it's Chen Bin?

312
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,800
I think so,

313
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,600
but I can't prove it yet.

314
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,100
It's just a good police officer's intuition.

315
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760

316
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,910

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,820
As police officers,

319
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,870
shouldn't we be less emotional?

320
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820

321
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,390

of a good police officer.

323
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,450

324
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,460

There are some things...

374
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,120
I've been wanting to tell you.

375
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,760
Sure.

Xueman.

379
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,680
Do you know how to make sweet and sour pork ribs?

380
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah.

381
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,830
You want to have some?

382
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,350
How do you make it? Is it hard?

383
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,570
Who do you want to cook it for?

384
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,020
Don't ask.

385
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,240
Being all secretive, aren't you?

386
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,950
Come on.

Hello.

The phone you're calling is powered off.

This...

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,520
is for you.

396
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,890
Didn't your phone die in the line of duty today?

397
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,830
I don't need it.

398
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,500
I'll buy one myself. Take it back.

399
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,700
I bought it for my mom's birthday

400
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,540
last year.

401
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,590
She didn't like it, so I've been keeping it.

402
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,800
It's been collecting dust at my place.

403
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,670
If you don't use it, it'll expire

404
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,500
and become useless.

405
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,970
Just think of it as recycling.

406
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,640
Well, if you insist.

407
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,550

Okay.

I'll be right back.

419
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,770
What's wrong, Qing?

420
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,220
A driver reported

421
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,160
that on the night Fan Lingling was killed,

422
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,870
he drove Fan Lingling and Bai Xiaohui

423
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,880
to Limin Lane.

424
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,500
Limin Lane?

425
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,600
The lane where Zhong Wei disappeared.

426
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,950
Liang.

427
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,900
Take someone with you

428
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,670
and wait at

429
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,150
the intersection of Taikang Road and Limin Lane.

430
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:42,900
Yes, Captain Fang.

00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,560

432
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Look at the camera. Give me a kiss.

433
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,930
Kiss me again.

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,780
[Cops are here to investigate Limin Lane]

Captain Fang.

437
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,090
What's the situation, Captain Fang?

438
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,800
The driver who reported said on May 5th,

439
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,780
after Bai Xiaohui and Fan Lingling got out of the car,

440
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,100
they entered Limin Lane.

441
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,510
We've checked the surveillance footage

442
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,300
and found this.

443
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,840
[May 5, 2017, Limin Lane Entrance, Auxiliary Lane Entrance]

444
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,030
Black-framed glasses.

445
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,090
That's him.

446
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,910
But Bai Xiaohui escaped.

447
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,510
After that, the old man with black-framed glasses

448
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,460
and Fan Lingling

449
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,210
never left Limin Lane again.

450
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,860
The video team retrieved the surveillance footage from that night,

451
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,130
but they didn't find any trace of that silver-gray minivan.

452
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,690
Not driving

453
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,160
doesn't mean they couldn't

454
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,510
leave Limin Lane.

455
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,740
What if they could avoid the cameras by walking?

456
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,650
We can't rule out that possibility.

457
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,990
We had the same thought back when we couldn't

458
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,480
find Zhong Wei here.

459
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,400
Moreover, this old man with black-framed glasses

460
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,560
was wearing a mask.

461
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,080
Even if he had been caught on camera,

462
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,270
we still wouldn't have been able to

463
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,140
recognize his real face, even without the mask.

464
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,010
What about Fan Lingling?

465
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,190
Fan Lingling couldn't have been wearing a mask

466
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,070
and left the lane, could she?

467
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,490
The autopsy shows she was killed that night.

468
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,860
If she hadn't left Limin Lane,

469
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,350
she must have died here.

470
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,850
Then how did the man with black-framed glasses

471
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,720
manage to transport her body out?

472
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,890
Even without surveillance,

473
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,480
he couldn't just carry her body

474
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,800
and walk out casually, could he?

475
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,470
That's what you need to find out.

476
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,090

477
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,920

00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,810
Yes, we have.

He has no criminal record.

During the investigation of Zhong Wei's disappearance,

487
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,280
I went to question him a few times.

488

Come on,

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,920

490
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,140

491
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,860
Why couldn't you?

492
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,320
During our time as partners,

493
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,670
have you ever dropped the ball?

494
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,780
That's true.

495
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,060
Who is it?

496
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,310
We're from the Municipal Criminal Investigation Unit.

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,200
were you in the shop on May 5th?

May 5th...

506
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,330
Yes, I was.

507
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,770

Your family isn't with you?

512
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,570
My parents are back in my hometown in the Northwest.

513
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,170
What about your wife and children?

514
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,260
I'm single.

515
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,790
Have you seen this girl?

516
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,120
No.

517
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,090
What about this one?

518
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,670
No.

519
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,630
Please take a closer look.

520
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,060
I haven't seen her.

521
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,800

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,530
No.

00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,310
I haven't seen it.

524
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,170
You don't usually drive?

525
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,650
Do I look like someone who could afford a car?

526
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,300
Have you seen this person?

527
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,480
I've seen this one.

528
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,860
He was on the news

529
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,640
the other day...

530
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,620
There is someone else upstairs, Mr. Wang?

531
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,620
There...

532
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,190
there isn't.

533
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,110
Can this be opened, Mr. Wang?

534
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:14,880
Yes, it can.

535
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:39,930
The rod is loose.

536
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,560
Mr. Wang.

537
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,380
What deities are you worshiping here?

538
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,700
The Door Gods.

539
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,230
The Door Gods?

540
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,880
Shouldn't door gods be sticking at the entrance?

541
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,310
Why is it on the second floor?

542
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,570
The feng shui master

543
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,920
said it'd conflict with the energy if put on the first floor,

544
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,680
so he told me to put it on the second floor.

How tall are you?

00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,390
About 176 or 177 cm.

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,640
I haven't measured in a while.

548
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,760
Quite a stock you have here.

549
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,190
You must sell axes here, right?

550
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,070
Yes, I do.

551
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,930
When was the last time you sold one?

552
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,600
I'll have to check on that.
