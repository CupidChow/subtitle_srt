00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,820
Hello, Dongzhou 110.

4
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,210
Please don't panic. Take your time.

5
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,850
Where are you located right now?

6
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,450
Is it Unit A2, Limin Lane?

7
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,550
Do you remember

8
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,040
the specific time frame when the incident occurred?

9
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,150
Well...

10
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,030
Hello.

11
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,940
Who are you two?

12
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,450
We're from the Municipal Criminal Investigation Unit.

13
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,460
Captain Han.

14
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,990
What's going on?

15
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,550
A resident called to report that

16
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,930
a stranger was choking her.

17
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,910
Who choked you?

18
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,350
I don't know him.

19
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,260
Take a look. Is this the person?

20
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,410
Yes, it's him.

21
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,680
Are you sure?

22
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm certain. It's definitely him.

23
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,870
He looked particularly frightening.

24
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,520
Is he the owner of Unit A1?

25
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,260
No.

26
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,060
The owner of Unit A1 doesn't live here.

27
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,020
The unit has been empty for over half a year.

28
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,050
But when you saw him,

29
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,050
he was locking the door, right?

30
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,660
Yes.

31
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,090
Have there always been two locks on this door?

32
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,130
No.

33
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,510
When did they add another lock?

34
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,570
In a moment,

35
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,810
start investigating from the door lock.

36
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,980
I'll tell them.

37
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,550
Did you hear

38
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,990
any noise from inside at night?

39
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,980
No.

40
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,700
There was no sound at all.

41
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,020
The lights in that unit weren't even turned on.

42
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,540
Do all the other residents here know

43
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,220
that Unit A1 is unoccupied?

44
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,240
Everyone knows.

45
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,030
Has anyone come by since then?

46
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,100
No.

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,310
If anyone had come, I would have definitely seen them.

48
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,960
The owner of Unit A1 has passed away.

49
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,220
His children said

50
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,909
they've never seen the chain lock on the door

51
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,040
and they didn't install it.

52
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,590
They haven't been back since he passed away six months ago.

63
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,290
that the jeans he was wearing

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,930
seemed a bit different.

65
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,260
How were they different?

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,960

Sure.

69

These jeans

73
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,370
are quite niche.

it's still a worn-out pair.
