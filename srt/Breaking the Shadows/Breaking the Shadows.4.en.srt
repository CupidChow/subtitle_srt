Let me give you a hug.

Let's see how heavy you are.

347
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,960
You've really gotten heavy.

Dad, take me out to play.

349

I haven't been out to play for a long time.

How about I take you out to play
in a few days, okay?

No.

Take me out to play now.

Mom,

I bought some snacks.

Right.

365

This is 70,000 yuan.

It's for Liangliang's medical treatment.

this treatment will cost?

Yes,

I know this money

370
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,000
is not enough for sure.

But this is all I can manage.

That's all I have right now.

please take good care of him.

In the basement garage of
Tianze Department Store.

was at the checkpoint on the south side of
Guangming Street in Jingxin County.

However, the north checkpoint

was alone in the repair shop.

00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,760
The surveillance settings were also altered,

449
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,510
so nothing inside the shop was recorded.

450

Also, the car parts were quickly destroyed.

451
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,620
I believe those scraps

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,980
is probably 8H5.

It was reckless for

not reporting major clues,

477
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,780
taking action without approval, and

disrupting the overall plan of

00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,240
that Zhong Wei has been missing for 52 days.

512
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,250
What do you mean?

513
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,570
I...

514
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,420
You mean he's done for, he's already dead.

515
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,130
Han Qing,

516
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Han Qing!

517
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,600
She, she, she...

518
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,100
She's just like that.

519
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,870
Usually cold towards others,

520
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,760
and always with a long face.

521
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,990
When Zhong Wei was around, he called her Unhappy.

522
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,700
But once she's on a case,

523
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,510
she throws herself into it completely.

524
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,860
You go ahead with your work.

525
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,720
Don't be angry, don't be angry.

526
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,620
Why would I be angry?

527
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,250
Han Qing, she...

528
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,260
Zhu.

529
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,420
Brother, you're back.

530
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,190
Everything okay at the factory?

531
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,020
Nothing much.

532
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:36,830
Oh, right.

533
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,590
That female police officer came looking for you again.

534
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,640
What did she want with me?

535
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,690
She didn't say.

536
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,740
I just told her you went out to Dongzhou.

537
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,110
What else did she say?

538
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,450
She asked where that pile of scrap went.

539
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,250
I said it was sent to the metal recycling plant.

540
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,140
Then she left in a hurry.

541
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,880
You go on with your work.

542
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,680
Alright, brother.

543
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,260
Come here, come here.

544
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,360
Come over here.

545
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,650
Go tell Captain Fang right away

546
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,360
to immediately investigate 8H5

547
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,030
and Lyu Jianmin.

548
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,070
It doesn't matter if I'm not allowed to go.

549
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,980
Let someone else go, go immediately.

550
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,390
Well.

551
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,450
Go now, understand?

552
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,410
I understand.

553
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,320
Then you go.

554
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,180
Well, I...

555
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,080
What are you laughing at? Stop laughing.

556
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,220
What's so funny?

557
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,650
Speak up.

558
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,320
Captain Fang

559
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,620
assigned you to take me

560
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,160
to investigate Lyu Jianmin's auto repair shop in Jingxin immediately,

561
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,380
and 8H5.

562
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,110
Captain Fang also called the Xia'an Police Station,

563
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,030
spoke to Chief Qin,

564
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,260
asking him to assist in our investigation.

565
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,830
Why didn't you say so earlier?

566
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,240
You didn't let me speak.

567
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,310
Qing, I found out who's been asking about Qiu Hailong.

568
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,410
But they discovered me.

569
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,480
Where are you?

570
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,050
Alright, got it.

571
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,590
You go to Jingxin first.

572
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,260
I need to take care of something first.

573
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,460
Hu,

574
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,960
how did you get hurt?

575
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,870
Qing.

576
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,180
-I’m fine.
-Don’t move.

577
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:26,970
I... I'm okay.

578
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,190
Who hit you?

579
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,310
Taotao.

580
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,690
He's a drug addict.

581
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,510
Qing, I found out

582
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,550
he's the one you're looking for.

583
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,900
Taotao?

584
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,500
He inquired about Qiu Hailong's address?

585
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,470
Yes.

586
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,410
He heard I was asking about him,

587
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,570
so he brought some guys and beat me up.

588
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,910
Where are they now?

589
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,860
They ran away long ago.

590
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,430
Don't worry, Qing.

591
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,090
I know where they hang out.

592
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,070
I can definitely find him.

593
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,490
Did you break any bones?

594
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,260
No.

595
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,550
Let me take you to the hospital.

596
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,520
It's fine, Qing.

597
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,190
I'm used to such beatings.

598
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,310
I'll be better after a while.

599
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,310
You go ahead and get busy.

600
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,570
I'll let you know when I find out...

601
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,320
No, no, no.

602
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,810
Don't investigate. I'll do it myself.

603
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,720
Qing, I'm really fine...

604
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,470
Don't move.

605
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,370
Stay seated.

606
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,500
You're not allowed to investigate anymore. Leave it to me.

607
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,520
Qing.

608
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,830
What's wrong?

609
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,410
He's drunk too much.

610
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,750
He's been drinking since noon.

611
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,070
He's been here the whole time. Hasn't left.

612
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,830
Lyu Jianmin.

613
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,070
Get up.

614
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,110
I'm up.

615
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,550
What's troubling you to the point of

616
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,510
to the point of drinking like this?

617
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,170
You went to Dongzhou today?

618
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,920
Yes, I did.

619
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,190
What did you go there for?

620
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,610
I went to see my son.

621
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,660
What else?

622
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,920
To give money to my mother-in-law.

623
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,760
What money?

624
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,730
Money for my son's medical treatment.

625
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,150
Do you know

626
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,450
how much it costs

627
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,100
to treat my son's illness?

628
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,040
It costs one million.

629
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,160
And that's not even enough.

630
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,640
I only brought 70,000 over to her.

631
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,540
That's all the money I have.

632
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,030
I can't steal

633
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,890
or rob.

634
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,270
I called your mother-in-law today.

635
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,580
She said you also went to see a friend.

636
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,210
Who is it?

637
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,010
Zhang Yong.

638
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,680
Why did you meet him?

639
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,010
What else could I meet him for?

640
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,600
To borrow money, of course.

641
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,310
Did you get it?

642
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,890
If I had borrowed the money,

643
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,830
would I be here drinking to drown my sorrows?

644
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,480
Is it illegal for me to drink now too?

645
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,390
The person who kidnapped Bai Xiaohui

646
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,610
was driving a silver-gray minivan.

647
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,270
The license plate number is

648
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,380
Jiang C85K92.

649
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,570
Have you seen this car?

650
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,370
[CCTV screenshot]

651
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,870
No.

652
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,750
[CCTV screenshot]

653
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,710
What about this one?

654
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,020
[CCTV screenshot]

655
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,890
Haven't seen that one either.

656
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,690
This car

657
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,930
was spotted on the street

658
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,390
of your repair shop the night before last.

659
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,000
I've already told you I haven't seen it.

660
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,140
Are you sure you haven't seen this car?

661
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,800
What are you implying?

662
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,330
If you have evidence, then take me in.

663
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,920
I've had enough of being out here anyway.

664
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,840
Lyu Jianmin.

665
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,600
Bai Xiaohui is your son's mother.

666
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,380
She went to Pingzhou

667
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,430
to get treatment for your son.

668
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,080
Kidnapping her

669
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,050
is equivalent to harming your son.

670
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,760
Do you understand?

671
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,230
Do you think Lyu Jianmin is telling the truth?

672
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,230
Not necessarily.

673
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,140
But I think

674
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,640
Lyu Jianmin wouldn't kidnap Bai Xiaohui.

675
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,280
An excellent cop's intuition again?

676
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,500
He's just like Bai Xiaohui,

677
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,390
wanting to save their child.

678
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,630
He has no reason to kidnap Bai Xiaohui.

679
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,110
But there are many suspicious points about him.

680
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,040
And that car hasn't been found either.

681
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,560
That's where the contradiction lies.

682
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,910
But that car

683
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,950
seems to have some connection with him.

684
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,600
What's our next move, Qing?

685
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,790
The car drove into Guangming Street. That's solid evidence.

686
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,320
It wouldn't appear there for no reason.

687
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,310
The time period

688
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,060
before Bai Xiaohui went to find Lyu Jianmin

689
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,600
also needs to be investigated.

690
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,020
Guangming Street,

691
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,020
the auto repair shop,

692
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,370
places we've already checked don't mean they're problem-free.

693
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,890
We can't overlook even the most unlikely places.

694
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,600
We can't overlook even the most unlikely places.

695
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,240
Where did you hear that phrase?

696
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,910
I

697
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,900
just thought of it and said it.

698
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,120
Did I say something wrong?

699
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,550
No.

700
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,500
Are you okay, Qing?

701
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,230
I'm fine. I just need a moment.

702
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,760
The information about the friend whom Lyu Jianmin Jianmin

703
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,350
went to borrow money from has arrived.

704
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:24,940
Zhang Yong.

705
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,070
Male, 41 years old.

00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,949

[Lyu Jianmin]

708
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,719
Sweetie, please step out for a moment.

709
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,190
I need to take a call.

710
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,270
Jianmin.

711
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,140
What's the deal with that car?

712
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,150
I'm asking you, what's going on with the car?

713
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,650
What car?

714
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,790
You told me there wouldn't be

715
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,320
any problem with that car.

716
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,030
The police just came by.

717
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,250
The police told me that Bai Xiaohui has been kidnapped.

718
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,550
The car used to kidnap her

719
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,860
is the one I helped you deal with.

720
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,860
What the hell is going on?

721
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,760
Tell me the truth, what's happening?

722
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,400
That's my ex-wife, the mother of my child.

723
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,610
Why did you kidnap her?

724
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,590
Lyu Jianmin, calm down.

725
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,110
Stay calm, okay?

726
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,480
Well, you...

727
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,000
Listen to me first.

728
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,330
I'm not lying to you.

729
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,540
I really don't know anything about this, I swear.

730
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,360
Can you stop shouting

731
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,910
and making a fuss everywhere?

732
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,440
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this for you.

733
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,120
I'll give you an explanation, okay?

734
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,880
Jianmin,

735
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,830
we're brothers.

736
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,070
Do you trust me?

737
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,900
I do.

738
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,690
Hand over the stuff.

739
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,750
Didn't I already give it to you?

740
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,660
The backup.

741
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,950
All of it.

742
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,600
This is true.

743
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,610
I gave you both the original and the backup.

744
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,190
Do you want to end up like her?

745
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,630
I'm not lying to you.

746
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,060
I really gave you everything.

What about the money?

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,800
One million.
