You joined a major case on your first day.

You kept discovering important clues,

560
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,260
and you investigated on your own.

561
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,740
Director Hou even specifically asked me to mentor you.

or was bullied or felt wronged,

588
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,650
she would keep them from me.
