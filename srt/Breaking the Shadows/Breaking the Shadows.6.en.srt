[Episode 6]

3
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,980
Mrs. Dong, you're here.

4
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,160
Is Mr. Chen in his office?

5
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,340
Mr. Chen was just working out.

6
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,150
I'm not sure if he's in his office yet.

7
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,990
Then, I'll go check.

8
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,000
Carry on with your work.

9
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,050
I'm with you now.

10
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,280
Stay focused.

11
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,720
Let me see who's looking for me.

12
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,390
Be good.

13
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,570
What's wrong?

14
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,210
Do you have other women besides me?

15
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,030
[Mrs. Dong is here!!!]

16
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,700
My wife is here.

17
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,770
Hello, Mrs. Dong.

18
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,700
Hello.

19
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,630
You're the new dance teacher here, right?

20
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,410
Yes.

21
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,430
Nice to meet you.

22
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,310
You're so beautiful.

23
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,730
What's your name?

24
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,610
Jiaqi.

25
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,630
That's a lovely name.

26
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,590
Is Mr. Chen in?

27
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,900
Yes, I've just finished scheduling classes with him.

28
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,310
That's all. You can go back to your work.

29
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:38,850
Okay.

30
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,900
Goodbye then, Mrs. Dong.

31
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,620
Goodbye.

32
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,020
Honey.

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,650
You've come at just the right time.

34
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,600
I think I'm the one who came too early.

35
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
What did you say?

36
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,420
What do you mean by that?

37
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,090
I don't mean anything by it.

38
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,690
Then, you're really no fun.

39
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,740
Right?

40
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,519
It really is quite boring.

41
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,240
Your chest workout today really paid off.

42
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,940
I worked on my legs today.

43
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,650
Did Xueman bring you the new tea?

44
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,260
She said the new tea from Fudong

45
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,900
is better than previous years.

46
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,620
The rainfall has been abundant this year.

47
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,220
I still have the tea she brought before,

48
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,750
the one from Yun'an.

49
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,170
She hasn't sent the one you mentioned to me yet.

50
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,620
Honey,

51
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,690
did you watch the news today?

52
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,810
No, I didn't. What's up?

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,620
The Public Security Bureau has issued a reward notice.

54
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,660
That receptionist of yours, Bai Xiaohui,

55
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,960
has been kidnapped.

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,510
Did you know about it?

57
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,560
Bai Xiaohui?

58
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,370
Who would kidnap her?

59
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,470
What for?

60
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,210
The police already came to ask questions?

61
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,190
They did, but they didn't mention anything about kidnapping.

62
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,950
Then what did you tell them?

63
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,430
What could I say?

64
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,790
She's just an employee. How would I know anything about her?

65
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,020
But I think

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,710
this Bai Xiaohui is quite interesting.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,390
She's usually so dull and unremarkable,

68
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,110
yet she's tangled up with a murderer.

69
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,750
You...

70
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,830
How do you know it's a murderer?

71
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,870
Didn't the news say

72
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,780
that person killed two other people as well?

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,310
Didn't you say you didn't watch the news?

74
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,340
Yeah, I didn't watch the news.

75
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,620
Then how did you know?

76
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,850
When I was working out earlier,

77
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
two guys were talking about it.

78
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,550
I just overheard them talking about it.

79
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,400
Now you're telling me about it too,

80
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,320
so I put two and two together

81
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,200
and realized that you were talking about the same thing!

82
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,510
Why are you getting all worked up?

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,520
Do you think Bai Xiaohui

84
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,530
might have already been...

85
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,300
What's it got to do with you?

86
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,280
Why are you worrying about this?

87
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,510
You're not a cop.

88
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm just worried.

89
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,230
I'm afraid what happened to her

90
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,800
might drag us into it.

91
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,210
Drag us into it?

92
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,500
What are you trying to say?

93
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,420
They've been on your case for so long

94
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,110
for that missing police officer earlier.

95
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,560
You know that.

96
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm thinking that if something

97
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
also happens to Bai Xiaohui,

98
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,720
that would give them another chance.

99
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,360
Hello.

100
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,980
Hello.

101
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,830
Are you Dong Jie?

102
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,550
Yes.

103
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,560
Who are you?

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,350
We're from the Municipal Criminal Investigation Unit.

105
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,410
My name is Han Qing.

106
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,730
[Police]

107
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,500
Oh, you're Han Qing.

108
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,140
I'm good friends with your sister.

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,990
She often talks about you.

110
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,790
Give me a moment; let me park my car.

111
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,450
Okay.

112
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,590
Do you want sugar, Han Qing?

113
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,620
She doesn't drink coffee.

114
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,940
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,980
Then I'll get you some water.

116
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,000
No need. Don't trouble yourself.

117
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,450
It's alright.

118
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,340
Please, have a seat.

119
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,710
Here.

120
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,270
Thank you.

121
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,560
Do you know Bai Xiaohui?

122
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,460
Yes, I do.

123
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,150
She works for my husband.

124
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,530
But I think I heard

125
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,180
that she hasn't been to work these past few days.

126
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,630
She's been kidnapped.

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,370
No way.

128
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,660
When did this happen?

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,320
Haven't you seen the news?

130
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,330
I really haven't been paying attention to that.

131
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,550
Oh my God, how could this happen?

132
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,950
If something happens to her,

133
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,240
what will happen to her child?

134
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,750
You know about her child?

135
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,620
Yes.

136
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,820
Because Bai Xiaohui borrowed money from me.

137
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,190
She said it was for her child's medical treatment.

138
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,120
How much did she borrow?

139
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,730
I lent her 50,000 yuan.

140
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,500
When did she borrow it?

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,460
Could you describe to us what happened at that time?

142
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,790
It was...

143
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,960
early March.

144
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,260
Yes, early March.

145
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,500
We agreed to meet at a café.

146
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,540
Hello.

147
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,770
Please, sit.

148
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,060
I'm Dong Jie.

149
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,640
I know.

150
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,610
I heard that your child is sick, right?

151
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,110
I think you might need this.

152
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,690
Take this.

153
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,940
No, no, no.

154
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,150
Mrs. Dong, this...

155
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,190
I... I can't take it.

156
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,330
Don't be so polite.

157
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,950
You work at Chen Bin's company,

158
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,500
so we're all family here.

159
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,380
Your child's treatment is important.

160
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,210
Come on, take it.

161
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,020
Are you very close to her?

162
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,940
Why would she borrow money from you?

163
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,730
Not at all. I didn't even know her before.

164
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,980
So, when she came to me,

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,980
I actually thought it was quite out of the blue too.

166
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,780
But I could understand.

167
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,180
After all, she works for Chen Bin.

168
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,210
I suppose

169
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,340
she must have heard about what I've been doing.

170
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,190
You've been doing something?

171
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,690
What have you been doing?

172
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,930
I've been doing charity work.

173
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,890
I've been doing this for ten years now.

174
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,800
We also have a chat group for our wives,

175
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,440
where we frequently organize charity events.

176
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,100
Your sister is also in the group.

177
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,280
Then, has Bai Xiaohui

178
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,710
ever contacted you again since that time?

179
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,690
No,

180
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,550
she didn't contact me after that.

181
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,970
To be honest,

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,270
I don't expect her to pay back

183
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,910
the money I lent her.

184
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,150
And we've already agreed within our group

185
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,710
that when it's time for her child's surgery,

186
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,680
we'll provide additional financial support.

187
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,960
Has Chen Bin ever mentioned

188
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,790
anything about Bai Xiaohui to you?

189
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,790
No.

190
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,540
Chen Bin, this man,

191
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,470
I think he probably...

192
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,360
he probably doesn't even know

193
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,430
about an employee like her.

194
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,150
Is that so?

195
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,410
When I asked him about it,

196
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,710
he seemed quite aware.

197
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,730
Really?

198
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,990
Well, that's not surprising.

199
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,240
After all...

200
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,160
Bai Xiaohui is the receptionist.

201
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,390
She often takes clients

202
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,440
to Chen Bin's office.

203
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,950
It's normal for him to be well aware of her.

204
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,870
Qing,

205
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,170
I think

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,570
there may be something off about Dong Jie

207
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,870
lending money to Bai Xiaohui.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,910
What is off?

209
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,910
The 200,000 yuan that Bai Xiaohui gave to Fan Lingling's parents

210
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,750
probably didn't come from Fan Lingling's jade gambling earnings.

211
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,000
I've looked into it.

212
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,640
Fan Lingling never invested in any jade business.

213
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,070
So, you mean Bai Xiaohui is lying?

214
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,790
I also asked

215
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,870
the doctor who's been doing dialysis for Bai Xiaohui's child.

216
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,600
The doctor said Bai Xiaohui was very eager to get a kidney transplant for her child

217
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,510
and had even said that as long as there was a kidney available,

218
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,110
the money would be ready immediately.

219
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,620
The cost of a kidney transplant is over several hundred thousand yuan.

220
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,900
Plus the 200,000 yuan given to Fan Lingling's parents,

221
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,480
that's a huge sum of nearly one million yuan.

222
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,030
If she has this million yuan,

223
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,020
why would she need to borrow 50,000 yuan from Dong Jie?

224
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,100
Not bad.

225
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,980
You've been investigating quite a bit behind my back.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,510
I'm just learning from your spirit, Qing.

227
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,860
Always digging a little deeper.

228
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,380
But you've overlooked one thing.

229
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,370
What's that?

230
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,740
Time.

231
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,410
Time?

232
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,070
The time Bai Xiaohui borrowed 50,000 yuan

233
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,510
from Dong Jie was on March 2nd.

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,870
But the lead about her having a million yuan

235
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,570
came up only recently.

236
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,990
These two time points

237
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,830
are more than two months apart.

238
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,270
If she had not had the million yuan two months ago,

239
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,950
then that 50,000 yuan would have been a huge amount for her.

240
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,640
Didn't you say it yourself?

241
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,240
This was the largest amount she'd ever had

242
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,170
in her account since it was first opened.

243
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,390
Two months ago, Bai Xiaohui's child

244
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,470
was receiving treatment at another hospital.

245
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,500
The attending physician said

246
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,610
Bai Xiaohui clearly stated

247
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,910
she couldn't afford the kidney transplant at all.

248
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,690
Even the ten or twenty thousand yuan for the hospitalization deposit

249
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
took her a week to scrape together.

250
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,430
I'm convinced.

251
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,350
Completely convinced.

252
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,310
You're still more thorough in your work, Qing.

253
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,300
I'll keep investigating where Bai Xiaohui

254
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,330
got that million yuan in cash.

255
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,150
You're here.

256
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,050

Thank you.

This is

260
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,160
all the information you wanted on that woman.

261
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,920
How long have they known each other?

262
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,120
Less than a month.

263
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,670
She's married?

264
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,890
To be precise,

265
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,330
she's juggling several men at once.

266
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,500
Quite impressive.

267
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,180
What are you going to do about it?

268
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,570
I'll handle it myself.

269
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,900
Thank you for your hard work.

270
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,080
My pleasure.

271

There's one more thing I need your help with.

272
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,550
Do you have her name?

273
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,390
It's just her WeChat username.

You haven't told anyone else that I asked you to look into

Bai Xiaohui before, have you?

Rest assured about this.

about your private matters.

You have to answer everything

341
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,330
you know honestly.

342
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,170
Yes.

343
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,210
I know. I'm being honest.

344
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,910
About Bai Xiaohui,

345
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,890
I really can't remember her clearly.

346
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,280
Did Dong Jie ever mention

347
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,900
including uremia patients

348
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,579
in the fund's support plan in the future?

349
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,560
Here is the thing.

350
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,920
We did support Fei before.

351
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,910
Later, I suggested this

352
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,710
to Dong Jie too,

353
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,490
but she didn't give me a direct answer,

354
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,829
so it just fizzled out.

355
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,430
How is Dong Jie's relationship with Chen Bin?

356
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
You mean her husband?

357
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,920
Pretty good.

358
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,840
Pretty good?

359
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,250
Chen Bin keeps mistresses,

360
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,620
not just one.

361
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,890
If you know about this

362
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
and still think their relationship is good,

363
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,600
what's your reason?

364
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,020
You know about it, right?

365
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,340
Yes, I do know.

366
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Actually,

367
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,560
Dong Jie knows about it, too.

368
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,780
She's fully aware of it.

369
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,230
Whenever Chen Bin has another woman, she deals with them.

370
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,090
No woman who's been involved with Chen Bin

371
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,310
escapes her notice.

372
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,260
As long as she wants something,

373
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,670
she'll get it.

374
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,910
She's maintaining her marriage

375
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,540

[Wexin Pay]

378
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,770
Why would Dong Jie tolerate this?

379
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,150
She loves Chen Bin.

380
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,950
She thinks it's fine for a man

381
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,090
to fool around outside,

382
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,110
as long as he doesn't take it seriously.

383
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,890
And Chen Bin,

384
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,730
he has never taken other women seriously.

385
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,250
Do you know that many of the women Chen Bin

386
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,960
couldn't get rid of later

387
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,170
were all dealt with by Dong Jie on his behalf?

388
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,170
I think the reason

389
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,010
Dong Jie can be so tolerant of this

390
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,940
[Stay away from my husband!]

391
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,660
is because she feels

392
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,750
she owes it to Chen Bin from the past.

393
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,060
Owes it to Chen Bin? Why?

394
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,480
She was pregnant

395
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,070
with Chen Bin's child.

396
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,880
But at that time,

397
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,260
she was too young.

398
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,500
She wanted to continue her dance career.

399
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,090
For the sake of her figure,

400
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,580
she decided not to keep the child.

401
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,980
And she didn't tell Chen Bin about it in advance.

402
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,550
Is Dong Jie really not angry?

403
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,620
Who would not be angry?

404
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,770
I guess she's come to terms with it.

405
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,530
She has her own way of venting.

406
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,960
She listens to music, does charity work,

407
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,040
[Okay, Mrs. Dong, I'm sorry.]

408
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,610
and helps people in need

409
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,360
to forget about these unpleasant things.

410
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,890
I really can't understand it.

411
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,790
Knowing Chen Bin is like this,

412
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,000
how can Dong Jie still be with him?

413
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,570
Human emotions are just complicated.

414
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,200
That kind of feeling of loving and hating him at the same time,

415
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,120
wanting to kill him,

416
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,160
but still unable to live without him.

417
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,270
All these feelings can coexist.

your license plate is connected to a homicide case.

00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,140

No, this is the first time.
