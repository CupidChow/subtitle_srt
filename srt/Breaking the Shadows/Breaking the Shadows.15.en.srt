192
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,720
and the first crime scene at Unit A1, Limin Lane,

193
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,960
confirming that they belong to the same pair of shoes.

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,440
Inside the shoes, we also found

195
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,500
a pair of 9 cm hidden height-increasing insoles.

196
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,590
Given Wang Xuehua's height of 1.76 meters,

197
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,960
wearing these shoes

198
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,710
would bring him to 1.85 meters,

199
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,590
which aligns with

200
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,470
the height of Black Frame.

201
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,450
We found 2 unmarked medicine bottles

202
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,180
in the drawer of the hardware store.

203
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,260
Upon testing, the pills inside

204
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,910
[Dongzhou City Public Security Bureau]

205
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,830
were identified as illegal hallucinogenic drugs.

206
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,830
This

207
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,830
corroborates the symptoms

208
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,710
Fangfang exhibited after leaving his store.

209
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,310
On the nights Wang Xuehua disposed of Fan Lingling's body

210
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,600
and killed Zhang Yong,

211
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,850
he drugged Fangfang

212
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,810
and took advantage of that time to go out and commit the crimes.

213
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,600
He then used Fangfang's unawareness

214
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,950
to create a perfect alibi for himself.

215
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,330
We also found the privately constructed basement.

216
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,080
Tests on the walls and floor revealed

217
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,750
residues of a strong alkaline cleaning solution.

218
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
The entire basement had been thoroughly cleaned.

219
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,200
We believe

220
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,330
that was the primary crime scene

221
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,250
where Wang Xuehua committed murder and dismemberment.

222
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,080
In the basement, we found a

223
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,550
homemade canvas bag

224
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,930
containing a modified hunting rifle,

225
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,339
a modified starter pistol,

226
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,339
over 50 rounds of various ammunition,

227
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,430
and the handgun

228
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,210
with a scratched-off serial number

229
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,200
that Wang Xuehua used to commit suicide.

230
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,619
Wang Xuehua

231
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,730
is the old man with black-framed glasses

232
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,310
and the true culprit behind the serial dismemberment cases.

233
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,869
Alright.

234
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,000
Comrades,

235
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,109
the entire case is now mostly clear.

236
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,990
The criminal organization

237
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,370
led by the King of Hearts

238
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,870
has been dismantled,

239
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,170
with all known suspects

240
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,220
apprehended

241
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,470
except for the ringleader, Chen Bin.

242
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,710
Our next task is to

243
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,920
organize all clues

244
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,020
and evidence,

245
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,270
and clarify the facts and motives of the crimes.

246
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,870
Additionally, Chen Bin's

247
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,030
potential contact—

248
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,020
his wife, Dong Jie—

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,610
must be a key focus.

250
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,670
If Chen Bin reaches out to her,

251
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,260
we must be aware of it

252
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,870
and work to capture him as soon as possible.

253
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,790
-Yes!
-Yes!

254
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,470
Yes!

255
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,590
Meeting adjourned.

256
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,360
Today is Children's Day.

257
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,750
I wish each of you a happy holiday

258
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,430
and hope you grow up strong and healthy.

259
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,760
Thank you, Auntie.

260
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,160
I brought you cake today.

261
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,470
Everyone will receive a gift.

262
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,490
I'll have the teacher hand them out.

263
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,230
A drug lord?

264
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,720
You mean Chen Bin?

265
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,080
I didn't expect that.

266
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,790
My goodness.

267
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,820
I thought all Chen Bin did

268
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,300
was flirt with beautiful women.

269
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,490
Has he contacted you?

270
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,760
Do you think

271
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,150
he has any reason to contact me?

272
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
What do you mean?

273
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,440
We've been married for so many years.

274
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,040
As far as I know,

275
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,550
there are only 2 things in his life—

276
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,990
fitness

277
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,230
and fooling around with women.

278
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,790
He never cared about his family.

279
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,540
You're suggesting that he is in the drug business?

280
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,280
If he were to contact someone,

281
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,950
it'd probably be

282
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,950
one of those women around him,

283
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,090
not me.

284
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,620
He left in a hurry,

285
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,680
so he must have left some loose ends behind

286
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,440
and might need to contact you for help.

287
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,390
I've actually helped him quite a bit before.

288
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,010
Every time he got

289
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,940
tired of a woman and couldn't shake her off,

290
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,900
he'd come to me for help.

291
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,650
Let's not talk about this anymore.

292
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,710
Don't worry, I promise you that

293
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,110
if he contacts me,

294
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,570
I'll let you know immediately.

295
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,460
Thank you.

296
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,500
Do you really think he's the King of Hearts?

297
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,450
Isn't he?

298
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,510
I don't think he is.

299
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,860
You're playing cards again?

300
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,250
You play and calculate them every day;

301
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,070
do you understand playing cards?

302
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,490
Of course.

303
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,350
What's special

304
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,780
about this card?

305
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,280
Nothing special.

306
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,120
Look carefully.

307
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,120
What's different about this one compared to the others?

308
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,180
The suit is different.

309
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,530
What else?

310
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,370
The king's face is turned in a different direction.

311
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,160
Anything else?

312
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,290
That's all, nothing else.

313
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,410
The King of Hearts doesn't have a mustache.

314
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,220
That's true.

315
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,170
Originally, cards

316
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,610
were carved on wooden boards.

317
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,190
According to legend, when the craftsman

318
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,140
was carving the King of Hearts,

319
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,710
he accidentally slipped

320
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,710
and shaved off his mustache.

321
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,350
This mistake was then carried on to this day,

322
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,290
making

323
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,910
the King of Hearts

324
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,560
the only king without a mustache.

325
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,760
Are you serious? You sound so earnest.

326
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,720
Look at it closely again;

327
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,310
there's another difference.

328
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,810
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense.

329
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,710
Tell me quickly.

330
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,060
What else is different?

331
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,210
The King of Hearts is the only king

332
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,450
who hides his weapon.

333
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,970
A sharp blade concealed

334
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,380
beneath a beautiful and gentle appearance.

335
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,600

337
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,760
Speak.

338
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,750
Bai Xiaohui's mom is at the station looking for you.

339
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,470
Okay, I'll be right back.

340
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,420
Auntie Yao,

341
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,820
you're looking for me?

342
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,020
Ms. Han,

343
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,570
I have something to tell you.

344
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,310
Go ahead.

345
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,760
I just went to see Jianmin.

346
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,370
He told me that

347
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,130
when Xiaohui visited him,

348
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,790
she mentioned something.

349
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,720
What was it?

350
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,320
One million yuan?

351
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,950
How did you get so much money?

352
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,220
Don't ask anymore.

353
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,440
Anyway, the money is ready,

354
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,850
and I've already hidden it.

355
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,820
If anything happens to me,

356
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,720
you must protect that money at all costs.

357
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,340
Jianmin told me that

358
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,010
Xiaohui hid the money in the pigeon cage.

359
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,040
He asked me to keep it safe

360
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,800
for Liangliang's treatment.

361
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,740
Ms. Han,

362
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,870
can this be considered as Jianmin

00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,070
he'll have to rely on his dad in the future.

Please help him.

367
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,320
Can it be considered redeeming himself through his actions?

368
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm begging you.

how are you going to repay the money

379
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,980
your wife borrowed from me?

380
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll figure something out.

381
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,540
You need to give me some time.

382
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,690
You need to wait until I sell this house.

383
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,870
Selling a house

384
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,370
isn't that easy now.

385
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,070
Besides,

386
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,430
the money from selling your house might

387
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,190
not even be enough to cover what your wife borrowed from me.

388
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,660
It's enough.

389
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,710
No wonder you're a cop;

390
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,510
you figured it out?

391
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,620
Yes.

392
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,910
You're trafficking drugs.

393
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,120
I can't be part of this.

394
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,250
But it seems like you've already been

395
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,390
involved for a while.

396
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,760
That was because I didn't know before.

397
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,380
Who would believe that if I told them?

398
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,210
Don't forget, I used to be a cop.

399
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,720
I've arrested dealers like you before.

400
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,620
You used to be a good cop,

401
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,640
but now you're already

402
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,910
helping us transport drugs.

403
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,610
Don't push me too far.

404
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,920
I can do anything.

405
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,070
At worst, it's just death.

406
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,710
Are you afraid of dying?

407
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,270
I'm not.

408
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,090
But you will be,

409
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,960
because you have a family—

410
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,410
a wife and a lovely daughter.

411
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,600
The money your wife borrowed from me

412
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,400
will buy your daughter's health.

413
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,890
But think about this—when she grows up

414
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,120
and realizes that her healthy body

415
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,390
came at the cost of her father dealing drugs,

416
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,210
how will she feel?

417
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,550
How will she live that pain for the rest of her life?

418
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,270
[Jin Huan]

419
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,960
[I've done it.]

420
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,090
We did take your money before,

421
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,510
but I didn't know at the time.

422
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,020
I can never be involved in

423
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,790
drug trafficking.

424
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,740
But don't worry,

425
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,630
I will pay you back.

426
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,900
No matter what I do in the future

427
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,750
or how I do it,

428
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,350
I will never break the law—

429
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,570
even if it costs me my life.

430
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,330
Zhou Xueman,

431
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,510
I hope you can stop

432
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,360
for Han Qing's sake.

433
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,220
Consider this my plea.

434
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,670
Do you recognize this person?

435
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,400
Where is he?

436
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,830
What happened to him?

437
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,920
He's already dead,

438
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,390
just like what you see in the picture.

439
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,320
I'll kill you!

440
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,790
Let go! Let go!

441
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,370
Let go! Let go!

442
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,350
If you don't continue helping us,

443
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,660
your wife and your kid will be killed like Zhong Wei.

444
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,970
Now, can we

445
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,670
have a proper conversation?

446
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,480
A female officer just came by

447
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,210
asking about that male officer.

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,429
[March 16, 2017]

449
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,460
But she didn't seem suspicious of me—

450
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,120
she was just gathering information.

451
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,429
But when they go back,

452
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,710
they'll definitely check the surveillance footage.

453
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,239
They'll definitely find out that

454
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,550
the male officer

455
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,790
was following me last night.

456
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,690
[March 16th, 2017]

457
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,909
What's there to be afraid of?

458
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,850
That male officer is already dead anyway.

459
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,080
So what should I do?

460
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,730
Okay, got it.

461
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,580
This is the 53-second segment

462
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:52,000
that was cut from the video Bai Xiaohui secretly recorded of Chen Bin.

463
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,210
Did Bai Xiaohui and Fan Lingling

464
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,880
use it to blackmail Chen Bin,

465
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,320
which ultimately led to the 506 Series

466
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,640
dismemberment murder case?

467
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,960
This video also proves that

468
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,100
Zhong Wei

469
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,480
was brutally killed by them.

470
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,150
But Chen Bin

471
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,460
isn't even the ringleader of the group.

472
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,550
So what should I do?

[March 16th, 2017]

474
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,050
Okay, got it.

475
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,220
From Chen Bin's tone, we can tell that

476
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,290
he was seeking instructions from a superior.

477
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,740
The person he was speaking to

478
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,960
might be the real mastermind behind everything.

479
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,050
Could it be that

480
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,030
there's someone even higher up

481
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,860
than the King of Hearts?

482

The King of Hearts

483
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,010
isn't Chen Bin.

A king without a beard—

00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,350
sharpness concealed beneath

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,420
Easy to guess, right?

Yes, the "K" on the map

509
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,390
is not him, but the King of Hearts.

510
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,920
He's using this method of burying the bodies

to show loyalty and devotion to the King of Hearts.
