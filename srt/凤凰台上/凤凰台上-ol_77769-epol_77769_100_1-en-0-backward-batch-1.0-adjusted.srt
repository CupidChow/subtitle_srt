<i>Grand Tutor Ling,</i>

5
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>when will you let me rule in my own right?</i>

6
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>The day Cangcang weds you</i>

7
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,840
<i>will be the day you take real power.</i>

8
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,240
<i>You asked me here</i>

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,200
<i>because of your master?</i>

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,960
<i>You knew, yet you still dared to come?</i>

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>I killed him</i>

12
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,240
<i>for a reason.</i>

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,479
<i>A reason?</i>

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,480
<i>Yes.</i>

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,200
<i>One I cannot tell you.</i>

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
<i>Then I won't ask.</i>

17
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,320
<i>I only want the outcome.</i>

XIAO HUAN, EMPEROR OF GREAT QI

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,120
LING CANGCANG, GRAND TUTOR'S DAUGHTER

20
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,800
What are you waiting for?

21
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,400
Didn't you say you wanted to kill me?

22
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,600
I will give you the chance.

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,360
Do it.

24
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,840
Ling Cangcang,

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,880
you're too soft after all.

26
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,840
Better prepare for our wedding.

27
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
You killed my master.

28
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,640
How could I ever marry you?

29
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,000
You will,

30
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,800
because you have no choice.

31
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,160
In two months,

32
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,360
I will make you my empress.

33
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,080
Hongqing,

34
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,200
escort the future
empress back to the Ling Manor.

35
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

36
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
LING MANOR

37
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,200
LING XUEFENG, GRAND TUTOR OF GREAT QI

38
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,720
Father.

39
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
I will never marry him.

40
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,120
My Lady,

41
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,040
whatever you decide,
you should talk it out with Father.

42
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
Cangcang,

43
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,600
it is

44
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
an imperial decree.

45
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,280
To defy it is a crime

46
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,160
punishable by
the extermination of the whole clan.

47
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Father,

48
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,520
you helped him to the throne,

49
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,400
and this is how he repays you?

50
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
Mind your tongue.

51
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,120
Father.

52
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,280
He is now the Emperor.

53
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,520
"When a ruler commands death,

54
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,000
a subject must obey."

55
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,160
So an emperor

56
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,520
may kill at will and trample human life?

57
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,280
His Majesty is the ruler of Great Qi.

58
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
What he does and whom he kills

59
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
is not for others to judge.

60
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,640
But he killed my master!

61
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,000
Father, I'd rather die than marry him!

62
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,960
<i>There were reasons</i>

63
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
<i>your Master Li Lu had to die.</i>

64
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,840
Luo.

65
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,040
LUO XIANXUE, GRAND TUTOR'S ADOPTED SON

66
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Here.

67
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
It's snowing hard.

68
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Don't catch cold.

69
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,640
Let's go.

70
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,560
Cangcang!

71
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,400
Come on.

72
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
If you wish to die,

73
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,000
I can oblige.

74
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,880
Mind your manners!

75
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,480
Stand down!

76
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
Your Majesty, I am guilty.

77
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
What guilt?

78
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,440
You are my teacher.

79
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,000
You once fought alongside my father.

80
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,960
As I said before, outside the court,

81
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,760
you need not kneel to me.

82
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,760
I failed to discipline my child.

83
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,000
Please forgive me!

84
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,600
Traitors courting death

85
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,400
have nothing to do with you.

86
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,600
Xiao Huan!

87
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,840
There's no love between us.

88
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,080
Why can't you let me go?

89
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,240
We are bound by fate.

90
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,160
I will never let you go.

91
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,360
Let's go.

92
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
What an intrepid warrior,
repaying kindness with betrayal.

93
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,760
I forced him to take me.

94
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,720
Come at me.

95
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,360
Luo Xianxue,

96
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,240
I warned you back in Southern Chu.

97
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,880
Did you really think you could escape?

98
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
Father, forgive me.

99
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,120
Dying by my sword

100
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,800
- is no injustice to you.
- Xiao Huan!

101
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,560
Let him go,

102
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,720
or I'll take my life right here.

103
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880
If you dare take your own life,

104
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,240
the entire Ling clan
will follow you to the grave.

105
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,360
Your Majesty…

106
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,120
Father…

107
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,640
Your Majesty, I am guilty.

108
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
I beg

109
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
to resign my post.

110
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Please, Your Majesty,

111
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
show mercy and spare

112
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,720
my only daughter.

113
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,320
Father…

114
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,600
Xiao Huan,

115
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,920
what do you want from me?

116
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I want you

117
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,400
to marry me of your own free will.

118
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,760
Then spare the Ling clan

119
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,560
and spare Luo Xianxue!

120
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,200
Is this how you beg?

121
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,600
I, Ling Cangcang,

122
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,720
humbly beg Your Majesty

123
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,680
to spare the Ling clan

124
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,000
and spare Luo Xianxue.

125
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,920
I will return home with my father

126
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
and marry you

127
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,240
in two months.

128
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,560
Oh?

129
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
You make it sound as if I forced you.

130
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,360
I, Ling Cangcang,

131
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
wish

132
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,360
to marry Your Majesty.

133
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,080
Please

134
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
grant your consent.

135
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,080
- Hongqing.
- Yes.

136
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,800
Take Luo Xianxue back to the palace.

137
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,040
He'll bear witness to
the future empress's vow.

138
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Understood.

139
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,920
Grand Tutor Ling,

140
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,720
you truly played a fine move.

141
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,120
You let Cangcang go

142
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,760
and then used the lives
of your clan and Luo Xianxue

143
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
to make her agree to marry me.

144
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,760
You remain the kind father in her heart,

145
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,240
while I have become the ruthless villain.

146
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,320
Your skill truly surpasses mine.

147
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,800
Your Majesty,

148
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
you've gotten what you wished for.

149
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,160
Are you not satisfied?

150
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,160
TWO MONTHS LATER

151
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
CHANGHE GATE

152
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
By imperial decree,

153
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,600
the daughter of Grand Tutor Ling,
Ling Cangcang, is hereby named Empress.

154
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,080
The officials shall attend
the ceremony bearing their insignias.

155
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,200
DU TINGXIN,
IMPERIAL PRECEPTOR OF GREAT QI

156
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,440
Madam,
His Majesty's wedding is about to begin.

157
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,360
Please come down and change.

158
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,120
The refinement of
the pill is at a critical stage.

159
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840
I cannot afford distraction.

160
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,360
Such worldly affairs

161
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,600
need not concern me.

162
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
Understood.

163
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
{\an8}THE CAPITAL

164
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,880
By decree,

165
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,000
I come at this auspicious
hour to escort Her Majesty.

166
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,400
I follow the rites as commanded.

167
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,680
The auspicious hour is upon us.

168
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,480
Please don your coronet and bridal robes.

169
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,319
That snowy night,

170
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,880
who was it that said
she would willingly marry me?

171
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,160
What is it?

172
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,079
Have you changed your mind?

173
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,079
How could I

174
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,839
willingly marry a murderer?

175
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,880
Don't you want

176
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,560
to enter the palace and
see your adoptive brother?

177
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,280
I've had Li Hongqing look after him.

178
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,400
I wonder

179
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,640
if he's grown used to life in the palace.

180
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,320
Heed His Majesty!

181
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,280
I believe

182
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
the way of governance should
follow the order of Heaven and Earth,

183
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,040
and harmony within
the household is the root of all virtue.

184
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,800
To teach and to
guide both family and state,

185
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
a woman's virtue is
the foundation of royal morality.

186
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
Through such virtue,
the world may share one code of ethics,

187
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
and all hearts may
turn toward righteousness.

188
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,520
Thus, together we may honor our ancestors

189
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,080
and uphold filial
piety throughout the realm.

190
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,800
Ling,

191
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,720
the daughter of Grand Tutor Ling Xuefeng,

192
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,160
was born into a noble house

193
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,880
of enduring virtue and good fortune.

194
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
May the Empress and I

195
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,520
strive in diligence and respect,

196
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
cultivate virtue,

197
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
and carry forward
the grace of our forebears.

198
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,120
May enlightenment and harmony spread,

199
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,320
bringing everlasting blessings

200
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,160
to our descendants and our people.

201
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,920
Let this be proclaimed

202
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,320
to all under Heaven.

203
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,360
The ceremony is complete.

204
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,160
Please, Your Majesty, keep your word

205
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
and release Luo Xianxue.

206
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,400
We haven't drunk the nuptial wine yet.

207
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,480
Once we do,

208
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,880
you'll let him go.

209
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,160
The wine is finished.

210
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,880
Please honor your promise, Your Majesty.

211
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,560
From this day on,

212
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,560
you are my empress.

213
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,360
Go and change.

214
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,640
Get out.

215
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
You are my empress.

216
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,840
Why should I leave?

217
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
You promised me you'd set him free.

218
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,200
- Leave us.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

219
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,440
On this joyous day,

220
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,040
is Luo Xianxue all you can think about?

221
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,880
Between you and me,
is there truly any joy to speak of?

222
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,120
Do you love him?

223
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,760
My empress,

224
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,920
who married me of her own accord,

225
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,640
did so out of love for Luo Xianxue?

226
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,480
Is that why you
tried to run away with him?

227
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,720
Answer me.

228
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
Cangcang, I truly love you.

229
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,640
<i>Marry me.</i>

230
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,720
Yes, I love him.

231
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
If I could choose,

232
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,240
I'd flee this cursed city with him.

233
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,240
Are you satisfied now?

234
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,000
Do you know what you just said

235
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,280
is enough to have him
executed ten thousand times?

236
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,800
If he dies, I won't live either.

237
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,040
Threatening me with death?

238
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,720
That only works if I care about you.

239
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
Do you really think I do?

240
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,600
<i>You are destined</i>
<i>to become Empress someday.</i>

241
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,800
I don't care for that title.

242
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,560
I just want to win someone's heart
and roam the world with my sword.

243
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,440
<i>Find a chance to leave first.</i>

244
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,560
I will make sure you are unharmed.

245
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,960
<i>If you dare take your own life,</i>

246
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,120
the entire Ling clan
will follow you to the grave.

247
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Who are you?

248
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,920
Are you Ling Cangcang

249
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,040
or the Empress of Great Qi?

250
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,280
Do you love the Emperor?

251
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,000
Or do you love

252
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
Bai Chifan?

253
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,600
Bai Chifan…

254
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,040
Why did you lie to me?

255
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,080
He does not exist.

256
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,760
Bai Chifan…

257
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,600
Bai Chifan never existed.

258
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,480
Bai Chifan…

259
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,120
You slept well last night, my empress.

260
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,640
What do you want?

261
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,720
Why so hostile toward me?

262
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,240
I came first thing this morning
with a gift for you.

263
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,840
What gift?

264
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,120
Your adoptive brother, Luo Xianxue,

265
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,160
was returned
to the Ling Manor this morning.

266
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,720
Really?

267
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,520
A ruler does not jest.

268
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

269
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,640
I kept something of Luo's

270
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,840
as a present for you.

271
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,360
Xiaoshan, pick up the gift I brought.

272
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,600
Keep it safe for the Empress.

273
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

274
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,720
What are you trying to do?

275
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,760
My gift is to remind you:

276
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,120
there are things you must not do

277
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,600
and rules you must obey.

278
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Break them, and you will pay the price.

279
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,240
This pear blossom hairpin
is the one I gave you, isn't it?

280
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,200
If I recall correctly,

281
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,200
you wore this very hairpin

282
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,640
the day you tried to
run off with Luo Xianxue.

283
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,800
It was picked at random.

284
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,800
The more casual the choice,
the truer the feeling behind it.

285
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Remember,

286
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
you are my empress.

287
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
As long as you fulfill
your duties as Empress,

288
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,480
nothing like today will ever happen again.

289
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,760
ONE YEAR AGO

290
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,800
I've heard

291
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,040
young boys have been
going missing in Southern Chu.

292
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,600
More than 100 have vanished so far.

293
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,320
Has anyone reported this?

294
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,000
Your Majesty,

295
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,600
Southern Chu has always
been peaceful and prosperous,

296
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,760
and it is governed by
the Prince of Yuzhang.

297
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,240
How could that happen?
Perhaps Your Majesty was misinformed.

298
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,440
Insolence! Though His Majesty
ascended the throne young,

299
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,440
he is both virtuous and wise.

300
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
How dare you speak so presumptuously?

301
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
The Prince of Yuzhang has
always ruled Southern Chu with diligence.

302
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
We must not
dishearten such a loyal official.

303
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,000
His Majesty is still young
and hasn't governed personally…

304
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,960
- Mr. Liu, you are mistaken.
- …It's you schemers…

305
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,000
- The news has already reached His Majesty.
- …who wish to frame the Prince of Yuzhang…

306
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,720
- How could it be false?
- …In that case,

307
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,280
let the Prince of
Yuzhang investigate by himself.

308
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,640
- Why trouble His Majesty?
- What a ridiculous notion!

309
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,880
Enough.

310
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,680
This matter
concerns the peace of an entire region

311
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,880
and is of great importance.

312
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,520
To prevent ill-intentioned
men from exploiting it,

313
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,160
we must

314
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,040
proceed with utmost caution.

315
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,280
<i>Those court officials kept chattering,</i>

316
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,600
saying either that Your Majesty is frail,

317
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,640
or that you have never ruled in person.

318
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,360
TRANQUIL CLARITY

319
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,520
They don't take
Your Majesty seriously at all.

320
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,120
Grand Tutor Ling promised

321
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
to hand over the reins of power after you
married Miss Ling,

322
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,720
yet now he keeps delaying,
refusing to yield.

323
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,640
In court today,
he even defended the Prince of Yuzhang.

324
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,600
Could he mean to break off the engagement?

325
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,160
The Grand Tutor holds great power.
He won't give it up easily.

326
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,640
If I keep backing down,
I'll remain under his control.

327
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,680
There are spies everywhere in the palace.

328
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,440
Perhaps it's time to find someone
who can break the stalemate.

329
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,240
Hongqing, where is Ling Cangcang?

330
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
Southern Chu?

331
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,040
{\an8}SOUTHERN CHU

332
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,760
RECRUITING TALENTS

333
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,440
- Shall we give it a try?
- Let's go.

334
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,240
Everyone,

335
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:42,920
FENGLAI PAVILION

336
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,120
Fenglai Pavilion
offers a heavy reward today

337
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,040
to seek a new hall master.

338
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,720
Whoever can defeat Hall Master Luo

339
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,280
will be hired immediately.
The pay is ten liang a month.

340
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,640
- Ten liang?
- Ten liang for real?

341
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,120
Why would Grand Tutor Ling
allow his only daughter

342
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,760
to linger in a place like this?

343
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,320
Isn't he afraid a stray blade

344
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,840
- might harm his precious girl?
- You go!

345
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,760
I heard Ling Cangcang defied her father
and ran away from home.

346
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,120
According to Shi Yan,

347
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,840
the man over there, Luo Xianxue,

348
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,280
is known as Southern Chu's Top Swordsman.

349
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,240
Yes!

350
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,640
As for that woman, her name is Zhong Lin.

351
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
She's a skilled fighter as well.

352
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,320
With those two around,

353
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,560
I doubt Ling Cangcang is in any danger.

354
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,160
- Wonderful!
- Amazing!

355
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,880
<i>It seems she and her father</i>

356
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,880
<i>aren't quite the same.</i>

357
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,160
An hour has passed.
Does anyone else dare to challenge?

358
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,440
No one's stepped up for a while.

359
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,080
What's going on?

360
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,240
No challengers at all?

361
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,720
If no one comes forward,

362
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,960
- then we'll…
- Wait!

363
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,040
- Go!
- He's going up!

364
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
- Let him on!
- Hurry!

365
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,000
Over here! Someone's going up!

366
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,920
- Go!
- Go!

367
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,200
- Hurry!
- Go!

368
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,720
- Go!
- Go!

369
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:35,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

370
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
Wait!

371
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,800
EXEMPLARY VIRTUE

372
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
He looked like the Prince of Yuzhang.

373
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,080
He wouldn't draw
suspicion disguised as the Prince.

374
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,520
Why not let him compete?

375
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
He didn't come with good intentions.

376
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,320
We mustn't use him.

377
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,080
What is this, Miss Ling?

378
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,680
Are you going back on your word?

379
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
<i>I knew it.</i>

380
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,800
<i>He was calm and composed,</i>

381
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,320
<i>certainly no ordinary fighter.</i>

382
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,360
<i>His stance was steady,</i>

383
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,040
<i>yet his hands bore no calluses.</i>

384
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,520
<i>He was clearly trained by a master</i>

385
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,720
<i>but lacked real combat experience.</i>

386
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,560
<i>And that upright bearing,</i>

387
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,600
that air of nobility…

388
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,800
He must be

389
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,520
a spy sent by my father.

390
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,320
Who are you calling a spy?

391
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,360
How did you get in here?

392
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,800
The match was suddenly canceled.

393
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,400
Even the guards are
busy explaining things.

394
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,000
Uninvited guest, what brings you here?

395
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,480
I sincerely wish to join Fenglai Pavilion.

396
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,280
There's an expression that suits you well:

397
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,880
- fine on the outside
- but rotten within.

398
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,760
My sword hasn't even left its sheath.

399
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,160
Why such harsh words, Miss Ling?

400
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,040
I've always been one

401
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
to see the whole
picture from a single clue.

402
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,000
- Have you perhaps misunderstood me?
- My apologies.

403
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,960
Guards, see him out.

404
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,160
I've long admired Fenglai Pavilion.

405
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,840
I truly wish to join.

406
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,720
Fenglai Pavilion's
fame spreads far and wide.

407
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,120
Many wish to join in earnest,

408
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,040
but I can't possibly
accept everyone, can I?

409
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,200
Luo, see him out.

410
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,920
You made the rules,

411
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,960
yet now you break your own word.

412
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,640
I doubt this place will amount to much.

413
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,480
The Emperor went to
Southern Chu under the pretext

414
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,200
of convalescence?

415
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,360
I underestimated him.

416
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,440
Could it be
that he went after Ling Cangcang?

417
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,440
What else could it be?

418
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,679
Xiao Huan has truly grown bold.

419
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,120
He wants to rule on his own.

420
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,520
Send word to Qing.

421
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,400
Tell him to win Ling Cangcang's heart

422
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,320
while she's in Southern Chu.

423
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,880
The Ninth Prince is brilliant
in both strategy and battle…

424
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,639
Your Highness, these are the most
popular designs at present.

425
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,920
<i>…But he never bows to anyone.</i>

426
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,639
<i>Asking him to fawn</i>
<i>over a spoiled, willful girl</i>

427
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,080
might be difficult.

428
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,120
In my humble opinion,

429
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,880
it would be better

430
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,960
to make sure the Emperor
never returns from this trip.

431
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,159
<i>Of course I choose the peacock.</i>

432
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
I'm getting this tattoo

433
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
only so the young
ladies will stay away from me.

434
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,639
That way, I'll have an excuse
when Mother presses me to marry.

435
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,639
You fool,

436
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,960
do you want me to tattoo
a dragon and tiger in combat

437
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,760
so the whole world thinks
I'm challenging the Emperor?

438
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,120
My apologies. I wouldn't dare.

439
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,520
Forget it. As for Ling Cangcang,

440
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,080
as long as she stays out of my sight,

441
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,000
I'll pretend I never saw her.

442
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,120
SPLENDID TAILOR SHOP

443
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,720
SPLENDID FINERY

444
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,720
Welcome.

445
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,520
This won't do. It's too plain.

446
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,560
Do you have something more elegant?

447
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,680
You could have it custom-made,

448
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,080
but it would take about a month.

449
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,400
Miss Ling,
we still haven't found a hall master.

450
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
How can we carry out the plan?

451
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,320
I already have someone in mind.

452
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,360
For now, the priority

453
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,120
<i>is to get our hands on</i>
<i>the Prince of Yuzhang's clothes.</i>

454
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,680
Do you have anything ready-made?
We need it urgently.

455
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,920
To tell the truth, Miss Ling, a while ago,

456
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
a servant from
the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor

457
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,480
ordered a casual outfit for the Prince,

458
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,960
but for some reason,
they never came to collect it.

459
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,480
In that case, let us take that one.

460
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,800
Well, I can't…

461
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,240
I suppose I can do that.

462
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,640
All right, I'll do as you say.

463
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,040
Much obliged.

464
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,000
I've never worn anything like this.

465
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,880
Perhaps
someone else should try it on instead.

466
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,280
Luo,
you're not just here to try on clothes.

467
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm

468
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,320
counting on you for the task.

469
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,400
Sir, that outfit was made for the Prince!

470
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,400
<i>The outfit</i>

471
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,240
<i>for the Prince?</i>

472
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,640
Wait! Please wait!

473
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,320
That outfit was
custom-made for the Prince.

474
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
How could you just put it on and leave?

475
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,480
I like it.

476
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,880
It suits me quite well.

477
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,800
I'll pay handsomely for it.

478
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
Well, in that case…

479
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,480
What are you after, really?
Why are you following us?

480
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,520
You again?

481
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,720
Sorry, but we bought that outfit.

482
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,560
You'll have to take it off.

483
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,400
Wait!

484
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,600
Don't ruin the outfit!

485
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,640
That's Shu brocade!

486
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,600
Miss Ling, please stop them!

487
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,080
You want this outfit that badly?

488
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,280
Listen,

489
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,000
if you let me join Fenglai Pavilion,
I'll give it to you.

490
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,280
Luo, forget it.

491
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,880
There's more than one
tailor shop in Southern Chu.

492
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,360
Let's go.

493
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,680
Do you really hate
the idea of me joining that much?

494
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,560
Then tell me,
why are you so eager to join?

495
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,240
I was born defiant.
I never accept defeat easily.

496
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,200
What a coincidence. Neither do I.

497
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,440
What exactly is Ling Cangcang after?

498
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,920
Have you found anything?

499
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,520
She's always with Luo Xianxue,

500
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,920
but Zhong Lin's been
going outside the city often.

501
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,840
Where exactly?

502
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
- Near the Southern Chu mine.
- The mine?

503
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,120
So she's after more than just clothes.

504
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,760
Shi Yan,

505
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I want to know everything about that mine.

506
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,720
Understood.

507
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,160
<i>Ling Cangcang,</i>

508
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,600
<i>why did you cast aside the Empress's seat?</i>

509
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,720
<i>What is it that you truly want?</i>

510
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,760
Master.

511
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,240
Pear blossom honey?

512
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,360
I knew it.

513
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,800
No one understands me better than you.

514
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,800
Master, let me pour you some tea.

515
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,240
Here.

516
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,680
You haven't visited me at
the Sword Cottage for a long time.

517
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,680
What have you been up to?

518
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,480
Nothing escapes you, Master.

519
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,640
A mine has recently yielded iron ore,

520
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,680
an extremely rare
metal for forging swords.

521
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,760
Whoever obtains it

522
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,520
will make their name
across the martial world.

523
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,720
You still dream of
roaming the martial world?

524
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,960
Don't forget, you are destined

525
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,280
to become Empress someday.

526
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
I don't care for that title.

527
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,640
I just want to win someone's heart
and roam the world

528
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,480
with my sword.

529
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,320
<i>Cangcang,</i>

530
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,600
<i>there are few things in this world</i>
<i>that turn out as one wishes.</i>

531
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,720
<i>May your joy at</i>
<i>least last a little longer.</i>

532
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,480
EXEMPLARY VIRTUE

533
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,120
Cangcang, we've got the clothes.

534
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,840
Turn around.

535
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,280
Miss Ling, something feels off.

536
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,440
It's missing a bit of
the Prince of Yuzhang's…

537
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,560
Nobility!

538
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,840
Exactly.

539
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,320
Hands behind your back.

540
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,120
Stand straighter.

541
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
A little more.

542
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,440
Yes, remember this posture.

543
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,640
Now you look eighty percent like him.

544
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,440
<i>The Prince needs a tattoo artist.</i>

545
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,280
<i>We can…</i>

546
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,720
Your Highness, they've arrived.

547
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,440
Liubao says your skills are unmatched.

548
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,560
You must tattoo

549
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,200
the most magnificent
peacock in Great Qi for me.

550
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,400
Yes, Your Highness.

551
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,840
Begin.

552
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,160
It might sting a little.

553
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,800
Pain is nothing. Hurry up.

554
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,120
Didn't you say you weren't afraid of pain?

555
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,640
Shall I have my
assistant fetch a paperweight?

556
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,920
You can squeeze it if it hurts.

557
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,800
- Go. Hurry.
- Yes, Your Highness.

558
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,600
<i>A golden embroidered box?</i>

559
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,520
<i>That must be it.</i>

560
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,320
Your Highness, here's the paperweight.

561
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Hold it firmly.

562
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,440
After I dotted the eye,
the phoenix immediately came to life.

563
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,040
Bear with it a little longer.
I'm almost finished.

564
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,800
I asked for a peacock!

565
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,560
When a peacock rests
upon the Azure Dragon's back,

566
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,000
it takes on the grace of a phoenix.

567
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,000
Your Highness's
nobility is truly overwhelming.

568
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I was momentarily distracted by awe.

569
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,720
I'll put my utmost care into this.

570
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,640
Let's continue.

571
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,640
Your Highness, the peacock is complete.

572
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,080
Complete?

573
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,360
- Already?
- Yes.

574
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
It looks stunning on your back,

575
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,720
almost alive.

576
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,840
Truly.

577
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,440
You two, bring me a bronze mirror.

578
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,400
I want to see for myself.

579
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,400
Sure. I'll fetch one.

580
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,360
Hurry.

581
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,800
The mold's ready.

582
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,800
Can you really reproduce it?

583
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,760
Trust me. I'm Zhong Lin.

584
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,280
It'll be identical,
down to the finest detail.

585
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,720
Miss!

586
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,000
A mister bought these flowers for you.

587
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,480
Who?

588
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,880
Him again?
