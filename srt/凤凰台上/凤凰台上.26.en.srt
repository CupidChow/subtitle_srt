But indulging her

76
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,090
isn't truly loving her.

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,460
I understand.

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,330

I won't just let it slide.

117
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,330
Her body can't take any more.

118
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,770
Bring Ling Xuefeng back to the Capital.

120
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,730
Find him the best imperial physician.

121
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,090
Do everything you can to save him.

122
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,770
If anything goes wrong,

123
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,730
at least let father and daughter

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,330
see each other one last time.

125
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

126
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,140
Qianqing,

127
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,330
what did His Majesty say about this?

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,820
Will he have Ying executed?

129
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,460
Ying,

130
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,090
tell me the truth.

131
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,500
Did someone egg you on

132
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,770
to try

133
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,860
to assassinate His Majesty?

134
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,930
You don't need to ask her.

135
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,050
She's still not herself.

136
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,500
I'll have someone send calming soup

137
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,100
so she can get some real rest.

138
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,500
This time,

139
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,690
you were wrong.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,170
When you do something wrong,

141
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,930
there is always a price to pay.

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,620
Qianqing, what are you saying?

143
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,980
I wanted to pay that price for you.

144
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,100
But His Majesty is right.

145
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,530
Always indulging you...

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,860
is not truly loving you.

147
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,100

151

Qianqing,

152
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,980
what are you doing?

153
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,040
I've cut her inner channels.

154
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,190
She can never refine poison again.

155
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,460
Qianqing,

156
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,740
are you out of your mind?

157
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,650
I'm not!

158
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,930
I was the one running away before.

159
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,140
Ying had a miserable childhood.

160
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,100
No one ever taught her right from wrong.

161
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,140
But in this world,

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,050
no one can spoil her forever.

163
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,980
Ying...

164
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,380
forgive me...

165
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,770
forgive your brother.

166
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,860
Qianqing!

167
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,050
Xiao Qianqing!

168
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,260
Ying...

169
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,570
it's all right.

170
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,290
It's all right now.

171
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,410
From now on,

172
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,860
you can't make poison.

173
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,380
I'll keep you company in other ways.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,260
I will always...

175
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,770
always stay by your side.

176
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,410
Xiao Qianqing,

177
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,500
tell me,

178
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,500
are you afraid of Wuying Hall now?

179
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,050
Mother,

180
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,260
did you

181
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,290
have anything to do with this?

182
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,570
What did you say?

183
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,690
Did you order Ying

184
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,100
to try to assassinate His Majesty?

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,220
Is this how you speak to your mother?

186
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,530
In this palace,

187
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,050
who but you would dare think that way?

188
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,220
Yes!

189
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,620
I wish he would just die right now!

190
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,170
But...

191
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,810
do you really think

192
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,530
I would send Ying to do it?

193
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,340
Her mind is not sound.

194
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,650
She is beyond my control.

195
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,290
If anything went wrong,

196
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,570
Xiao Huan would suspect me first!

197
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,450
Why would I set myself on fire?

198
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,500
And if Xiao Huan survived,

199
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,690
I,

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,980
the whole Liu clan,

201
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,170
and you included,

202
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,690
would all be buried with her!

203
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,980
And today,

204
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,980
you question me for Xiao Huan's sake.

205
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,810
Qianqing,

206
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,690
has your heart

207
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,970
already turned to him?

208
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,020
Have you forgotten

209
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,980
the humiliation I suffered back then

210
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,410
and how coldly I was treated?

211
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,580
[Prince of Yuzhang's Manor]

212
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,220
Xiao Qianqing,

213
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,770
I'm back!

214
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,690
Zhong Lin!

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,930
I found it!

216
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,500
This method really works?

217
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,450
It has to work.

218
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,930
Though Gold Incense is colorless and tasteless,

219
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,290
the red flying ants that grow on dead branches

220
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,690
of thousand-year-old golden nanmu

221
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,930
will swarm straight to it.

222
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,050
They can sniff it out even from ten zhang away.

223
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,220
I managed to get two of them.

224
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,220
We can give it a try.

225
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,450
You've really helped me a lot this time.

226
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,740
If we can prove my mother is innocent,

227
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,530
I'll make sure she credits you with great merit.

228
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,380
I'm not doing this for your mother.

229
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,020
I'm doing it for you and Ying,

230
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,620
and for Cangcang.

231
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,340
Her baby is just gone.

232
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,980
Whoever is behind this,

233
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,570
I'll drag them out into the light.

234
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,980
The Emperor just lost his temper.

235
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,530
His anger at you

236
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,810
was just anger at himself.

237
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,530
Once we catch the culprit,

238
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,290
things will work out.

239
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,450
I know.

240
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,170
Besides,

241
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,770
even if he keeps his distance from you,

242
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,980
you still have me.

243
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,290
Right?

244
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,410
Zhong Lin,

245
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,170
if one day I leave this place

246
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,530
and never return,

247
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,930
who would you choose

248
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,860
between Ling Cangcang and me?

249
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,410
If Cangcang is safe and happy,

250
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,380
that's all I wish for.

251
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,860
As for me,

252
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,500
of course I'll go wherever you go.

253
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,410
I go where my man goes!

254
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,380
Your Majesty.

255
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,380
In the future,

256
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,340
Ying can never refine poisons again.

257
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,060
The venomous insect she used this time

258
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,930
is called Dual-Pupil.

259
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,650
It can rapidly draw out a person's inner power,

260
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,100
but it does severe damage to the mind.

261
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,860
Right now,

262
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,340
Ying only recognizes me.

263
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,690
Whatever I say,

264
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,650
she doesn't really understand.

265
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,010
I can't get any answers out of her.

266
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,340
But on the day she attacked,

267
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,300
her mind was clear.

268
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,100
That's what Dual-Pupil does.

269
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,410
Once it forces out all your potential

270
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,930
and unleashes your power,

271
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,250
you quickly become dull and witless.

272
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,170
Your Majesty,

273
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,300
though my mother raised Ying,

274
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,970
she would never make her

275
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,690
use a secret art that ruins her own body.

276
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,750
If my mother chose to use Ying,

277
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,410
she'd be setting herself on fire.

278
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,140
She's not that foolish.

279
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,380
I truly believe

280
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,250
the one pulling Ying's strings

281
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,650
must be someone else.

282
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,970
I will find them.

283
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,690
But Xiao Ying can't say anything now.

284
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,380
How will you find them?

285
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,540
She finished

286
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,730
breeding this insect long ago.

287
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,490
She even bragged about it to me.

288
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,250
But to get this kind of insect into the body,

289
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,780
you have to take Gold Incense

290
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,340
for several days in a row.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

291
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,010
This stuff is highly addictive.

292
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,300
It's worth a fortune.

293
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,930
It's contraband.

294
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,730
It should never appear

295
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,580
inside the palace.

296
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,730
So you already have a plan?

297
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,410
Within five days,

298
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,450
I will get to the bottom of this

299
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,580
and give you an answer.

300
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,740
[Upright and Honorable]

301
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,010
Sir, please don't be angry.

302
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,770
We've been setting this up for so long,

303
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,180
and Xiao Huan is still alive.

304
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,860
On top of that,

305
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,570
I've even lost a grandchild I never met.

306
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,490
How am I supposed to calm down?

307
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,660
But you use this chance to return to the Capital.

308
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,290
And I've helped you quite a bit.

309
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,460
Now that you're back,

310
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,860
we can finally aim for bigger things.

311
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,560
I've already lost my grandchild.

312
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,330
I just want to go back

313
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,500
and see my daughter.

314
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,170
Are you thinking of backing out?

315
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,380
Don't forget:

316
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,380
the Empress losing her child

317
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,980
was partly your doing.

318
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,180
Do you really think you still have a way out?

319
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,860
Commander of the Capital Patrol Office,

320
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,570
Zhang Heng,

321
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,570
please come out.

322
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,140
I heard you two have never gotten along.

323
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,490
Because of you,

324
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,460
Mr. Zhang was demoted three ranks.

325
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,980
He had to start over as a lowly clerk in the North City Patrol

326
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,220
before climbing back up to commander.

327
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,770
And even as commander,

328
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,220
he gave you no end of trouble.

329
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,940
Years ago, he stopped your carriage,

330
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,090
saying you were too extravagant

331
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,220
that your carriage exceeded your rank.

332
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,770
If Sir had really wanted to make things hard for me,

333
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,570
could I have risen safely to commander?

334
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,090
The one playing the game

335
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,580
will sometimes place a hidden piece.

336
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,860
And that hidden piece

337
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,840
often sits at the most critical spot.

338
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,010
Truly,

339
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,290
he is a masterful piece.

340
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,120
Right now,

341
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,990
I've turned the key hidden piece

342
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,220
face up for you to see.

343
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,590
Do you still think

344
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,590
I would back down?

345
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,550
General Lu,

346
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,420
let me remind you of one thing:

347
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,240
the Imperial Preceptor is sacred and untouchable.

348
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,820
The last Imperial Preceptor had a secret affair

349
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,660
and I personally carried out

350
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,810
her sentence of death by fire.

351
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,570
Inside here are red flying ants.

352
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,660
They love the scent of Gold Incense.

353
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,810
If someone has come into contact with it,

354
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,940
even a dozen days later,

355
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,420
the red flying ants can still sniff it out.

356
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,940
This register lists everyone

357

who has entered or left the cold palace recently.

358
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,980
Once we test them with the ants,

359
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,940
the one behind it all is sure to be exposed.

Why isn't Lu Qi's name

367
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,180
on this register?

368
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,770
He's Li Hongqing's right-hand man.

369
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,620
That doesn't make sense.

370
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,600
He could've had contact with Xiao Ying too.

371
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,380
That day, the situation in Wuying Hall was deadly dangerous.

372
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,020
Yet he showed up late,

373
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,530
saying he'd suddenly taken ill.

374
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,900
How could it be such a coincidence?

375
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,770
Lu's family has been loyal for generations.

376
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,660
He's an upright man,

377
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,090
even a bit stubborn.

378
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,050
It's hard to believe he'd be bought off.

379
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,060
We'll know

380
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,240
as soon as we test him.

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,700
in the cold palace that day.

385
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,490
It was my failure in duty.

386
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,380
I didn't notice anything unusual about the princess.

I want to see who's really behind this,

402

409

behind the princess?

410
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,860
We have a lead,

411
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,620
but nothing is certain yet.

All right.

I won't hide anything.

who escorted Ling Xuefeng back.

Ling Xuefeng still won't give up his ambitions?

But Zhang Heng has always been his sworn enemy.

468
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,730
That's why I trusted him so deeply

469
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,050
and put the Capital's defenses in his hands.

470

But thinking about it now,

471
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,730
if Ling Xuefeng really wanted to block him,

472

rise so smoothly to commander?

474

Could Zhang Heng

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,620
have been Ling Xuefeng's secret piece all along?

476

00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,620
Ling Xuefeng's crimes

518
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,620
are unforgivable.

519
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,700
I will never spare him.

520
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,380
But rest assured,

521
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,090
the innocent

522
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,010
will not be dragged down.

[Wuying Hall]

525
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,820
Everything is ready.

526
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,260
If we fail,

527
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,460
we die trying!

528
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,050
All officials of the Imperial Assembly, enter the hall

529
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,460
and pay respects to His Majesty!

530
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,420
Proceed!

531
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,260
At the dawn of a new year,

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,130
all things are made new.

533
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,340
We pray Your Majesty

534
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,130
receive Heaven's blessing

535
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,260
and share in its glory!

536
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,980
Stow your tablets!

All hail!

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,940
Long live Your Majesty!

540
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,420
You may all rise!

541
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,940
Present your tablets!

542
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,980
By Your Majesty's grace,

543
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,340
in the ninth year of Yongxi, Great Qi is rich and strong.

544
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,780
In the southern provinces, the land is fertile and the waters full.

545
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,740
Though we faced locust plague,

546
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,050
the damage was slight.

547
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,780
Every home has grain stored.

548
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,340
The people are all well fed.

549
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,420
At best, fields yield two dan of grain per mu.

550
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,420
As for the remaining details,

551
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,860
[Memorial]
I've set them out in full

552
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,780
for Your Majesty's review.

553
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,340
Such prosperity

554
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,650
is thanks to all you ministers.

555
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,260
What Great Qi seeks

556
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,690
is not short-term gain.

557
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,090
I hope you will all work as one,

558
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,420
abolish outdated rules,

559
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,460
and push forward new policies.

560
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,940
Let the brave know righteousness,

561
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,300
and the wise cherish benevolence.

562
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,980
We will heed your teachings!

563
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,460
Imperial Preceptor Du has prepared Tusu wine for everyone.

564

Let's all raise a toast

and a peaceful, prosperous people!

568
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,610
How could this cup of wine

569
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,610
possibly go

570
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,380
without me?

571
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,780
Ling Xuefeng,

572
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,940
you dare commit treason!

573
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,090
So you've been planning this for a long time, Sir.

574
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,780
Since you've come today,

575
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,780
I'm sure

576
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,690
you have plenty to say.

577
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,650
Of course.

578
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,100
Today I came

579
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,890
to ask just one thing:

580
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,840
Without the full support

581
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,390
of the Ling clan and me,

582
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,170
what right or ability did you have

583
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,150
to sit securely on the throne?

584
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,690
So,

585
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,930
you want to take it for yourself?

586
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,610
I have no wish to usurp you.

587
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,160
But I have already received an imperial edict.

588
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,940
It states His Majesty is gravely ill with a cold illness,

589
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,750
and thus

590
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,900
he has passed the throne to the prince in the Empress's womb.

591
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,110
He orders me to bear the imperial seal,

592
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,910
ascend to the Taiji Hall,

593
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,380
assist the new emperor,

594
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,170
share in handling state affairs,

595
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,960
and oversee the realm and armies.

596
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,820
This minister

597
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,430
dares not refuse.

598
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,940
Why didn't I know

599
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,390
about this edict?

600
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,660
Because...

601
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,090
during today's court session,

602
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,960
you will suddenly be taken ill

603
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,530
and die.

604
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,860
You're that sure

605
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,860
everything will go your way today?

606
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,130
The hearts of men are with me.

607
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,420
Good.

608
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,610
Very good.

609
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,680
So,

610
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,380
you'd planned ahead all along.

611
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,190
I've already spent the night

612
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,330
replacing the Imperial Guards with my own men.

613
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,860
In fact, I could've taken down

614
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,740
the Capital Patrol commander earlier.

615
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:38,940
But...

616
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,090
I wanted to see

617
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,170
just how many people in this court

618
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,900
truly stand

619
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,420
on your side.

620
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,490
Now that you've seen it for yourself,

621
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,190
allow me

622
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,050
to send Your Majesty on your way.
