All the poisons have already been destroyed.

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,540
Why then does the Begonia Pendant still react so strangely?

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,410
Could it be that there are still other toxins hidden within the palace?

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,660
Princess Ying's mind is unclear.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,980
Her words cannot be taken as truth.

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,930
Your Highness,

30
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,770
I mean no disrespect.

31
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,290
It is by His Majesty's command.

32
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,100
Should a single lamp be lit in this cold palace,

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,130

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,260
I brought you osmanthus and red bean dumplings.

00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,260
After you eat them,

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,690
you should go to sleep early.

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,290

Then do you want to eat them?

56
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,250
When I've killed them all,

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,730
then I'll eat.

58
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,340
Kill whom?

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,220
Why don't you help me,

60
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,410
and kill them all?

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,850
Mother, this teacup is exquisite.

Fine porcelain,

63
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,730

65
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,730
has always come and gone.

66
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,170
After much effort to nurse her,

67
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,460
her confusion still outweighs her clarity.

68
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,490
That Xiao Huan

69
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,250
is determined to take our lives!

70
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,850
Mother.

71
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,900
Ying gave poison to the Empress,

72
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,020
and attempted to assassinate His Majesty.

73
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,580
She was only punished by ten days without lighting a lamp.

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,610
That punishment is already merciful enough.

75
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,610
Ying has never been of sound mind.

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,340
But why did she become this way?

77
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,610
You know the reason well.

78
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,460
Had it not been for that great fire at Luling Palace back then,

79
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,100
when Xiao Huan abandoned her,

80
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,540
she would never have been so deeply scarred.

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,580
Then

82
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,780
why did Luling Palace suddenly burn for no reason?

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,980
What do you mean by that?

84
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,490
You are my own flesh and blood,

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,130
the child I carried for ten months,

86
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,140
born through hardship and pain.

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,700
Do you not know why,

88
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,100
or for whom, I have done all this?

89
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,730
So Mother has always known

90
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,170
the truth behind Ying's madness,

91
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,020
yet chose never to tell her,

92
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,900
encouraging her instead to resent His Majesty.

93
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,140
Is this, Mother,

94
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,460
what you call love for me and Ying?

95
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,660
So,

96
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,660
it is because of your sister's matter

97
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,020
that you have borne a grudge against me all this time.

98
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,660
You were in Southern Chu for so many years,

99
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,410
yet not once did you send a letter home.

100
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,140
Whatever I asked you to do,

101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,610
you brushed aside carelessly,

102
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,540
and even

103
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,580
stood against me.

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,140
Mother.

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,050
You speak too harshly.

106
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,610
Does it hurt?

107
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,340
It does not.

108
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,020
Mother,

109
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,140
please be at ease.

110
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,250
Now that I have returned,

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,410
I shall protect you and my sister with all that I am.

112
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,410
I will never let either of you suffer again.

113
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,580
The injustice Ying endured,

114
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,540
I will never forget.

115
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,580
Well?

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,610
Did you meet His Majesty?

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,460
Does that mean I can stop practicing?

118
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,300
Look at me,

119
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,820
do I look like I've met him?

120
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,460
Then what should we do?

121
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,300
His Majesty could summon Song Lanxi at any moment.

122
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,610
He values him so highly.

123
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
Even if I practice until I'm perfect,

124
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,850
the moment His Majesty sees the real one, I'll be exposed.

125
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,180
His Majesty

126
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,980
is gravely ill now.

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,820
He is unlikely to grant an audience for the time being.

128
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,700
As for you,

129
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,010
put your mind to practicing your calligraphy first.

130
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,220
We'll talk once you've fooled the officials in the Capital.

131
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,370
Come,

132
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,490
show me.

133
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,770
Your writing

134
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,460
does resemble his,

135
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,130
yet it still lacks spirit.

136
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,370
Anyone who has seen Song Lanxi's true work

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,820
will see through it at a glance.

138
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,490
Song Lanxi

139
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,580
is a master of calligraphy.

140
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,490
A four chi scroll of his sells for more than a hundred liang of silver.

141
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,340
How could that be copied so easily?

142
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,420
At the start, you insisted

143
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,370
on accompanying me to the Capital.

144
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,530
You boasted

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,420
as if nothing were beyond your ability.

146
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,180
I said I wished to go to the Capital with you,

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,650
but did I say I meant to impersonate Song Lanxi?

148
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,300
If you think my writing is poor,

149
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,180
do it yourself if you can.

For the Grand Tutor's kindness to me,

182
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,980
I would give my body and soul,

183

and repay it fully.

184

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,060
She claimed she was going to the Summer Palace,

192
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,420
but went to the Sword Cottage instead.

193
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,300
It seems

194
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,180
her visit to the Sword Cottage isn't simple.

195
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,770
Then Father means...

196
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,650
Regarding Li Lu's death,

197
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,340
she has never let it go.

198
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,820
How is the truth

199
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,690
she seeks coming along?

200
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:02,990
Master.

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,430
I miss you.

202
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,580
The longer I stay in the palace,

203
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,300
the more I miss the carefree days I had here.

204
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,490
But you're gone.

205
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,940
Xiao Huan won't even give me a reason.

206
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,700
Master,

207
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,420
what exactly were you all hiding from me?

208
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,420
The imperial family is heartless,

209
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,010
yet Xiao Huan keeps helping me.

210
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,060
Why is that?

211
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,490
Why did you kill my master?

212
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,610
I promised him

213
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,700
I wouldn't tell you.

214
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,610
What did you say?

215
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,250
What aren't you allowed to tell me?

216
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,460
What are you all hiding from me?

217
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,490
You're back, little glutton.

218
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,340
What do you want to eat?

219
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,770
I will make it for you.

220
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,580
Master, is it ready?

221
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,340
What gift are you giving me?

222
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,300
You may open your eyes now.

223
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,890
What a beautiful pendant.

224
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,250
This is a protector I give you.

225
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,250
You must keep it with you from now on.

226
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,220
Well?

227
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,100
Do you like it?

228
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,130
I do.

229
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,850
Father never remembers my birthday.

230
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,100
Master is much better than Father.

231
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,180
Thank you, Master.

232
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,490
I really like it.

233
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,890
As long as you like it.

234
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,820
Master,

235
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,730
can you tell me

236
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,100
why Xiao Huan

237
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,580
had to kill you?

238
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,300
Who?

239
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,650
Luo.

240
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,010
Cangcang.

241
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,490
Speak.

242
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,250
Why are you here?

243
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,100
I came to pay my respects too,

244
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,770
to share a drink with him.

245
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,580
But Master never drank Bamboo Leaf Green.

246
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,370
Are you really here to pay respects?

247
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,700
Cangcang,

248
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,370
Father

249
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,980
was worried about you.

250
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,370
Luo,

251
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,420
do you still remember this pendant?

252
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,700
This Begonia Pendant

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,770
was given to me by Master.

254
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,250
He said it would keep me safe.

255
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,730
I remember.

256
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,490
I only learned recently

257
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,300
that it is a treasure beyond price.

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,050
With it on me,

259
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,990
no poison can get close.

260
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,010
Master was protecting me all along.

261
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,140
But I do not even know why he died.

262
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,930
I do not even know why he died!

263
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,780
Am I that useless?

264
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,730
Cang...

265
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,060
Cangcang.

266
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,900
I remember when I was little,

267
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,780
I loved leaning against this forge.

268
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,380
No matter how cold it was outside,

269
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,860
it was always warm here.

270
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,820
Tell me,

271
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,250
when have you ever approached me

272
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,380
without a purpose?

273
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,340
No, My Lady.

274
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,930
It was Father...

275
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,250
Master forged the Rex Sword for you

276
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,930
and you used that very sword to kill him.

277
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,780

How come this morning, now that the sun is out,

335
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,490
it's suddenly chilly?

336
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,540
I remember there was a cellar at home once,

337
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,690

Cangcang.

342
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,100
Could it be

343
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,730
there's a cellar here too?

344
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,970
Let's look.

It's so cold.

Why is the wind so strong?

349
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,250
Could it be

350
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,900
there's a cellar underneath,

351
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,970
connected to Sword Cottage?

352
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,010
Take out the sword.

353
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,650
I didn't expect Master

354
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,650
had hidden a place like this.

355
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,820

356
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,210
These belong to Tang.

357
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,250
Every time I mentioned Tang,

358
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,540
Master would say it was in the past.

359
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,340
But in his heart,

360
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,100
he never really let go.

361
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,690
This is...

362
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,650
This isn't Master's wife.

363
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,900
I remember how she looked,

364
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,900
round-faced,

365
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,010

366
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,860
Then this...

367
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,650
How could her portrait be here with Master?

368
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,170

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,490

381
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,410
Secret art...

382
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,380
This is the secret art of the Ghost King of the Lingbi Sect.

383
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,340
Could it be that Mr. Li Lu is...

384
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,140
Impossible.

385
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,900
I don't believe it!

386
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,780
How many days has the Empress been away?

387
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,210
Report to Your Majesty,

388
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,410
it's been fewer than five days.

389
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,100
Any news?

390
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,970
None that I've heard.

391
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,620
Your Majesty.

392
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,930
Has the Empress sent any word back?

393
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,620
Her Majesty's letters are not here,

394
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,140
but there are a few of Mr. Song Lanxi's writings

395
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,410
that leaked from the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

396
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,300
Why would Song Lanxi be staying in the manor?

397
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,930
He said he was injured on the road

398
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,300
and needed to recuperate at the manor.

399
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,300
I have received some good news.

400
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,620
Though perhaps not entirely good news.

401
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,100
Some bad...

402
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,340
Though not exactly bad.

403
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,620
What news?

404
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,250
His Majesty just issued an order:

405
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,490
Because he is seriously ill,

406
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,060
the final imperial exam is postponed.

407
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,580
It's good news.

408
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,380
But I wonder,

409
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,210
could it be

410
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,170
because he discovered something?

411
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,540
Impersonating Song Lanxi in the Capital is a capital offense.

412
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,650
I am also complicit.

413
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,250
Naturally, I shall protect you.

414
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,620
If you want to go, go yourself.

415
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,410
I'm not going.

416
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,730
After Ling Cangcang entered the palace,

417
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,490
the first gift she received...

418
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,780
Do you know what it was?

419
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,930
What was it?

420
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,490
A finger

421
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,300
of her adoptive brother, Luo Xianxue.

422
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,730
So,

423
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,140
you may not trust me.

424
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,900
Between us,

425
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,970
there is no common interest.

426
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,100
However,

427
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,410
we share a common enemy.

428
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,300
Then what should we do?

429
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,650
If he discovers I'm impersonating Song Lanxi,

430
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,860
you must save me.

431
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,900
Your Highness,

432
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,300
Mr. Xu Feng, requests an audience.

433
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,210
Which Mr. Xu?

434
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,900
No.

435
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,210
He is a student of Mr. Ling Xuefeng.

436
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,730
Ling Xuefeng?

437
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,210
What should we do?

438
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,540
Your Highness,

439
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,730
I heard that Mr. Song Lanxi has been ill for a long time,

440
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,930
and Grand Tutor Ling is very concerned.

441
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,210
This is Physician Liu, a miraculous healer.

442
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,970
Grand Tutor specifically sent him here

443
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,930
to diagnose Mr. Song.

444
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,170
To be honest,

445
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,540
Mr. Song's condition is indeed serious.

446
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,930
To be precise,

447
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,900
on the way here,

448
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,580
he was attacked by assassins,

449
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,210
and the injuries were severe.

450
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,820
Then, in that case,

451
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,250
please summon Mr. Song.

452
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,300
Mr. Song,

453
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,690
have you disguised yourself?

454
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,780
Mr. Song was severely injured on the head and neck

455
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,780
when on the way to the Capital.

456
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,690
His vocal cords were damaged,

457
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,270
and he cannot speak for now.

458
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,060
Since the injuries are severe,

459
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,930
Physician Liu,

460
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,140
please take care of him.

461
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,820
Yes.

462
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,210
Mr. Song was attacked in the night,

463
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,340
and was greatly frightened.

464
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,820
Since then, he has refused any physical contact with others.

465
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,930
Mr. Song,

466
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,170
I have admired you for a long time.

467
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,250
Your calligraphy is renowned throughout the land.

468
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,540
Now that I see you,

469
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,060
I wonder if you might grant me a few characters.

470
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,970
This...

471
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,210
Mr. Song's calligraphy was already circulated yesterday.

472
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,780
Why

473
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,710
can't he display it publicly today?

474
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,060
Xu Feng,

475
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,620
you are taking this too far!

476
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,820
But

477
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,930
since you are Grand Tutor Ling's student,

478
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,690
I naturally have to

479
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,730
show him some respect.

480
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,410
Mr. Song,

481
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,540
what do you think?

482
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,970
Someone,

483
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,490
bring ink and brushes.

484
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,420
[Wuying Hall]

485
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,540
[Calligraphy of Song Lanxi]

486
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,170
Song Lanxi has always been modest.

487
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,620
Why has so much calligraphy been circulated?

488
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,970
It is said that too many people came to request his writing,

489
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,300
and Prince of Yuzhang had no choice

490
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,860
but to ask Mr. Song to comply.

491
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,450
I doubt it.

492
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,380
Your Majesty, what seems off?

493
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,450
Along the way,

494
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,380
there were too many strange things.

495
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,490
Since Your Majesty is doubtful,

496
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,690
then when the Prince of Yuzhang came to request an audience a few days ago,

497
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,100
why didn't you ask directly?

498
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,820
I had just punished Xiao Ying,

499
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,490
and if I saw him now,

500
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,410
wouldn't it only cause trouble?

501
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,930
After all this time, unable to master a single character of Xi.

502
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,970
Your Highness.

503
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,820
[Take care of yourself]

504
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,140
[Take care of yourself, Song Lan]

00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,450
Song Lanxi of the Western Garden in Guzhou,

506
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,220
a character worth a thousand gold coins.

507
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,820
This writing

508
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,300
is now given to you.

509
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,930
Since that's the case,

510
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,490
I wish Mr. Song

511
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,050
a speedy recovery.

512
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,740
Your Highness,

513
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,930
I

514
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,260
take my leave.

515
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,970
I'm suffocating.

516
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,090
No.

517
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,660
I nearly died of fright!

518
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,180
If Xu Feng found out, I'd be finished!

519
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,010
If I'm caught impersonating an imperial official,

520
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,050
how many heads do I have for Xiao Huan to chop off?

521
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,180
I can't believe you even know that!

522
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,010
How dare you let Zhong Lin impersonate Song Lanxi?

523
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,820
Song Lanxi was assassinated by your father-in-law.

524
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,180
If I hadn't done it,

525
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,300
how could I have kept it from him?

526
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,260
Kept it from him,

527
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,570
or kept it from me?

528
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,340
As soon as I returned, I came straight to the palace

529
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,530
to confess to you.

530
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,130
But you refused to see me.

531
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,970
I haven't yet punished you for failing to protect him,

532
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,930
and you blame me instead.

533
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,010
Fine.

534
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,050
Fine.

535
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,450
Then please punish me, Your Majesty.

536
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,130
It would be best

537
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,260
to punish Zhong Lin's crime along with mine.

538
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,130
Are you trying to use Zhong Lin to threaten me?

539
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,700
I wouldn't dare.

540
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,010
Zhong Lin is just a commoner.

541
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,130
How could she possibly threaten Your Majesty?

542
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,050
But I heard

543
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,260
that the Empress misses her dearly.

544
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,860
Then you will bear

545
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,130
Zhong Lin's crime.

546
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,380
Your Highness,

547
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,180
you just saw for yourself.

548
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,450
Ling Xuefeng's people already believe

549
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,010
that Song Lanxi is living safely in my manor.

550
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,820
If you punish me now,

551
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,450
wouldn't that

552
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,820
cause pain to loved ones

553
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,570
and joy to enemies?

554
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,260
So

555
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,660
this is your plan.

556
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,380
You're using Ling Xuefeng to pressure me.

557
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,220
I wouldn't dare.

558
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,530
If Ling Xuefeng knew that Song Lanxi was dead,

559
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,740
it would benefit neither of us.

560
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,660
Why not maintain the lie together?

561
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,380
You truly have a lot of nerve.

562
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,900
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

563
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,260
I am trembling with fear.

564
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,260
Having me cover the lie for you

565
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,790
is not entirely impossible.

566
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,850
But you must do one thing for me in return.

567
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,860
What is it?

568
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,490
Have you heard of

569
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,660
Li Chengtian?

570
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,050
Li Chengtian?

571
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,860
He was once a senior minister in the court.

572
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,700
After losing to Ling Xuefeng,

573
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,010
he retired to the countryside.

574
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,300
Yet his name remains illustrious among the gentry.

575
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,050
Many upright officials in the court were his students.

576
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,220
Song Lanxi was also his student.

577
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,930
Indeed.

578
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,700
Your Majesty is truly cunning and strategic.

579
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,610
So Song Lanxi

580
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,260
was merely a lure to draw out Li Chengtian.

581
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,260
Ling Xuefeng killed his beloved student.

582
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,450
What would he feel?

583
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,410
Your Majesty intends for me to summon Master Li out of retirement.

584
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,700
What do you think?

585
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:11,340
[Take care, Song Lan]

586
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,700
Greetings, Father.

587
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,860
Song Lanxi is not dead.

588
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,940
Impossible.

589
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,640
I personally struck him down.

590
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,100
[Take care, Song Lan]

591
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,260
This is Song Lanxi's calligraphy.

592
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,570
Since you personally attacked him,

593
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,130
there must be hidden circumstances.

594
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,300
I will investigate further.

595
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,300
Get up.

596
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,340
All traces of Li Lu's interactions with us

597
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,410
should be cleared away.

598
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,670
Rest assured, Father.

599
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,450
Everything has been properly handled.

600
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,880
But...

601
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,160
I know you cannot bear it.

602
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,970
And as a father, neither can I.

603
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,860
Yet this is the truth she most wishes to know.

604
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,410
It is also what she must face.

605
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,130
But Young Lady refuses to believe that Li Lu is the Ghost King,

606
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,090
thinking instead that someone framed him.

607
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,530
Who does she suspect?

608
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,900
She has not mentioned it.

609
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,410
She is heading straight to the palace now.

610
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,620
[Wuying Hall]

611
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,010
Is the Empress's favourite pear blossom honey

612
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,130
all ready?

613
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,050
Prepared long ago.

614
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,490
Your Majesty,

615
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,970
the Empress has arrived.

616
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,380
Why

617
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,930
does Your Majesty look so surprised

618
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,090
to see me?

619
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,530
I just thought

620
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,130
you would be happier to step out

621
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,700
of the palace for a while.

622
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,260
Why should I be happy?

623
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,130
This is pear blossom honey from this year's harvest.

624
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,380
Taste it.

625
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,410
You haven't finished speaking.

626
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,970
Why would I

627
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,050
be happy?

628
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,970
Should I be happy

629
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,280
that my master is the Ghost King?

630
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,950
What are you talking about?

631
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,820
All along, you've had people following me,

632
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,860
never leaving my side.

633
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,700
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

634
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,380
I had them follow you

635
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,300
to protect you.

636
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,570
Since you admit it,

637
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,660
then the items of the Ghost King in the Sword Cottage...

638
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,380
You were the one who placed them?

639
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,340
You are suspecting me

640
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,300
of framing your master?

641
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,180
No.

642
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,860
If I truly wanted to frame your master,

643
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,530
why wait until today?

644
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,860
Then tell me,

645
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,660
why did you kill my master?

646
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,090
I promised your master

647
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,180
I wouldn't reveal the truth to you.

648
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,660
Fine.

649
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,970
I'll find out myself.

650
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,410
Cangcang,

651
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,410
have you considered

652
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,010
that perhaps the truth

653
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,700
is more than you can bear?

654
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,410
If I didn't know the truth,

655
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,180
how could I bear it?

656
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,490
Ling Xuefeng,

657
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,340
are you betting that I wouldn't break my vow?

658
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,860
Grand Tutor Ling has been kind to me.

659
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,660
He helped me avenge my daughter's wrongs.

660
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,050
He allowed me

661
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,970
to live again.

662
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,860
For him,

663
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,820
I would face mountains of blades and seas of fire,

664
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,700
even if my soul were to shatter,

665
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,090
I would not hesitate.

666
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,220
If I told you

667
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,340
that it was Ling Xuefeng

668
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,970
who abducted your daughter?

669
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,380
All of this

670
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,130
was orchestrated by him

671
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,740
as a bitter ruse.

672
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,130
Impossible.

673
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,340
It's impossible.

674
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,860
Everything I saw

675
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,010
was real.

676
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,740
Everything I did

677
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,450
was of my own free will.

678
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,900
I was not used by anyone.

679
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,380
I will never regret it.

680
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,300
Is that so?

681
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,180
Then these words,

682
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,380
would you dare to say them to Cangcang?

683
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,410
Do not tell Cangcang the truth.

684
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,860
Understood.

685
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,930
A promise from the sovereign

686
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,740
is never broken.
