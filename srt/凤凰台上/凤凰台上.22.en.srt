00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,490
And did you...

177
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,980
also poison it?

178
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,690
I did.

179
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,180
So...

180
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,060
when you kept calling me Cangcang,

181
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,730
calling me your precious daughter,

182
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,220
was any of that real?

183
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,940
Cangcang!

184
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,340
I was absolutely certain

185
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,100
His Majesty would save you!

186
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,710
But you say an emperor is heartless.

187
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,010
If you really believed he'd save me,

188
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,010
is he heartless or not in your eyes?

189
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,010
To you, Father,

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,980
whether he's heartless or not

191
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,060
depends on which answer helps you.

192
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,700
And whether you love your precious daughter

193
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,300
depends on whether she hinders your grand plans.

194
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,100
Isn't that right?

195
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,340
Cangcang,

196
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,490
you... you have to believe me.

197
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,530
Sometimes,

198
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,370
I have no choice but to weigh and choose.

199
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,370
And everything I've done...

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,610
was for our Ling clan!

201
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,490
You've already made your choice!

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,530
You chose

203
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,730
to be a ruthless Grand Tutor,

204
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,850
even at the cost of your daughter's life.

205
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,130
Didn't you?

206
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,650
Cangcang...

207
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,530
I have my own reasons!

208
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,060
The hunger for power is endless.

209
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,460
Stop saying it's for me,

210
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,340
for the Ling clan,

211
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,610
for Jueding.

212
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,530
If you stop now, it's still not too late

213
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,370
to turn back!

214
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,650
Your Majesty,

215
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,890
you want to teach me how to live?

216
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,220
I can never repay

217
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,100
all you've done for me.

218
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,730
I only beg you:

219
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,340
if you don't stop now,

220
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,370
there'll be no turning back.

221
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,180
Very well.

222
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,650
So when Your Majesty went to my study,

223
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,050
you were looking for evidence?

224
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,650
Did you really think no one else would expose you?

225
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,100
You mean Luo Xianxue?

226
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,490
He treasures you like his own life.

227
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,940
For your sake,

228
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,980
he can tell you certain things.

229
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,610
But do you really think

230
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,490
he could come back alive?

231
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,580
What did you do to him?

232
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,250
Luo is the foster son

233
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,770
you raised from childhood.

234
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,180
And you still wouldn't spare him.

235
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,250
So tell me, Father...

236
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,860
what will you do with your precious daughter?

237
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,760
Kill me?

238
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,250
How could I bear to?

239
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,570
"Her Majesty

240
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,860
has returned home to mourn her late mother.

241
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,530
Overcome with grief,

242
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,010
she has fallen gravely ill

243
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,870
and will remain here

244
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,900
for a time". That is all.

245
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,180
Do you really think

246
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,530
His Majesty will let you live?

247
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,180
With Your Majesty in my hands,

248
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,810
he won't dare act rashly.

249
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,490
You chose him

250
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,620
because in your heart

251
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,810
he's a man of feeling and honor, isn't he?

252
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,620
Yet he hurt you and lied to you!

253
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,810
He even killed the master you loved most.

254
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,660
And now he wants to kill your father!

255
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,460
And yet

256
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,420
you still choose to stand with him?

257
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,290
From beginning to end,

258
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,660
I never meant to kill you.

259
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,900
Did you think

260
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,570
that by getting rid of Luo Xianxue,

261
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,010
you could erase your ties to the Lingbi Sect

262
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,330
and the proof of your treason and regicide?

263
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,180
I have far too much evidence

264
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,700
of your crimes in my hands.

265
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,220
Sir,

266
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,730
do you recall a move you taught me at chess?

267
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,770
"Drive in a wedge

268
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,570
and shatter the formation."

269
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,490
So, you used Luo Xianxue as that wedge

270
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,090
to lull my pieces into dropping their guard?

271
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,860
That's right.

272
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,250
If Luo learned you once poisoned Cangcang,

273
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,140
he'd dig out the truth.

274
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,180
But you would never leave

275
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,810
a piece you couldn't control.

276
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,980
So,

277
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,380
I let him go on purpose.

278
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,490
While you were busy purging your own ranks,

279
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,090
I could tighten the net I'd cast.

280
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,860
Secretly forging weapons,

281
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,770
skimming off grain,

282
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,090
rigging prices,

283
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,290
controlling intelligence...

284
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,570
[Letter] As an elder of two reigns,

285
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,700
you've spent years weaving your power.

286
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,620
To wipe it out in one stroke

287
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,010
is no easy task.

288
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,490
Sir,

289
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,700
for this day,

290
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,900
I've been planning for many years.

291
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,730
Since it's come to this,

292
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,940
kill me or punish me as you please.

293
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,940
I told you,

294
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,860
I've never once thought of killing you.

295
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,770
I'll spare your life

296
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,420
and spare the entire Ling clan.

297
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,490
I will not

298
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,660
allow my empress

299
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,700
to have a traitorous father

300
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,250
and a rebel family.

301
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,620
What did I always teach you?

302
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,380
Remove the threat completely.

303
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,090
You never soften your heart.

304
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,010
Letting me go today

305
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,380
might just be...

306
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,010
your greatest mistake.

00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,930
Everything

520
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,740
has already begun.

521
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,260
Sky so vast, wild plains so wide...

522
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,930
My mother named me Cangcang [*"Cangcang" means vast.]

523
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,530
hoping that in this vast world

524
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,300
I could live free and easy.

525
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,130
If she could see me like this now,

526
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,660
what would she think?

527
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,180
Father said

528
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,450
when you were fourteen,

529
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,090
you waited for him all night at Xishi Gate.

530
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,010
It wasn't quite all night.

531
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,380
I knew he would enter by Xishi Gate,

532
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,610
so I went there at the Yin Hour to wait for him.

533
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,220
That day,

534
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,820
snow was falling thick,

535
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,300
and it was bitterly cold.

536
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,050
Your Highness,

537
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,820
you've always been frail.

538
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,090
Why suffer the cold here to wait for me?

539
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,820
Sir, is your daughter

540
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,700
named Cangcang?

541
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,610
Your Highness,

542
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,300
I do have a girl named Cangcang.

543
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,450
She's eight this year,

544
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,780
and terribly mischievous.

545
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,010
Sir, are you willing

546
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,220
to betroth her to me as my future empress?

547
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,130
Your Highness,

548
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,090
do you know what you're saying?

549
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,340
Today,

550
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,300
I stand here in snow,

551
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,180
waiting for you.

552
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,260
I know exactly what I'm saying.

553
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,140
Your Highness, rise!

554
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,010
Teacher,

555
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,090
please accept my bow!

556
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,300
If one day, I ascend the throne,

557
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,220
I will make you the Grand Chancellor,

558
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,010
and make Cangcang my empress.

559
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,280
Get up!

560
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,930
You must be cold...

561
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,220
So,

562
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,090
how did your father see that day?

563
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,090
Father said our engagement

564
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,820
was a deal struck ten years ago.

565
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,490
He was being kind.

566
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,530
Ten years ago...

567
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,340
what right did I have

568
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,820
to bargain with Grand Tutor?

569
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,010
I was only clinging

570
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,820
to a last lifeline.

571
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,010
Father also said

572
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,010
that you from ten years ago

573
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,740
were no different from the man he is now.

574
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:23,930
No.

575
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,570
Back then, I only wanted to live.

576
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,050
Cangcang,

577
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,180
I am indeed a chess player.

578
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,090
All my life,

579
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,780
I've been playing the game,

580
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,340
weighing gain and loss with every move.

581
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,930
But taking you as my wife

582
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,300
is the best thing

583
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,010
all my plotting ever won me.

584
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,650
And hiding my true origins

585
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,700
was just another move in your game?

586
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,820
He's weighed gains and losses...
