Jueding…

So your business in Xijiang was just a ruse,

34
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,220
and you slipped back into the Capital

35

When that failed,

46

Everything I did was for Great Qi.

106

Don't say that!

167

Stay with me.

I won't be able to protect you anymore.

00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,290
Grand Tutor Ling will check our progress.

349
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,900
Have you memorized yours?

350
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,290
Huan,

351
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,700
tell me something.

352
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,140
Are you dead set on becoming Emperor?

353
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,700
So who's the real fool, me or you?

354
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,380
The truth is,

355
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,620
what I've always wanted most

356
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,180
is to live freely,

357
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,620
roaming the martial world with my sword.

358
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,940
But I know

359
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,860
it's only a dream.

360
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,180
And that is a dream

361
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,530
no one cares about.

362
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,220
I care.

363
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,530
I opposed you,

364
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,730
wanting to pull you off the throne.

365
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,050
But in truth,

366
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,460
I thought you were too frail.

367
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,730
You're not suited to rule.

368
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,380
So why not

369
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,570
grant your wish?

370
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,050
You can roam the world

371
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,980
and have your freedom.

372
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,140
I care about

373
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,460
your childhood dream.

374
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,700
Well?

375
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,050
Aren't you moved?

376
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,250
Don't you think your younger brother

377
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,730
has a bit of loyalty in him?

378
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,540
A little, I suppose.

379
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,940
Then Your Majesty, show me your generosity.

380
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,490
Grant me the request I'm about to make.

381
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,000
Speak.

382
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,780
What do you want?

383
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,820
If it's something I can give,

384
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,050
you shall have it.

385
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,740
I want to retreat from court and roam the martial world.

386
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,980
To leave with Ying and Zhong Lin,

387
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,340
and seek out Li Hongqing.

388
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,650
If I find him,

389
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,650
I'll steal away your beloved commander.

390
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,460
If I don't...

391
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,210
If I don't find him,

392
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,050
I'll still do everything I can to give Ying a happy life.

393
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,460
Well?

394
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,210
Will you allow it or not?

395
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
I still need you.

396
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,300
Not anymore.

397
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,460
Your greatest enemy has already fallen.

398
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,050
It's about time this prince made his grand exit.

399
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,170
This is my royal seal

400
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,340
and the military token of my Southern Chu fief.

401
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,650
Please keep them safe.

402
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,780
I've thought it all through.

403
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,420
Between the two of us,

404
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,570
one brother

405
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,860
should at least fulfill our shared dream of roaming free.

406
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,860
Isn't that right?

407
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,190
You intend to walk away

408
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,830
with Xiao Ying just like that?

409
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,860
After what was done to her,

410
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,490
don't you want to know the truth?

411
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,050
Wasn't the one who hurt her

412
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,740
Ling Xuefeng?

413
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,450
It's never

414
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,820
that simple.

415
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,740
Ling Xuefeng was attacked.

416
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,900
Someone wanted to silence him.

417
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,090
And that someone

418
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,050
is very likely tied

419
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,570
to Xiao Ying's attempt to assassinate me.

420
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,380
Think it over one more time.

421
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,970
Eunuch Feng, I'll trouble you with this, then.

422
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,180
I hope His Majesty

423
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,530
takes care of himself.

424
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,490
We bid you farewell.

425
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,970
You were a gift from Li Hongqing.

426
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,970
So you must bloom soon.

427
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,410
Ying.

428
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,780
You remembered?

429
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,970
Remembered what?

430
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,180
Li Hongqing.

431
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,410
Her Majesty told me.

432
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,450
She told me so many things about Li Hongqing.

433
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,090
It made me happy,

434
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,620
but somehow,

435
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,610
I feel this sadness

436
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,050
in my heart.

437
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,380
You intend

438
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,860
to walk away with Xiao Ying?

439
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,970
After what was done to her,

440
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,380
don't you want to know the truth?

441
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,340
Qianqing,

442
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,490
who is Li Hongqing?

443
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,780
Why do I feel such a longing to see him?

444
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,570
Can you take me to him?

445
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,260
All right.

446
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,340
I will take you to him.

447
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,970
But you must behave,

448
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,740
all right?

449
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,180
This is the Soul-Severing Grass.

450
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,220
It grows inside volcanic craters.

451
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,900
Its fiery nature is extremely potent.

452
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,900
Its heat can force

453
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,380
venomous insects out through the skin and flesh.

454
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,490
Perhaps this Soul-Severing Grass

455
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,970
can drive out the Dual-Pupil parasite inside Princess Ying

456
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,220
and restore her clarity.

457
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,300
Let me do it.

458
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,530
Tell me how.

459
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,970
Your Highness mustn't.

460
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,410
Once the Soul-Severing Flame touches your skin,

461
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,340
it'll scorch the flesh in an instant.

462
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,820
Ordinary people can't control it.

463
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,180
But...

464
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,860
His Majesty is an exception.

465
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,610
My body runs colder than most.

466
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,340
So this is a task

467
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,180
only I can undertake.

468
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,410
The Soul-Severing Flame

469
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,530
must drive the medicinal heat

470
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,300
into the princess's meridians

471
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,220
for the duration of one joss stick each day.

472
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,740
After three days,

473
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,260
the parasite will leave her body.

474
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,820
However...

475
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,380
His Majesty will deplete a great deal of inner force.

476
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,610
He may even suffer burns.

477
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,180
It's fine.

478
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,930
Ying.

479
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,970
Ying.

480
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,410
Ying!

481
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,610
Ying!

482
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,570
Ying!

483
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,220
Qianqing...

484
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,050
Your Majesty.

485
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,780
Stop.

486
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,610
This is enough.

487
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,740
Let's stop here.

488
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,220
The parasite is reacting.

489
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,180
That means the method is working.

490
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,130
Qianqing...

491
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,820
Ying!

492
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,260
Ying!

493
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,780
It hurts…

494
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,530
All I see is her pain.

495
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,410
It's sharp and searing,

496
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,780
a torment she can barely endure.

497
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,020
Don't worry.

498
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,280
I won't put her in danger.

499
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,900
However...

500
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,780
Ying is the only one who knows the clues.

501
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,570
You want to walk away halfway.

502
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,090
But I need to

503
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,970
know the truth.

504
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,660
Is the truth you're after

505
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,820
worth the pain Ying goes through?

506
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,490
She's not your sister.

507
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,700
Of course you can harden your heart and look away.

508
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,740
But I can't.

509
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,490
Ying, come with me.

510
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,530
We're leaving.

511
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,340
Move.

512
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,180
You think you're the only one who sees her as family,

513
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,410
the only one who cares for her?

514
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,090
No one in this world

515
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,050
but Xiao Huan

516
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,300
truly knows what her pain feels like.

517
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,380
He grew up enduring pain no ordinary man could bear,

518
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,090
all for that gleam of hope after the storm.

519
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,780
Ying has held on for so long,

520
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,180
and now you want her to give up halfway?

521
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,900
What about everything she endured?

522
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,300
I won't let her suffer another moment.

523
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,410
I'll care for her all my life.

524
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,260
Xiao Qianqing!

525
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,660
Wake up.

526
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,180
Ying doesn't remember anything now.

527
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,180
She doesn't remember me.

528
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,450
She doesn't remember us.

529
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,970
She doesn't remember anything.

530
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,180
She doesn't remember Li Hongqing.

531
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,530
Do you really think

532
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,740
she could ever be happy for the rest of her life?
