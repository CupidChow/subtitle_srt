00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,240
You again.

3
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,280
I just wanted to greet a friend.

4
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
How did you find this place?

5
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,880
<i>Other than the quarry,</i>

6
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
<i>I also saw Zhong Lin change her clothes</i>

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,080
<i>and met with His Highness's subordinates.</i>

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,560
I was bored so I asked around

9
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,800
and deduced where both of you would be.

10
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,240
Then, I came to pick you up.

11
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
I saw you both come out
of His Highness's manor

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,520
whilst disguised as tattoo artists.

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,480
You also mentioned forging just now.

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,320
So, I ran it through my mind

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,360
to see what exactly

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,600
you need forged in
Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,120
Well,
if you wish to forge His Highness's seal,

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,200
allow me to suggest

19
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,360
Wuxi green jade.

20
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,520
Miss Ling, Wuxi green jade

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,520
is indeed the material with
which the royal seal is made.

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,920
I keep running into you.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,880
What are you after?

24
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,160
I wish to follow you and achieve greatness

25
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,960
to make a name for myself

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
in this martial world.

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,000
Fame and glory are but an illusion.
I do not share your goal.

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
We all have different ambitions.

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,520
But isn't it beautiful

30
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,960
to share a journey together?

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Wuxi green jade
for your perusal, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
Good.

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
Why are you shaking?

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,880
I'm not killing you.

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,920
Thank you for clemency, Your Highness.

36
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,760
Have you found

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,800
the two fraudsters?

38
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,040
Your Highness,

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,280
they snuck out of the manor stealthily
and disappeared.

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
But none of our property is lost.

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
And you couldn't discern
real tattoo artists from the fake ones?

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
Tattoos have intricate patterns.

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
But those fraudsters did a good job
replicating the patterns.

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,400
So you're saying

45
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,440
that they put in so much effort

46
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,920
into approaching me

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,520
so that they could tattoo a bird on me

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,160
to humiliate me?

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,960
You're an idiot!

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
You know what?

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,120
Re-enact the whole
scene with the housekeeper.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
Even if you can't figure out the truth,

53
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
I will still spare you.

54
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,160
But I'll break your legs

56
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,040
and feed you to the hounds.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,519
Make haste.

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Yes.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
FENGLAI PAVILION

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,880
Forgive me. All jades are unique.

61
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,520
This one might be slightly different
from the one used by Prince of Yuzhang.

62
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,280
- It can't be helped.
- This jade

63
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,920
is more polished than the real one.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
And you found it within one night?

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,600
You're amazing.

66
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,120
Prince of Yuzhang's seal

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,960
is engraved
with four claws that subdue evil.

68
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
Just who exactly are you?

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm Bai Chifan

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,560
of the Xiling region.

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,800
Bai Chifan?

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,880
Bai Chifan.

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
You have the name of a fraudster.

74
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
You are mistaken.

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
I come

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
from an affluent family,

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
so I must be discreet.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,640
Are you related to the Bai clan of Xiling?

79
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,160
A distant relative of theirs.

80
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,280
A distant relative?

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,800
The Bai clan of Xiling
is a sword-wielding clan.

82
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,760
They were a big name
in the martial world for several decades.

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Then, they went to
the western regions to trade.

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,160
It is true that they are rich right now.

85
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,400
- So you truly are Bai Chifan?
- Yes.

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,280
A spoiled heir who forsook
martial arts for mercantile skills?

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,920
Who's your father?
My origin doesn't define me.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Just like I never asked
who your father is.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,800
Why must you know who my father is?

90
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,880
So you're just a spoiled heir.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,600
Do you even know
what makes the martial world?

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Everyone has a different take.

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,400
Some fight for vengeance.

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,520
Some fight for justice

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,880
or bonds that cannot be severed.

96
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,360
They all make up the martial world.

97
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,000
In my opinion,

98
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,000
it is enough as long as I possess the will

99
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,120
to wield my sword.

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
Since you're so insightful,

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,520
can you guess

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,440
what I'm after?

103
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,520
Expensive robes. Thumb ring.

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,160
Royal seal.

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,960
Are you gathering these items

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
to impersonate Prince of Yuzhang?

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,800
It's not that serious.
You'll just get your entire family killed.

108
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh. From what I was told,

109
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,880
Prince of Yuzhang might seem boisterous,

110
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,320
but he's actually quite observant.

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,040
He might
have already seen through your trick.

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,920
It seems like I did underestimate you.

113
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
I hope you won't bar me

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,680
from joining Fenglai Pavilion

115
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,280
simply because I know too much.

116
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,520
Of course, not.

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,160
Fenglai Pavilion
never breaks its promises.

118
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,320
My friend, take a seat.

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,880
Don't worry.
We do not renege on our promises.

120
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Give me a few days.

121
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,480
After I consult the rest,

122
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,760
I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

123
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,600
Miss Ling, you're committing a crime.

124
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,200
It's against our sect's rules.

125
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
He knows too much.

126
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
I can't risk letting him ruin our plan.

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
Luo, imprison him.

128
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,560
- Yes.
- Zhong Lin.

129
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,840
Check if someone did
leave the Bai clan of Xiling

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,240
to go on an adventure
in the martial world.

131
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,400
Yes.

132
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,640
FENGLAI PAVILION

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,720
<i>They know Cangcang</i>
<i>is after Frostflame Iron.</i>

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,120
<i>Something's afoot.</i>

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,440
<i>Report back to the capital immediately.</i>

136
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
We get in from this side

137
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,160
and you will enter from here.

138
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
REFINEMENT QUARRY

139
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,200
We'll group up here.

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,039
Once it's done, wait for my signal.

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,360
- Cangcang.I need to tell you something.
- Oh, you're here.

142
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,080
Luo. Look. The royal seal is done.

143
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,280
Everything is in order.
It's up to you now.

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,040
Cangcang. I have to be away for a while.

145
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,800
Are you serious?

146
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,160
- I'm serious.
- You are?

147
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,600
But

148
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,760
we planned this for so long.

149
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,160
If you leave now,
everything will go to waste.

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Besides, how am I supposed
to find another Prince of Yuzhang?

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Why don't we delay it for a few days?

152
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,840
No.

153
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,240
If we miss the timing, we'll be in danger.

154
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,160
It is an urgent matter
that I must attend to.

155
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,480
Is it my father?

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,320
The worst outcome will always happen.

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,920
Why must he take
you away at this crucial moment?

158
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,520
Just go.

159
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,280
- What will you do now?
- What can I do? I'll figure it out.

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,520
He left for real.

161
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,640
I…

162
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Cangcang.

163
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,400
He left just like that.
Who can impersonate Prince of Yuzhang now?

164
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
How would I know?

165
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
Perhaps…

166
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,080
Miss Ling.

167
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,680
How have you been?

168
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
What do you think, Cangcang?

169
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
It's not good.

170
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
What do you mean?

171
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
I have the thumb ring and the fan.

172
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,880
No, it's not good.

173
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,800
You look like a feeble scholar,

174
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
and not a prince.

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,760
What do we do now then?

176
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,600
Are we just going to give up?

177
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,600
This is bad.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,080
What should we do?

179
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I have an idea.

180
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,600
I was careless.

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,440
Miss Ling, what is the meaning of this?

182
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,040
Speak! Who exactly are you?

183
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,480
- Bai Chifan.
- Stubborn, aren't you?

184
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,720
Bring them in.

185
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,240
Fenglai Pavilion
has a wide selection of torture tools.

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,760
I'm giving you one last chance.

187
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,040
Answer honestly.

188
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,800
If you lie to me,

189
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,000
you'll have a taste
of all my torture devices.

190
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Ask away.

191
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,760
Did my father send you here to spy on me?

192
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,000
No one

193
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,640
can order me around.

194
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,760
You can be the first if you let me

195
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
join Fenglai Pavilion.

196
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
How arrogant.

197
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Who are you? The emperor?

198
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,120
If my father did not send you here,

199
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,920
why do you know and care about

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
my whereabouts and Fenglai Pavilion?

201
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,680
Explain yourself.

202
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,960
One who understands
the rules of the five elements

203
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,120
and the nature of humanity

204
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,680
will know all there is
to know in the universe.

205
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,080
Enough of your nonsense.

206
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
I am not making anything up.

207
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,520
My father did not send you here?

208
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,720
Shouldn't I be more trustworthy

209
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,160
if I were close to your father?

210
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
Release him.

211
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,840
<i>He has the looks</i>

212
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,000
<i>and the comportment for it.</i>

213
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,600
<i>Since I have no better option,</i>

214
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,920
<i>I'll just have to use him.</i>

215
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,840
Bai Chifan.

216
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,200
I have a use for you.

217
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,640
FENGLAI PAVILION

218
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,520
Miss Ling, can you tell me

219
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,640
why I must impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

220
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,840
and risk getting my entire family killed?

221
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,280
Don't worry.
Now that you're part of my sect,

222
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,080
you're mine.

223
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
Come what may,

224
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,200
I'll protect you.

225
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,640
And if I insist on finding out why?

226
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
Right.

227
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Since you're taking the risk,

228
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,160
you earn the right to know.

229
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,800
Give me a moment.

230
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,040
FROSTFLAME IRON

231
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,720
{\an8}Frostflame Iron?

232
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,320
Yes. Did you know?

233
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,800
One who owns Frostflame Iron

234
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,240
can craft a divine
weapon to lead the martial world.

235
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,000
Frostflame Iron

236
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,120
must first endure
abyssal flame for a millennium

237
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
before being frozen for another millennium

238
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,520
in order to form this distinct pattern.

239
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,760
Also,

240
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,200
a sword made of this iron

241
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,560
is indestructible.

242
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,920
The Great Qi Dynasty has not seen

243
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,640
such material in several centuries.

244
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
Several days ago,

245
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,520
they found one
in the quarry in Southern Chu.

246
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,480
So you want me to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

247
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
to get this iron ore?

248
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,440
Yes. Prince of Yuzhang rules Southern Chu.

249
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,640
If Prince of Yuzhang wants it,

250
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,880
they'll have to turn it in.

251
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,560
You're so naive.

252
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,720
Do you really think a few weapons
with this iron will allow you

253
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,720
to rule the martial world?

254
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,640
What's wrong with that?

255
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,080
In this martial world,

256
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,520
the sharper the blade,
the more power you have.

257
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,400
What else?

258
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,280
BRUSH AND INK

259
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,000
Father, I am telling the truth.

260
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,320
In that case, explain why

261
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,040
Cangcang put in so much effort

262
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,040
for one Frostflame Iron.

263
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,640
She was looking for the hall master

264
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,520
and wanted someone to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang.

265
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,800
If she wanted the iron ore,

266
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,320
she could've come to me.

267
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,480
Perhaps Young Lady

268
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,680
doesn't want to rely
on you for everything.

269
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
It's not as simple as that.

270
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Cangcang has always
been an opinionated kid.

271
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,000
Xianxue.

272
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
I know

273
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,480
you are loyal, responsible,

274
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
and meticulous.

275
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,680
But you seem to forget to mention

276
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,600
a certain Bai clan member of Xiling

277
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,440
who approached Cangcang lately.

278
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,240
He…

279
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,440
He's Bai Chifan.

280
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,360
He keeps pestering Young Lady.

281
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,400
But she doesn't really take him seriously.

282
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
She even thought
you had sent him to spy on her.

283
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,240
Do you know why I summoned you

284
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
back here?

285
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Please enlighten me.

286
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,040
Xianxue.

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,720
You must know

288
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
that Cangcang

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,160
is now in Southern Chu,

290
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,360
the territory of Prince of Yuzhang.

291
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,360
Xianxue.

292
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,359
No matter what happens,

293
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,960
you must protect her.

294
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,040
In the meantime,

295
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,720
I need to know

296
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,920
what she's doing.

297
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,119
Yes, Father.

298
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,040
Now return to Southern Chu.

299
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,040
I need you to do something.

300
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,640
- Yes, Sir.
- Go now.

301
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,560
Xianxue.

302
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,640
You must know that Cangcang

303
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,040
will be the Empress consort.

304
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,080
So cease whatever wishful thinking

305
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,440
you have now.

306
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,640
Yes.

307
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's go.

308
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,040
People have gone missing lately.

309
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
Let's hurry up.

310
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,720
We've been foraging
for vegetables in the mountains.

311
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,720
I'm so hungry that I can't walk.

312
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,160
A bun!

313
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
Don't eat it.
We don't know where it's from.

314
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,280
What if it's poisoned?

315
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,680
Why would anyone poison a bun?

316
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,640
Wake up!

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,160
Get up!

318
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,560
Get up!

319
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
Eat the buns now

320
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,600
or you won't even be able to afford it

321
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,280
in the quarry.

322
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

323
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,440
Why are you

324
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,000
sneaking up this late at night?

325
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
It is my duty to make sure

326
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,440
that you are always alert, Your Majesty.

327
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,280
All right, Shi Yan. Take a seat.

328
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,160
Shi Yan. Did you find anything

329
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,880
about Refinement Quarry
that I told you to?

330
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,080
Your Majesty, on the surface,

331
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,240
that quarry mines and processes ores.

332
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,800
But in reality, it runs a monopoly

333
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,400
that abducts citizens to be miners
and forges weapons without authorization.

334
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,640
Many people have died.

335
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,840
Many young boys went
missing in Southern Chu.

336
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
In fact, more than 100
young boys have disappeared.

337
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,920
Southern Chu is an affluent region

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,040
that is governed by Prince of Yuzhang.

339
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,760
You must have misheard, Your Majesty.

340
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,280
In that case,
they are behind the missing boys

341
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,280
of Southern Chu.

342
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,360
At this moment, it seems so.

343
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,640
My investigation

344
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,440
reveals that Lingbi Sect
is behind the quarry.

345
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,880
And the one running the sect is…

346
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,000
Grand Tutor Ling is quite ambitious.

347
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,520
Southern Chu is
Prince of Yuzhang's territory,

348
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,840
and he is committing his crime here.

349
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,880
Isn't Ling Cangcang
sabotaging her father's plan

350
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,480
by going to the quarry?

351
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,720
Perhaps she isn't even aware

352
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,640
of the ties between
her father and Lingbi Sect.

353
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,480
Luo Xianxue
returned to the capital suddenly.

354
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,640
He might already know that I'm here.

355
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,560
This time, not only must
we bring back the Empress,

356
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
we must also get rid of Lingbi Sect,

357
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
thereby extinguishing
his contingency plan.

358
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,480
The marriage is inevitable.

359
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,520
We must now help Ling Cangcang
achieve her goal as soon as possible.

360
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,680
Impersonating me in public?

361
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,880
The audacity of it!

362
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,400
Slow down. They can't have run far.

363
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,280
Are you sure
they headed to Refinement Quarry?

364
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,320
Yes. Absolutely.

365
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,320
All right.

366
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,880
If you make another wrong judgment,
you'll pay for it.

367
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,720
Hurry up! Faster!

368
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm talking about you! Hurry!

369
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,400
There are only kids in this cave.

370
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
No need to feed them properly.

371
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,360
Just one bun per day.

372
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,920
If that's not enough,

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,960
tell them to drink water.

374
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,720
Sir, the laborers we have
are too swollen to walk now.

375
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,520
Ten kids died last month.

376
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,960
All our men are out there capturing kids.

377
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,000
But we still don't have enough manpower.

378
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,480
There is even a rumor saying

379
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,240
that the ghosts are kidnapping kids.

380
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,160
Besides,

381
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,960
if something bad happens,

382
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,120
what do we do?

383
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
We are working
for the Ghost King after all!

384
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,200
Right.

385
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,440
He wants the money urgently.

386
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,080
What can we do?

387
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,600
And you. You talk a lot

388
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,720
and eat a lot.

389
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,120
What now?

390
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,360
Why are you in a rush?

391
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,800
Prince of Yuzhang is here.

392
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,600
Prince of Yuzhang?

393
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,400
What is he doing here?

394
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,840
Greetings, Your…

395
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,680
Are you the owner of this quarry?

396
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

397
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,080
What can I do for you?

398
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,320
I was told

399
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,880
that you found Frostflame Iron.

400
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,320
Your Highness, you need not come here

401
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
in person for one iron ore.

402
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,680
If you desire it,

403
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,600
just say so

404
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,800
and I will have
it delivered to your manor.

405
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,240
What?

406
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,520
Are you doubting my identity?

407
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,720
Of course, not.

408
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,400
Look closely.

409
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,080
Wuxi green jade.
Even a fortune can't buy it.

410
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,520
It is in the right form too.

411
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Frostflame Iron, is it?

412
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Let me retrieve it now.

413
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,240
You, come with me.

414
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,760
- You two, serve His Highness tea.
- Yes.

415
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,160
What a delicate chest.

416
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,480
It must have been
made by a famous blacksmith.

417
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
You know many things, Your Highness.

418
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,320
Precious iron ores must
be stored in a precious box.

419
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,600
Please, Your Highness.

420
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,840
How dare you
try to murder Prince of Yuzhang!

421
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,160
Prince of Yuzhang?

422
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
The prince's royal seal

423
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,640
has four claws to subdue evil.

424
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,240
But yours has five claws.

425
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,120
Prince of Yuzhang's seal is engraved

426
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,440
with four claws to subdue evil.

427
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,120
If I don't even
possess such basic knowledge,

428
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,440
how can I even run my smithing business?

429
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,640
Insolence!

430
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,880
Hold your breath.

431
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,560
Give chase now! Quick!

432
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,200
Hurry!

433
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,560
Over there!

434
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
You can escape no more.

435
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,320
Don't you know where you are?

436
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,880
You think you
can steal the Frostflame Iron?

437
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,040
Who says

438
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,680
we're after the Frostflame Iron?

439
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,840
Mister, you are…

440
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,000
I am Shi Yan. Mr. Bai Chifan asked me

441
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,360
to assist Fenglai Pavilion.

442
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,040
Bai Chifan…

443
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,200
What is going on?

444
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,040
I think Quarry No. 2 blew up.

445
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,760
Sir, this is bad!

446
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,000
Sir! The slaves…

447
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
- The slaves escaped.
- What?

448
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,000
But sir, you said someone
was impersonating Prince of Yuzhang.

449
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,960
So I dispatched all our men here.

450
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,640
You fled on purpose

451
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,640
to lure us here?

452
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,640
It seems like
I've underestimated you both.

453
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
I'm glad you know that.

454
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,080
Bai Chifan.

455
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,640
Zhong Lin already rescued those kids.

456
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,880
Find an opening and flee.

457
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
I'll watch your back.

458
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,880
No, allow me to protect you.

459
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,000
What a tear-jerking pair
of star-crossed lovers.

460
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
Unfortunately for you,
my smoke is laced with potent poison.

461
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,240
It won't be long till you fall.

462
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,440
Surrender

463
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,720
yourself now and come clean.

464
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,440
Then perhaps I'll spare you.

465
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Kill them all!

466
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,000
Leave none alive. Kill them all!

467
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,200
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

468
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,520
Charge!

469
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,840
Run now.

470
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,760
Come!

471
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Don't worry about me. Just go.

472
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,160
Come.

473
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
Take this.

474
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,680
What is it?

475
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
A pill to save you.

476
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,080
You don't want to
leave any witnesses alive.

477
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,760
Ghost King of the Lingbi Sect?

478
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,800
What a monster reared by Lingbi Sect.

479
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,200
He is invincible.

480
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,520
Prince of Yuzhang? He's finally here.

481
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,000
Quite late too.

482
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,880
Your Highness, please capture
these unscrupulous scoundrels.

483
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,320
<i>It's you, my dear brother.</i>

484
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,800
You're the unscrupulous scoundrels.

485
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,920
Subdue them!

486
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,600
- Yes, Your Highness.
- It's not us.

487
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,560
You're mistaken.
We did this because we wanted to rescue…

488
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,800
Let go of me.

489
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,920
Let go!

490
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,000
This is just a misunderstanding.

491
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,240
We did this because
we wanted to rescue the slaves.

492
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,720
Let me talk to His Highness! Don't go!

493
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,880
I'm sorry.

494
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,200
I promised to protect you.

495
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,040
I failed that.

496
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,320
But who knew Prince of
Yuzhang would arrive this late?

497
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,480
So you wanted to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

498
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,680
to lure the culprits away

499
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,000
before you could bring them to justice?

500
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,240
The miners were abducted off the street.

501
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,720
Many of them are just teenagers.

502
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,560
Fenglai Pavilion
doesn't covet fame and glory.

503
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,200
We just want to help the helpless ones.

504
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,080
<i>So that's why</i>
<i>she refuses to enter the palace.</i>

505
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,640
If the plan fails, you might die.

506
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,960
Have you thought about that?

507
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,960
My life is precious, but so are theirs.

508
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,840
I used you as bait today.

509
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,280
I'm sorry.

510
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,320
But it wasn't my
intention to get you hurt.

511
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,240
Show me your wound.

512
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,240
It's nothing.

513
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,560
But you…

514
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,840
In this vast world,
it's hard to find someone

515
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,880
who will defend those victims.

516
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,320
If this is your goal,

517
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,000
I'll do everything I can

518
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,240
to make sure you're not alone in this.

519
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,800
<i>Speaking of which,</i>
<i>he has saved me several times.</i>

520
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,160
No, allow me to protect you.

521
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,640
Your pulse is stable but weak.

522
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,440
It's all thanks to your pill.

523
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,920
It sped up the recovery.

524
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,600
How come you are immune

525
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,040
to the poisonous smoke?

526
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,760
Besides, you were shot by an arrow too.

527
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,960
I am immune to all poisons.

528
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,720
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

529
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,960
I'm serious.

530
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,120
I'll tell you more in the future.

531
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,480
Your Highness.

532
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,480
A missive from the Empress Dowager.

533
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,200
Your Highness! What if Her Highness wishes

534
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,600
to tell you something important?

535
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,760
Every time Mother wrote to me,

536
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,680
it was about His Majesty.

537
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,040
I know what I'm doing.

538
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,800
I'm leaving now.
Are you not going to see me off?

539
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,280
From now on,

540
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,000
you're a prince who governs a region.

541
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,200
You'll have to think before you act now.

542
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,520
Huan, before I leave, can you please

543
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,640
give me the Great Qi Divination Chart

544
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,320
drawn by Father?

545
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,880
Father left it behind,

546
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,840
and I wish to keep it

547
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,280
as memorabilia.

548
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,000
Father's chart

549
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,040
contains the topography

550
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,760
of Great Qi.

551
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,160
You're asking for this chart.

552
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,640
Does this mean you are still

553
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,640
coveting the throne?

554
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Remember now.

555
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,360
As long as I breathe,

556
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,600
you will not

557
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,080
have the divination chart.

558
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Prince of Yuzhang? You're finally here.

559
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,120
I did impersonate and deceive you.

560
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,520
But it was to save the kids.

561
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,520
My achievement can offset the crime.

562
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,440
No, it cannot.

563
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,080
Can you be a generous soul
and let it slide?

564
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,040
I hate the word,

565
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,720
generous, the most.

566
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,680
When I see that bird on my back,

567
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,800
it only fuels my hatred more.

568
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,560
Unless…

569
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,960
Unless what?

570
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,720
Unless the man behind you

571
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,000
can apologize to me properly,

572
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
then I may consider forgiving your crime.

573
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,760
Look.

574
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,440
I coerced him into coming here.

575
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
It has nothing to do with him.

576
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,800
I'll apologize to you on his behalf.

577
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,800
I am Bai Chifan.

578
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,840
It was not my intention to offend you.

579
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,560
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

580
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Mr. Bai,

581
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,440
you can put your dignity aside
when need be.

582
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,440
Are you Bai Chifan for real?

583
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,120
Yes.

584
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,400
If that's the case,

585
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,120
do you know the consequences

586
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,600
of impersonating me?

587
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,840
Wait, Your Highness.

588
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,880
You are the ruler of Southern Chu

589
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,480
yet you did not know
that there was an illegal quarry

590
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,040
that refined iron in your feudal land.

591
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,400
If His Majesty learns of it,

592
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,640
you will be beheaded.

593
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,720
We found the culprit for you.

594
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,000
Your Highness
will not be seen as colluding with them.

595
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,200
And with this achievement,

596
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,960
His Majesty will surely praise you.

597
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,280
By right, you should reward us.

598
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,160
I'm here to punish you.

599
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,960
Why must I reward you?

600
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,360
Didn't I explain?

601
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,800
Our achievement offsets the crime.
It's even now.

602
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,360
All right now.

603
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,080
We'll be leaving now.

604
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,560
No need to see us off.

605
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,640
Halt.

606
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,040
To reward you two,

607
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,240
I have set up a banquet.

608
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,760
Won't you do me the honor?

609
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,800
You did what
you did to save innocent lives.

610
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,400
On behalf of Southern Chu citizens,

611
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,320
allow me to thank you.

612
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

613
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,920
I'll dig in then.

614
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,840
Miss Ling, you are still injured.

615
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,720
You shouldn't ingest chilled food.

616
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,800
Pear soup is rejuvenating.
You should drink more.

617
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,320
- Here.
- Thank you.

618
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,360
Mr. Bai, you seem to care a lot

619
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,600
about this woman.

620
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,040
Forgive me.

621
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,720
How may I address you, miss?

622
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm…

623
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,160
<i>Oh. He's a prince.</i>

624
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,680
<i>Surely, he knows</i>
<i>about the marital arrangement.</i>

625
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,320
<i>I should not cause any unwanted trouble.</i>

626
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,960
I'm Zhong Lin, Vice Sect Leader
of Fenglai Pavilion.

627
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,680
Oh, Miss Zhong.

628
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,640
<i>She must be Ling Cangcang.</i>

629
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,080
<i>Huan always moves with a goal in mind.</i>

630
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,320
<i>So he is after her.</i>
