00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,490
Lanxi,

192
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,820
I've told you long ago:

193
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,420
no matter when,

194
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,580
you must stand tall.

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,300
It's nothing more than some schemer failing to have you killed

196
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,650
and now trying to sling mud instead.

197
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,580
As your teacher,

198
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,980
I'll stand up for you!

199
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,460
Since that's the case,

200
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,890
I ask all of you

201
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,890
to wait for the results of the palace exam.

202
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,420
Not even a word of praise for me.

203
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,130
Using me and then kicking me away,

204
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,490
how heartless of you!

205
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,770
Grand Tutor Ling.

206
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,620
[Taiji Hall]

207
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,610
You've schemed for years,

208
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,700
and now your career is about to collapse.

209
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,300
You must have lost your mind

210
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,700
after the loss of your beloved daughter.

211
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,420
Why are you talking such nonsense?

212
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,370
Don't provoke me like this.

213
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,650
This whole situation now

214
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,820
is all thanks to your fine disciple.

215
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,850
You're not much better off than I am.

216
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,740
[Writing]

217
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,650
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

219
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,180
You turned things around in the palace exam.

220
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,460
You specially summoned me here

221
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,130
just to offer congratulations?

222
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,220
Yesterday, Imperial Physician Li sent someone over

223
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,650
and had the Frost Reed delivered.

224
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,100
So he has really found it?

225
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,530
With this key herb that can dispel all poisons,

226
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,130
your cold sickness

227
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,530
may finally be cured.

228
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,730
That's wonderful.

229
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,890
I've specially prepared a banquet

230
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,130
to celebrate for Your Majesty.

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,220
Thanks for your kindness,

232
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,460
but I still have matters to attend to.

233
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,650
I'll take my leave.

234
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,220
Your Majesty just can't wait

235
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,460
to share this good news

236
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,820
with the Empress, is that it?

237
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,980
That is between the Empress and me.

238
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,820
Mind your words.

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,530
In that case,

240
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,460
I wish Your Majesty

241
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,820
long life and endless blessings.

242
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,730
May you find joy,

243
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,060
find the one you love,

244
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,980
and never be lost in doubt again.

245
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,300
Madam,

246
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,060
don't let stray desires take root.

247
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,700
All of you, leave.

248
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,100
Yes, Madam.

249
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,380
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

250
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,460
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

251
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,090
Your Highness!

252
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,660
I want to go out.

253
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,380
If you won't let me out, fine.

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,940
How about this?

255
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,660
Pick one of you to stand right here

256
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,810
so I can "light a lantern" on him.

257
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,730
Please spare us!

258
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,010
What is the Princess up to now?

259
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,730
Commander Li,

260
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,220
you'll see once you're there.

261
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,700
Actually, we don't even need fire.

262
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,900
One of these days I'll sprinkle some powder on you,

263
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,730
and it'll burst into flame at night all on its own.

264
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,730
It'll be so much fun!

265
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,700
Spare us, Your Highness!

266
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,940
Your Highness.

267
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,940
Please stop causing trouble.

268
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,490
What?

269
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,330
Want to punish me by putting out the lights again?

270
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm telling you, my brother is back.

271
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,980
I'm not scared anymore!

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,810
Forgive me.

273
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,460
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

274
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,570
You mustn't do that!

275
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,570
If my powder hadn't been destroyed,

276
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,940
you'd already be dead!

277
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,490
I have so many kinds of poison.

278
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,570
Deadly with just a touch!

279
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,420
Your Highness,

280
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,140
what are you trying to do?

281
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,490
Whatever you want me to do,

282
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,330
I'll do it.

283
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,140
Say it...

284
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,050
what do you want me to do?

285
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,530
I would like Your Highness

286
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,730
to spare my men

287
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,180
and go back to your chambers to rest.

288
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,700
Fine.

289
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,250
How long do I have to rest?

290
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,050
How about

291
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,810
you rest until tomorrow?

292
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,330
All right.

293
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,730
I'll go rest now.

294
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,050
See you tomorrow.

295
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,570
Finding you

296
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,290
makes me really happy.

297
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,420
Sir.

298
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,620
- Are you okay? - Are you alright?

299
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,810
What are you looking at?

300
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,810
Do I look that bad?

301
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,810
Am I poisoned or something?

302
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,860
Your Majesty,

303
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,940
this is the pear blossom honey Grand Tutor Ling brought today.

304
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,460
I added four spoonfuls, just as he ordered.

305
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,180
It really does smell sweet.

306
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,050
Whenever Father went away,

307
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,010
he would always bring me a gift,

308
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,900
like milk dates,

309
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,980
candied fruit,

310
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,050
mooncakes,

311
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,570
and this pear blossom honey.

312
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,420
He really dotes on Your Majesty.

313
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,810
His Majesty arrives!

314
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,810
It's so late.

315
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,570
What brings you here?

316
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,380
I've had two pieces of good news today,

317
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,010
so I wanted to come see my empress.

318
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,810
What good news?

319
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,250
There's hope for my cold sickness.

320
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,770
I no longer have to fear

321
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,860
that one day, I'll suddenly leave you behind.

322
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,570
What's wrong?

323
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,940
I'm not sure.

324
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,290
I just have a bit of a headache.

325
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,490
Here.

326
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,490
You're burning up.

327
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,730
I'll call the imperial physician to take a look.

328
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,860
I'm fine.

should I trust you one more time?

Your Majesty!

362
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,570
Someone, come quickly!

363
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

364
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,530
She has always been in good health.

365
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,250
How could she suddenly pass out?

366
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,460
Your Majesty,

367
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,940
Her Majesty

368
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,250
has been poisoned.

369
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,620
Poisoned?

370
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,660
How could the Empress be poisoned?

371
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,530
What kind of poison is it?

372
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,140
A vicious, rare toxin.

373
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,660
It's already entered Her Majesty's bloodstream.

374
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,660
Her temperature keeps dropping.

375
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,730
This poison

376
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,620
seems to be suppressing her heartbeat.

377
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,900
If this goes on,

378
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,290
Her Majesty will lose all body heat.

379
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,530
I'm afraid

380
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,860
in a few hours,

381
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,620
there will be no saving her.

382
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,730
How could she be poisoned

383
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,940
here in the inner palace?

384
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,010
She was perfectly fine just yesterday.

385
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:09,810
Speak!

386
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,090
Your Majesty,

387
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,490
aside from this toxin,

388
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,290
Her Majesty also seems to have taken

389
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,180
Lovesickness Powder.

390
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,050
Lovesickness Powder?

391
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,940
How do we cure it?

392
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,420
I think I've seen it before at Princess Ying's place.

393
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,620
Don't be afraid.

394
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,380
He said

395
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,660
I shouldn't make things hard for you,

396
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,860
so I won't.

397
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,380
I'll wait for him to come.

398
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,250
I knew it.

399
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,620
You were bound to come!

400
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,050
I warned you.

401
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,140
You can hate me, even kill me,

402
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,860
but you may not touch my empress.

403
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,530
Give me the antidote.

404
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,530
What antidote?

405
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,570
I'll say it one more time.

406
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,380
Give me the antidote!

407
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,050
Your Highness.

408
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,290
I've waited for you all day.

409
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,250
Hurry up and tell your master

410
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,900
that I didn't poison the Empress.

411
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,900
Xiao Ying,

412
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,530
I'm not joking with you.

413
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,770
Ying says she didn't.

414
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,140
Your Majesty,

415
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,980
what's going on?

416
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,700
You're not asking what really happened.

417
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,810
You're just lashing out.

418
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,810
Cangcang's poisoned.

419
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,330
The imperial physician says he's only seen it in the cold palace.

420
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,420
If Ying really used it,

421
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,010
would she deny it?

422
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,730
Every day she shouts about killing you.

423
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,090
Has she ever done something and not owned up to it?

424
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,770
There may be someone trying to frame her.

425
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,810
Your Highness,

426
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,530
the Empress's poison

427
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,420
really wasn't your doing?

428
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,860
You came by yesterday.

429
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,250
You told me to go rest, so I did.

430
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,250
I only just came here to wait for you.

431
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,530
How would I poison anyone?

432
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,940
Is that so?

433
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,380
Since noon yesterday,

434
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,770
Princess Ying hasn't taken a step out of the cold palace.

435
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,770
I stake my life on it.

436
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,980
After the Empress was poisoned,

437
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,860
her whole body turned cold

438
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,250
and the veins in her face went blue and purple.

439
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,140
What kind of poison is this?

440
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,460
Is there an antidote?

441
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,660
It sounds like...

442
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,010
Frostflower.

443
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,460
But I don't have an antidote.

444
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,050
I only brew poisons to kill you.

445
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,420
Why would I bother making antidotes?

446
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,250
Can you make one or not?

447
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,940
I already said there is no antidote.

448
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,180
Her temples have gone purple,

449
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,940
which means she'll be dead in a few hours.

450
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,330
Even if someone can make an antidote,

451
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,530
she won't live to see it.

452
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,090
Li Hongqing.

453
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,770
Here.

454
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,730
Go to Nanrong Palace at once.

455
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,380
Understood.

456
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,090
Your Majesty.

457
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,050
As for this matter,

458
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,810
you haven't told Preceptor Du, have you?

459
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,250
No.

460
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,140
Your Majesty...

461
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,570
Let go.

462
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,530
Imperial Physician Li has searched for ten years for it.

463
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,090
It's your lifesaving medicine.

464
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,050
Ten years, that's all.

465
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,770
I managed to wait before.

466
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,530
I can keep waiting now.

467
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,660
Your Majesty...

468
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,660
Go back.

469
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,290
You should know

470
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,900
that once I've made a decision,

471
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,900
no one can change it.

472
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,380
Your Majesty.

474
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,250
Xiaoshan,

475
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,980
grind this into powder,

476
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,010
mix it with water and bring it in.

477
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,810
I will use it to cleanse the poison from the Empress.

478
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

479
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,090
I'll go at once.

480
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,250
Commander Li took away the Frost Reed.

481
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,700
Is it because Imperial Physician Li is back?

482
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,180
Seems not.

483
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,570
Commander Li said

484
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,490
if you return,

485
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,900
you'd better go straight to Linghe Hall.

I'm not dead yet.

515
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,770
You can't afford to wait another ten years

516
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,220
for the Frost Reed.

517
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,620
There may still be hope.

518
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,050
From now on,

519
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,940
I will do exactly as you say.

520
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,530
I'll take the medicine and the needles

521
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,810
without so much as a frown.

522
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,810
Who did this?

523
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,980
I'll investigate at once.

524
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,700
No need.

525
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,860
At first, I thought it was Xiao Ying.

526
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,180
But when I returned to Linghe Hall

527
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,050
and checked everything carefully,

528
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,570
I understood.

529
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,780
This

530
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,690
is the pear blossom honey Cangcang has loved since childhood.

531
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,490
Yesterday,

532
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,570
Grand Tutor Ling sent it over.

533
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,210
And the poison

534
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,740
was hidden right inside it.

535
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,090
The imperial physician also said

536
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,210
that in what Cangcang was given,

537
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,860
there was not only a fatal toxin

538
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,130
but also Lovesickness Powder.

539
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,820
We found an important lead:

540
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,610
the cure for His Majesty's cold sickness,

541
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,380
the rare Frost Reed,

542
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,690
has finally been found.

543
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,470
If we lay the Lovesickness Powder and the poison

544
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,210
only on the very top layer of honey,

545
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,460
can you guarantee the honey beneath is clean?

546
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,780
I can, my lord.

547
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,650
I once trained under the Tang Clan.

548
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,740
I would never leave any trace behind.

549
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,820
You may rest assured.

550
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,380
This poison

551
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,530
was stolen from Princess Ying

552
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,420
by an undercover agent in the palace, wasn't it?

553
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,260
Yes.

554
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,900
I heard

555
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,860
His Majesty has already visited the cold palace

556
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,170
and seems to have cleared Princess Ying.

557
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,900
It doesn't matter.

558
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,610
With no solid proof,

559
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,050
even if His Majesty suspects something,

560
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,860
this case

561
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,300
can only be left hanging.

562
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,940
Speak.

563
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,530
My lord,

564
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,380
this Frostflower poison

565
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,490
is incredibly vicious.

566
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,610
If used carelessly, it could take a life.

567
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,820
Are you truly not worried about Young Lady?

568
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,820
If you had a daughter

569
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,170
who grew up fair and clever,

570
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,820
treasured like a pearl in your palm,

571
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,860
could you not worry,

572
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,340
not feel pain?

573
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,010
I've long since prepared the antidote.

574
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,340
In the last round,

575
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,650
I lost.

576
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,850
So I decided

577
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,490
to place one more bet.

578
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,340
I bet that someone else's feelings for Cangcang

579
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,820
run deeper

580
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,010
than mine.

581
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,210
He's gambling.

582
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,050
Word about the Frost Reed

583
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,420
must have leaked out.

584
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,260
He's betting

585
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,050
that I won't just stand by and watch Cangcang die,

586
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,570
that I'll definitely use the Frost Reed

587
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,090
to save her life.

588
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,980
And once I do,

589
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,050
I won't live much longer.

590
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,340
He can pin it all on Xiao Ying,

591
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,210
and even stir up strife between me and the Empress Dowager.

592
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,860
And after that,

593
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,740
if the Empress conceives my heir,

594
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,210
this round

595
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,420
really will be three birds with one stone.

596
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,690
As for this,

597
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,820
you already knew it

598
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,260
before treating the Empress?

599
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,050
This matter

600
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,690
cannot simply be let go!

601
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,530
Are you really going to wait

602
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,570
and let Ling Xuefeng become regent again one day?

603
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,940
You must not soften again.

604
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,690
If the Empress bears an heir,

605
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,820
Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.

606
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,010
As Grand Tutor Ling is now,

607
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,340
he's resorting to desperate measures.

608
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,980
[Linghe Hall]

609
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,010
You must not soften again.

610
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,260
If the Empress bears an heir,

611
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,300
Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.

612
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,340
You're awake.

613
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,420
What happened to me?

614
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,340
You were poisoned.

615
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,260
Poisoned?

616
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,690
Who did it?

617
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,260
The Empress Dowager?

618
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,570
It doesn't matter anymore.

619
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,570
What matters is,

620
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,690
the poison has been cleared.

621
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,650
People in this inner palace

622
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,530
are truly like beasts let loose.

623
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,420
What's wrong?

624
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,650
You look so grim.

625
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,460
Before the medicine cools,

626
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,900
hurry and drink it.

627
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,460
What kind of medicine is this?

628
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,780
Is it bitter?

629
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,260
Birth-control tea.

It's mixed by Preceptor Du.

It won't do your body much harm.
