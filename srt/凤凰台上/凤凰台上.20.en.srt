00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,580
so he'll give me a month off every year

174
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,530
to come back and visit you and Father.

175
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,940
Really?

176
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,850
He even wrote the decree himself.

177
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,940
He's also sending officials over agriculture and works

178
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,130
to open up trade routes for Jiangzhou.

179
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,650
Later, I'll meet with Kumor to discuss

180
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,820
how to resettle the people of Xijiang.

181
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,820
That's wonderful.

182
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,850
Cangcang,

183
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,010
Father always told me

184
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,730
emperors are the most heartless,

185
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,820
that a ruler's heart is unreadable.

186
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,060
He wanted me to train hard

187
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,770
and become a strong warlord.

188
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,850
But I think

189
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,770
His Majesty isn't as heartless as Father said.

190
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,300
He's an emperor,

191
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,820
but he has a kind heart.

192
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,820
Yes,

193
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,650
he's a good emperor.

194
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,460
Most importantly,

195
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,610
he treats you well.

196
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,940
He's willing to ride into the enemy camp for you,

197
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,180
risking his life.

198
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,530
You can't ask for more than that.

199
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,420
Cangcang,

200
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,650
hurry up and give birth to a little prince.

201
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm dying to be an uncle.

202
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,820
You brat,

203
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,250
what do you think about all day?

204
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,460
Cangcang,

205
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,250
I feel like

206
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,250
things between you and His Majesty

207
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,370
are a little off.

208
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,250
Back when he was seriously ill,

209
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,060
you stayed by his side every moment.

210
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,060
When he was in danger,

211
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,060
you even risked your own life to save him.

212
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,530
But now that he's awake,

213
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,850
you won't go and see him.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,460
What's between us

215
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,460
isn't something you'd understand!

216
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,300
There's nothing a good drink can't fix.

217
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,980
Cangcang,

218
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,650
back when you insisted on roaming the martial world,

219
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,100
Father was dead set against it.

220
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,220
Didn't you say

221
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,100
all those martial world dreams

222
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,770
aren't worth a single cup of wine?

223
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,220
I've never seen you

224
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,820
this weighed down before.

225
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,820
Yeah.

226
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,820
A sword and a jar of wine,

227
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,980
that's the Cangcang I'm supposed to be.

228
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,460
Cangcang,

229
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,610
where are you going?

230
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,250
His Majesty's better now.

231
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,060
I've still got things to do,

232
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,130
so I have to leave first.

233
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,580
You're not staying with His Majesty?

234
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,140
[Post Station]

235
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,580
Your Majesty,

236
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,820
Her Majesty left early this morning.

237
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,370
Summon Kumor and Ling Jueding to discuss affairs.

238
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,060
Your body still can't take too much strain.

239
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,820
It's fine.

240
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,340
I need to get everything in Xijiang and Jiangzhou

241
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,340
properly arranged

242
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,580
so we can set out as soon as possible.

243
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

244
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,460
Hongqing,

245
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,340
escort Physician Li back to the Capital.

246
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,820
Shi Yan,

247
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,100
return to Fenglai Pavilion.

248
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,850
All right.

249
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,820
General Ling,

250
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,580
even though Jiangzhou is settled,

251
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,770
there will be plenty of loose ends.

252
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,820
I hope you won't relax your guard.

253
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,850
I obey, Your Majesty.

254
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,580
I will see to everything personally.

255
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,850
General Ling,

256
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,370
do you know

257
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,610
where the Empress has gone?

258
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,340
My sister didn't tell me.

259
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,340
But...

260
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,180
Your Majesty may head toward Yanxia Lake.

261
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,340
She once said

262
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,530
she wanted to see it.

263
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,340
All right.

264
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,130
Thank you, General Ling!

265
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,300
Your Majesty!

266
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,180
You've only just begun to recover.

267
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,100
You can't push yourself like this!

268
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,010
Physician Li,

269
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,650
didn't I tell you

270
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,010
I'm already fine?

271
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,100
And I just took my medicine, didn't I?

272
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,530
Your Majesty...

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,340
Don't kneel.

274
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,220
Madam,

275
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,850
General Lu requests an audience.

276
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,250
Let him in.

277
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,100
Yes, Madam.

278
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,850
Preceptor Du.

279
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,420
General Lu.

280
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,820
How is His Majesty?

281
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,060
His Majesty and Her Majesty

282
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,580
will be able to return soon.

283
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,940
How is His Majesty's health?

284
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,650
His Majesty is in excellent health.

285
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,650
It's just...

286
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,980
it's just...

287
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,010
Just what?

288
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,300
His Majesty gave a verbal edict

289
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,940
for me to pass on to you.

290
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,820
What edict?

291
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,730
His Majesty said

292
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,770
the Empress will soon return to the palace,

293
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,650
and that you...

294
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,580
that you are

295
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,820
to remember what he told you

296
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,250
back in Jiangzhou.

297
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,090
In this world,

298
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,090
there is more than one person
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

299
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,140
who can heal my body.

300
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,620
But as for my empress,

301
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,810
there's only Cangcang.

302
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,460
I obey,

303
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,860
Your Majesty.

304
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,290
Madam!

305
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,980
Madam,

306
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,420
what happened to you?

307
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,620
I followed His Majesty's will

308
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,460
and reflected in Nanrong Palace.

309
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,980
But you can't hurt yourself.

310
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,490
So what if I hurt myself?

311
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,570
No one cares anyway.

312
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,090
I...

313
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,660
Coward.

314
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,180
Madam...

315
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,620
You like someone but don't dare admit it.

316
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,810
If that doesn't make you a coward,

317
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,090
what does?

318
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,810
Madam,

319
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,810
do you still remember

320
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,050
your mother's last words?

321
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,250
Think this through.

322
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,860
If you stay by my side today,

323
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,010
you belong to me from now on,

324
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,860
your life and death at my command.

325
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,220
If you want my heart,

326
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,860
I will give it to you!

327
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,980
Come catch me!

328
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,090
Catch me!

329
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,970
You can't catch me!

330
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,450
I never imagined

331
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,530
that after all these years,

332
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,320
there'd be so many shops here.

333
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,380
Sir,

334
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,610
one plate of fennel dumplings.

335
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,330
Got it!

336
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,090
Today

337
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,730
is my foster son's birthday.

338
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,290
And also,

339
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,260
bring a small jar of wine too.

340
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,720
All right!

341
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,180
Luo!

342
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,220
Cangcang!

343
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,460
I can't protect you anymore!

344
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,900
Live well.

345
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,900
You must live on!

346
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,180
Cangcang,

347
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,420
we'll meet again someday.

348
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,180
Good child,

349
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,680
I'll be waiting

350
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,050
for good news from you.

351
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,460
I will not

352
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,770
fail your expectations!

353
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,940
Long live Lingbi!

354
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,660
All hail the Protector!

355
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,860
Long live Lingbi!

356
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,330
All hail the Protector!

357
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,180
Xianxue,

358
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,290
you've done very well.

359
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,730
You make me proud.

360
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,700
Thank you for backing me, Father.

361
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,530
But what brings you here

362
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,530
this time?

363
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,630
Has something happened in Jiangzhou?

364
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,900
The Jiangzhou crisis is over.

365
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,180
Jueding

366
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,420
got out of it in one piece.

367
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,530
But Xiao Huan

368
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,770
sacrificed the status verification system

369
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,420
to make Kumor agree to withdraw.

370
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,290
But Father,

371
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,140
wasn't the system

372
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,940
your idea?

373
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,380
Xiao Huan wants Xiao Qianqing to act as Regent

374
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,670
mainly to counter me and the Empress Dowager,

375
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,180
so he can reap all the gains,

376
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,770
and push his talent recommendation system through.

377
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,250
New emperor, new court.

378
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,570
He means to stand against me completely.

379
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,750
And that's not all.

380
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,200
Xiao Qianqing even went to Jiangzhou in person.

381
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,490
Who knows what he's plotting.

382
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,980
At this rate,

383
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,830
not only our Ling clan,

384
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,250
but Cangcang as well

385
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,940
will find it

386
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,770
even harder

387
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,380
to survive

388
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,140
in that imperial city.

389
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,420
Whatever you need of me,

390
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,420
I will not refuse.

391
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,180
Cangcang,

392
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,180
go easy on the wine.

393
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,530
This really isn't like you.

394
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,290
Jueding said

395
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,730
a jar of wine and a sword,

396
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,730
that's the real me.

397
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,770
Isn't that just the old Ling Cangcang?

398
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,530
How is that not me?

399
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,770
At this point,

400
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,420
you have to learn to move on.

401
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,420
Yeah,

402
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,010
move on.

403
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,090
That's why I'm saying,

404
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,180
why don't we go back and rebuild Fenglai Pavilion?

405
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,180
What's wrong?

406
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,980
You're acting really strange.

407
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,900
Are you hiding something from me?

408
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,180
- Cangcang, I... - I know.

409
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,660
You've been bewitched by Xiao Qianqing.

410
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,530
What are you even talking about?

411
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,860
You're lying to me.

412
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,180
No...

413
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,330
We're talking about you.

414
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,050
How did this get turned on me?

415
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,140
Look how flustered you are.

416
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,530
I hit the mark, didn't I?

417
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,140
You do like him.

418
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,460
Don't talk nonsense.

419
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,730
So what if you like him?

420
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,420
What's so hard about admitting it?

421
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,660
Cangcang,

422
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,250
I actually...

423
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,290
What are you doing here?

424
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,380
So my brother can come,

425
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,730
but I can't?

426
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,530
Cangcang,

427
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,490
why did you leave so suddenly?

428
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,700
Come back to the Capital with me.

429
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,220
You promised you would.

430
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,530
It's harsh out here,

431
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,530
nothing like the palace.

432
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,330
Why don't we

433
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,900
head back a little earlier?

434
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,290
We?

435
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,530
You mean...

436
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,600
you and I going back to the Capital together?

437
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,180
Xiao Huan,

438
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,900
stop coming after me.

439
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,980
You're the Empress of Great Qi,

440
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,140
head of Fenglai Pavilion.

441
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,250
How can someone like you go back on her word?

442
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,980
Ten more li ahead,

443
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,330
and we'll reach Yanxia Lake.

444
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,180
We can take the waterway back.

445
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,380
I just feel

446
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,330
there are things

447
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,660
I need to sort out in my head.

448
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,250
He's chased his wife a thousand li,

449
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,900
and you insist on getting in the way here.

450
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,900
They get to enjoy the scenery on their way back,

451
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,330
while I have to deal with all those old foxes.

452
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,700
How is that fair?

453
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,010
She's the Empress of Great Qi.

454
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,730
How could that be the same?

455
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,420
I'm warning you,

456
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,460
with that attitude,

457
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,940
watch they don't dump you halfway

458
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,530
and feed you to the wolves.

459
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,330
I'm not scared.

460
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,010
I've still got you, don't I?

461
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,420
You won't have the heart to dump me.

462
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,330
I'll toss you in first!

463
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,700
Please don't hurt my child!

464
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,940
Zhong Lin!

465
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,860
Zhong Lin!

466
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,860
Zhong Lin!

467
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,050
What did you make her take?

468
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,940
You think we're idiots

469
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,620
who'd swallow your poison?

470
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,010
Say one more word

471
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,330
- and I'll stab her again! - Wait!

472
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,940
Stop!

473
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,730
Eat it, now!

474
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,050
I thought it was something serious.

475
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,620
Turns out it's just some cheap soft-bone powder.

476
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,980
Hardly worth all this fuss.

477
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,090
Talk!

478
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,810
What do you people actually want?

479
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,730
Send someone who can negotiate.

480
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,540
[Zhu Sha, branch leader of the Lingbi Sect]

481
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,620
Honestly,

482
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,010
none of you know how to treat a lady.

483
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,620
Such a pretty little thing,

484
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,330
how can you be so rough with her?

485
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,490
Who on earth are you?

486
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,050
Don't hurt her.

487
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,460
If you want to talk, talk to me.

488
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,380
Talk to you?

489
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,900
Sure.

490
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,180
Come here.

491
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,050
Cangcang, don't come any closer...

492
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,620
This is Bone-Eating Ice,

493
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,530
deadly poison.

494
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,460
So you're one of us.

495
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,730
No wonder you know what Bone-Eating Ice is.

496
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,900
How funny.

497
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,900
Since when did the Lingbi Sect's assassins

498
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,770
grow so soft-hearted?

499
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,180
What are you talking about?

500
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,900
What Lingbi Sect assassin?

501
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,330
Looks like your friend

502
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,180
still doesn't know who you really are.

503
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,270
We've got two grown men right here.

504
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,940
Why are you bullying a girl?

505
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,620
If you've got guts, come at us!

506
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,460
Don't rush.

507
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,180
Here I am.

508
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,620
Heal her.

509
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,890
Otherwise,

510
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,040
there's nothing to talk about.

511
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,130
Sir,

512
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,890
how did you know I wanted to talk to you?

513
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,610
If anything happens to her,

514
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,720
I can guarantee

515
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,170
that what you want

516
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,720
will never be yours.

517
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,970
Oh, I'm so scared!

518
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,610
Treating her

519
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,170
isn't out of the question.

520
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,520
This sir,

521
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,080
you were so fired up just now.

522
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,130
What,

523
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,210
trying to play the hero?

524
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,450
And what if I am?

525
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,170
How about this:

526
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,610
if you stab yourself once,

527
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,210
I'll treat her wound.

528
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,650
Xiao Qianqing,

529
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,410
don't listen to this madwoman...

530
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,000
Well?

531
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,320
If you don't,

532
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,520
Miss Zhong will die from this Bone-Eating Ice.

533
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,210
Not deep enough.

534
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,560
Go deeper

535
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,450
and the two ladies will go to the VIP parlor.

536
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,890
There'll be food,

537
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,760
drink,

538
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,890
medicine,

539
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,210
and a warm brazier.

540
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,000
That's the spirit!

541
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,890
Take Miss Ling and Miss Zhong to the VIP parlor.

542
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,410
Yes, Madam!

543
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,450
The drug we gave you

544
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,000
does more than just sap your strength

545
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,210
and block your inner force.

546
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,650
It also slows your bleeding.

547
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,650
You'll die very slowly,

548
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,450
and ever so beautifully.

549
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,520
What are you really after?

550
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,650
I thought you knew.

551
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,080
How would I know if you don't say?

552
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,520
Don't rush.

553
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,330
You can stay here

554
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,640
and slowly admire your brother's misery.

555
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,000
Cangcang...

556
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,330
there's something

557
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,640
I've never known how to say to you.

558
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,080
I...

559
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,850
You don't have to.

560
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,000
I already know.

561
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,290
I've actually suspected for a long time

562
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,410
that Master sent you to my side.

563
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,290
After his identity was exposed,

564
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,080
I started doubting who you were too.

565
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,330
But...

566
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,200
if the truth had really come out,

567
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,640
I wouldn't have known how to face it either.

568
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,520
Cangcang,

569
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,410
I never meant to hide it from you.

570
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,850
You're the person I care about most.

571
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,200
I'd rather go to my death

572
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,330
than ever hurt you in the slightest.

573
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,520
I know.

574
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,770
That's why I trust you.

575
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,000
I won't hold it against you.

576
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,770
After everything we've been through,

577
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,330
I've finally realized

578
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,200
a lot of things aren't simply black or white.

579
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,450
I know

580
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,640
you must have had your reasons.

581
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,080
You've changed.

582
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,200
It's like you suddenly grew up.

583
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,770
Let's drop it.

584
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,080
Our top priority now

585
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,770
is figuring out how to get out of here.

586
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,640
Those people are from the Lingbi Sect?

587
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,640
Right.

588
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,560
They know who we are,

589
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,520
and they know ordinary poisons

590
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,970
can't do anything to Xiao Huan,

591
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,000
so they hit us with soft-bone powder right away.

592
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,410
Looks like

593
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,520
they came well-prepared.

594
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,890
What is she after?

595
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,640
How's your wound?

596
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,880
I hate it when you dodge the question like that.

597
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,590
Same.

598
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,600
I hate it when you keep badgering me.

599
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,770
I only got hurt because of you.

600
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,450
You clearly just wanted to play the hero.

601
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,730
What's that got to do with me?

602
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,120
Of course it has to do with you.

603
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,000
They were obviously coming for you.

604
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,770
If I'd known, I should've wiped them all out.

605
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,200
What else do you know

606
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,410
about the Lingbi Sect?

607
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,770
Ever since Master Li Lu sent me to you,

608
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,120
I've barely had any contact with them.

609
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,640
I only heard their saintess came out of seclusion.

610
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,630
And not long ago,

611
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,590
a Lingbi Sect Protector suddenly came to me

612
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,110
and ordered me to kill Xiao Qianqing.

613
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,890
There was such a thing?

614
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,000
And Xiao Qianqing pulled a disappearing act

615
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,000
and helped me get away.

616
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,640
But now that they've recognized me again,

617
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,410
they definitely won't let this go.

618
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,770
But this time, I won't dance to their tune.

619
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,890
Their earlier attempt to kill Xiao Qianqing

620
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,890
is surely not as simple as it seems.

621
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,640
And the woman today

622
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,370
doesn't seem to want him dead.

623
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,250
Then what does she want?

624
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,520
This operation

625
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,000
is to intercept and kill the Emperor of Great Qi

626
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,970
and take back the Lingbi Sect's sacred relic.

627
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,330
That's the Emperor of Great Qi!

628
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,930
And you dare set an ambush for him?

629
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,290
Don't forget:

630
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,560
if he doesn't die,

631
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,120
you will.

632
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,200
I forgot to introduce myself.

633
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,770
I'm Zhu Sha, branch leader of Shuyang chapter

634
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,080
of the Lingbi Sect.

635
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,000
As for me,

636
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,250
I love thinking up

637
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,520
new ways to torment people.

638
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,000
So should I try them out on you,

639
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,250
or on Ling Cangcang?

640
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,890
If you lay a finger on her,

641
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,250
I swear

642
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,930
you'll never get

643
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,160
what you're after!

644
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,640
They say emperors are heartless.

645
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,000
But you'd turn out

646
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,000
to be such a lovesick fool!

647
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,480
I heard the Ghost King's token, the Moon-Eclipse, is in your hands.

648
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,410
How about this:

649
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,640
divorce Ling Cangcang,

650
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,000
and I'll marry you.

651
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,410
You be the Emperor,

652
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,520
I'll be the Ghost King.

653
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,930
We'll work together

654
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,120
and rule the world.

655
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,290
My brother

656
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,640
doesn't need to work

657
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,770
with some freakish witch like you.

658
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,770
Xiao Qianqing,

659
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,890
do you want Zhong Lin dead that badly?

660
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,040
Guards!

661
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,470
Go tie Zhong Lin up!

662
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,390
Wait!

663
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,330
Miss...

664
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,330
Miss Zhu Sha,

665
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,250
hold on.

666
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,290
Don't be hasty.

667
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,770
If he won't agree,

668
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,370
you can have me.

669
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,000
I... I am younger than he is,

670
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,410
and a lot gentler.

671
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,000
We can work together.

672
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,850
Really?

673
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,640
Guards,

674
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,040
open the cage.

675
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,850
But I like

676
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,160
the proud streak on you even more.

677
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,120
If you're willing to spend one night with me,

678
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,640
I'll let them go.

679
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,680
How about it?

680
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,250
What's wrong with your taste?

681
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,450
He's got no sense of romance at all.

682
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,120
I'm different.

683
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,410
Guards,

684
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,370
take him to my room.

685
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,930
Yes, Madam!

686
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,680
You really are a stunning beauty.

687
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,890
No wonder the Emperor fell so hard for you.

688
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,930
Cut the nonsense.

689
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,640
What exactly are you after?

690
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000
There are so many lovesick ones in this world.

691
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,160
Whether their love is real,

692
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,290
my Illusion-Butterfly Powder will tell.

693
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,810
Tell me,

694
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,330
for your sake,

695
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,080
will Xiao Huan hand over the Moon-Eclipse?

696
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,930
Cangcang,

697
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,370
does it still hurt?

698
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,520
Let's think of a way

699
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,770
to get out of here.

700
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,040
Your Majesty...

701
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,930
Cangcang,

702
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,600
what's wrong?

703
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,970
Cangcang!

704
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,410
It's me, Xiao Huan!

705
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,480
She's inhaled my Illusion-Butterfly Powder.

706
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,930
It traps people in illusions.

707
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,120
Her mind and the drug will tear at her,

708
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,290
driving her into agony

709
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,370
until her insides collapse and she dies.

710
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,600
How long

711
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,330
do you think she can last?

712
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,040
Zhu Sha,

713
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,730
how can you be so vicious?

714
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,370
You're only realizing that now?

715
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,970
You just want the Moon-Eclipse, don't you?

716
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,080
I can give it to you!

717
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,520
Right now, in her eyes,

718
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,040
you're a mortal enemy she's fighting to the death.

719
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,770
Cangcang,

720
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,560
it's me, Xiao Huan.

721
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,480
I don't believe you'd really kill me.
