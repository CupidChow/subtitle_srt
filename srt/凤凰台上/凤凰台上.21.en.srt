[Episode 21]

23
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,900
I didn't expect Xiao Huan

24
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,540
to be such a romantic.

25
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,980
Don't move.

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,980
How could this happen?

27
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,490
Sorry to disappoint you.

28
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,660
I've woken up.

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,410
This can't be!

30
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,610
How could my Illusion-Butterfly Powder fail?

31

How is it that you're both standing here?

It seems

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,610
your investigation wasn't thorough enough.

We're fine.

Thanks to the Puppet Incense that Xiao Qianqing brought,

I'll give you one more chance.

Hand over the Moon-Eclipse,

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,570
or I'll make sure all of you lose your senses

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,380
and perish with your meridians severed.

54

Protector, have mercy!

the Moon-Eclipse to you.

Is that so?

61
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,490
to become the Ghost King yourself.

I'm glad you're safe.

That day,

67
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,900
I watched you be engulfed in flames with my own eyes.

68
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,340
Father sent someone to retrieve your body,

69
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,540
and they found a severed finger on it as well.

70
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,730
I thought

71
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,220
I'd never see you again.

72
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,020
How did you escape?

73
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,100
There was a cellar in the liquor storage.

74
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,020
I hid there

75
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,730
and barely survived.

76
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,250
You never came

77
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,170
looking for me.

78
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,540
I knew

79
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,370
His Majesty saw me as a thorn in his side.

80
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,220
If I appeared recklessly,

81
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,490
I'd only bring you trouble.

82
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,140
So,

83
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,780
I planned

84
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,100
to wander the world.

85
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,290
And now you've appeared out of nowhere.

86
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,340
Do you intend to assassinate him?

87
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,810
Why?

88
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,370
I don't want

89
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,460
to see you hurt,

90
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,490
suffering,

91
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,930
or endangered because of him.

92
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,540
Cangcang,

93
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,540
he's your tribulation.

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,020
Don't let yourself get entangled with him anymore.

95
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,340
If you can't make up your mind,

96
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,610
I can help.

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,340
Luo,

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,460
so much has happened

99
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,460
between him and me since you left.

100
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,540
It's not

101
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,540
as simple as you think.

102
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,780
Even I didn't expect some things.

103
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,020
He and I...

104
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,730
Nobody can decide our matters for me.

105
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,580
I overstepped.

106
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,220
That's not what I meant.

107
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,610
Luo, I...

108
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,290
Cangcang.

109
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,610
Have you forgotten?

110
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,250
You saved my life.

111
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,850
Protecting you

112
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,820
is my lifelong duty.

113
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,250
I don't want to see you harmed in any way.

114
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,610
I heard they raided an evildoer's base around here.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,460
Many missing children were found.

116
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,420
Many of them were silenced.

117
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,340
He moved!

118
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,610
They say

119
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,730
you're dying.

120
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,860
I won't allow it.
Luo Xianxue,

121
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,760
you are not to die

122
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,710
without my permission.

123
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,010
I, Luo Xianxue, swear to the heavens.

124
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,530
From now on, I belong to Ling Cangcang.

125
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,770
No matter how hard it gets,

126
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,180
I will stay strong

127
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,770
for Ling Cangcang.

128
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,010
No matter how hard it gets,

129
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,340
I will stay strong

130
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,940
for Ling Cangcang.

131
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,340
Cangcang,

132
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,130
it's for you

133
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,460
that I crawled my way out of that fire.

134
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,180
Luo,

135
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,940
ever since you joined the Ling family,

136
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,340
you've always been a brother to me.

137
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,850
Do you remember

138
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,580
the vow I made when I entered the palace?

139
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,980
I will protect everyone in the Ling family.

140
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,420
I've never changed.

141
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,340
It's just...

142
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,530
With Xiao Huan,

143
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,530
I now...
So,

144
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,370
no matter how much he hurts you,

145
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,940
you won't hurt him back.

146
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,420
Is that right?

147
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,060
Luo,

148
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,770
I think there are many misunderstandings

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,130
between you two.

150
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,650
It will take time to clear them up.

151
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,460
All right.

152
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,490
If that's the case,

153
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,460
we'll talk next time.

154
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,580
Good.

155
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,530
Cangcang,

156
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,730
I remember you've always loved

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,220
pear blossom honey since you were little.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,770
I brought some

159
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,650
especially for you.

160
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,490
I didn't expect

161
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,650
you still remember after all this time.

162
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,100
Of course.

163
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,980
Try it while it's warm.

164
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,300
It's the taste I remember.

165
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,770
It's been...

166
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,460
It's been...

167
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,100
Cangcang!

168
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,490
Luo Xianxue.

169
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,980
I know why you came.

170
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,580
If you really wanted to be dead,

171
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,100
you wouldn't show up.

172
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,770
Let's cut the chatter.

173
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,700
Hand over the Moon-Eclipse

174
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,490
and face your fate.

175
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,530
Do you know what you're saying?

176
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,010
There will be

177
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,700
a battle between us.

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,060
Have you thought about

179
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,850
what will happen to Cangcang?

180
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,890
I will never hurt her.

181
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,460
You already have.

182
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,460
You know Ling Xuefeng is using you

183
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,530
to rebuild the Lingbi Sect,

184
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,650
yet you willingly serve as his dog.

185
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,100
You know how Cangcang feels about me,

186
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,530
yet you help Ling Xuefeng to kill me.

187
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,100
What do you expect

188
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,370
Cangcang to think or do?

189
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,850
Enough talk.

190
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,850
Fight me!

191
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,250
Stop!

192
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,980
Cangcang...
You lied to me.

193
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,250
You weren't supposed to be...

194
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,300
I've used inner force to remove the sedative in the pear blossom honey.

195
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,100
Your "death" was flawless.

196
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,980
You couldn't have done it alone.

197
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,490
What's really going on?

198
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,300
Cangcang,

199
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,940
you and Father

200
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,770
saved my life.

201
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,220
I must obey

202
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,370
his command.

203
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,530
My father?

204
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,730
What order did my father give you?

205
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,010
He must die

206
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,010
today.

207
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,610
You won't succeed!
Cangcang,

208
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,340
move aside!

209
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,250
The Xiaoxing Guards are already lying in wait.

210
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,340
You can't do anything to me.

211
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,980
Luo Xianxue,

212
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,580
you loyally serve Grand Tutor Ling.

213
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,300
But sadly,

214
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,650
you're a fool.

215
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,700
Do you know what Grand Tutor Ling has done?

216
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,940
Whatever he does,

217
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,820
it's all for the Ling clan

218
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,300
and Cangcang.

219
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,580
Is it?

220
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,530
Do you know Grand Tutor Ling

221
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,850
poisoned Ling Cangcang to force His Majesty

222
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,100
to give her the cure?

223
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,220
Were his actions really for Ling Cangcang's sake?

224
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,010
What?

225
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,490
My father...

226
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,530
Was it

227
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,850
the pear blossom honey?

228
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,460
Grand Tutor Ling brought this pear blossom honey today.

229
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,940
I added four spoonfuls as instructed.

surrender yourself.

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,730

Let him go.

238
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,460
Let him go?

239
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,530
Cangcang!
Go!

240
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,180
I never want to see you again.

241
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,890

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,010
to resign of my own accord.

268
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,460
I only ask that Your Majesty

269
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,660
will be merciful

270
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,860
and spare

271
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,700
my only daughter.

272
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,860
[Qi]

273
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,460
They've returned at last.

274
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,490
We welcome the return of His Majesty and Her Majesty.

275
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,810
It's been a while, everyone.

276
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,620
I hope all has been well.

277
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,980
I dare to ask,

278
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,730
Your Highness, how much longer

279
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,420
will you govern on behalf of His Majesty?

280
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,730
Well...

281
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,180
His Majesty's health has greatly improved

282
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,250
but still requires rest.

283
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,420
You'll have to deal with me for a while longer,

284
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,940
Grand Tutor Ling.

285
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,460
His Majesty and Her Majesty share a deep and enduring love.

286
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,770
It is a blessing for Great Qi.

287
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,900
Enough of these words.

288
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,900
Save them

289
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,330
for when His Majesty returns from the outer palace

290
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,810
to hear it himself.

291
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,490
Now, let us discuss the situation in Xuzhou.

292
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,460
The disaster in Xuzhou

293
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,050
has been temporarily contained.

294
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,380
Sadly, Song Lanxi

295
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,900
was killed.

296
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,330
Mr. Song was killed?

297
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,460
Mr. Li,

298
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,980
I have failed you.

299
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,700
Lanxi sacrificed himself for the country.

300
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,220
I pray Your Highness will investigate the culprits behind the unrest.

301
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,330
Rest assured.

302
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,810
It is my duty.

303
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,980
That said,

304
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,660
the position of Governor of Xuzhou remains vacant.

305
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,090
There is no suitable candidate in Xuzhou.

306
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,180
From what I know,

307
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,420
the former Governor

308
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,700
was once under Grand Tutor Ling's tutelage.

309
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,290
Might you have

310
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,180
any suggestions

311
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,810
for the new Governor,

312
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,810
Grand Tutor Ling?

313
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,810
I never expected

314
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,730
the Governor of Xuzhou

315
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,420
to commit such unforgivable acts!

316
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,010
He ignored my warnings.

317
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,770
It brings shame upon me.

318
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,090
Indeed.

319
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,940
I was also taken aback.

320
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,090
Mr. Li,

321
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,090
you've returned to court.

322
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,330
I entrust you to recommend

323
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,980
a governor for Xuzhou.

324
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,250
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,250
My Lord,

326
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,250
His Majesty and Her Majesty have arrived at the outer palace.

327
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,770
Still no word from Xianxue?

328
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,900
No.

329
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,770
We grew up together.

330
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,220
My mission is to protect Cangcang.

331
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,090
But now,

332
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,730
she no longer needs your protection.

333
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,660
Who said that?
His Majesty.

334
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,530
Then what am I to do?

335
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,980
Do whatever

336
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,140
you wish.

337
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,380
Be carefree and at ease.

338
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,570
Isn't that a good thing?

339
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,730
Can I?

340
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,180
You can.

Young Master,

374
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,090
what are you...
Answer me.

375
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,580
Did you really poison

376
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,340
Young Lady's pear blossom honey?

377
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,560
Did you?

378
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,020
I can't believe it's true.

379
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,760
Father actually meant to harm Cangcang.

380
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,010
No.

381
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,700
He had his reasons.

382
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,900
Everything he does is for her

383
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,090
and the Ling clan.

384
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,330
He never meant her harm.

385
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,030
Then, answer this.

386
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,020
If that person hadn't given her the antidote,

387
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,380
what would have happened?

388
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,090
You're gambling with her life!

389
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,250
Luo Xianxue!

390
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,050
I pulled you back from the brink of death

391
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,980
and took you in.

392
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,210
Is this how you repay me?

393
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,900
I am Cangcang's father.

394
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,290
Everything I do

395
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,460
is for her good.

396
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,810
Xianxue,

397
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,470
this is the path she must walk.

398
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,900
All we can do

399
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,160
is pave the way for her

400
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,660
to travel steadily

401
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,160
and far.

402
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,460
I know your heart aches.

403
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,420
As a father, so does mine.

404
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,050
But this is the truth she longs for

405
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,700
and the reality she must face.

406
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,530
I beg

407
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,220
Your Majesty

408
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,730
to spare the Ling clan

409
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,140
and Luo Xianxue.

410
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,490
I offer myself

411
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,970
as Your Majesty's consort.

412
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,730
May Your Majesty grant my request.

413
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,620
Xiao Huan,

414
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,250
let him go!

415
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,970
Let him go.

416
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,140
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,900
I was the one who was wrong.

418
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,210
I thought I was protecting you,

419
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,860
yet I brought you nothing but harm.

420
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,170
Cangcang,

421
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,690
I swear to the heavens.

422
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,170
From this day forth,

423
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,860
I will never let you suffer

424
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,340
even the slightest harm.

425
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,250
How did I end up here?

426
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,860
Your Majesty,
I'll announce your arrival right away.

427
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,490
Don't bother.

428
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,410
The Emperor returned

429
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,140
to court today.

430
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,410
Yet, my son still has the nerve to sleep soundly in his residence.

431
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,140
Your Majesty,

432
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,170
please mind your health.

433
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,970
What...

434
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,210
Greetings, Your Majesty.

435
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,140
Where did you come from?

436
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,490
Dishevelled

437
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,140
and sneaking about.

438
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,930
What are you doing at the Prince of Yuzhang's manor?

439
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,540
The night was young,

440
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,820
and we made merry together.

441
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,450
What else

442
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,250
did you think we did?

443
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,250
You...

444
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:06,970
Your Majesty.

445
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,540
Your Majesty.

446
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,120
[Linghe Hall]

447
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,730
We welcome Her Majesty's return.

448
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,780
[Fate's rise and fall heed no one's will]

449
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,740
[Where fate is sown, the heart makes its own choice]

450
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,100
[Where fate is sown, the heart makes its own choice]

451
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,860
Look at mine.
See how high it is.

452
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,900
Mine's higher.

453
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,170
Zhong Lin,

454
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,780
you brought me out of the palace.

455
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,100
Is there something you want to tell me?

456
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,970
I...

457
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,490
Cangcang.

458
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,170
You...

459
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,340
What do you want to say?

460
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,580
Nothing.

461
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,820
You seemed to be in low spirits,

462
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,100
so I thought a kite flying outing might cheer you up.

463
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,650
Cangcang,

464
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,540
you've seemed unhappy lately.

465
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,780
What's troubling you?

466
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,340
I was thinking about my father.

467
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,970
Grand Tutor Ling?

468
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,090
Since our return from Jiangzhou

469
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,610
and after meeting Luo Xianxue,

470
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,340
you've been acting strangely.

471
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,930
What happened?

472
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,970
It wasn't until today

473
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,860
that I pieced everything together.

474
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,300
It turns out

475
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,860
the mastermind behind all this

476
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,780
was him.

477
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,380
Xiao Huan never told me

478
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,260
about everything my father did.

479
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,740
I think

480
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,740
he wanted to protect me

481
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,300
and feared I wouldn't be able to bear it.

482
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,260
These past few days, I've been thinking.

483
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,010
When did Father

484
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,740
who cared for

485
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,410
and protected me so much change?

486
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,450
How could he do such things?

487
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,340
Cangcang,

488
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,780
you're his only daughter.

489
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,740
He must love you.

490
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,130
But how much

491
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,490
of that love is genuine

492
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,110
and how much is self-serving,

493
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,820
I can no longer tell.

494
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,010
He was certain

495
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,050
Xiao Huan would use the Frost Reed to save me.

496
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,090
If I could successfully carry a child,

497
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,570
he could support my child

498
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,300
to ascend the throne.

499
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,610
So

500
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,700
what do we do now?

501
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,050
The Grand Tutor has set his mind to this...

502
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,570
What does His Majesty plan to do with him?

503
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,970
Caught between the two,

504
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,900
what should you do?

505
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,010
Xiao Huan is a wise ruler of Great Qi.

506
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,410
He is a good emperor for the people.

507
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,860
To protect Great Qi,

508
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,090
the stability of the nation,

509
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,820
and the well-being of the people,

510
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,860
I must stand alongside Xiao Huan

511
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,740
as his equal.

512
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,260
As for my father...

513
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,700
I only hope

514
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,010
he can still change his ways.

515
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,740
But I haven't figured out how to face him yet.

516
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,820
Cangcang,

517
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,410
he will.

518
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,570
The Grand Tutor surely will.

519
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,530
Shall we go

520
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,380
fly kites?

521
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,260
Don't dwell on it.

522
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,930
Let all these worries and sorrows

523
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,380
fly away like kites.

524
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,130
All right?

525
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,700
Come on.

526
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,780
Come on!

527
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,010
That boy runs fast.

528
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,820
Yes.

529
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,090
- Be careful. - Careful.
Wait for me!

530
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,410
It flies so high!

531
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,360
[Taiji Hall]

532
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,130
Today,

533
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,970
I wish to discuss

534
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,260
the abolition of the status verification system in Jiangzhou.

535
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,610
In addition,

536
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,410
to implement temporary centralized status verification nationwide

537
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,090
and gradually abolish the system.

538
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,860
Does anyone

539
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,300
have objections?

540
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,930
Your Majesty,

541
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,050
while

542
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,130
the temporary system might solve

543
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,610
immediate concerns,

544
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,260
it risks encouraging negative practices.

545
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,340
Please consider carefully, Your Majesty.

546
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,900
What negative practices?

547
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,970
Well...

548
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,300
Your Majesty,

549
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,650
Minister Xing believes the root

550
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,440
of the vagrants' issues

551
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,930
lies in registration and taxation.

552
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
Centralizing the registration

553
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,570
might cause taxation problems.

554
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,700
Therefore,

555
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,570
this can't continue.

556
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,450
Since you brought up taxation,

557
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,900
I've also given the matter some thought.

558
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,570
This tax system was set during the reign of the previous emperor.

559
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,220
Shouldn't it be improved to suit the times?

560
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,450
Your Majesty,

561
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,260
this tax system has been in place for many decades.

562
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,930
It has its reasons to exist.

563
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,410
It won't do to change it

564
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,550
on a whim.

565
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,010
I believe

566
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,410
what Your Majesty has said

567
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,300
is reasonable.

568
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,970
Mr. Li is right.

569
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,860
I also support Your Majesty's proposal.

570
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,130
Prince of Yuzhang, what are your views?

571
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,050
As His Majesty and Grand Tutor Ling said,

572
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,410
the tax system hasn't changed for decades.

573
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,490
But Great Qi's development

574
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,740
never stops.

575
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,780
I believe

576
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,340
this is the time to break the old ways

577
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,220
and reform taxation.

578
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,660
Prince of Yuzhang and I are of the same opinion.

579
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,610
The current tax system

580
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,930
has many types of levies

581
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,820
which prompt frequent corruption by officials.

582
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,300
I have also

583
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,860
considered simplifying

584
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,930
the collections

585
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,090
and taxing by acreage instead.

586
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,260
Of course,

587
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,050
all this is still under discussion.

588
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,740
If any minister has ideas,

589
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,300
please present them to me.

590
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,860
Since no one else has anything to say,

591
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,930
we'll end

592
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,380
today's session here.

593
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,570
You're grinning without reason.

594
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,860
What cunning scheme

595
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,900
is your wise self plotting now?

596
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,570
I just think

597
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,010
you were especially impressive today.

598
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,090
As a matter of fact,

599
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,660
it has been a long time

600
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,410
since we had a proper conversation.

601
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,220
Feel free to enjoy this advantage you have earned.

602
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,660
Well,

603
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,610
what do you think of my idea?

604
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,130
If the tax policies are simplified,

605
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,380
officials will find it harder to cheat,

606
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,820
so revenue should increase.

607
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,300
More importantly,

608
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,930
the people's tax burden will lessen.

609
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,450
It is indeed a good proposal.

610
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,220
However...

611
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:17,900
However,

612
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,410
the status verification issue

613
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,090
only treats the symptoms, not the cause.

614
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,010
We'll take it slow.

615
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,410
Reform

616
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,130
takes time.

617
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,740
I heard you stopped Her Majesty's birth-control tea.

618
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,970
You know about that?

619
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,570
My mother cares about you having an heir

620
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,340
much more than I do.

621
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,450
I heard

622
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,340
she is eager to find a princess consort for you.

623
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,660
What do you say?

624
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,700
Would you like me to find you a few?

625
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,570
I do regret

626
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,930
meddling and saving you.

627
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,660
Look.

628
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,530
Victory is mine.

629
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,780
Your Majesty,

630
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,970
is it true that you can roast pears?

631
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,130
Yes.

632
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,090
This is a recipe my mother invented.

633
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,220
When I was little,

634
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,010
I remember often

635
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,820
roasting pears with my master

636
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,900
and father...

637
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,660
The Grand Tutor roasts pears too?

638
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,780
I haven't roasted them

639
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,970
in a while as well.

640
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,010
Father.

641
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

642
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,530
Please be seated.

643
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,660
You as well, Your Majesty.

644
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,860
Let me tell you something.

645
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,860
Only the Jinye pears

646
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,900
from Shuiquan Village are best for roasting.

647
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,340
They are full of juice.

648
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,930
Once they're grilled,

649
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,180
spread some

650
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,700
of your favourite pear blossom honey on them.

651
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,490
You used to love it

652
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,220
as a child.
