00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,170
Please look after her.

192
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,860
Keep her from coming after me.

193
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,060
Thank you, sir!

194
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,010
We're out of congee.

195
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,060
Please wait a moment.

196
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,540
Stay in line, everyone!

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Here you are.

198
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,940
What's wrong?

199
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,130
Zhong Lin,

200
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,530
you're not yourself today.

201
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,940
If you

202
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,520
- have time to stand here, - Thank you.

203
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,820
why not help us instead?

204
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,420
I'm used to having everything done for me.

205
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,250
Great acts of charity like distributing congee

206
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,940
should be left to Your Excellency.

207
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,180
Here.

208
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,130
Move aside.

209
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,940
Is it ready yet, Madam?

210
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,650
Almost.

211
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,730
I know you.

212
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,610
Your name is Niqiu.

213
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,100
You already got your congee.

214
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,610
Everyone only gets one serving a day.

215
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,220
Move along.

216
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,730
Sir,

217
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,610
please,

218
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,730
let me get some more.

219
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,580
I'm really hungry.

220
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,820
Don't you understand the rules?

221
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,730
Get out of here!

222
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,420
Your Highness.

223
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,650
Careful.

224
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,250
Did you hurt yourself?

225
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,850
Here, take this.

226
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,250
Go on home.

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,490
Why are you looking at me like that?

228
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,220
Did

229
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,100
my gentle

230
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,420
and benevolent nature stun you?

231
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,220
Your Highness.

232
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,420
What's wrong?

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,580
Come with me.

234
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,020
- Thank you. - Thank you.

235
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,610
Bless us.

236
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,090
Bless us.

237
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,980
What are they worshipping?

238
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,980
The Tudigong?
[*Lord of the Land]

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,530
Your Highness,

240
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,060
that's no Tudigong.

241
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,340
It's the Locust Lord.

242
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,220
The Locust Lord?

243
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,420
That's absurd.

244
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,370
Why would anyone worship

245
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,980
something that only brings disaster?

246
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,340
Common folk have long seen locust plagues as divine punishment.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,420
They believe only sincere prayers

248
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,730
will earn mercy

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,130
and end the plague.

250
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,530
Why didn't you officials do anything

251
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,530
to stop such absurd rumors?

252
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,300
People were uncertain at first.

253
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,060
But after the Governor of Xuzhou

254
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,340
suddenly killed himself in prison,

255
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,940
they became convinced their worship

256
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,010
moved the Locust Lord

257
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,770
to deliver justice,

258
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,610
so things kept escalating.

259
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,890
"Know the enemy and know yourself,

260
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,010
and you'll never lose."

261
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,420
We should

262
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,700
head back

263
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,820
and come up with a plan.

264
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,610
Where are you going?

265
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,100
I didn't haul grain all the way to Xuzhou

266
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,300
just to let them

267
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,580
offer it to a swarm of bugs!

268
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,460
What are you planning to do?

269
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,300
Out of the way!

270
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,890
What are you doing?

271
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,820
Everyone!

272
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,060
Everyone,

273
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,980
- please listen to me! - Locust Lord!

274
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,530
The Governor of Xuzhou has confessed and paid for his crimes,

275
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,980
and we've found a way to end the plague.

276
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,700
The grain distributed by the government

277
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,820
is to get you through the famine,

278
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,460
not to be offered

279
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,420
to the very pest that caused it!

280
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,770
Please get up

281
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,130
and take your grain home.

282
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,340
Madam, get up.

283
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,130
Liar!

284
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,340
You officials

285
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,180
are the ones who harmed us!

286
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,730
You...

287
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,250
If that wretched governor hadn't stolen our grain,

288
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,880
would we be starving now?

289
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,370
Nonsense!

290
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,820
The Locust Lord

291
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,130
is our guardian spirit!

292
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,060
It punished

293
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,530
the Governor of Xuzhou for us!

294
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,060
Anger the Locust Lord,

295
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,490
you'll suffer retribution!

296
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,250
You...

297
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,180
They look down on the Locust Lord

298
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,460
because they don't want us to live well!

299
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,940
Exactly!

300
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,770
- That's right! - Move aside!

301
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,610
Calm down!

302
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,770
Everyone, listen to me!

303
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,890
It's not like that!

304
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,850
How dare he?

305
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,580
- Listen to me... - Beat him!

306
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,610
Listen...

307
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,180
The darn official is attacking people!

308
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,770
He's attacking people!

309
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,490
- Step back! - Step back!

310
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,250
Beat him up!

311
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,860
How can they attack people?

312
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,220
Beat him!

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,050
- Catch them! - Let's go.

314
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,420
Don't let them get away!

315
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,860
Catch them!

316
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,570
After them!

317
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,290
Stop! Don't run!

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,700
They're up ahead!

319
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,810
Hurry, catch them!

320
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,050
Hurry!

321
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,050
Stop!

322
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,530
Come on!

323
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,180
Where are they?

324
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,810
- Over there! - That way!

325
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,530
- Hurry! - Hurry!

326
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,090
- Hurry up! - That way!

327
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,490
Hurry!

328
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,620
Mr. Song,

329
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,420
I'll draw the crowd away.

330
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,460
You protect His Highness and leave.

331
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,980
All right.

332
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,100
- Be careful. - There they are!

333
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,580
- Run! - Let's go!

334
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,180
Where did they go?

335
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,050
Search!

336
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,440
Hurry up...

337
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,070
Stop right there!

338
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,180
I'll hold them off.

339
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,770
Go!

340
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,570
No.

341
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,420
We leave together.

342
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,330
Catch them!

343
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,010
- Don't run! - Come on.

344
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,730
Stop!

345
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,330
This way.

346
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,490
Stop!

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,660
Stop!

348
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,940
- Come on. - Stop right there!

349
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,220
They're over there!

350
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,090
Don't run!

351
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,290
Stop!

352
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,810
That way! Hurry!

353
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,330
Let's go.

354
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,050
Search.

355
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,220
Boss,

356
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,490
they're not in the house.

357
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,810
Keep looking!

358
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,380
Xiao Qianqing.

359
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,900
Wake up, Xiao Qianqing.

360
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,220
Xiao Qianqing, wake up!

361
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,330
Complete the mission

362
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,380
and you'll be free.

363
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,730
If I kill you,

364
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,860
I'll be free.

365
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,220
If you fail your task,

366
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,460
the Lingbi Sect will never let you go.

367
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,980
[Kill the Prince of Yuzhang]

368
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,530
Did you find them?

369
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,250
Sir,

370
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,090
no trace of them anywhere.

371
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,530
Where are they?

372
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,940
How could they just vanish?

373
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,770
Sir,

374
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,620
a search is underway,

375
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,810
but we

376
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,980
haven't found anything yet.

377
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,290
Please grant us more time.

378
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,980
We can't wait any longer.

379
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,140
Arrest every person who was worshipping

380
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,090
that Locust Lord!

381
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,460
Interrogate them. Torture them.

382
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,620
We'll see how long

383
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,490
they can hold out!

384
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,180
But...

385
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,730
Sir,

386
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,250
there were far too many people.

387
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,660
It isn't realistic

388
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,620
to arrest them all.

389
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,010
Do you know who is missing?

390
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,330
I'll be honest.

391
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,620
It's not just the Imperial Commissioner.

392
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,140
There's also...

393
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,860
Also who?

394
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,460
In short,

395
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,050
someone you can't afford to offend!

396
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,380
Listen closely.

397
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,530
From now on,

398
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,490
no eating, no drinking,

399
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,090
and no rest

400
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,050
until you find them!

401
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,460
Turn the place upside down if you have to!

402
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,220
Is that clear?

403
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,380
Yes!

404
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,050
Careful.

405
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,330
You're hurt.

406
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,980
Where are we?

407
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,010
We fell into a dry well.

408
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,660
I can't believe those people...

409
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,290
This time, it's my fault.

410
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,090
Had I not provoked them,

411
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,330
you wouldn't be injured

412
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,380
or trapped down here.

413
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,940
I'm hungry.

414
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,660
You heard me.

415
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,290
Hurry and figure out a way out.

416
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,050
I've

417
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,770
already checked.

418
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,490
The well isn't deep,

419
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,420
and there are

420
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,530
stone bricks we can climb.

421
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,330
But in our condition,

422
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,900
we probably can't make it up.

423
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,940
Then

424
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,140
how about this?

425
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,050
Shout for help.

426
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,700
Maybe someone will hear you,

427
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,330
- and we'll be saved. - What?

428
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,620
Why don't you shout?

429
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,490
Me?

430
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,050
My arm hurts.

431
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,770
So troublesome.

432
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,050
If I'd known,

433
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,660
I would've just killed you earlier.

434
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,490
Why are you still staring at me?

435
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,420
Hurry up and shout.

436
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,140
If you wait any longer,

437
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,620
my arm will break.

438
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,380
Help.

439
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,050
Louder.

440
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,860
Help!

441
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,660
Is anyone there?

442
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,770
Help!

443
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,330
Help!

444
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,010
Is anyone there?

445
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,290
Come and help us!

446
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,050
All right, enough.

447
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,140
In a deserted yard like this,

448
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,620
no one's coming.

449
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,620
Save your strength.

450
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,660
Why didn't you say so earlier?

451
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,050
You said

452
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,050
I ended up like this

453
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,220
because of you.

454
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,010
So what's wrong with making you shout a bit?

455
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,980
Something's not right.

456
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,730
Your Highness, you didn't seem surprised at all

457
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,980
when they rioted.

458
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,460
You knew this trip would be dangerous,

459
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,330
so why did you insist on coming with me?

460
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,530
I had my reasons.

461
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,940
What reasons?

462
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,250
To protect you.

463
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,180
You've helped me so many times.

464
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,660
I can't let you walk into danger alone.

465
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,290
Stop sitting there.

466
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,980
Come here.

467
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,700
Here's the plan:

468
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,570
step on me and jump.

469
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,900
See if you can grab the vines

470
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,860
and climb out.

471
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,090
What about you?

472
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,090
I'll stay

473
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,140
and wait for you to bring help.

474
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,530
Don't... don't get sentimental.

475
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,770
I only said that because I have an important task,

476
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,330
and a little sacrifice is necessary.

477
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,700
Once you get out,

478
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,330
bring people back immediately.

479
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,570
Understand?

480
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,860
Yes.

481
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,940
I'm sorry.

482
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,090
I don't want to kill you,

483
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,380
but I can't let you live either.

484
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,900
We part ways here.

485
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,700
Whether you survive

486
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,770
depends on yourself now.

487
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,570
Sir...

488
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,220
You saw the Ghost King Token.

489
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,620
Why are you still hesitating?

490
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,140
The Ghost King has just passed away,

491
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,490
and you've already forgotten your place?

492
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,290
I wouldn't dare.

493
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,380
Please, sir, spare me.

494
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,940
Remember the fate of traitors.

495
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,380
Spare me, sir!

496
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,940
As long as you live,

497
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,460
no matter where you go,

498
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,420
you must stay loyal to the Lingbi Sect.

499
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,090
Go and kill Xiao Qianqing.

500
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,250
What took you so long?

501
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,810
Xiao Qianqing,

502
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,980
you're the first person who ever said you had feelings for me.

503
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,660
But you and I

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,250
belong to two different worlds.

505
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,980
One of us must die.

506
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,380
Even if I don't kill you,

507
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,290
they'll send someone else.

508
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,620
I can only buy you some time.

509
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,770
Once the Xuzhou matter is settled,

510
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,290
we'll

511
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,290
go our separate ways.

512
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,250
Fate is to blame.

513
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,220
Just pretend

514
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,940
- there was never a Zhong Lin in this world. - Mr. Song!

515
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,380
Mr. Song!

516
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,570
Mr. Song!

517
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,860
Come quickly!

518
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,980
Mr. Song is here!

519
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,050
Are you all right?

520
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,220
Divine spirit above, hear our plea.

521
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,220
We were reckless earlier

522
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,420
and offended you.

523
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,220
We beg your forgiveness.

524
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,290
Now, I, Song Lanxi, together with the people of Xuzhou,

525
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,700
humbly pray

526
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,460
for blessings and safety,

527
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,660
and for the locust plague to be dispelled soon.

528
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,290
I have received an edict from the Shrine of Great Qi.

529
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,050
Today, I lead the people in sincere prayer,

530
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,570
seeking the descent of the divine spirit

531
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,900
to deliver us from hardship.

532
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,730
Who is that?

533
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,570
The deity has manifested!

534
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,980
Bow!

535
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,440
A manifestation!

536
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,660
Oh, deity!

537
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,860
Please save us, deity!

538
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,980
Filled with compassion for all beings,

539
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,660
I traverse the mortal world.

540
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,490
Passing through this place,

541
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,050
I saw Xuzhou ravaged by disaster

542
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,730
and its people in misery.

543
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,660
In honor of your sincere prayers,

544
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,290
I bestow upon you this Immortal Dew.

545
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,330
Scatter it upon the locusts,

546
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,530
and the plague will be dispelled.

547
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,900
Thank you for your divine grace.

548
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,660
Scatter the Immortal Dew

549
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,660
to eliminate the locusts.

550
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,220
Understood.

551
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,420
We're saved by the deity's blessing!

552
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,170
Wait!

553
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,420
He's a fake!

554
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,420
Why would a deity be wearing official boots?

555
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,490
Don't let him fool you!

556
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,380
I've been waiting for you!

557
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,460
Seize him!

558
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,170
Arrest him!

559
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,690
Get them!

560
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,820
[Kill the Prince of Yuzhang]

561
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,260
Why would I feel

562
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,130
like I'm falling for you?

563
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,650
Look out!

564
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,860
I, Li Youlin,

565
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,690
together with the people of Xuzhou,

566
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,260
am here to see Mr. Song off.

567
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,740
Mr. Song traveled far to deliver grain

568
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,570
and gave his all.

569
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,050
We will never

570
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,130
forget

571
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,530
his life-saving grace!

572
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,740
Mr. Song,

573
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,380
may you rest in peace!

574
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,690
