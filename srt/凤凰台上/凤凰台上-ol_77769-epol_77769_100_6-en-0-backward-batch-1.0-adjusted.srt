00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,320
Enjoy, Your Majesty.

3
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
So

4
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,160
what did you put in the liquor?

5
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,200
You know I spiked the drink,

6
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,080
but you drank it still.

7
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,040
I thought

8
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,920
you had put some potent venom.

9
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,960
So it was just
to trigger my cold sickness.

10
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I just need you to stay
here for one more night.

11
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,560
I need the Phoenix Seal.

12
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,640
Otherwise, I can't do much in the palace.

13
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,960
My dear, you're too naive.

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,040
You think keeping me here

15
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,560
will get you the Phoenix Seal
from the Empress Dowager?

16
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,600
Father aided you for many years.

17
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,360
Empress Dowager Liu is our common enemy.

18
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,480
You want your power. I have my goal.

19
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
We can work together.

20
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,920
Even willing to look past
what happened before?

21
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,920
Yes.

22
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,880
Xiaoyue, you're back.

23
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
I don't want to talk about it.

24
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
- Madam.
- Madam.

25
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,880
What happened to His Majesty?

26
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Her Majesty
seems to have offended His Majesty.

27
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,720
Ling Cangcang.

28
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,080
Where is your respect?

29
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,600
Who said you could come in?

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,560
Get lost!

31
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,440
I am unable to ascertain

33
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
what happened in the chamber.

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,600
But His Majesty
was lashing out against Her Majesty.

35
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,800
He even hollered at Imperial Preceptor Du
who barged in thereafter.

36
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,560
It seems like Her Majesty hasn't earned

37
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,520
His Majesty's favor.

38
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
Indeed.

39
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,320
It means nothing even if
she's the daughter of Ling Xuefeng.

40
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,840
She's just a stepping stone

41
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,120
for Xiao Huan to amass more power.

42
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
Then shall we proceed with the plans

43
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,800
we have devised against her?

44
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
No need.

45
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,400
A disfavored Empress is no threat.

46
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,480
Xiao Huan doesn't love her.

47
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,360
So she isn't my enemy.

48
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
In that case,

49
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
I'm sure

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,440
she'll be too ashamed to
get the Phoenix Seal from you.

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,200
By His Majesty's decree,

52
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,800
Her Majesty's oversight has caused

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,920
the resurgence of
His Majesty's cold sickness.

54
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,560
As an act of punishment,

55
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,480
His Majesty declares that from now on,

56
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,000
Her Majesty cannot leave the inner palace.

57
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
May Her Majesty profit

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,120
from this period to reflect upon herself.

59
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,400
Father. I have bad news.

60
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,440
What is it? Why the panic?

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,960
Her Majesty has been grounded.

62
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,960
Grand Tutor Ling, did
you rush into the palace

63
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,120
for whatever reason?

64
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
I must have spoiled my daughter

65
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
that she grew flippant.

66
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,360
That's why you had to put her in place.

67
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,720
I came to apologize on her behalf.

68
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
It's not that serious, Grand Tutor Ling.

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
The Empress poisoned my drink

70
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
in an attempt to harm me.

71
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,280
But I knew that if

72
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
I punished the Empress
in accordance with the law,

73
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
ministers in the court

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,440
would think that
there was discord between us.

75
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,040
So I made a declaration

76
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
that the Empress had angered me

77
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,480
and was grounded as a result.

78
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
Are you happy

79
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,760
with such an approach?

80
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,920
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,120
You're welcome.

82
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
Alas, I am still plagued by my sickness.

83
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,240
I count on you to handle

84
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,600
the endless matters in the court.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,920
I wish to consult
your opinion on one matter.

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,560
Do tell.

87
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
The talent recommendation system

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,760
will bring a boon to our nation.

89
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,640
After several days of research
and deliberations,

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,640
I've decided

91
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,760
to agree with the suggestion
of the Ministry of Personnel.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,240
We should implement the system.

93
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,400
I am glad to see your devotion

94
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,840
to our national welfare, Grand Tutor Ling.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
LING MANOR

96
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,560
Father. You're back.

97
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,800
Fortunately, this drawing

98
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,240
can yet be saved.

99
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,600
Otherwise, I'll have
to discard and redraw it.

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,080
Father, what did your visit
to the palace yield?

101
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
What did it yield?

102
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,480
His Majesty grounded Cangcang

103
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,400
so that I'd agree to let

104
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
Song Lanxi assume office in the Capital.

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
He used Cangcang again.

106
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
For my daughter,

107
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
I'm willing to concede.

108
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,440
- But Father…
- Don't worry.

109
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,120
If I can raise a dragon,

110
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
I can tame it.

111
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,880
Once Cangcang is conceived with a child,

112
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,360
a young emperor
who died before the age of 30

113
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
won't be a threat.

114
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,320
His Majesty implements
the talent recommendation system

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,040
in order to shuffle
the current power dynamics in court.

116
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,080
That will not do me or Liu any good.

117
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,160
Even if I concede, I'm sure

118
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,200
Liu will do something about it.

119
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,800
His Majesty allows
Qing to return to the Capital?

120
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,720
Yes.

121
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Because Qing has to escort that Song back?

122
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,640
Song Lanxi.

123
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
I knew he was up to no good.

124
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,440
I disagreed with
the talent recommendation system.

125
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,560
So he wants to use Qing to deal with me.

126
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,080
Calm down, Your Majesty.
His Highness is coming back.

127
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,160
You will be freed from the pain

128
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,040
of missing your son.

129
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,160
If Qing escorted
Song Lanxi to the Capital safely,

130
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,240
Xiao Huan would be able
to implement the new policy.

131
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
It would not do us any good.

132
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,560
If they had an accident, however,

133
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,760
Qing would bear full liability.

134
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,400
Xiao Huan

135
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,040
is getting smarter and smarter.

136
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,760
What should we do then?

137
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,720
Qing is at stake. I cannot act recklessly.

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
We'll let them
return to the Capital safely.

139
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
Fortunately for us, Song Lanxi

140
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
is only slightly popular among the nobles.

141
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
He is young and inexperienced.

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,680
Using him to implement the new policy

143
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,680
will not be as easy.

144
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,720
It's late now.
Her Majesty must be asleep now.

145
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Xiaoyue who serves
the Empress works for the Dowager Empress.

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
Find a way to get rid of her.

147
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,960
I don't want any unscrupulous party

148
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,080
to be working closely with her.

149
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,760
It'll be done, Your Majesty.

150
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
Wufu.

151
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
The Empress's palace
could use some decorations.

152
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,440
Find some art pieces

153
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,040
and give them to her tomorrow.

154
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
And tell her

155
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,080
that the confinement has been lifted.

156
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,680
Noted, Your Majesty.

157
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm sure Her Majesty will
appreciate Your Majesty's gesture

158
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,920
once she received the drawings.

159
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,360
<i>Cangcang,</i>

160
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,880
<i>I used you again.</i>

161
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,200
<i>You must resent me even more now.</i>

162
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,200
- Here. Roll it.
- Okay.

163
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,720
Your Majesty.

164
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,600
Have you arranged for the candidates
to enter the Capital?

165
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

166
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,880
Shi Yan has brought the candidates to Chu.

167
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,800
Fenglai Pavilion will assist further
and Prince of Yuzhang will escort them.

168
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,320
Additionally,
Lingbi Sect is now left leaderless,

169
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
and has suffered great loss.

170
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
Their disciples are vying for power now.

171
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Ling Xuefeng will not
be able to do much for now.

172
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,000
The Lingbi Sect might have fallen apart,
but it's not gone yet.

173
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,560
Even though Ling Xuefeng
has lost his forces in the martial world,

174
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
he still has murder thralls.

175
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,120
We cannot underestimate him.

176
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,240
Right.

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
But Your Majesty,

178
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,040
you are wary of the Grand Tutor.

179
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,600
Why did you summon
Prince of Yuzhang back here?

180
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,800
Because I can profit from some infighting.

181
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,680
Your Majesty. Eunuch Feng is here.

182
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

183
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,320
You're here, Eunuch Feng.

184
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,320
His Majesty asked me

185
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,960
to bring some drawings as gifts for you.

186
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
Here.

187
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
Allow me to thank His Majesty.

188
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,240
Is he recovering from his cold sickness?

189
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,600
Worry not, Your Majesty.

190
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,440
His Majesty is doing well.
He is now discussing

191
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,320
important matters
in Wuying Hall with Grand Tutor Ling.

192
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,520
His Majesty sure is shrewd.

193
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,840
Your Majesty,

194
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,400
His Majesty misses you a lot.

195
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,600
Look.
He also asked me to come here to tell you

196
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,040
that your confinement had been lifted.

197
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,400
The drawings…

198
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,440
I understand, Eunuch Feng. You may return.

199
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,640
Okay.

200
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,880
By your leave.

201
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,880
Your Majesty. Do you want to look
at His Majesty's gifts?

202
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
No. Put them aside.

203
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,040
{\an8}SOUTHERN CHU

204
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,720
{\an8}FENGLAI PAVILION

205
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
{\an8}LIST OF CANDIDATES

206
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,400
{\an8}ZHANG YU, LIN CHUWEI

207
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,640
I only have to escort
a few people back to the Capital.

208
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Why must I enlist
Fenglai Pavilion's help too?

209
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,720
The martial world is dangerous,

210
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,520
and our enemies hide in the shadows.
We must be careful.

211
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,000
Besides, it's a precondition
for your return to the Capital.

212
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,520
Fine.

213
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,680
I cannot defy His Majesty's decree.

214
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,960
If Fenglai Pavilion is assisting me,
how many of you will be there?

215
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,320
Zhong Lin, Vice Sect Leader
of Fenglai Pavilion,

216
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,840
will be at your service.

217
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,760
I'll escort you back to the Capital.

218
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
Miss Zhong, this is not right.

219
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,760
You have been managing

220
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,320
Fenglai Pavilion, Mr. Shi.

221
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm free and could use some exercise.

222
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,200
What's wrong with that?

223
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,320
You must be Miss Zhong.

224
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,400
I haven't settled
the score of that hideous tattoo.

225
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
And here you are, surrendering yourself.

226
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
Your Highness.

227
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,400
You want a peacock tattoo.

228
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,400
That's easy.

229
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,520
Once you bring me to the Capital,

230
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,360
I'll modify your tattoo into a peacock.

231
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Bring you to the Capital?

232
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,720
Do you want to see Ling Cangcang?

233
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,840
Sorry.

234
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,800
I was born selfish.

235
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,960
Altruism is not in my nature.

236
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,440
What a shame.

237
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,240
Shi Yan.

238
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
There's only one such name list.

239
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,400
Is that right?

240
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,440
Miss Zhong. What are you doing?

241
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,360
I don't have many talents,
but I have a good memory.

242
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,840
The name, age, physical descriptions,

243
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,040
and habits

244
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,040
of the candidates on the name list

245
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,200
are all seared in my mind.

246
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,240
However,

247
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,200
if Your Highness insists on
not bringing me back to the Capital,

248
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,359
I'll miss Cangcang so much

249
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,960
and fall into depression.

250
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,720
When that happens,
I might just forget everything.

251
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,359
The powder you used just now…

252
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,560
It's phosphor.

253
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,720
And the different pouches you're carrying…

254
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,400
They contain different powders
with different effects.

255
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,119
Wow.

256
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,280
Miss Zhong, you are brave and smart.

257
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,720
You will come with us.

258
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,560
But no. Your Highness,
His Majesty asked me to come with you.

259
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,240
The entire Fenglai Pavilion
can come with me.

260
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,480
Your Highness, why did His Majesty

261
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,160
summon you back to the Capital?

262
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,040
Who knows what happened in his crazy mind?

263
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,360
But knowing him,

264
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,360
it's not a good thing.

265
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,960
But I haven't returned in many years.

266
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,480
I do miss Mother and Ying.

267
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,840
FENGLAI PAVILION

268
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,360
We'll cross the bridge when we get there.

269
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
Zhong Lin is witty and cunning.

270
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,840
Why did you pick her, Your Highness?

271
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,520
Are you dumb?

272
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,400
Shi Yan works for His Majesty.

273
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,680
Right.

274
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,160
Putting you on escort duty must be a trap.

275
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,320
If Shi Yan pulls
a trick during the journey

276
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
and the candidates are in danger,
you'll be implicated.

277
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,160
Zhong Li doesn't get
along with Shi Yan well.

278
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,600
Wise choice, Your Highness.
Ask everyone in the manor to get ready.

279
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,160
- I want to return to the Capital already.
- Are you not taking me, Your Highness?

280
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,560
For you to mess everything up?

281
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,040
Stay here to watch Shi Yan closely.

282
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,320
Your Majesty,
for once, you're in a good mood.

283
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
Did something good happen?

284
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,040
A friend outside of
the palace wrote to me,

285
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,400
saying that she'd be in the Capital soon.

286
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,760
Speaking of which,
we haven't met for a while. I miss her.

287
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,000
How wonderful.

288
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,680
I'm happy for you, Your Majesty.

289
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,040
<i>The Begonia Pendant lit up.</i>

290
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,840
PRISTINE INTEGRITY

291
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,000
What is this place?

292
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,760
Your Majesty,

293
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,080
this is the cold palace
where Princess Ying resides.

294
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
A cold palace?

295
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,040
How come I've never heard of this place?

296
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,000
And who is Princess Ying?

297
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,640
It's only normal
that you did not know, Your Majesty.

298
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,440
Princess Ying is
a taboo subject in the palace.

299
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
No one brings her up.

300
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,720
Tell me more.

301
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,800
Tell me. We are alone here.

302
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,560
Well,

303
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,840
Princess Ying is
the Empress Dowager's adoptive daughter.

304
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,000
Her birth mother passed away early.

305
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Prince of Yuzhang
brought her back to Xuanguang Hall.

306
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,880
When she was little,
she was close to His Majesty.

307
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,640
But then, there was
an inferno all of a sudden

308
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,640
and she almost lost her life there.

309
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,280
Princess Ying suffered a great shock.

310
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,880
She became addled upon being rescued.

311
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,160
They had no choice

312
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,560
but to put her here.

313
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,120
An inferno all of a sudden?

314
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,480
Why would the Empress Dowager
let her only daughter

315
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,080
stay in such a forsaken place?

316
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,120
Actually,

317
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,080
that is Princess Ying's own decision.

318
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,720
After she survived the inferno,

319
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
she became afraid of her own palace.

320
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,040
But wherever she relocated to,

321
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,400
she would run out in distress.

322
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,720
She only manages to calm herself down

323
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,360
in the cold palace.

324
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,080
The Empress Dowager had no other choice.

325
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,960
Let's go.

326
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
<i>The Begonia Pendant never lights up,</i>

327
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,400
<i>but it reacts to the cold palace.</i>

328
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,400
<i>How odd.</i>

329
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,040
Do not touch my belongings!

330
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,160
XIAO YING, PRINCESS OF GREAT QI

331
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,760
I do not like you.

332
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,920
Go away.

333
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,040
You don't know me.

334
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
Why do you not like me?

335
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,800
I know who you are.

336
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,120
His Majesty got married the other day.

337
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,560
No one invited me,

338
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,600
but I snuck out to watch the ceremony.

339
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,520
I hate you.

340
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,800
I hate anyone who has ties with Xiao Huan.

341
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,080
Then you should like me.

342
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,960
Because I hate Xiao Huan too.

343
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,760
Why did you marry him then?

344
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,400
I had no choice.

345
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,160
You are able-bodied.

346
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,080
What do you mean you had no choice?

347
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,520
I came to ask you something.

348
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,440
Maybe you could help me.

349
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,760
Do you recognize this Begonia Pendant?

350
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,480
If you kill Xiao Huan for me,

351
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,160
I'll tell you everything.

352
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,120
What?

353
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
You don't want him killed?

354
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,680
Then you don't hate him for real.

355
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,240
Go away.

356
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,440
I want him killed.

357
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,720
But he is the Emperor.
No one can kill him easily.

358
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,560
I can.

359
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,440
What? Are you scared now?

360
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,840
If you are scared, you can still run.

361
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,480
Otherwise, I might kill you too.

362
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,160
You only chase me out because you can't

363
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
answer my question.

364
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,840
You don't know what it is at all.

365
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
And you don't know why it lit up.

366
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,720
- I do!
- Then tell me.

367
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,960
Azure firefly.

368
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,000
You know many things.

369
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,960
Yes. This is an azure firefly as
recorded in the Tome of All Venom

370
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,640
It grew up ingesting
the poisonous powder I made.

371
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
It is afraid of my pendant.

372
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,120
Amazing.

373
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
It scares my firefly.

374
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,360
Your pendant

375
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,280
must have contained Wanwei Herb,

376
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,520
a precious herb

377
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,720
that will light up to expel
all venomous creatures near it.

378
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,880
With it,

379
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,600
no venomous bugs can hurt you.

380
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,440
<i>Why would Master</i>
<i>give me a special artifact</i>

381
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
<i>as an ordinary accessory?</i>

382
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,160
Where did you get this amazing artifact?

383
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
My master gave it to me.

384
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,040
Your master is so sweet.

385
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,440
He was very kind to me.

386
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,880
But

387
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,480
he was killed.

388
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,600
By Xiao Huan?

389
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,880
That's why you hate him.

390
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
Yes.

391
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,960
I have a limitless supply of poisons.

392
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,200
I can help you kill him.

393
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,080
Your Majesty,
Her Majesty went to the cold palace.

394
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,240
Cold palace?

395
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,280
What for?

396
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,640
Princess Ying said
she wanted to help her kill you.

397
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,240
Your Majesty,

398
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,200
allow me to bring her back.

399
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,360
No need.

400
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,040
Your Majesty,
I am worried about Her Majesty.

401
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,520
Princess Ying might hurt her.

402
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,480
She won't.

403
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,560
They have a common enemy.

404
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,320
Xiao Ying wants to use her to kill me.
She won't hurt her.

405
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,520
Worry not, Your Majesty.
Her Majesty did not agree to her request.

406
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,280
LINGHE HALL

407
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
Stop drinking, Your Majesty.
It's bad for your health.

408
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,960
No,

409
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,920
it's bad if I don't drink it.

410
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,920
You're drunk, Your Majesty.
You should stop drinking.

411
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
Drunk?

412
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,080
I'm not drunk.

413
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,480
You don't believe me?

414
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,920
Come.

415
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Let's have an arm wrestle.

416
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,880
Zhong Lin and I played it a lot.

417
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,440
And she never won.

418
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,360
- Come.
- Your Majesty, you're teasing me again.

419
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,640
You're a heroine.

420
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,440
I can't win even if you're drunk.

421
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,520
Heroine?

422
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,080
I'm not a heroine.

423
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm just

424
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,320
a caged canary bird.

425
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,160
Drink up!

426
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,960
Be careful, Your Majesty.

427
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,360
You soaked the drawings.

428
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,760
Your Majesty, I didn't
expect to see this side of you.

429
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,080
You're so cool

430
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,400
and free-spirited.

431
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,560
I'm sure the author of this drawing

432
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,240
must be very close to you.

433
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,360
Why do you say so?

434
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,320
Because Your Majesty
smiles so brightly in the drawing.

435
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,600
I've never seen you like this.

436
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,200
His Majesty has arrived.

437
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,880
Why did you come here?

438
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,280
To apologize.

439
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,360
Apologize?

440
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,720
I spiked your drink.

441
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
You committed no fault.

442
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,440
If that's the case,

443
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,600
would you want to drink with me?

444
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,280
What if I poisoned you again?

445
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,040
It doesn't matter.

446
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,240
Come.

447
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,800
Drink up.

448
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,440
Do you remember

449
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,880
the first time we climbed to the roof?

450
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,880
The audacity of you to bring it up.

451
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,960
I bet

452
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,080
I've always been the bargaining chip

453
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,640
for you to fight against my father.

454
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,680
Tell me now.

455
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,480
What is your agenda this time?

456
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Whatever justification

457
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,520
I bring up will be useless.

458
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,760
Exactly.

459
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,200
I don't believe

460
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,760
in any word you say.

461
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
What about the Phoenix Seal?

462
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
Do you still want it?

463
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,960
What?

464
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,400
Are you helping me?

465
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,520
Or lying to me?

466
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,120
Lying to me again.

467
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,560
Come.

468
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,480
Drink up.

469
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
Look. Our relationship

470
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,400
is just

471
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,760
like this cup.

472
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,080
It's broken.

473
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,520
It's broken.

474
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,880
No.

475
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,320
Our relationship

476
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
is just a pipe dream of mine.

477
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,320
Cangcang. You're drunk.

478
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,600
No, I'm not.

479
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,680
I just

480
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,440
don't get it.

481
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,320
Why did you kill my master?

482
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,040
I don't get it.

483
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,080
Did you approach me

484
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:10,040
just to kill my master?

485
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,080
Cangcang.

486
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,120
I'm serious about you.

487
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,760
And your serious commitment

488
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,440
can kill.

489
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,560
Drink up!

490
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,760
Are you happy?

491
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Let's find our new ally.

492
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,080
No wonder you won't kill Xiao Huan.

493
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,280
He

494
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,440
likes you.

495
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,680
Come in, mister.

496
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,280
I'm coming!

497
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Come inside.

498
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,600
How may I help, sir?

499
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,440
It's summer now.

500
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
You must have fresh pufferfish.

501
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,560
We are a group of 30-something travelers.

502
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,160
One braised pufferfish
with rushes for everyone, please.

503
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,800
Sir,

504
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
we do have pufferfish.

505
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,200
But unfortunately, we don't have a chef

506
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,240
who can cook pufferfish here.

507
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,720
Gold?

508
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,680
You shall have fresh pufferfish tonight!

509
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,120
You will be served our best Sangluo Wine

510
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,000
as well.

511
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,640
Come. Follow me.

512
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,160
Let's go.

513
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Xiao Qianqing made
a huge deal out of his escort duty

514
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,520
with regards to the candidates.

515
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,320
Everyone knows about it.

516
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
I found

517
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,800
this new blade for you.

518
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,800
It's light and gentle.

519
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,640
You have trouble using a blade
due to your missing right index finger.

520
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,360
This blade will suit you well.

521
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,000
Thank you, Father.

522
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,200
Xiao Qianqing.

523
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,960
They call him the Peacock Prince.

524
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,640
He isn't as superficial as he seems.

525
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
He's returning to the Capital in grandeur

526
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,160
because he wants to meddle
in the implementation of the new system.

527
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,320
We cannot give him
the opportunity to do this.

528
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,320
You must

529
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,080
eliminate Song Lanxi and the rest.

530
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,800
Kill everyone you think is your target.

531
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,800
I know you are rich,

532
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,160
but it's better to lie low

533
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,560
when you're escorting
someone to the Capital.

534
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,080
A humble peacock

535
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,000
is no different from a fowl.

536
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,400
If someone has ill intentions,

537
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,440
being discreet will not make a difference.

538
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,760
You're so gullible.

539
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,720
An unfallen mulberry leaf

540
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,720
is endowed with plump leaves.

541
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,000
A fallen mulberry leaf

542
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,120
is crisp and mellow.

543
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,920
The Sangluo Wine
mustn't be savored like this.

544
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,240
Servants!

545
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,520
- Sir.
- Bring my ice here.

546
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,440
Sure.

547
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,040
You are a heroine, yes.

548
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,680
But rolling your eyes

549
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,960
is an indecent thing to do.

550
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,840
I will attend to other officials.
Enjoy your meal.

551
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,880
I have a question.

552
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,960
Song Lanxi is just a new, lowly candidate.

553
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,880
Why must we kill him?

554
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Who Song Lanxi is doesn't matter.

555
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
What matters

556
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,560
is his tutor, Li Chengtian.

557
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,680
He was my rival
in the court for many years,

558
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,600
and gave me many headaches.

559
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,600
While he retired many years ago,

560
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,080
his influence runs deep

561
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,400
and can still be felt.

562
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,720
The moral ones
in the court view him as a leader.

563
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,600
I understand now.

564
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,280
If Xiao Huan uses Song Lanxi to entice

565
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,280
Li Chengtian into coming back,

566
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,480
that will be a threat to us.

567
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,440
Song Lanxi

568
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,840
is Li Chengtian's student
after he went into retirement.

569
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
Not many know that.

570
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,960
Even I only found out recently.

571
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,520
Again, His Majesty

572
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,040
is one step ahead of me.

573
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,640
It's my fault.

574
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,480
We have lost our head start.

575
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,600
You cannot make any mistakes now.

576
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,000
And make sure to leave no traces behind
that reveal who you are.

577
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,400
Yes, Father.

578
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,320
I will not let you down.

579
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,360
Your Majesty, please put it on.

580
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,600
It's okay. I'm not cold.

581
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,880
Your Majesty, it's late and misty now.

582
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,080
Even if you're not cold,
you must make sure you won't catch a cold.

583
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,520
I'm fine.

584
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,120
This is…

585
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,160
Someone wants to see me.

586
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,160
They worked together flawlessly

587
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,920
and killed them in one slash.

588
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
They left none alive.

589
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,400
What a professional group of assassins.

590
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,200
It's good that you found criminals
on the death row to impersonate them.

591
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,320
Do you understand why
I maintain a high profile now?

592
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,160
Yes.

593
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,360
It's just a small trick.

594
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,680
What small trick?

595
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,760
I am brave and wise.

596
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,280
My tactics are unrivaled.

597
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,120
We still have to exercise caution.

598
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,080
The Capital is far.

599
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,640
We might run into another incident.

600
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,560
I must live till I get to the Capital
and find Cangcang.

601
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,600
Don't worry. You can count on me.

602
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,520
Bad news!

603
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,560
Bad news!

604
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,600
Your Highness. Official Song…

605
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,840
- What happened?
- For some reason, Official Song

606
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,160
left on his own.

607
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
When I found him,

608
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,680
he was barely alive.

609
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,600
He will die soon.

610
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,920
We did everything we could,
but it was still not enough.

611
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,640
What do we do now?

612
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,920
Official Song is a priority.

613
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,200
<i>If something happens to him,</i>

614
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,800
<i>Xiao Huan will say</i>
<i>that I failed in my duty to escort him.</i>

615
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,520
<i>I cannot let this happen.</i>

616
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,720
<i>Let me think of a solution.</i>
