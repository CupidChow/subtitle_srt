there were days so bitter I could hardly breathe,

Indeed.

My fault

188
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,180
lies in overstepping,

189
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,300

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,250
it was my narrow-mindedness.

You overstate it.

Even this year's locust plague is tied to the flooding.

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,730
You still dare ask?

348
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,490
You shared my bed, and now you start avoiding me.

349
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,010
If I hadn't come looking for you,

350
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,450
would you really never have come to me, even till death?

351
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,490
What nonsense is that?

352
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,410
Who shared a bed with you?

353
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,620
I was drunk.

354
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,900
I remember nothing.

355
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,930
Fine.

356
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,410
So now you pretend ignorance, do you?

357
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,340
Stand still.

358
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,140
This is abandoning me after leading me astray.

359
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,420
There was never a beginning. How could I abandon anything?

360
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,090
Never a beginning?

361
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,620
Then all that happened between us...

362
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,290
none

363
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,980
of it counts?

364
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,780
Zhong Lin.

365
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,380
Zhong Lin,

366
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,340
help me.

367
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,180
It hurts.

368
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,840
Stop acting.

369
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,380
I will not fall for it.

370
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,730
It truly hurts.

371
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,050
What is it?

372
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,530
What is it?

373
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,810
It bit me.

374
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,090
This is bad. You have been bitten by a venomous scorpion.

375
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,460
It is the Nanyi venom-scorpion.

376
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,010
Fortunately, its venom is not fatal.

377
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,490
But its venom will cause hallucinations.

378
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,290
- Hallucinations? - Enough.

379
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,530
I will take you to sit up ahead.

380
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,180
Come.

381
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,330
Zhong Lin...

382
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,220
Zhong Lin.

383
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,140
Zhong Lin,

384
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,660
I like you.

385
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,460
I...

386
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,530
I want to marry you.

387
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,620
So fast.

388
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,490
This venom truly works well.

389
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,770
Tell me,

390
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,700
do you like me too?

391
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,490
Do you?

392
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,940
- Do you? - Yes.

393
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,220
- Do you? - Yes.

394
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,010
Yes.

395
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,660
I knew you liked me too.

396
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,380
You would never abandon me.

397
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,180
Right.

398
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,940
I will not abandon you.

399
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,180
And then?

400
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,530
That is all.

401
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,570
You are unharmed.

402
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,980
I...

403
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,050
I was never bitten at all.

404
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,220
You...

405
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,620
But everything I said just now was true.

406
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,140
Are you mad?

407
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,330
Zhong Lin,

408
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,120
I am not mad.

409
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,560
I like you. I wish to marry you.

410
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,730
You admitted it just now.

411
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,810
You like me too.

412
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,220
You cannot deny it.

413
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,090
Do you know what kind of person I am?

414
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,570
Of course I know.

415
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,700
You saw it.

416
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,900
I have survived

417
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,900
only by these crooked tricks.

418
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,420
Because I am of the Lingbi Sect.

419
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,420
So, Your Highness,

420
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,330
please do not make such senseless jokes again.

421
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,620
I do not like it.

422
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,620
I was not jesting.

423
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,770
I was sincere.

424
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,460
You have already feigned death

425
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,900
and escaped the Lingbi Sect.

426
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,620
You are now under my protection.

427
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,900
It is useless.

428
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,660
From the day I joined the Lingbi Sect,

429
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,290
I was afflicted with Heartbane.

430
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,720
This poison has fused with my blood.

431
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,620
As long as the Heartbane Bell rings,

432
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,380
the poison will erupt.

433
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,640
I have tried hundreds

434
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,090
of antidotes.

435
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,890
But this poison has no cure at all.

436
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,290
So, Xiao Qianqing,

437
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,010
I will live my entire life in fear.

438
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,660
Startled at the slightest sound,

439
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,700
haunted by shadows,

440
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,140
even the sound of a copper bell terrifies me,

441
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,620
for fear the Heartbane may erupt.

442
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,860
This is the kind of person I am.

443
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,980
Someone like me,

444
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,730
would you still marry?

445
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,760
Do you truly feel nothing

446
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,600
for Princess Ying?

447
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,090
I am terrified.

448
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,280
I would never be presumptuous.

449
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,440
Set aside your terror.

450
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,660
Set aside her rank as Princess.

451
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,670
You,

452
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,720
Li Hongqing,

453
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,900
toward Xiao Ying,

454
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,050
do you truly feel not even the slightest affection?

455
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,730
It seems even you are not entirely certain.

456
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,010
My sister

457
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,140
has a willful temper.

458
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,290
She loves and hates with extremity.

459
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,220
If you are uncertain,

460
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,980
you must not provoke her.

461
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,940
But if you are certain,

462
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,700
I have no objection.

463
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,220
I understand.

464
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,810
For now,

465
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,860
I will not see Princess Ying.

466
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,810
Not until I am certain of myself.

467
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,730
Good.

468
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,080
Mother,

469
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,700
I wish to marry Zhong Lin.

470
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,860
I hope Mother will grant her blessing.

471
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,220
On ordinary days you may fool around all you like,

472
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,380
but you must never marry Zhong Lin.

473
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,290
What if I insist?

474
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,860
Release me.

475
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,900
The Empress Dowager has heard that Miss Zhong excels in calligraphy.

476
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,180
She has summoned you into the palace

477
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,090
to witness your skill.

478
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,940
Summoning me into the palace?

479
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,770
It is clearly a scheme.

480
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,570
My thanks for Her Majesty's favor.

481
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,570
However,

482
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,010
I was brought here too hastily.

483
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,010
I did not bring my beloved Sanhua Purple-Haired Brush.

484
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,900
I shall return to retrieve it.

485
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,380
Sanhua Purple-Haired?

486
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,140
There is one here as well.

487
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,050
I have another quirk.

488
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,660
Before I put brush to paper,

489
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,530
I must drink two cups of the Sangluo Wine I brew myself.

490
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,010
Unless Miss Zhong finishes copying these scriptures,

491
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,530
this servant cannot allow you to leave.

492
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,330
Good aunt,

493
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,620
if the Prince of Yuzhang learns that I have gone missing,

494
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,620
he will certainly come seeking me.

495
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,220
Can you bear the consequence?

496
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,380
The Prince of Yuzhang

497
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,220
is taking supper with the Empress Dowager.

498
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,490
He may remain in the palace tonight.

499
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,700
I fear

500
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,940
he will not be thinking of you.

501
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,330
Please proceed.

502
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,820
[Writing]

503
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,140
Such petty tricks,

504
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,980
and you think you can deal with me?

505
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,810
Your Majesty.

506
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,180
Your Majesty,

507
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,250
please spare me.

508
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,620
It was this woman.

509
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,730
She seduced me!

510
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,620
She is mine.

511
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,140
You dare touch her?

512
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,010
Qing,

513
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,770
this vile woman

514
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,460
conducted indecent acts

515
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,860
in my own chambers,

516
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,220
yet you defend her?

517
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,180
Mother,

518
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,090
these palace ploys...

519
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,140
Are you certain you wish to use them

520
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,050

[Wuying Hall]

522
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,530
I seek to marry Zhong Lin

523
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,610
and beg Your Majesty to grant the marriage.

524

[Pure and Spotless]

525
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,490
Xiao Qianqing,

526
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,860
have you gone mad?

527
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,980
A woman of unknown origin,

528
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,010
with her virtue

529
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,170
in doubt.

530
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,820
You would make her your princess?

531
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,490
Mother speaks ill of Zhong Lin,

532
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,780
yet do you know

533
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,210
that in the many times I was trapped,

534
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,900
my life hanging by a thread,

535
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,130
it was she who risked everything

536
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,570
again and again to save me.

537
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,490
There are countless fine women in this world,

538
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,170
but in my heart,

539
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,740
none compare to Zhong Lin's courage and loyalty.

540
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,050
Her devotion runs true.

541
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,490
In this lifetime,

542
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,980
I will marry no one but her.

543
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,490
I will never allow you to wed

544
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,130
a lowborn girl of the martial world.

545
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,610
Especially one

546
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,900
versed in crooked and unorthodox ways.

547
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,570
She is not a maiden of proper lineage.

548
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,530
Put this thought out of your mind.

549
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,210
The Empress Dowager speaks truly.

550
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,210
According to the rites of Great Qi,

551
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,980
Zhong Lin's status

552
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,130
indeed forbids her from becoming Princess of Yuzhang.

553
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,780
But Zhong Lin's heart is upright,

554
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,360
and she journeyed a thousand li to resolve Xuzhou's plight.

555
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,380
She also retrieved Frost Blossom with the Prince of Yuzhang,

556
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,340
which counts as service in protecting the throne.

557
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,610
She deserves a reward.

558
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,690
Therefore,

559
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,650
today I decree

560
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,490
that Zhong Lin be granted the title Princess of Ding'an,

561
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,010
and this shall be proclaimed to all.

562

Zhong Lin,

563
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,170
from this day on,

His Majesty and I are your family.

causing you grievance,

567
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,530
we shall uphold justice for you.

are you willing to marry the Prince of Yuzhang?

There is something I have long wanted to ask you.

636
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,490
Why do you treat Ling Cangcang

differently from others?

638
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,940
Perhaps because

639
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,610
from childhood until now,

640
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,090
she was the only one who ever wished to protect me.

641

Where are you taking me?

Today is your birthday.

643
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,490
I prepared a surprise for you.

644
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,130
Is it beautiful?

They say a mountain spirit dwells within this wishing tree.

646

As long as you make a wish,

647
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,740
it will come true.

648
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,490
Zhong Lin,

649
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,610
hurry and make a wish.

650
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,650
I know I was wrong.

651
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,090
Do not hit me.

652

Forgive me, Zhong Lin.

No, Cangcang.

657
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,610
I should be the one thanking you.

658
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,980
Cangcang.

659
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,490
I want to make a wish.

660
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,210
All right.

661
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,090
What is it?

662
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,340
I want to be your friend for life,

663
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,780
to treat each other sincerely,

never to part.

665
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,900
It is a promise.

666
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,980
Then today let us swear sisterhood.

667
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,170
Let this tree bear witness.

668
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,570
Very well.

669
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,340
Let the wishing tree bear witness.

670
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,170
Today,

671
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,900
- Ling Cangcang, - Zhong Lin,

672
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,490
form a bond of sisterhood.

673
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,170
From this day on,

674
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,260
we shall share blessings and hardships alike,

675
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,090
travel the ends of the earth together,

676
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,780
and never betray each other.

677
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,570
From then on,

678
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,380
we became sworn sisters,

679
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,690
inseparable ever since.

680
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,940
So she cut down all those bells for you,

681
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,900
without question.

682
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,900
Touched, aren't you?

683
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,050
I understand.

685
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,130
Commander Li.

686
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,820
I saw the dark circles under your eyes lately

687
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,940
and worried you were not sleeping well.

688
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,940
So I made this calming sachet for you.

689
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,380
It is a small token of my regard.

690
