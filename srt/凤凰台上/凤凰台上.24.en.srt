00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,740
What's going on with them?

174
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,380
I'm apologizing to them.

175
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,500
They're all happily forgiving me.

176
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,690
They're happy?

177
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,170
- Happy! - Happy!

178
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,740
- So happy! - So happy!

179
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,500
See?

180
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,260
They're really happy.

181
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,380
The sky's clear now.

182
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,900
Qianqing,

183
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,340
come sit in the sun with me!

184
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,260
Come on.

185
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,740
Qianqing,

186
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,140
what is filial piety?

187
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,340
Is it just

188
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,450
doing what you're told,

189
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,380
and being there at the very end?

190
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,570
More or less.

191
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,050
Qianqing,

192
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,810
I'll definitely be there for you in the end.

193
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,260
I won't try to kill His Majesty anymore.

194
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,650
Brother Hongqing said

195
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,650
when Luling Palace was on fire,

196
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,980
His Majesty was still very young

197
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,340
and in poor health,

198
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,740
so it wasn't on purpose that he didn't save me.

199
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,620
So I can't blame him.

200
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,500
Well, well.

201
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,690
So now you've got a Brother Hongqing besides me.

202
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,690
Qianqing...

203
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,220
let me tell you a secret.

204
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,810
Go on.

205
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,020
Yesterday,

206
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,570
he took me out to have fun.

207
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,770
He told me lots of things.

208
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,340
He said

209
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,380
he kind of likes me.

210
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,980
If I can be a bit more proper,

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,570
he'll like me even more.

212
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,020
So I stayed up all night memorizing two books.

213
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,410
I'll recite them for you, okay?

214
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,340
Okay.

215
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,500
"A gentleman does not seek fullness in food

216
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,290
or comfort in living.

217
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,140
He is diligent in action, cautious in speech,

218
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,220
and learns from the virtuous to correct himself.

219
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,170
This is...

220
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,620
what it means to love learning."

221
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,170
What you memorized overnight

222
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,620
is the Analects of Confucius.

223
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,690
And you...

224
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,810
Don't interrupt me,

225
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,020
or I'll forget it!

226
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,980
All right.

227
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,100
"A gentleman can shoulder great responsibilities..."

228
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,770
Later,

229
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,450
when Hongqing comes,

230
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,450
remember to wake me up.

231
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,620
Don't worry.

232
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,340
I promise.

233
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,740
You have grown up

234
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,810
and finally found your own happiness.

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,650
I'm happy for you.

236
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,930
That's wonderful.

237
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,770
Qianqing...

238
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,380
I'll be there for you in the end.

239
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,980
All right.

240
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,220
I'll be waiting

241
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,100
for you to see me off.

242
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,740
Court's off today and the weather's good.

243
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,570
It's nice to come out for some fresh air.

244
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,020
What a shame this outfit isn't good for archery.

245
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,170
Or we'd show those two up in archery.

246
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,380
Your Majesty,

247
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,220
let's settle it at the range today.

248
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,340
If you lose, don't be a sore loser.

249
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,770
You still talk too much.

250
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,570
This is so sour.

251
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,810
How can you eat this?

252
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,260
I don't think so.

253
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,340
It's really refreshing.

254
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,260
Tastes great.

255
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,810
You're flirting right in front of us?

256
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,620
Which of them

257
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,380
do you think will win?

258
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,620
I bet

259
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,580
His Majesty will win!

260
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,620
Good!

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,730
That one doesn't count!

262
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,820
I just slipped up.

263
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,650
This round doesn't count.

264
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,140
You're still just like before,

265
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,900
can't stand losing.

266
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,250
Who's a sore loser?

267
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,690
You only won once.

268
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,140
If you've got guts, let's go again.

269
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,320
Maybe I'll go easy on you

270
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,140
and let you win one.

271
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,740
I don't need that.

272
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,990
Congratulations on your victory.

273
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,450
Your Majesty is truly impressive.

274
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,500
Feng Wufu!

275
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,060
You're such a suck-up!

276
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,340
Your Highness, he just outmatches you.

277
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,450
Don't take it out on me, please.

278
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,490
This dagger cuts iron like it's nothing,

279
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,250
a rare treasure in this world.

280
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,170
Thank you.

281
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,650
What are you grinning at?

282
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,490
Sit down.

283
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,390
They're being all lovey-dovey.

284
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,370
What's so great about watching them?

285
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,460
You're only allowed to look at me.

286
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,340
All right.

287
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,650
I'll only look at you.

288
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,780
Your Highness is the cutest man in the world,

289
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,300
the most handsome,

290
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,340
and the most fun.

291
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,650
You're the only one in my heart and in my eyes.

292
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,410
Satisfied now?

293
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,620
Your Majesty really hides your talents well.

294
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,930
You roast meat

295
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,580
as well as any master cook in the martial world.

296
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,250
That's because when he was little,

297
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,450
he went through too much hardship.

298
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,490
It's all in the past.

299
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,690
No need to bring it up.

300
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,820
Here.

301
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,580
Smells amazing!

302
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,490
Zhong Lin, have a taste.

303
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,580
Delicious!

304
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,650
So good!

305
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,650
My grilled fish is just as carefully made.

306
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,300
Don't play favorites, okay?

307
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,410
Zhong Lin, here.

308
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,410
Have a taste.

309
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,620
Cangcang,

310
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,490
after you.

311
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,450
What's wrong, Cangcang?

312
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,860
Nothing.

313
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,730
Maybe today's fish...

314
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,170
is a bit fishy.

315
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,010
Let me smell.

316
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,970
It doesn't smell fishy.

317
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,860
You usually love fish the most.

318
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,410
Why the change in taste today?

319
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,580
No way.

320
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,620
The fish I grilled could never be fishy.

321
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,580
I told you, I'm fine.

322
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,860
Don't get so worked up.

323
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,450
You couple

324
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,340
should really let me worry less!

325
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,490
Physician Li,

326
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,730
is there something wrong with her health?

327
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,340
Your Majesty...

328
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,340
you'd better

329
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,730
get ready.

330
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,690
Get ready?

331
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,340
Get ready for what?

332
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,250
Her Majesty is carrying your child!

333
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,490
Get ready to be a father.

334
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,550
So you mean

335
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,490
she is pregnant?

336
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,340
- Congratulations, Your Majesty! - Congratulations, Your Majesty.

337
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,280
- Congratulations, Her Majesty! - Congratulations, Her Majesty.

338
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,380
Although in the past,

339
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,740
Her Majesty's health took some damage,

340
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,950
thankfully her constitution is still very strong,

341
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,300
and

342
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,450
so is yours.

343
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,100
In a moment,

344
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,380
I'll prescribe some medicine to protect the baby.

345
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,540
You must take it regularly
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

346
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,900
and must not overwork yourself again.

347
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,690
You two really are trying

348
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,300
to smash my good reputation,

349
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,140
aren't you?

350
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,170
Physician Li,

351
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,100
for these next ten months,

352
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,730
I hope you can stay here in the Capital.

353
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,930
You brat,

354
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,210
now you want to chain me here?

355
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,450
Fine.

356
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,410
From now on, your married life

357
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,100
is my responsibility.

358
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,860
What are you all standing around for?

359
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,060
Get out!

360
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,650
Thank you, Physician Li.

361
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,780
Cangcang,

362
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,930
thank you.

363
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,900
I heard you went to Wuying Hall.

364
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,210
Did His Majesty make things hard for you?

365
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,010
No.

366
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,490
I showed him most of my sincerity.

367
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,540
Even with all the resentment in his heart,

368
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,780
we've helped each other after all.

369
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,860
I figured he'd remember that bond

370
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,160
and show me some mercy.

371
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,970
Even if there's trust,

372
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,140
it's not like before.

373
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,490
It doesn't have to be!

374
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,380
In his eyes,

375
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,650
I never mattered much.

376
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,100
That's true.

377
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,380
I know you really

378
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,930
have my best interests at heart.

379
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,860
Madam,

380
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,170
you don't have to force yourself.

381
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,210
I know you're unhappy today.

382
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,900
Why would I be unhappy?

383
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,730
His Majesty...

384
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,410
finally has an heir.

385
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,490
We should be happy for him!

386
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,210
We should be celebrating!

387
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,490
I just don't understand

388
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,300
how the Xiao family can live so happily

389
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,140
after ruining my mother!

390
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,730
It's not fair!

391
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,110
Do you like children?

392
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,410
Or only the one

393
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,490
she'll give you?

394
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,100
[Linghe Hall]

395
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,540
Your Majesty,

396
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,820
forgive me for the offense.

397
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,900
Search the place!

398
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,580
Cangcang,

399
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,650
can you explain what all this is?

400
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,820
Why can't you keep the promises

401
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,690
you made to me?

402
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,580
I was just reading them.

403
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,650
I didn't mean anything else.

404
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,060
Besides,

405
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,820
those street tales,

406
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,540
sometimes,

407
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,820
they're...

408
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,650
not as thrilling as ghost stories.

409
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,860
Isn't martial arts enough?

410
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,620
No.

411
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,930
Not exciting enough.

412
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,730
Don't be mad.

413
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,650
Mr. Bai.

414
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,490
Dear Bai.

415
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,380
Mr. Bai.

416
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,170
Dear Bai.

417
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,410
That won't work on me.

418
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,690
No, really...

419
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,410
they're actually quite good.

420
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,490
Let me show you.

421
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,780
Just read this one.

422
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,450
It's the story of Swallow Eight.

423
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,210
She can catch demons,

424
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,860
but she's actually a demon herself.

425
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,060
Later she's killed for drinking too much,

426
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,820
then she turns into a woman

427
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,060
and falls for the man who killed her.

428
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,420
And this one.

429
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,170
It's really good too.

430
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,450
Let me show you.

431
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,250
This one

432
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,970
[Qiaozhong Monster]
is about a male ghost.

433
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,210
He always puts a robe

434
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,580
over the woman he loves

435
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,620
after she falls asleep.

436
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,450
It's actually a very heartwarming story.

437
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,450
Really!

438
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,410
If you don't believe me,

439
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,690
you can ask Eunuch Feng.

440
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,930
Right?

441
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,650
Yes...

442
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,060
Ever since Her Majesty

443
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,900
first told me that story,

444
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,340
I've been full of energy when helping you

445
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,540
with memorials,

446
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,900
not sleepy at all.

447
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,170
And there

448
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,970
are even more stories like that.

449
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,900
All right, Cangcang.

450
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,060
Earlier,

451
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,650
I've specially looked up some classics.

452
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,300
The mother of King Wen of Zhou

453
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,380
never looked at anything improper

454
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,930
or listened to anything unpleasant

455
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,100
when she was pregnant.

456
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,100
That's what they call prenatal education.

457
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,970
Prenatal education?

458
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,650
So...

459
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,410
So,

460
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,250
I've specially picked out this book,

461
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,250
Tales of Rivers and Mountains,

462
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,410
full of travel notes and insights.

463
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,100
You can read it properly.

464
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,540
Come on, sit back down.

465
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,820
Wufu.

466
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,210
Here.

467
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,930
So many words,

468
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,970
packed so tightly.

469
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,710
[Tales of Rivers and Mountains]

470
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,580
How am I supposed to get through this?

471
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,620
It's all right.

472
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,060
I can

473
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,730
read it to you slowly.

474
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,410
Once we're done,

475
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,450
you have to eat properly.

476
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,340
What would you like to eat?

477
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,410
I...

478
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,140
Five-spice crispy fish.

479
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,690
No.

480
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,410
Smells fishy.

481
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,380
Next.

482
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,340
Crystal mutton jelly.

483
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,170
Next.

484
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,780
Stuffed eight-treasure duck.

485
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,340
You don't even want that?

486
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,450
No.

487
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,490
I'm not hungry.

488
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,410
Maybe...

489
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,300
just don't serve anything.

490
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,340
Since she has no appetite,

491
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,300
take it all away.

492
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,250
Out of the palace,

493
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,930
I ran around so many restaurants for you.

494
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,140
My legs nearly broke.

495
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,060
And she doesn't even want a single dish!

496
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,540
My reputation's already taken a hit,

497
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,140
and you clear everything away

498
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,210
and won't even let me eat?

499
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,340
She can't handle

500
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,860
anything greasy.

501
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,820
Take it all away.

502
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,900
What a waste.

503
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,540
Pack it all up and take it to my manor.

504
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,300
I'll share it with Zhong Lin.

505
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,140
Okay.

506
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,970
What are you thinking about?

507
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,250

Yes.

514

should have been here by my side,

515

but now...

516
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,140

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,730
Xiao Qianqing,

520
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,970
and the child we'll have in the future.

521
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,820
If you miss your father,

522
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,300
you can visit him.

523
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,100
If he knows

524
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,210
we are having a child,

525
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,060
what will he think?

526
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,540
[Deer Courtyard]

527
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,150
When you break through the earth,

528
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,180
it will be time for great deeds.

529
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,300
[Linghe Hall]

530
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,130
Your Majesty.

531
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,220
His Majesty had the kitchens

532
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,340
prepare this bird's nest soup.

533
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,260
He told me

534
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,820
to make sure you taste it.

535
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,180
Eunuch Feng?

536
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,220
Peace to Your Majesty.

537
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,660
What brings you here?

538
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,860
Where is His Majesty?

539
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,180
Your Majesty,

540
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,490
His Majesty is busy in Wuying Hall.

541
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,530
He sent me

542
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,300
to change out Your Majesty's incense.

543
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,380
Change the incense?

544
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,050
The one I have is perfectly fine.

545
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,220
Why change it?

546
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,860
His Majesty said

547
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,380
the old incense was for clearing the head

548
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,260
and wasn't the best for you now.

549
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,530
So he wants this gentler blend instead,

550
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,820
to keep Your Majesty relaxed every day.

551
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,660
Very well.

552
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,380
All right.

553
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,340
Xiaoshan,

554
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,860
go bring me my sword.

555
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,180
I'm in the mood today.

556
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,570
No!

557
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,740
Your Majesty,

558
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,260
you're not well right now.

559
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,700
You mustn't practice swordplay.

560
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,900
I can't do this either?

561
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,050
I was once the proud leader of Fenglai Pavilion,

562
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,130
and now

563
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,450
I've become some pampered hothouse flower?

564
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,380
Forget it.

565
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,700
Your Majesty, where are you going?

566
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,180
His Majesty said you mustn't run around.

567
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,490
I'm going to find him, all right?

568
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,090
Your Majesty...

569
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,180
Your Majesty.

570
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,410
Cangcang!

571
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,220
What brings you here?

572
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,090
I'm here to take you back.

573
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,410
Xiaoshan watches me all day,

574
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,490
saying you told her

575
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,570
I can't do this

576
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,820
and I can't do that.

577
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,090
I'm about to turn into a complete invalid.

578
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,490
I wouldn't even mind being useless,

579
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,340
but...

580
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,340
could you at least not take away my freedom?

581
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,490
Cangcang,

582
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,410
it's all for your own good.

583
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,610
Once Physician Li says you can move around,

584
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,970
you'll have more freedom.

585
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,490
All right.

586
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,900
Then until Physician Li nods,

587
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,780
I promise

588
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,180
I'll behave myself.

589
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,570
Good.

590
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,570
Come on.

591
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,860
Let's go back to Linghe Hall.

592
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,740
Let's go.

593
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,410
Wufu.

594
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

595
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,410
Double-check everything the Empress eats or uses.

596
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,550
No errors are allowed.

597
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,100
Understood.

598
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,660
You'll personally keep watch over the guards at Linghe Hall.

599
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,340
Understood.

600
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,660
Your Majesty,

601
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,260
isn't this a bit much?

602
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,900
But don't worry.

603
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,930
I'll keep an eye on my mother.

604
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,860
We'll see your heir safely born.

605
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,780
All right.

606
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,530
How are things at Deer Courtyard?

607
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,300
Your father-in-law works the fields there every day.

608
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,300
He caught a slight chill recently and has been coughing.

609
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,930
The imperial physicians have seen him.

610
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,740
Aside from that,

611
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,700
nothing unusual.

612
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,780
Make sure he's well taken care of.

613
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,130
After all,

614
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,490
he's getting old.

615
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,050
Understood.

616
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,050
Add some coltsfoot blossoms.

617
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,930
They're very good for easing the cough.

618
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,300
Here, Madam.

619
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,050
"Shi Yan will launch a surprise attack

620
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,930
on Lingbi Sect's Langye Mountain branch in two days."

621
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,450
Leak this news to Lingbi Sect.

622
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,050
But won't that put Shi Yan in danger?

623
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,490
If something happens to Shi Yan,

624
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,780
what will Li Hongqing do?

625
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,340
With the commander of the Imperial Guards away,

626
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,860
you, the deputy commander,

627
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,410
can serve a greater purpose.

628
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,450
Understood.

629
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,610
That mad princess in the palace

630
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,050
is still

631
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,130
a clever move we haven't even played.

632
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,340
Saintess.

633
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,900
I have received word

634
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,220
that the Emperor's Xiaoxing Guards

635
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,300
plans to strike Lingbi Sect's Langye Mountain branch.

636
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,820
[Saintess, Lingbi Sect]

637
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,260
Is the report accurate?

638
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,700
Yes.

639
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,260
Shi Yan meant to strike straight at the heart

640
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,700
and take the Langye Mountain branch in one blow.

641
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,300
But he walked into an ambush.

642
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,450
Though the Ghost King is dead

643
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,740
and they're now headless,

644
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,700
they've been in the martial world for years

645
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,220
and are hard to wipe out completely.

646
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,820
Earlier, Zhu Sha mentioned the Saintess,

647
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,900
saying she's their true master.

648
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,860
I request permission to set out

649
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,930
to bring Shi Yan back

650
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,130
and uncover the truth for Your Majesty.

651
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,740
All right.

652
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,340
Then be careful.

653
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,380
Commander Li.

654
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,090
What did you need from me?

655
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,340
I'm leaving on urgent business.

656
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,380
The palace patrols and His Majesty's safety

657
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,180
will be in your hands.

658
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,130
We're buddies.

659
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,380
No need to be so formal.

660
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,610
Besides,

661
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,530
this is all part of my duty.

662
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,450
Also,

663
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,490
over at the cold palace,

664
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,340
no more than three lamps are allowed.

665
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,970
All lamps must be out by the hour of Xu.

666
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,450
Though that's the servants' task,

667
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,970
have the men keep an eye on it too.

668
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,380
Ask them to help watch it.

669
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,450
Three lamps.

670
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,340
Hour of Xu.

671
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,180
No problem.

672
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,490
Thank you.

673
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,700
Oh, yes.

674
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,530
You know

675
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,700
what the princess is like.

676
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,660
I'm afraid the guys won't handle her well

677
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,340
and make her unhappy.

678
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,050
It's fine.

679
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,930
Just coax her and say

680
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,970
as long as she doesn't get mad

681
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,130
or hit anyone,

682
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,220
the flower will bloom soon.

683
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,860
What kind of flower is it?

684
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,570
Honestly, I'm not quite sure.

685
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,740
But once it blooms,

686
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,340
we'll know.

687
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,130
I'll take good care of it.

688
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,130
I'll make sure it grows up well and blossoms.

689
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,450
Then we can see what it looks like together.

690
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,970
I'm not eating until Hongqing comes back.

691
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,570
Your Highness,

692
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,820
Commander Li will be gone for quite a few days.

693
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,220
You'll ruin your health if you starve.

694
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,340
We can't have that.

695
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,180
All right then.

696
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,450
I should be more understanding.

697
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,300
Then,

698
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,780
I'll eat ten bites today,

699
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,660
nine bites tomorrow...

700
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,610
If he still isn't back in ten days,

701
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,930
I won't eat a single bite!

702
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,570
Your Highness,

703
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,260
this...

704
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,860
this absolutely won't do!

705
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,130
Let me talk to Her Highness.

706
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,610
Get out.

707
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,930
I don't like you.
