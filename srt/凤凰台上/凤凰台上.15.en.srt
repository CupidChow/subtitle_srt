Your Majesty,

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,570
after days of investigation,

25
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,690
this is the only location we found.

26
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,050
Kumor chose to set up camp here.

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,210
With mountains on three sides,

28
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,210
it's easy to defend and hard to attack.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,260
And their defenses are extremely tight.

Forgive me, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,410
Kumor is still waiting for the peace delegation,

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,260
so he is unlikely to harm her rashly.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,290

He's in the military camp

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,410

But is Lin Cangcang really his empress?

57

If she weren't,

would that darn emperor have sent a delegation at all?

the more suspicious you seem.

91

Your surname is Lin,

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,420
and never betray one another.

192
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,340
Kumor!

193
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,340
Who are you?

194
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,820
What did you say?

195
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,580
That's right.

196
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,730
We used to be romantically involved.

197
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,610
But we've already parted ways.

198
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,700
Yes, we parted ways.

199
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,300
But as you can see, I came after her.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,770
Tell me.

201
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,340
How did you two meet?

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,850
I founded Fenglai Pavilion back in Southern Chu.

203
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,180
She was recruiting a hall master,

204
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,530
so I went to apply.

205
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,710
But she wouldn't choose me.

206
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,420
He kept pestering me.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,180
Only later did I realize

208
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,530
he had ulterior motives.

209
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,980
What did he want?

210
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,580
He...

211
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,250
he wanted me.

212
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,180
Love at first sight?

213
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,980
She wanted to rescue the abducted youths.

214
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,770
Even while gravely poisoned,

215
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,180
she still tried to protect me out of duty

216
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,420
as the Sect Leader.

217
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,850
He did help me rescue

218
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,730
those children trapped in the mine,

219
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,130
and he risked his life for me

220
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,980
in the process.

221
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,340
So you fell in love with him too?

222
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,610
Then why did she come to Jiangzhou?

223
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,850
Why did you break up?

224
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,180
And why did you come?

225
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,770
We were incompatible.

226
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,100
That's it?

227
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,980
She thought I couldn't give her the freedom she wanted,

228
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,180
so she left me.

229
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,580
As for why and how

230
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,420
she came here,

231
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,610
I have no idea.

232
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,530
I just wanted to find her.

233
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,300
I heard someone spotted her in Jiangzhou,

234
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,700
so I came.

235
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,890
Kumor,

236
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,340
why aren't you saying anything?

237
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,250
Everything they said matches.

238
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,100
They met in the martial world.

239
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,060
One is the leader of Fenglai Pavilion,

240
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,770
and the other is a hall master chasing after her.

241
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,730
They fought side by side, saved people with their swords,

242
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,730
fell in love,

243
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,180
and later

244
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,530
broke up because of differences.

245
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,420
Then Bai Chifan,

246
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,820
still in love with Lin Cangcang,

247
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,420
rushed here once he heard

248
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,460
of her whereabouts.

249
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,180
Are you still suspicious of them?

250
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,530
It all seems too much of a coincidence.

251
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,300
But they clearly

252
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,130
had no time to coordinate a story.

253
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,420
When I provoked the Jiangzhou garrison earlier today,

254
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,490
Bai Chifan saved the two of us from the rain of arrows.

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,730
When she saw him, Lin Cangcang was startled

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,370
and even a bit repulsed.

257
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,010
Her reaction did not look fake.

258
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,770
I'm sure

259
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,250
she had no idea Bai Chifan would turn up here.

260
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,300
Yes,

261
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,820
everything they said about Southern Chu

262
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,060
lines up

263
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,580
and sounds like lived experience,

264
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,890
not something made up.

265
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,460
But neither of them would elaborate

266
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,370
on what happened after they left Southern Chu.

267
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,580
It's perfectly normal not to speak

268
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,180
of painful things after a breakup.

269
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,340
Besides, Kumor,

270
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,010
didn't you already test them?

271
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,220
He didn't know she stole the Phoenix Seal

272
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,490
or that she secretly joined the army.

273
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,820
It makes sense that he knew nothing about all that

274
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,300
since they had broken up.

275
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,890
The fact that their stories line up so perfectly

276
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,460
makes me even more uneasy.

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,730
Kumor,

278
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,340
you're overthinking it.

279
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,010
The peace delegation will arrive sooner or later.

280
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,610
You'll know her identity then,

281
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,820
won't you?

282
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,220
Besides,

283
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,340
from the way Ling Jueding shot at us without hesitation,

284
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,220
Cangcang is probably not the Empress.

285
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,420
More importantly,

286
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,980
the two of them saved me today.

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,700
We can't repay kindness with cruelty, can we?

288
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,460
You two saved me today.

289
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,730
I'm truly grateful.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,980
Here's a toast to you both.

291
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,610
No need for that, Your Highness.

292
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,980
I only meant to save Cangcang.

293
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,300
Saving you

294
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,580
was pure coincidence.

295
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,010
Mr. Bai, you traveled all this way for your beloved.

296
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,730
How touching.

297
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,650
General,

298
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,220
I cut ties with this man long ago.

299
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,370
He has nothing to do with me.

300
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,100
Cangcang,

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,700
even though we're no longer together,

302
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,300
I can't bear

303
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,530
to watch you treat yourself like this.

304
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,980
Since we've gone our separate ways,

305
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,610
what I do has nothing

306
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,700
to do with you.

307
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,370
Knowing you were captured,

308
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,010
of course I was worried.

309
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,890
You know perfectly well what it is

310
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,730
you're truly worried about.

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,770
Miss Lin,

312
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,820
what do you think Mr. Bai is worried about?

313
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,490
You should ask him.

314
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,420
Cangcang,

315
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,490
my feelings for you

316
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,850
are genuine.

317
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,530
Mr. Bai,

318
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,460
did you come all this way

319
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,700
only to take your beloved with you?

320
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,250
Of course.

321
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,730
She may have left me,

322
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,980
but I still love her.

323
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,300
Today,

324
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,340
Minjia went to the Jiangzhou gates

325
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,100
on a whim.

326
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,980
Bringing Miss Lin along

327
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,540
was even more spur-of-the-moment.

328
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,620
So how is it that you

329
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,010
just happened to be there?

330
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,850
Were you

331
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,340
lying in wait near my camp?

332
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,100
Yes.

333
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,460
You are honest indeed, Mr. Bai.

334
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,890
I knew Cangcang had been taken,

335
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,730
so I kept watch here day and night.

336
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,100
I wasn't about to let go

337
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,650
of even the faintest hope.

338
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,180
In this bitter cold,

339
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,530
night winds cut like knives.

340
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,130
Your devotion to her truly runs deep.

341
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,340
And

342
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,700
I was rewarded.

343
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,730
I found and saved her.

344
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,530
What if you hadn't saved her?

345
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,980
Then

346
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,140
I would've died with her.

347
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,420
Very well.

348
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,220
I'll grant that wish

349
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,090
and let you

350
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,090
share life and death today.

351
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,570
Guards!

352
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,700
Yes, General!

353
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,050
Take these two away.

354
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,220
Yes, General!

355
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,050
General.

356
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,620
Miss Lin,

357
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,860
step outside.

358
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,700
Weren't you going to keep me locked up?

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,900
What is this about?

360
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,290
Come and see.

361
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,330
What is this, General?

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,570
Mr. Bai said earlier

363
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,900
that he kept watch

364
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,380
near my camp day and night just to rescue you.

365
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,620
Since he's not afraid of Xijiang's freezing winds,

366
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,180
I'd like to see

367
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,090
how long he can endure them.

368
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,010
I was just worrying about how to shake him off.

369
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,050
Thank you, General, for helping me.

370
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,730
You two were once in love.

371
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,810
Miss Lin, don't you care at all?

372
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,330
I've already chosen to leave him behind,

373
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,220
so why cling to the past?

374
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,220
Even so,

375
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,050
he risked his life to rescue you.

376
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,810
Can you really bear to watch him suffer?

377
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,810
General,

378
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,010
I'm your prisoner now.

379
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,980
I can barely protect myself.

380
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,140
How could I worry about anyone else?

381
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,730
If you beg me,

382
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,980
I might let him go.

383
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,700
If begging really works,

384
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,530
can I beg you to let me go?

385
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,490
That's unlikely.

386
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,530
He and I have nothing to do with each other.

387
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,700
You may deal with him as you wish, General.

388
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,330
What a pity.

389
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,010
Your old flame

390
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,980
doesn't seem to care for you at all.

391
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,810
It doesn't matter.

392
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,140
I came here of my own will.

393
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,810
I accept whatever punishment comes my way.

394
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,090
Interesting.

395
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,620
You two...

396
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,010
One is devoted, while the other

397
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,620
is indifferent.

398
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,140
Very well.

399
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,570
Enjoy the cold.

400
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,010
Minjia.

401
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,490
Cangcang,

402
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,860
why did you call for me?

403
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,010
I knew you'd still be awake.

404
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,620
Sit.

405
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,330
I saw

406
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,460
Bai Chifan

407
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,620
tied to the pillar.

408
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,050
He looked like he was about to die.

409
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,220
I'm telling you your lover is dying.

410
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,180
Do you really not care?

411
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,420
Former lover.

412
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,980
He's just my former lover.

413
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,860
Why should I care?

414
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,140
But he's handsome,

415
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,250
skilled,

416
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,980
and absolutely devoted to you.

417
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,010
Don't tell me

418
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,770
you feel nothing at all.

419
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,770
In my opinion,

420
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,900
life is short.

421
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,660
Outcomes don't matter.

422
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,010
Living each day well

423
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,460
is what truly matters.

424
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,250
Princess Minjia,

425
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,700
are you feeling sorry for him?

426
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,140
This isn't pity.

427
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,050
I think he's a good man.

428
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,250
I like him.

429
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,980
If you don't want him,

430
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,180
give him to me.

431
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,980
I don't care about outcomes anyway.

432
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,530
Sure.

433
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,660
You can have him.

434
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,290
But right now,

435
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,980
he's probably freezing to death thanks to your brother.

436
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,700
Not

437
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,050
while I'm here.

438
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,620
Xiao Huan,

439
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,730
this is all I can do for you.

440
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,740
♪Falling petals♪

441
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,820
♪Petals drifting through the sky♪

442
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,580
♪Echoes linger♪

443
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,220
♪In the empty alleys at dawn♪

444
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,100
♪You used to gaze into my eyes♪

445
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,100
♪That watchful waiting once warmed a whole city♪

446
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,220
♪In the embers, a few strands of warmth still remain♪

447
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,860
♪The sky has faded to dusk♪

448
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,180
What are you looking at?

449
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,530
The stars.

450
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,330
They are especially

451
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,570
bright here.

452
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,700
Haven't you seen stars before?

453
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,980
It's been two years

454
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,660
since I

455
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,140
last looked up properly.

456
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,220
You're unbelievable.

457
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,730
In a situation like this,

458
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,530
you still care about stargazing?

459
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,010
At least we're under the same sky now.

460
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,290
That's a kind of bond, isn't it?

461
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,180
Just sharing

462
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,380
the same sky is enough for you?

463
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,290
Being able to see her again at all

464
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,250
is already a rare blessing.

465
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,570
I doubt I can hope for anything more.

466
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,180
You're easy to satisfy.

467
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,900
Too bad

468
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,980
she said she didn't care for you anymore.

469
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,420
She's giving you to me.

470
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,620
Your Highness must be joking.

471
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,980
A princess like you

472
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,330
will find a fine match.

473
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,330
You really are devoted.

474
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,570
Let me warn you,

475
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,050
the night winds here can freeze cattle and sheep to death.

476
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,660
Aren't you afraid of the cold?

477
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,690
No,

478
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,050
I'm used to it.

479
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,980
Here, Mr. Bai,

480
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,530
take this cloak.

481
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,700
Make it through the night.

482
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,090
Kumor,

483
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,220
I tested

484
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,980
both of them as you said.

485
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,250
I don't think they're faking it.

486
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,180
Minjia,

487
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,810
you grew up on the steppe.

488
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,010
You don't know how cunning the Central Plains people can be.

489
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,250
But Kumor,

490
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,180
Bai Chifan saved my life.

491
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,770
If you let him freeze to death,

492
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,250
that wouldn't be right.

493
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,700
Minjia,

494
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,490
don't tell me you've taken a liking to him.

495
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,330
Of course not.

496
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,980
Why would I fall for someone

497
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,460
whose heart belongs to another?

498
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,050
I'm just touched by his devotion.

499
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,220
Don't worry.

500
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,860
He won't die yet.

501
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,420
We'll decide his fate

502
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,420
after the delegation comes.

503
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,010
Is the hot water ready?

504
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,770
Yes, Your Highness.

505
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,980
The braziers are lit too.

506
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,980
Mr. Bai,

507
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,660
I've prepared a tent for you.

508
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,330
Take a hot bath once you get there.

509
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,180
I added herbs

510
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,980
to help you warm up.

511
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

512
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,010
Come on,

513
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,980
let's head back.

514
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,180
Didn't expect that.

515
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,250
You braved the northern wind all night and are still standing.

516
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,140
It seems I underestimated you.

517
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,090
I've roamed the martial world for years.

518
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,220
A bit of cold wind

519
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,490
is nothing.

520
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,420
In that case,

521
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,490
stay out for a few more nights.

522
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,250
Kumor,

523
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,530
I'm indebted to Mr. Bai.

524
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,220
I won't let you treat him like this.

525
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,050
Mr. Bai,

526
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,770
let's go.

527
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,220
Is she

528
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,090
really not the Empress?

529
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,570
General,

530
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,180
the delegation from Great Qi is at the gate.

531
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,810
Very well.

532
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,180
Let them in.

533
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,810
Yes, General.

534
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,090
Cangcang.

535
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,810
Minjia?

536
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,530
The delegation from Great Qi is here.

537
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,380
- They're here? - Let's go.

538
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,280
Kumor's waiting for us.

539
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,530
Come on.

540
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,770
Du Tingxin, envoy of Great Qi,

541
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,220
greets General Kumor.

542
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,730
By order of His Majesty,

543
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,090
I've come to negotiate peace.

544
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,290
Looks like I hold quite a place in the eyes

545
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,700
of the Emperor of Great Qi.

546
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,250
He actually sent the Imperial Preceptor here.

547
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,700
This shows

548
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,140
His Majesty's sincerity.

549
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,010
Very well.

550
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,140
Then let me show your emperor

551
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,700
my sincerity as well.

552
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,490
Bring her up!

553
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,810
General.

554
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,700
Preceptor Du,

555
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,730
aren't you going to kneel before your empress?

556
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,660
The Empress?

557
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,220
Where?

558
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,810
Didn't the Emperor of Great Qi

559
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,990
receive my letter?

560
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,490
Calm down, General.

561
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,770
I came precisely to address this matter.

562
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,330
This is a handwritten letter from His Majesty.

563
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,250
Please see for yourself.

564
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,500
[The Phoenix Seal of Great Qi recently went missing.]

565
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,900
[I heard it was found by General Kumor, so I sent a delegation]

566
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,100
[to retrieve the stolen seal, reclaim the captives, and negotiate peace.]

567
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,090
The Empress of Great Qi is still in the palace?

568
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,010
Yes.

569
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,940
Her Majesty is safe and sound.

570
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,570
His Majesty sent this delegation

571
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,290
to retrieve the stolen Phoenix Seal,

572
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,570
reclaim the captives,

573
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,250
and negotiate terms

574
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,620
for peace.

575
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,010
Preceptor Du,

576
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,010
do you know this woman?

577
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,090
This is the thief?

578
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,490
How dare you steal the Phoenix Seal?

579
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,570
Your crime is unforgivable!

580
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,570
Guards,

581
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,940
take her back to Jiangzhou for punishment!

582
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,730
- Wait. - Understood.

583
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,810
No need for all that trouble.

584
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,140
According to custom in Xijiang,

585
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,620
a thief's right hand is chopped off in public

586
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,860
and thrown in the wilderness to feed the wolves.

587
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,220
In that case,

588
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,620
let's follow local custom.

589
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,220
Do you have anything to say?

590
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,620
General,

591
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,620
to the Imperial Preceptor,

592
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,900
I am indeed a thief who stole the Phoenix Seal.

593
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,460
I have nothing to say.

594
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,250
Please do the honors, Preceptor Du.

595
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,090
Then please have your men

596
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,770
hold the thief down.

597
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,290
Preceptor Du, your inner force may be mediocre,

598
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,700
but your resolve to chop off her hand is admirable.

599
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,090
What is it?

600
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,180
Have you changed your mind about punishing her?

601
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,860
Since she is not the Empress of Great Qi,

602
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,290
her matter can wait.

603
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,090
Let us discuss real business.

604
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,490
Since you were sent by the Emperor of Great Qi,

605
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,700
you must have brought some token of sincerity.

606
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,530
Bring it up!

607
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,770
What is this?

608
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,150
Do you think you can

609
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,090
buy me off with a bit of money?

610
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,010
This is 3,128 liang and nine qian of gold.

611
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,900
It is not "a bit of money."

612
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,570
This is the money people in Xijiang paid to purchase proper status

613
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,380
after the status verification system was implemented last year.

614
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,220
I had the Ministry of Revenue convert it into gold

615
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,210
and brought it here to you.

616
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,570
I didn't go through all this trouble

617
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,010
for a bit of gold.

618
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,940
Since the status verification system was enforced,

619
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,610
those without proper status have been reduced to slaves.

620
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,740
Ordinary folk have had no choice but to purchase good status.

621
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,530
How is this any different from daylight robbery?

622
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,900
If the system is not abolished,

623
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,130
this gold you brought

624
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,610
will be nothing but a drop in the ocean.

625
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,820
General, mind your words.

626
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,170
The status verification system is a national policy

627
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,820
established to maintain order.

628
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,300
How can it be abolished so easily?

629
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,880
You are mistaken, Preceptor Du.

630
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,460
Only when all people are free and equal

631
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,460
can the land be at peace.

632
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,740
As I see it,

633
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,610
the status verification system

634
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,050
is the very cause of chaos in the land.

635
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,530
I am merely carrying out orders

636
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,780
to deliver this gold to you, General.

637
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,340
Matters regarding the system

638
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,130
are not for me to decide.

639
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,090
I've heard you're the Emperor of Great Qi's trusted aide.

640
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,900
Seeing you today,

641
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,980
I can't imagine why.

642
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,010
I will report your thoughts

643
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,530
to His Majesty.

644
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,980
Good.

645
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,260
Please do.

646
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,110
When you decide to abolish

647
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,900
the status verification system,

648
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,090
I will consider

649
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,480
when to withdraw my troops.

650
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,610
General, are you truly turning down

651
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,050
3,000 liang of gold?

652
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,380
Did I say I was?

653
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,900
Aren't the Phoenix Seal and the captives

654
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,340
worth 3,000 liang of gold?

655
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,410
General, how bold you are.

656
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,530
Very well.

657
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,180
In that case,

658
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,490
the gold is yours.

659
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,700
As for the captives, the Phoenix Seal, and her,

660
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,130
I'm taking them all.

661
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,780
Preceptor Du, you are being a bit too greedy.

662
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,660
You may take the captives.

663
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,860
As for the Phoenix Seal and her,

664
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,860
you may choose only one.

665
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,700
Then please, chop off her hand

666
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,300
and feed it to the wolves for me.

667
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,010
As for the Phoenix Seal and her,

668
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,090
you may choose only one.

669
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,300
Then please, chop off her hand

670
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,970
and feed it to the wolves for me.

671
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,700
The Preceptor never intended to take me away.

672
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,410
Was she acting on his orders?

673
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,740
No matter.

674
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,610
I am no longer the Empress of Great Qi.

675
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,050
Why should I care what he wants?

676
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,860
If the Preceptor can at least tell Jueding

677
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,860
that I'm safe,

678
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,260
it will put his mind at ease.

679
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,940
If I can use this opportunity

680
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,010
to learn the Black Tiger Army's defenses...

681
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,260
What are you thinking?

682
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,340
Nothing.

683
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,980
Are you sad?

684
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,940
Of course.

685
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,530
All the captives have left.

686
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,900
I'm the only one left behind.

687
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,260
General, you don't still think

688
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,490
I'm the Empress of Great Qi, do you?

689
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,210
To be honest,

690
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,210
I still have a tiny bit of doubt.

691
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,130
But right now,

692
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,380
I see no reason

693
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,610
to believe you are.

694
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,260
Then what do you plan to do with me?

695
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,690
I intend

696
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,860
to treat you two

697
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,210
as honored guests.

698
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,900
When the war ends,

699
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,940
I will see you both off myself.

700
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,860
This is how you treat honored guests?

701
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,780
You're practically putting me under house arrest.

702
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,860
Inside the camp,

703
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,780
you two are free to go wherever you like.

704
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,460
But if either of you steps outside,

705
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,860
don't blame me for being ruthless.

706
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,170
All right.

707
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,610
Since you're so "hospitable,"

708
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,690
I suppose

709
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,090
I'll stay.

710
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,090
But there is one thing I don't understand.

711
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,260
Now that you know I'm not the Empress,

712
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,300
why

713
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,860
haven't you killed me?

714
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,780
I can't bear to.

715
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,460
I just think

716
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,490
that you are a woman of honor.

717
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,460
You stole provisions to save the people.

718
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,170
I admire that.

719
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,530
Rest assured.

720
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,170
Since I said

721
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,980
I'd treat you as honored guests,

722
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,740
I'll keep my word.

723
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,050
Good.

724
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,420
Your Highness.

725
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,690
Mr. Bai,

726
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,610
are you better now?

727
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,820
Thank you for the cloak.

728
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,010
Cangcang?

729
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,740
She should have left with the delegation.

730
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,610
Why is she still here?

731
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,380
Yes, that's Cangcang.

732
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,210
What's wrong?

733
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,610
Nothing.

734
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,820
Did

735
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,610
the delegation from Great Qi come today?

736
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,340
They did.

737
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,130
And they've already left.

738
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,610
Can you believe my brother?

739
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,740
Earlier,

740
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,340
he suspected that Lin Cangcang was the Empress

741
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,260
and even had me follow the two of you.

742
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,460
Only when the delegation

743
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,170
confirmed her identity today

744
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,260
did he finally relax.

745
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,900
If you ask me,

746
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,860
the whole thing is simple.

747
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,210
If Cangcang were the Empress,

748
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,130
wouldn't that

749
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,090
make you the Emperor?

750
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,380
Exactly.

751
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,420
[Qi]

752
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,780
General.

753
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,900
Greetings,

754
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,010
Preceptor Du.

755
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,380
General Ling,

756
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,610
no need to look around.

757
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,010
Her Majesty

758
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,490
is not with us.

759
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,300
Why not?

760
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,900
Kumor made me choose between the 300 captives

761
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,530
and Her Majesty,

762
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,090
but she would rather die than admit who she was.

763
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,530
I had no choice but to respect her wishes,

764
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,980
so I only retrieved the stolen Phoenix Seal

765
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,210
and brought back the captives.

766
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,690
Then what about my sister?

767
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,690
Her Majesty put the greater good first.

768
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,210
Heaven will watch over her.

769
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,050
I will also

770
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,860
pray for her safety day and night.

771
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,420
Cangcang.

772
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,740
Minjia?

773
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,340
Why are you staying in your tent all the time?

774
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,380
Why not go out for a walk?

775
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,530
What's the point?

776
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,900
I can't leave the camp anyway.

777
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,420
What,

778
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,130
do you know somewhere worth going?

779
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,090
I wish.

780
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,170
I still have to clean the stables this afternoon.

781
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,380
Clean the stables?

782
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,610
A princess like you cleans the stables yourself?

783
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,460
Of course.

784
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,740
As my brother says,

785
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,340
there are no princesses in the camp,

786
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,420
only soldiers.

787
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,130
If I want to stay here,

788
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,260
I have to work like everyone else.

789
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,100
Anyway, enough about that.

790
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,570
I snuck out

791
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,210
to chat with you.

792
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,820
About what?

793
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,340
If it's about Bai Chifan,

794
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,610
forget it.

795
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,260
That's exactly what I want to talk about.

796
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,490
Why did you break up with him?

797
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,690
He clearly cares for you deeply.

798
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,260
I used to think so too.

799
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,380
Only later did I realize

800
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,010
he had ulterior motives.

801
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,740
Mr. Bai is not that kind of man.

802
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,610
He risked his life to save you.

803
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,010
Enough.

804
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,210
I don't want to talk about him.

805
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,420
I bet

806
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,900
you still have feelings for him.

807
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,050
If you truly didn't care,

808
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,610
you wouldn't sound so bitter.

809
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,210
You say you've moved on,

810
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,780
but you still hold grudges.

811
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,610
If you ask me,

812
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,610
your anger

813
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,860
comes from love.

814
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,780
Really?

815
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,050
I hit the mark, didn't I?
