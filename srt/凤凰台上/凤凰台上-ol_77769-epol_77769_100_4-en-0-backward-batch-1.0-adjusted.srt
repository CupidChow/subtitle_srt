00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,240
LOVE & CROWN

2
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,920
EPISODE 4

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We have an invitation.

5
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,800
Please, go upstairs
to the Green Haitang Chamber.

6
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,480
This young lady is a distinguished guest.

7
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,600
Let her in.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,280
Please come with me.

9
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,200
Let's go.

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,440
Master, why did you let her in?

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,880
Willow and haitang blossoms.

12
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,720
She's one of us.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Look.

14
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
Sorry for the long wait.

15
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,200
The highlight of our show today
will begin soon.

16
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,640
You who come to this pleasure boat
must have already known the rules here.

17
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,560
A blind auction.

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
You each have three
haitang flowers on your table,

19
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
representing three bidding chances.

20
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,080
But let me put out a disclaimer now.

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,360
If you bid but fail to pay,

22
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
you'll be fed to the fish.

23
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,720
- What are we bidding for today?
- I wonder.

24
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Allow me to start the bid.

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,560
My starting price is 100 liang.

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,720
200 liang.

27
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,400
How can we bid when we don't know
what it is?

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
400 liang.

29
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,640
400 liang already? This soon?

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,520
Mr. Niu offers 400 liang.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Do I hear a higher bid?

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,640
3,000 liang.

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,040
- 3,000?
- 3,000?

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
Are you out of your mind?

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,120
How generous of this gentleman.

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,360
3,000 liang.

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,720
Any higher bids?

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,880
5,000 liang.

39
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,560
5,000 liang?

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
5,000 liang?

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,360
That's not fair.
He didn't throw the flower.

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,920
Patience, my esteemed guest.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,120
Guests on the second floor,
in the Golden Haitang Chamber

44
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,480
have special privileges,

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,280
but they all have only three chances
as well.

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,960
6,000 liang.

47
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,600
- 8,000 liang.
- 8,000 liang?

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,120
Enough is enough. Stop it.

49
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
What if they feed you to the fish?

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
Did you hear me?

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,960
Two fluorite night pearls.

52
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,000
Two fluorite night pearls.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Fluorite night pearls.

54
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,240
What an elucidating experience.

55
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,320
<i>That spoiled brat.</i>

56
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,880
What exquisite fluorite night pearls.
Fine tributes from the Western Sea.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,840
May I know where you hail from, Mr. Bai?

58
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,360
This is just a transaction.

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
Outside of this pleasure boat,
we're both strangers.

60
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,440
Right. I agree.

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,320
I wonder what it is
that my husband spent a fortune

62
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,280
to purchase.

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
When can we get it?

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,120
You're so impatient, Miss. Come with me.

65
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
After you.

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,600
Wait for me here.

67
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
I'd like to see a friend.

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,120
A friend? Who?

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
You're alone.

70
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,240
Oh, my dear brother. Are you worried

71
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,160
that I might feel lonely,

72
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,360
so you came to have
a heart-to-heart talk with me?

73
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,920
Someone tried to kill me when you learned

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,880
that I joined Fenglai Pavilion.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
As my only brother,

76
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
you sure want me dead.

77
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
You think I tried to kill you?

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Are you implying

79
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,000
that it was
your mother who wanted me dead,

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,920
and you had no idea at all?

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,560
Just like all the times before,

82
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,480
it's always your mother who wants me dead,

83
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,520
not you.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,120
Will you believe me if
I say I have nothing to do with it?

85
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,240
Whether it's your or your mother's doing,

86
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,240
it makes no difference.

87
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Right.

88
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,480
You lured me to Botang Pleasure Boat.

89
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
What if I kill you right now?

90
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,520
Can you kill me though?

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,040
I can try.

92
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,880
I don't have time for a spar right now.

93
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,480
Many kids on this boat are waiting
to be rescued.

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,880
Drop your act.

95
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,080
You forsook moral
principles for the throne.

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,320
A human life is nothing in your eyes,

97
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
let alone the lives of those kids.

98
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,600
You only care about ruling Great Qi.

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,680
Yes.

100
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
I do care about our empire

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,240
but I care more about
the lives of my subjects.

102
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,400
Even if it's just one person,

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
that person is still
a citizen of Great Qi.

104
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,320
You're still
the sanctimonious Xiao Huan I know.

105
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,360
You again?

106
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,240
Why do you two always
fight when you see each other?

107
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,520
I told you to wait for me there.

108
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
I…

109
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
We have to pick the goods.

110
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
They are here. Help yourself.

111
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Are these murder thralls?

112
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
Keen eyes, Mister.

113
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,600
They are stone men.

114
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,880
They are invincible and feel no pain,

115
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,200
perfect for a killing machine.

116
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,320
It's hard to make one,

117
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
and that's why it's expensive.

118
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,320
We only have 10 minutes to save them.

119
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,640
After 10 minutes,

120
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,360
Prince of Yuzhang will surround the boat.

121
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,400
None of the passengers
will be able to escape.

122
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,600
We want this one.

123
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,440
Wise choice.

124
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
There are small boats behind the boat.

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
Someone will pick you up there.

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,120
Protect yourself and take the kids away.

127
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Run!

128
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,200
- Here.
- Mother!

129
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,120
Careful.

130
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Careful.

131
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
Here.

132
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Come.

133
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Take the kids away first.

134
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
I'll save Bai.

135
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
Why did you return?

136
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,360
We fight together.

137
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,880
Who are you?

138
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,280
It doesn't matter.

139
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,600
What you need to know

140
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,040
is that he is not for you to kill.

141
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,240
It's too late.

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,320
Surrender yourself now.

143
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,680
You came nonetheless.

144
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,880
It is my feudal land.

145
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,360
If someone wants to commit
an atrocious crime on my land,

146
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,400
they'll have to get through me,
Prince of Yuzhang.

147
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,000
Enemy vessels are
three zhang away from our boat.

148
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,360
The boat must be destroyed.

149
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,560
Long live Lingbi.

150
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,720
We give our lives to you.

151
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Long live Lingbi.

152
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,000
We give our lives to you.

153
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
Long live Lingbi.

154
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,600
We give our lives to you.

155
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,680
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

157
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,720
Long live Lingbi.

158
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,760
- We give our lives to you.
- Run!

159
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,560
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

160
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,160
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

161
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,200
FENGLAI PAVILION

162
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,880
<i>Miss Ling,</i>
<i>you merely suffered from the shock,</i>

163
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
<i>so you're fine.</i>

164
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,040
<i>He, however,</i>
<i>got the short end of the stick.</i>

165
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,920
<i>His back is seriously wounded,</i>
<i>and he is suffering from nightmares.</i>

166
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>We don't know when he'll wake up.</i>

167
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,840
Bai. I'm sorry.

168
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,920
Please be all right.

169
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,800
<i>What a joke.</i>

170
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,840
<i>What a joke.</i>

171
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,880
<i>You want to regain your power?</i>

172
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,360
<i>Have you forgotten</i>

173
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
<i>that you gave it to</i>
<i>us willingly in the past?</i>

174
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,840
Your Highness.

175
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
It is cold out here,

176
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,720
and you have a weak constitution.

177
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,560
Why are you standing here alone?

178
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,960
Don't do this, Your Highness.

179
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
Come.

180
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,520
If one day,

181
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,200
I become the emperor,

182
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,960
I shall make you the Grand Chancellor,

183
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
and Cangcang the empress.

184
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,520
The Empress Dowager
never takes His Highness seriously.

185
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,520
His Highness is isolated politically.

186
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,240
It is shrewd of him to form
an alliance with the Grand Tutor.

187
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,280
But should he become
the emperor in the future,

188
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,160
this promise might be
the one thing that binds him.

189
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,080
Indeed.

190
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,800
Grand Tutor Ling,

191
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,240
when will you let me rule in my own right?

192
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,240
The day Cangcang weds you

193
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,560
will be the day you take real power.

194
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Unfortunately,
you might not live to see that day.

195
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
Isn't it great to be the Bai Chifan

196
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,120
who roams freely in the martial world?

197
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,120
<i>If I lose my power,</i>

198
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,040
<i>I'll lose my life too.</i>

199
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,800
I will treat Cangcang with sincerity.

200
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,080
Your sincerity is a joke.

201
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,600
What a lovestruck ruler!

202
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,960
Not only did
you fail to regain your power,

203
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,000
but you will live like you used to before,

204
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,600
wondering every day

205
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,280
if you can live to
see the sunrise tomorrow.

206
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
You lay low for ten years,

207
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,480
but you messed up
your plan in one crucial moment.

208
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,560
You brought this upon yourself.

209
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,080
<i>No.</i>

210
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,280
<i>No. What should I do? This can't be it.</i>

211
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Bai.

212
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
{\an8}Bai. You're finally awake.

213
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,520
Cangcang.

214
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,640
Marry me.

215
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
What?

216
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,040
Cangcang. I love you.

217
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,480
Marry me. All right?

218
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,280
Luo.

219
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,800
Cangcang.

220
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Father wants me
to bring you back to the Capital.

221
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,000
Come with me.

222
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Let Cangcang go already.

223
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm going to marry Cangcang.

224
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,560
Luo, don't hurt Bai.

225
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,000
Cangcang.

226
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,840
Since the beginning,
he approached you to fulfill his plan.

227
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,160
He has an agenda.

228
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
I know very well if
he has an agenda or not.

229
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,720
Someone with a secret agenda

230
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
will not risk their lives to
save me again and again.

231
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,560
Cangcang.

232
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,240
He did that to earn your sympathy.

233
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,480
Can't you tell?

234
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,680
Luo.

235
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,680
I can tell if it's a ruse
to earn my sympathy,

236
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,680
or if he truly cares about me.

237
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,240
You'd rather believe
a stranger you just met than me?

238
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,360
I…

239
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,720
I didn't mean it that way.

240
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,480
Do you…

241
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,080
Do you fancy him as well?

242
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,880
Father wants me to bring you back.

243
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
Don't make my job difficult for me.

244
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,880
Luo.

245
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,760
Headstrong as I may be,
I dare not defy my father.

246
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,840
Give me three days.

247
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,800
Once I settle everything,

248
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,400
I'll see my father
and ask for a punishment.

249
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,599
But today,

250
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,240
you're not hurting Bai.

251
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,800
FENGLAI PAVILION

252
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm coming.

253
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,160
Bai?

254
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
What is this?

255
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
- A gift.
- A gift?

256
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,920
Frostflame Iron?

257
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,480
Give this to your master.

258
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,560
Cangcang,

259
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,120
if I want your hand in marriage,

260
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,120
I'll have to earn
your father's and master's recognition.

261
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,600
I don't want to see any tension
between you and them because of me.

262
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,280
So let's pay your master a visit.

263
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,120
I'm sure he'll be over the moon.

264
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,240
Among all things, he loves
making swords the most.

265
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,400
Doesn't this belong to Prince of Yuzhang?
Why do you have it?

266
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,600
HEROIC COMPOSURE

267
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,200
Frostflame Iron?

268
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,360
It's mine.

269
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,680
Why must I give it to you?

270
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,960
Botang Pleasure Boat was destroyed.

271
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
The Lingbi Sect
suffers another great loss.

272
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,400
You also solved
the case of the missing boys.

273
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,680
I'm sure the imperial court
will reward you handsomely.

274
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,480
You don't need the Frostflame Iron.

275
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,320
I can give it to you for free.

276
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
But only if you…

277
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,760
If I?

278
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm afraid you can't give me what I want.

279
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,480
Don't covet what isn't yours.

280
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Give me the Frostflame Iron.

281
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,680
Are you ordering me as the emperor

282
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,280
or are you pleading as my brother?

283
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,200
What do you think?

284
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,120
Whatever.

285
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,640
I saved you twice in the quarry

286
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,560
and on the boat.

287
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,680
I will ask you to pay me back

288
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,360
for those favors eventually.

289
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,320
Consider this iron ore

290
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,800
my gift to you for your upcoming wedding.

291
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,280
Thank you.

292
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,760
Bai, wait for me.

293
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,280
Cangcang.

294
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,440
Didn't you say your master is a swordsman?

295
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,040
I thought a swordsman would
go on an adventure to uphold justice.

296
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
Why is your master

297
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,200
residing in this remote area?

298
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,960
He was a swordsman,
and now, he's a recluse.

299
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,520
Because
he doesn't like the hustle and bustle.

300
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,360
How did you meet your master then?

301
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,720
Did I tell you
why I wanted to rescue those kids?

302
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,720
When I was little…

303
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,080
Father!

304
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,800
I miss Mother. Can we visit her grave?

305
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,000
Cangcang.

306
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,520
I'm busy.

307
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,640
Quit making a fuss. Go back now.

308
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,000
No. I don't want to stay home alone.

309
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,840
Cangcang.

310
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
Be a good girl.

311
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,400
We will visit her grave in the future.

312
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,800
Bring her back.

313
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,400
Find some playmates for her.

314
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,120
Go back now.

315
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,160
Slow down, Young Lady!

316
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,560
Don't trip yourself.

317
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,640
If you won't bring me there,

318
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,600
I'll go there myself.

319
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
Try running now. Run!

320
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll spank you.

321
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,920
Father will save me!

322
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
Run! Try running.

323
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,880
- He'll save me.
- Come out!

324
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,720
My father is the best father in the world!

325
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,880
You had similar experiences,

326
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,320
so you hate those who traffic children.

327
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
What does this have
to do with your master?

328
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,560
Mercy, sir.
I've not seen this girl before.

329
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,920
I'm serious, sir.

330
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,880
Just take that girl away.

331
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
For free.

332
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,200
Don't be scared. Let me help you.

333
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,680
Easy now. I'll take you home, all right?

334
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,280
I'm not a bad guy.

335
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,000
Tell me.

336
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,240
What is your name?

337
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,640
- And then?
- And then,

338
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,440
Master brought me to my father.

339
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,440
My father hugged me and cried.

340
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,360
Master also told Father

341
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,880
that his daughter
had suffered the same fate,

342
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
and that he had been looking for her.

343
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,520
Did he manage to find her?

344
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,480
It's over there.

345
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,320
Master told me
that she loved haitang blossoms the most.

346
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Even though I have never met her,

347
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,920
I'm sure

348
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,440
she missed her father

349
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,920
and this wonderful world a lot.

350
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,720
TOMBSTONE OF BELOVED DAUGHTER,
LI XIAOTANG

351
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,760
So later,

352
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,760
I made the decision

353
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,160
that even though
Master had lost her daughter,

354
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,760
I would treat him as if he were my father.

355
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,400
Bai.

356
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,440
You will treat Master with kindness,
won't you?

357
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,880
TOMBSTONE OF BELOVED DAUGHTER,
LI XIAOTANG

358
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
<i>Master, I'm here.</i>

359
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,200
Master.

360
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm here to visit you.

361
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,560
Master.

362
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,840
I'm here to visit you.

363
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,480
Where did he go?

364
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,120
What are you doing here?

365
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,680
I'm here to see Cangcang's master.

366
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,040
You're not welcome here.

367
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,920
Are you saying that as Cangcang's master,

368
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,200
or as the Ghost King?

369
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,160
As expected of
a student of Grand Tutor Ling.

370
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,760
Do you know
what your teacher thinks of you?

371
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,720
He said you were like a wolf pup

372
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,040
prowling in the snow.

373
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,040
People assume you're alone and powerless.

374
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,840
But they seem to forget

375
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,720
that you are still a wolf.

376
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,960
Master!

377
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,040
You're here.

378
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,200
I was looking for you.

379
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Greetings, sir.

380
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,960
I see you have talked to him.

381
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,800
- Allow me to introduce…
- No need.

382
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
We met just now.

383
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,560
Then, about our marriage…

384
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,000
I am just a farmer now.

385
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,360
Your father should have the final say.

386
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
What do you mean?

387
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,480
You're as important to me as my father.

388
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,640
I trust your judgment.

389
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,760
Cangcang,

390
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,640
Bai Chifan told me
that you came to have a sword made.

391
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,080
Quick. Give me the Frostflame Iron.

392
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,560
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

393
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,160
<i>I found something</i>
<i>important whilst investigating</i>

394
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,680
<i>Grand Tutor Ling.</i>

395
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,120
Ling Cangcang's master is likely

396
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,760
to be the Ghost King.

397
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,800
Likely, you said?

398
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,320
Don't you know how important he is
to Cangcang?

399
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,760
I can capture Li Lu

400
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,600
and interrogate him before we decide.

401
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,000
No need for that.

402
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,520
If I want Cangcang to marry me,
I must pay him a visit.

403
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,920
<i>If he turns out to be the Ghost King,</i>

404
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
<i>we can only act on a full moon's night.</i>

405
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,200
Bai.

406
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,680
What are you doing out here?

407
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm here to get some fresh air.

408
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,560
Did you know?

409
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,720
Master never lets
anyone into his sword cottage.

410
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,840
But he lets you in.
That means you've earned his recognition.

411
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,480
What's wrong?

412
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,520
The full moon's night is near.

413
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,400
Indeed.

414
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,120
It feels like the moon here
is prettier than anywhere else.

415
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,880
In the past,

416
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,600
Master would never
allow me to admire the moon

417
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
on a full moon's night.

418
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,280
But tomorrow is a full moon's night

419
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,600
and the day we'll get our swords.

420
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,920
I hope he won't chase me away this time.

421
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,440
<i>Cangcang.</i>

422
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,520
<i>I pray that you won't resent me.</i>

423
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,800
Is it done?

424
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,480
Yes.

425
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,440
Cangcang. Take a look.

426
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,120
What an amazing blade.

427
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,160
Master,

428
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,920
it is a good sword.

429
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,680
If that is your choice,
you should now name it.

430
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,240
Master, I have already thought it through.

431
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,680
Can we call it Willow?

432
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,080
Of course.

433
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,440
Thanks, Master.

434
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,480
Bai Chifan,

435
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,960
you can have this sword.

436
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Master, you should give it a name.

437
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,480
The dragon hasn't soared high,

438
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,680
but his reign can already be felt.

439
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,160
This blade shall be called Rex.

440
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,000
Rex and Willow.

441
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,080
Those are good names.

442
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,400
Consider these two blades

443
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,240
my gifts to your wedding.

444
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,920
Bai, thank my master already.

445
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,800
Thank you for the sword, sir.

446
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,000
Thank you, Master.

447
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,960
You're here.

448
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,360
Is Cangcang asleep already?

449
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,520
Without her chattering, it feels quiet.

450
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,320
You shouldn't have stayed here tonight.

451
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,120
I'm sure your men

452
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,000
are all around this sword grave.

453
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,000
You have already noticed my plan,

454
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,040
yet you decided to stay.

455
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,440
Are you surrendering yourself?

456
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Do you know why

457
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Cangcang named the blade Willow?

458
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,280
My daughter

459
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,720
was playing house with
the kids from the same village.

460
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,480
She loved to pretend to be a heroine.

461
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,880
She went out to play all the time,

462
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,040
and pestered me
to make her a wooden sword.

463
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,760
<i>Your sword is the best</i>
<i>sword in the world, Father.</i>

464
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,800
<i>Thank you, Father.</i>

465
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,200
<i>Should we give the sword a name?</i>

466
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,360
<i>Sure!</i>

467
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,120
That day when I found my daughter,
I saw a mountain full of cadavers.

468
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,680
All I could find of her

469
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,360
was a mangled hand.

470
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,760
That hand

471
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,480
was clinging to the wooden sword tightly

472
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,640
but she…

473
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,640
She was gone.

474
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,200
I held her hands

475
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,800
and carved the name, Willow, on it

476
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,320
by guiding her step by step.

477
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,480
Breeze passes
through the willow tree softly.

478
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,880
The moon shines on the haitang blossoms.

479
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,880
So you know

480
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,080
the complete codes.

481
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,160
On Botang Pleasure Boat,

482
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,680
when Jin Haitang

483
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,160
<i>saw the haitang blossom</i>
<i>pendant on Cangcang's waist,</i>

484
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,640
<i>she let us into the auction.</i>

485
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,000
I suppose the pendant
was left behind by your daughter.

486
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,200
You are indeed using Cangcang.

487
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,880
She's such a sweet girl.

488
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
How could you…

489
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,320
So the Ghost King has empathy?

490
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,200
Why did you lead the Lingbi Sect

491
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,960
and commit inhumane crimes then?

492
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,640
Factors out of our control often bind us.

493
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,760
The Ghost King is but a puppet.

494
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,080
I don't think myself morally perfect.

495
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,720
I seek vengeance and repay gratitude.

496
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,200
But why give your life away now?

497
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,120
Come to the palace with me and repent.

498
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,280
You will bring solace to everyone.

499
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,480
Heed my warning.

500
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,719
Stop pestering the Lingbi Sect.

501
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,000
If I don't die, there will be no peace.

502
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,120
So make it quick.

503
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,440
Alas, what a cruel joke from life.

504
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,320
Keep the truth from Cangcang.

505
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,400
A promise from the emperor

506
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,800
shall never be broken.

507
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,800
Do it.

508
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,160
Master!

509
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,840
Master!

510
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,480
Master!

511
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,120
Master!

512
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,920
Master!

513
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,680
Wake up, Master!

514
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,120
Tell me why.

515
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,000
Why?

516
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,880
My intervention was tardy.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

517
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,600
What did he just call you?

518
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,960
<i>You killed my master.</i>

519
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,360
<i>Why would I marry you?</i>

520
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,600
I want you to marry me willingly.

521
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,080
I, Ling Cangcang, am willing to marry you.

522
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
<i>Who are you?</i>

523
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
Ling Cangcang or the Empress of Great Qi?

524
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,560
Do you love the Emperor of Great Qi?

525
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,720
Bai Chifan never existed.

526
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,360
Bai Chifan…

527
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,800
Bai Chifan never existed.

528
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
My dear. You're awake.

529
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,520
Your Majesty.

530
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,240
How come you're here, Your Majesty?

531
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,120
I came in
and heard you talking in your dream.

532
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,360
Are you all right?

533
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,880
I…

534
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,040
I had a dream.

535
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,360
What is it about?

536
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,560
I dreamed that…

537
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,760
I dreamed that…

538
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,240
I dreamed that you were kind,

539
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,160
and that my master was still alive.

540
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,480
And I was still the carefree soul.

541
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,560
- My dear…
- Alas, a dream is the opposite of reality.

542
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,200
My master is dead.

543
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,400
Your Majesty, it's time to wake up.

544
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,520
Today is the day you return home.

545
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,440
Come in.

546
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,760
Your Majesty.

547
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,840
Since you have to return home today,

548
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,960
I understand it might be tiring.

549
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,800
So I will go back to
the Grand Chancellor's Manor with you.

550
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,880
What do you think?

551
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,600
You are a busy man, Your Majesty.

552
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,200
I shouldn't burden you
with such a trivial matter.

553
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,320
Your matter is not a trivial matter to me.

554
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,600
I wouldn't want to impose.

555
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,200
Relax, my dear.

556
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,640
This is a wedding gift
from the young general,

557
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,640
Ling Jueding.

558
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,720
It took me a while to locate it.

559
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,040
My dear, you may take a look.

560
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
How thoughtful of General Ling.

561
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,440
He couldn't attend
our wedding in the Capital,

562
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,840
yet he gave us such a meaningful gift.

563
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,320
He is stationed in Jiangzhou.

564
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,000
I can only imagine the pain
he feels from being away from his family.

565
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,600
Maybe it'll be less miserable

566
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,520
if he
can secure a position in the Capital.

567
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,960
My dear.

568
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,200
You must think about
the ones who are still alive.

569
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,560
Jueding is brave, strong,

570
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,640
and straightforward.

571
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,440
He should be a soldier.

572
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
If…

573
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,760
If we find him a desk job in the Capital,

574
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,920
I'm sure he'd hate

575
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,560
that kind of lifestyle.

576
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,560
You're right, my dear.

577
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,800
I didn't think of that.

578
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,280
In that case…

579
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
I turned your offer down,

580
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,480
thinking that you'd be
too busy to come with me.

581
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
But if

582
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,360
you are willing to come home with me,

583
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,640
I'll be extremely delighted.

584
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,400
Good.

585
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,920
Then I shall wait for you outside.

586
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,840
Do you think
His Majesty loves Her Majesty?

587
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
What are you on about?

588
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,880
After they got married,

589
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,120
His Majesty hasn't
consummated with Her Majesty.

590
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,360
Everyone in the palace

591
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,360
is saying that His Majesty
only married Her Majesty

592
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,240
for political reasons.

593
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,840
But seeing

594
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,160
His Majesty go back
home with Her Majesty today,

595
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,280
I feel that he does love her.

596
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,160
LING MANOR

597
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,840
Let's go.
