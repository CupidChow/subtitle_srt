00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,490
Lanxi,

192
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,820
I've told you long ago:

193
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,420
no matter when,

194
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,580
you must stand tall.

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,300
It's nothing more than some schemer failing to have you killed

196
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,650
and now trying to sling mud instead.

197
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,580
As your teacher,

198
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,980
I'll stand up for you!

199
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,460
Since that's the case,

200
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,890
I ask all of you

201
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,890
to wait for the results of the palace exam.

202
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,420
Not even a word of praise for me.

203
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,130
Using me and then kicking me away,

204
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,490
how heartless of you!

205
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,770
Grand Tutor Ling.

206
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,620
[Taiji Hall]

207
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,610
You've schemed for years,

208
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,700
and now your career is about to collapse.

209
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,300
You must have lost your mind

210
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,700
after the loss of your beloved daughter.

211
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,420
Why are you talking such nonsense?

212
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,370
Don't provoke me like this.

213
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,650
This whole situation now

214
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,820
is all thanks to your fine disciple.

215
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,850
You're not much better off than I am.

216
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,740
[Writing]

217
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,650
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

219
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,180
You turned things around in the palace exam.

220
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,460
You specially summoned me here

221
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,130
just to offer congratulations?

222
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,220
Yesterday, Imperial Physician Li sent someone over

223
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,650
and had the Frost Reed delivered.

224
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,100
So he has really found it?

225
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,530
With this key herb that can dispel all poisons,

226
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,130
your cold sickness

227
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,530
may finally be cured.

228
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,730
That's wonderful.

229
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,890
I've specially prepared a banquet

230
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,130
to celebrate for Your Majesty.

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,220
Thanks for your kindness,

232
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,460
but I still have matters to attend to.

233
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,650
I'll take my leave.

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,220
Your Majesty just can't wait

235
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,460
to share this good news

236
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,820
with the Empress, is that it?

237
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,980
That is between the Empress and me.

238
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,820
Mind your words.

239
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,530
In that case,

240
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,460
I wish Your Majesty

241
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,820
long life and endless blessings.

242
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,730
May you find joy,

243
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,060
find the one you love,

244
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,980
and never be lost in doubt again.

245
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,300
Madam,

246
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,060
don't let stray desires take root.

247
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,700
All of you, leave.

248
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,100
Yes, Madam.

249
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,380
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

250
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,460
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

251
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,090
Your Highness!

252
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,660
I want to go out.

253
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,380
If you won't let me out, fine.

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,940
How about this?

255
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,660
Pick one of you to stand right here

256
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,810
so I can "light a lantern" on him.

257
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,730
Please spare us!

258
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,010
What is the Princess up to now?

259
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,730
Commander Li,

260
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,220
you'll see once you're there.

261
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,700
Actually, we don't even need fire.

262
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,900
One of these days I'll sprinkle some powder on you,

263
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,730
and it'll burst into flame at night all on its own.

264
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,730
It'll be so much fun!

265
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,700
Spare us, Your Highness!

266
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,940
Your Highness.

267
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,940
Please stop causing trouble.

268
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,490
What?

269
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,330
Want to punish me by putting out the lights again?

270
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,220
I'm telling you, my brother is back.

271
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,980
I'm not scared anymore!

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,810
Forgive me.

273
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,460
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

274
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,570
You mustn't do that!

275
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,570
If my powder hadn't been destroyed,

276
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,940
you'd already be dead!

277
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,490
I have so many kinds of poison.

278
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,570
Deadly with just a touch!

279
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,420
Your Highness,

280
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,140
what are you trying to do?

281
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,490
Whatever you want me to do,

282
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,330
I'll do it.

283
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,140
Say it...

284
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,050
what do you want me to do?

285
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,530
I would like Your Highness

286
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,730
to spare my men

287
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,180
and go back to your chambers to rest.

288
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,700
Fine.

289
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,250
How long do I have to rest?

290
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,050
How about

291
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,810
you rest until tomorrow?

292
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,330
All right.

293
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,730
I'll go rest now.

294
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,050
See you tomorrow.

295
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,570
Finding you

296
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,290
makes me really happy.

297
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,420
Sir.

298
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,620
- Are you okay? - Are you alright?

299
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,810
What are you looking at?

300
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,810
Do I look that bad?

301
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,810
Am I poisoned or something?

302
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,860
Your Majesty,

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,940
this is the pear blossom honey Grand Tutor Ling brought today.

304
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,460
I added four spoonfuls, just as he ordered.

305
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,180
It really does smell sweet.

306
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,050
Whenever Father went away,

307
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,010
he would always bring me a gift,

308
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,900
like milk dates,

309
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,980
candied fruit,

310
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,050
mooncakes,

311
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,570
and this pear blossom honey.

312
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,420
He really dotes on Your Majesty.

313
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,810
His Majesty arrives!

314
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,810
It's so late.

315
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,570
What brings you here?

316
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,380
I've had two pieces of good news today,

317
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,010
so I wanted to come see my empress.

318
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,810
What good news?

319
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,250
There's hope for my cold sickness.

320
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,770
I no longer have to fear

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,860
that one day, I'll suddenly leave you behind.

322
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,570
What's wrong?

323
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,940
I'm not sure.

324
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,290
I just have a bit of a headache.

325
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,490
Here.

326
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,490
You're burning up.

327
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,730
I'll call the imperial physician to take a look.

328
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,860
I'm fine.

should I trust you one more time?

Your Majesty!

362
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,570
Someone, come quickly!

363
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

364
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,530
She has always been in good health.

365
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,250
How could she suddenly pass out?

366
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,460
Your Majesty,

367
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,940
Her Majesty

368
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,250
has been poisoned.

369
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,620
Poisoned?

370
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,660
How could the Empress be poisoned?

371
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,530
What kind of poison is it?

372
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,140
A vicious, rare toxin.

373
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,660
It's already entered Her Majesty's bloodstream.

374
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,660
Her temperature keeps dropping.

375
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,730
This poison

376
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,620
seems to be suppressing her heartbeat.

377
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,900
If this goes on,

378
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,290
Her Majesty will lose all body heat.

379
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,530
I'm afraid

380
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,860
in a few hours,

381
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,620
there will be no saving her.

382
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,730
How could she be poisoned

383
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,940
here in the inner palace?

384
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,010
She was perfectly fine just yesterday.

385
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,810
Speak!

386
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,090
Your Majesty,

387
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,490
aside from this toxin,

388
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,290
Her Majesty also seems to have taken

389
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,180
Lovesickness Powder.

390
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,050
Lovesickness Powder?

391
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,940
How do we cure it?

392
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,420
I think I've seen it before at Princess Ying's place.

393
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,620
Don't be afraid.

394
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,380
He said

395
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,660
I shouldn't make things hard for you,

396
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,860
so I won't.

397
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,380
I'll wait for him to come.

398
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,250
I knew it.

399
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,620
You were bound to come!

400
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,050
I warned you.

401
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,140
You can hate me, even kill me,

402
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,860
but you may not touch my empress.

403
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,530
Give me the antidote.

404
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,530
What antidote?

405
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,570
I'll say it one more time.

406
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,380
Give me the antidote!

407
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,050
Your Highness.

408
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,290
I've waited for you all day.

409
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,250
Hurry up and tell your master

410
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,900
that I didn't poison the Empress.

411
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,900
Xiao Ying,

412
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,530
I'm not joking with you.

413
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,770
Ying says she didn't.

414
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,140
Your Majesty,

415
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,980
what's going on?

416
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,700
You're not asking what really happened.

417
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,810
You're just lashing out.

418
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,810
Cangcang's poisoned.

419
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,330
The imperial physician says he's only seen it in the cold palace.

420
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,420
If Ying really used it,

421
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,010
would she deny it?

422
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,730
Every day she shouts about killing you.

423
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,090
Has she ever done something and not owned up to it?

424
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,770
There may be someone trying to frame her.

425
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,810
Your Highness,

426
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,530
the Empress's poison

427
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,420
really wasn't your doing?

428
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,860
You came by yesterday.

429
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,250
You told me to go rest, so I did.

430
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,250
I only just came here to wait for you.

431
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,530
How would I poison anyone?

432
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,940
Is that so?

433
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,380
Since noon yesterday,

434
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,770
Princess Ying hasn't taken a step out of the cold palace.

435
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,770
I stake my life on it.

436
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,980
After the Empress was poisoned,

437
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,860
her whole body turned cold

438
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,250
and the veins in her face went blue and purple.

439
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,140
What kind of poison is this?

440
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,460
Is there an antidote?

441
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,660
It sounds like...

442
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,010
Frostflower.

443
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,460
But I don't have an antidote.

444
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,050
I only brew poisons to kill you.

445
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,420
Why would I bother making antidotes?

446
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,250
Can you make one or not?

447
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,940
I already said there is no antidote.

448
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,180
Her temples have gone purple,

449
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,940
which means she'll be dead in a few hours.

450
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,330
Even if someone can make an antidote,

451
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,530
she won't live to see it.

452
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,090
Li Hongqing.

453
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:21,770
Here.

454
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,730
Go to Nanrong Palace at once.

455
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,380
Understood.

456
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,090
Your Majesty.

457
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,050
As for this matter,

458
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,810
you haven't told Preceptor Du, have you?

459
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,250
No.

460
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,140
Your Majesty...

461
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,570
Let go.

462
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,530
Imperial Physician Li has searched for ten years for it.

463
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,090
It's your lifesaving medicine.

464
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,050
Ten years, that's all.

465
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,770
I managed to wait before.

466
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,530
I can keep waiting now.

467
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,660
Your Majesty...

468
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,660
Go back.

469
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,290
You should know

470
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,900
that once I've made a decision,

471
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,900
no one can change it.

472
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,380
Your Majesty.

474
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,250
Xiaoshan,

475
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,980
grind this into powder,

476
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,010
mix it with water and bring it in.

477
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,810
I will use it to cleanse the poison from the Empress.

478
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

479
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,090
I'll go at once.

480
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,250
Commander Li took away the Frost Reed.

481
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,700
Is it because Imperial Physician Li is back?

482
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,180
Seems not.

483
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,570
Commander Li said

484
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,490
if you return,

485
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,900
you'd better go straight to Linghe Hall.

I'm not dead yet.

515
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,770
You can't afford to wait another ten years

516
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,220
for the Frost Reed.

517
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,620
There may still be hope.

518
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,050
From now on,

519
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,940
I will do exactly as you say.

520
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,530
I'll take the medicine and the needles

521
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,810
without so much as a frown.

522
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,810
Who did this?

523
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,980
I'll investigate at once.

524
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,700
No need.

525
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,860
At first, I thought it was Xiao Ying.

526
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,180
But when I returned to Linghe Hall

527
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,050
and checked everything carefully,

528
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,570
I understood.

529
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,780
This

530
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,690
is the pear blossom honey Cangcang has loved since childhood.

531
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,490
Yesterday,

532
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,570
Grand Tutor Ling sent it over.

533
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,210
And the poison

534
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,740
was hidden right inside it.

535
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,090
The imperial physician also said

536
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,210
that in what Cangcang was given,

537
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,860
there was not only a fatal toxin

538
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,130
but also Lovesickness Powder.

539
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,820
We found an important lead:

540
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,610
the cure for His Majesty's cold sickness,

541
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,380
the rare Frost Reed,

542
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,690
has finally been found.

543
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,470
If we lay the Lovesickness Powder and the poison

544
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,210
only on the very top layer of honey,

545
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,460
can you guarantee the honey beneath is clean?

546
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,780
I can, my lord.

547
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,650
I once trained under the Tang Clan.

548
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,740
I would never leave any trace behind.

549
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,820
You may rest assured.

550
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,380
This poison

551
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,530
was stolen from Princess Ying

552
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,420
by an undercover agent in the palace, wasn't it?

553
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,260
Yes.

554
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,900
I heard

555
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,860
His Majesty has already visited the cold palace

556
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,170
and seems to have cleared Princess Ying.

557
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,900
It doesn't matter.

558
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,610
With no solid proof,

559
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,050
even if His Majesty suspects something,

560
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,860
this case

561
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,300
can only be left hanging.

562
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,940
Speak.

563
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,530
My lord,

564
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,380
this Frostflower poison

565
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,490
is incredibly vicious.

566
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,610
If used carelessly, it could take a life.

567
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,820
Are you truly not worried about Young Lady?

568
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,820
If you had a daughter

569
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,170
who grew up fair and clever,

570
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,820
treasured like a pearl in your palm,

571
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,860
could you not worry,

572
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,340
not feel pain?

573
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,010
I've long since prepared the antidote.

574
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,340
In the last round,

575
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,650
I lost.

576
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,850
So I decided

577
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,490
to place one more bet.

578
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,340
I bet that someone else's feelings for Cangcang

579
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,820
run deeper

580
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,010
than mine.

581
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,210
He's gambling.

582
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,050
Word about the Frost Reed

583
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,420
must have leaked out.

584
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,260
He's betting

585
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,050
that I won't just stand by and watch Cangcang die,

586
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,570
that I'll definitely use the Frost Reed

587
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,090
to save her life.

588
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,980
And once I do,

589
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,050
I won't live much longer.

590
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,340
He can pin it all on Xiao Ying,

591
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,210
and even stir up strife between me and the Empress Dowager.

592
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,860
And after that,

593
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,740
if the Empress conceives my heir,

594
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,210
this round

595
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,420
really will be three birds with one stone.

596
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,690
As for this,

597
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,820
you already knew it

598
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,260
before treating the Empress?

599
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,050
This matter

600
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,690
cannot simply be let go!

601
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,530
Are you really going to wait

602
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,570
and let Ling Xuefeng become regent again one day?

603
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,940
You must not soften again.

604
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,690
If the Empress bears an heir,

605
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,820
Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.

606
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,010
As Grand Tutor Ling is now,

607
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,340
he's resorting to desperate measures.

608
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,980
[Linghe Hall]

609
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,010
You must not soften again.

610
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,260
If the Empress bears an heir,

611
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,300
Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.

612
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,340
You're awake.

613
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,420
What happened to me?

614
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,340
You were poisoned.

615
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,260
Poisoned?

616
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,690
Who did it?

617
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,260
The Empress Dowager?

618
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,570
It doesn't matter anymore.

619
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,570
What matters is,

620
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,690
the poison has been cleared.

621
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,650
People in this inner palace

622
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,530
are truly like beasts let loose.

623
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,420
What's wrong?

624
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,650
You look so grim.

625
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,460
Before the medicine cools,

626
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,900
hurry and drink it.

627
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,460
What kind of medicine is this?

628
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,780
Is it bitter?

629
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,260
Birth-control tea.

It's mixed by Preceptor Du.

It won't do your body much harm.
