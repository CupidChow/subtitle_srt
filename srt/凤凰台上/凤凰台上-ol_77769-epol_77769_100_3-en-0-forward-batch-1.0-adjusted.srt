00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
<i>She must be Ling Cangcang.</i>

3
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,000
<i>Huan always moves with a goal in mind.</i>

4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,280
<i>So he is after her.</i>

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,120
I've long admired Miss Ling,
your sect's leader,

6
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,080
and always wished to meet her,

7
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,040
but official duties kept me too busy.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,280
Busy with official duties?
Aren't you known for being quite idle?

9
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,680
You've actually met Miss Ling.

10
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,160
She was the one
who tattooed you last time.

11
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,920
With your sect's leader and you

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,880
both so brave and clever,

13
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
Mr. Bai here must be

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
no ordinary man either.

15
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,600
Naturally.

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Then why not have Mr. Bai

17
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,280
perform a sword dance

18
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,920
to enliven this gathering?

19
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,160
Your Highness,

20
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,280
I don't think that's necessary.

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,200
We're swordsmen, not…

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,720
Since Your Highness
wishes to be entertained,

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,480
I shall oblige.

24
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
Has Mr. Bai lost his mind?

25
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,200
How dare he swing at His Highness?

26
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,120
Does he have a death wish?

27
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
Do they have some kind of grudge?

28
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,200
His Highness is
Empress Dowager Liu's only son.

29
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,000
Even the Emperor
treads lightly around him.

30
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,240
Who would dare offend him?

31
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,760
Then Bai must be a man of integrity

32
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
who fears no authority.

33
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
You came all the way to Southern Chu.

34
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,520
You've made quite the effort to marry

35
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,920
the Grand Tutor's daughter.

36
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm merely traveling incognito.

37
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,080
You're overreacting.

38
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,000
Traveling incognito?

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,520
And you just happened
to come to my territory

40
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
and join Fenglai Pavilion?

41
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,120
All under heaven belongs to the Emperor.

42
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
If you've done nothing wrong, Qianqing,

43
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,280
why the unease?

44
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,640
Or have you just realized

45
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
there's corruption festering

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
in your domain?

47
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,880
<i>Why is the cold poison flaring now?</i>

48
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,200
Due to my clumsy swordsmanship,

49
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,600
I damaged Your Highness's flowers.

50
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,480
Please forgive me.

51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,880
Miss Zhong, Mr. Bai,

52
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,840
goodbye.

53
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,840
Your Highness,

54
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,080
the mine incident was
the Lingbi Sect's doing.

55
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,520
Please look into it.

56
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,280
Rest assured, Miss Zhong.

57
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,240
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

58
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,360
I'll investigate

59
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,880
this matter thoroughly.

60
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
If there's any progress,

61
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,640
Fenglai Pavilion will be
the first to know.

62
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,880
Good. Thank you, Your Highness.

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,720
If I manage to wipe out
the Lingbi Sect entirely,

64
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,320
I wonder how you will thank me, Mr. Bai.

65
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,240
Your Highness already rules over Chu

66
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,720
and has everything one could desire.

67
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,280
Surely there's nothing I can offer.

68
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,560
What if I do have a request?

69
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
What did he mean by that?

70
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,040
You're awake?

71
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,440
Where's Cangcang?

72
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,200
She's safe and sound.

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,960
The mine has been forced to shut down.

74
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,320
The Lingbi Sect suffered heavy losses.

75
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,760
The Grand Tutor is not pleased.

76
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,360
I failed to live up to Father's trust.

77
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,800
Fortunately, the mine owner is dead.

78
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,480
They won't be able
to trace anything useful.

79
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,600
But that man

80
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,720
won't give up so easily.

81
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,360
If he…

82
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,720
if he uses Cangcang…

83
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,360
Focus on your recovery.

84
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll take care of the rest.

85
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,440
PURE INTEGRITY

86
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,760
Shi Yan,

87
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,280
do you think slipping in
and out unseen is the only way

88
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
to live up to your title
as a Xiaoxing Guard?

89
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Your Majesty,
how did the cold poison flare up?

90
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
Hasn't Preceptor Du's medicine
always kept it under control?

91
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,120
Take this.

92
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,720
The medicine's run out.

93
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,160
You're out of medicine?

94
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,280
Why didn't Li Hongqing
send someone back to fetch more?

95
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,560
- How is he doing his job?
- It's not his fault.

96
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
Things have been hectic.

97
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
Have the miners been properly settled?

98
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
Li Hongqing and I

99
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,680
have already sent people
to escort them home.

100
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,200
But the number of miners we found

101
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,200
doesn't match the number reported missing.

102
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Could some have died in the mine?

103
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
We've counted all the bodies,

104
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
but the total still falls short by many.

105
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,240
Perhaps some escaped.

106
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,080
No one's been found
returning home on their own.

107
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,720
Then something else is going on here.

108
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,120
I'll keep investigating.

109
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,760
What about that masked young man
in the forest? Any leads?

110
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
I never saw him in my past contact
with the Lingbi Sect.

111
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,120
Despite several attempts to investigate,

112
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,040
I found no trace of him.

113
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,120
It seems the Lingbi Sect
is still growing stronger.

114
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,960
Shi Yan,

115
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,840
I have a new mission for you.

116
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
At your service.

117
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
Strengthen Fenglai Pavilion.

118
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,360
FENGLAI PAVILION

119
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,360
Bai.

120
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,880
You're up early.

121
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,360
You just promoted me to hall master.

122
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
Of course I should set an example

123
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,720
for the other disciples.

124
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
Looks like I didn't misjudge you.

125
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,360
Really?

126
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,560
Funny. As I recall, you used to keep me

127
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,600
well outside the door.

128
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Did I?

129
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,440
Well, life in the martial world
leaves one little room for trust.

130
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,600
You can never be too cautious.

131
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Bai, I admit it.

132
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,480
I once suspected you were my father's spy,

133
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
so I was wary of you.

134
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
Then I tricked you into posing
as the Prince of Yuzhang,

135
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,240
and you were injured

136
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,400
and even imprisoned.

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,960
That was my fault.

138
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
Bai Chifan, I apologize.

139
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,920
Bai… no,

140
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,080
Master Bai, Hall Master Bai,

141
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,880
thank you for not abandoning me in danger

142
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
and for sending people to
help Zhong Lin rescue those children.

143
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,080
Bai, I swear,

144
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,880
from now on, I'll see you
as my brother-in-arms at Fenglai Pavilion.

145
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,880
I'll never deceive you or doubt you again.

146
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,760
Hopeless.

147
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,480
You still won't forgive me?

148
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,040
You'd better find a new bookkeeper.

149
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
Here, take a look.

150
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
Since Fenglai Pavilion was founded
over a year ago,

151
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,120
we've run a deficit of 3,800 liang.

152
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,320
That's why you sighed?

153
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,760
Of course.

154
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,600
That's no big deal.

155
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,720
I'll just steal
a few of my father's paintings or antiques

156
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,040
and make up the loss. There are plenty.

157
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,720
That's not a long-term solution.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,120
Relax, Bai.

159
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,440
Fenglai Pavilion isn't short on money.

160
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,680
Besides,

161
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
we've got you, haven't we?

162
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,840
Miss Ling!

163
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,080
Miss Ling,
a big crowd has gathered outside.

164
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,880
They all want to join Fenglai Pavilion!

165
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,000
What?

166
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,320
FENGLAI PAVILION

167
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,240
What were you two talking about just now?

168
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,960
Nothing much.

169
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,440
Nothing much?

170
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,000
I doubt that.

171
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,840
You used to be so wary of him,

172
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,680
but now look at you,

173
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,000
making him a hall master
and calling his name nonstop.

174
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,920
Cangcang,

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,040
what exactly happened between you two?

176
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,360
I'll do all I can

177
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
so you won't have to act alone.

178
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,120
Really, nothing happened.

179
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,160
He saved my life.

180
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,520
Then we spent
one night together in prison.

181
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,800
One night?

182
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,000
And you call that nothing?

183
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,880
Don't tell me you plan
to repay him with your heart.

184
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,240
What are you…?

185
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,280
- Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
- You…

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,720
Don't you think he's

187
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,280
dashing,

188
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,520
charming,

189
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
and easy on the eye?

190
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,440
Not one bit.

191
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,880
I think he's

192
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
all appearance

193
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,160
and no substance. Absolutely repulsive.

194
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,880
Why do I feel

195
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,480
like his every move

196
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,400
carries a kind of…

197
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,960
A kind of duplicitous danger?

198
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,320
A kind of fatal charm.

199
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,760
You're hopeless!

200
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
My name is Shi Yan.
I specialize in the blade,

201
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,000
{\an8}especially the 72 Kunlun Swift Strikes.

202
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,320
{\an8}Cangcang, that man

203
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,920
is the one who helped us
rescue the children last time.

204
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,960
That's right. Greetings, Miss Ling.

205
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,200
Very well. You're in.

206
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Miss Ling,

207
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,320
shouldn't you think it over?

208
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
What's to think about?

209
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,880
He's Bai's man. I trust him.

210
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,280
Master, I led Fenglai Pavilion

211
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,200
to strike a heavy blow against
that inhumane Refinement Quarry.

212
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,640
We rescued all the children
who'd been taken there by force.

213
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,960
I know you mean to rid the world of evil,

214
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,720
but do you understand

215
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,720
how tangled the powers
behind that mine are?

216
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Of course.

217
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,520
They're all people from the Lingbi Sect.

218
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
I even saw

219
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
the Ghost King himself.

220
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,840
What is it, Master?

221
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
The Ghost King is dangerous.

222
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,400
Yes,

223
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,600
he's committed countless atrocities
and harmed so many people.

224
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,960
And guess what?

225
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,480
They didn't take those children

226
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
just to work as slaves.

227
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,400
They were turning
them into stone-like creatures.

228
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,840
There must be a greater plot behind it.

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,360
I hear Bai never leaves your side.

230
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,760
His ambitions may

231
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,800
well match the Ghost King's.

232
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,160
Did Zhong Lin say something to you?

233
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,000
I've looked into him.

234
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,760
His identity is false.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,040
I knew that already.

236
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,599
And you still trust him?

237
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,480
Everyone has their own burdens
and secrets.

238
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,720
Just because he hasn't told me the truth

239
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,240
doesn't mean he never will.

240
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
I can wait.

241
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,480
Besides,

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,880
I've kept my own identity from him too.

243
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,839
The human heart is unpredictable.

244
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,720
He's worked hard to get close to you.

245
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
He must have his own agenda.

246
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,800
Perhaps
it has to do with your other identity.

247
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,200
Time reveals all.

248
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,240
Whether he cares for me as
the Sect Leader of Fenglai Pavilion

249
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,200
or as the Grand Tutor's daughter,

250
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,760
I'll find out one day.

251
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Cangcang,

252
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,680
I know you've always been kind

253
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,040
and unwilling to see
the world through suspicion.

254
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,160
But remember, the only person

255
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,800
who loves you without reservation
is your father.

256
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,960
Even I, your master,
am not worthy of your full trust.

257
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,040
How could you say that?

258
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,680
If you hadn't saved me back then,

259
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,560
I would've been taken away and killed.

260
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,680
You saved my life.

261
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,800
If I can't trust you, who can I trust?

262
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,360
Enough, Cangcang.

263
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,680
Your father entrusted you to me,

264
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,680
so I must keep you safe.

265
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,680
Promise me

266
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,240
you'll keep your distance from Bai,
all right?

267
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,560
Now rest. I'll take my leave.

268
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Master…

269
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,000
I received word from
the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor

270
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
that His Highness released the Emperor

271
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
and started investigating the Lingbi Sect.

272
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,880
Sometimes,

273
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,360
I truly wonder what goes on

274
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,960
in my own son's head.

275
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,920
Please calm down, Your Majesty.
Anger will only harm your health.

276
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,160
How did I give birth
to such a stubborn child?

277
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,360
Instead of seizing
the opportunity to deal with Xiao…

278
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,040
he had to provoke the Lingbi Sect.

279
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,440
Does he know how powerful they are
in the martial world?

280
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,440
What a troublemaker.

281
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,120
- What should we do with the Emperor?
- At this point,

282
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,360
we'll have to take
matters into our own hands.

283
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,760
Bai.

284
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
FENGLAI PAVILION

285
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,200
Miss Ling, we've taken in

286
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,960
73 disciples over the past few days.

287
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,920
I've written down

288
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,600
all their details here for you to review.

289
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,640
Good. Bai, thanks for your hard work.

290
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,640
It's nothing.

291
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,520
Earning your trust is what matters.

292
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,760
I just got my hands
on two fine jars of wine.

293
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,000
It's the Lantern Festival.

294
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,360
Let's celebrate.

295
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Celebrate?

296
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,920
FENGLAI PAVILION

297
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,000
Here.

298
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,160
You're in quite the festive mood today.

299
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,840
Good wine should always
be shared with good friends.

300
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,760
Cheers.

301
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,680
Go on and try it.

302
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,960
Excellent wine.

303
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,880
Does it remind you of your hometown?

304
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,880
It's called Sangluo Wine.

305
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,480
"There we sit, sharing Sangluo Wine

306
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,960
and playing with chrysanthemum branches."

307
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,400
It's brewed by the Bai clan of Xiling.
Do you recognize it?

308
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,640
I suppose you've figured out

309
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,840
that I'm not from the Bai clan of Xiling,

310
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,040
yet you still treat me as a close friend.

311
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,840
As close friends,

312
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,720
we should be straightforward
with each other

313
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,640
rather than play tricks.

314
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
Very well.

315
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,720
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

316
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,120
I do

317
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,080
see you as a close friend.

318
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,480
But I still think you haven't
been entirely honest with me.

319
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,920
{\an8}For instance, I still don't know
who you really are.

320
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,680
What about you, Miss Ling?

321
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,600
Will you tell me your true identity?

322
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,440
That's not the same.

323
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
I have secrets I cannot speak of.

324
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,520
How do you know

325
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,080
I have no secrets I must keep?

326
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
I…

327
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Since we both carry secrets
we cannot share,

328
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
we are not so different after all.

329
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,520
Someone told me

330
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
you got close to me with a plan.

331
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,720
Or perhaps…

332
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,120
Perhaps what?

333
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,040
Nothing.

334
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,400
Who said I meant you harm?

335
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,680
Someone I trust.

336
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,640
Have I ever harmed Fenglai Pavilion?

337
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
Have I ever hurt you?

338
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,640
Then I suppose

339
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,320
my master is suspicious of you

340
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,240
because he doesn't know you well enough.

341
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,840
So it was your master.

342
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,640
As distance tests a horse's strength,

343
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,960
time reveals a person's heart.

344
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,920
You need not trust me now.

345
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,880
Just…

346
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,400
Bold fools,

347
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
how dare you break into Fenglai Pavilion?

348
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
You go first. I'll handle them.

349
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,160
We'll fight together.

350
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,760
Look out!

351
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,160
Assassins!

352
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,160
Bai, are you all right?

353
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,520
- Let's go.
- Seize them!

354
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,280
Be careful.

355
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,720
Bai.

356
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,280
Bai?

357
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,760
Bai?

358
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,160
Somebody!

359
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,440
Hurry! Get a physician!

360
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,840
Go after them!

361
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,560
Stop him!

362
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,640
It was a suicide mission.
They all had poison in their mouths.

363
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,760
Sir, how is he?

364
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,720
I've never seen
such a complicated pulse before.

365
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,880
What do you mean?

366
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,480
The poison has invaded
his internal organs.

367
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,960
He won't live long.

368
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,480
Now that he's lost so much blood,

369
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,000
his pulse should be weak.

370
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,280
- But…
- But what?

371
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,720
But his pulse is still strong and steady.

372
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
Then why hasn't he woken up?

373
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,560
That's what baffles me.

374
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,720
You said the poison had

375
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,640
reached his internal organs.
What does that mean?

376
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,720
Judging by his pulse,

377
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,040
he's suffering from cold poison.

378
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,240
It must have been
in his body for over ten years.

379
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,440
Impossible.

380
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,120
He seemed perfectly fine,

381
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,720
and his martial skills are extraordinary.

382
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
How could that be?

383
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,280
Then it makes sense.

384
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,400
His martial arts training has allowed him

385
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,560
to keep the poison
in check with inner force.

386
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,080
That's why his pulse
remains strong despite the blood loss.

387
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,200
He must have been taking
an antidote regularly.

388
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,720
Antidote?

389
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,520
What is this?

390
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
A life-saving medicine.

391
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,360
He gave me his last pill.

392
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,760
Then you must find him
another one at once.

393
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,240
Shi Yan must know about the antidote.

394
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960
- Hurry. Get Shi Yan here.
<i>- Got it.</i>

395
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,000
Shi Yan!

396
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,560
- Do you have Hall Master Bai's antidote?
- What happened to him?

397
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,600
He fainted.

398
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,800
The physician said he needed the antidote.

399
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,200
I'll be right back.

400
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Bai, you fool.

401
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,120
That antidote was meant
to save your own life,

402
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,840
yet you gave it to me.

403
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,680
You risked your life for me
again and again,

404
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,920
yet I still doubted you.

405
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,880
Master only grew suspicious of you

406
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,600
because he didn't know you.

407
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,560
But deep down,
I'd already come to trust you.

408
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,360
I shouldn't have tested you.

409
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,480
It was my fault.

410
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,280
You haven't even heard my apology yet,

411
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,200
so you can't die.

412
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,120
Please, wake up soon.

413
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,840
Please, wake up soon.

414
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,280
Cangcang,

415
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,440
what's wrong?

416
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,720
Bai,

417
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,520
you're really awake.

418
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
You've been crying?

419
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,040
I…

420
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,600
I haven't.

421
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,320
I was just a little scared.

422
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,520
Don't worry.

423
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,360
It'll take more than this to kill me.

424
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
I had a dream.

425
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,080
In it, I was wandering near death's door.

426
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,600
Then suddenly, someone called my name.

427
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,120
When I turned around,

428
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,760
I saw that it was you,
crying your eyes out.

429
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,000
I couldn't help but laugh.

430
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,560
Then I woke up.

431
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,920
You're making fun of me
at a time like this?

432
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,040
Did I hurt you?

433
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,040
I'm fine.

434
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,360
You were worried about me?

435
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,360
Of course.

436
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,560
When I got sick as a child,

437
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,840
my father would stay up all night
by my bedside too.

438
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,000
Are you close to your father?

439
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,920
My mother passed away
when I was very young.

440
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,040
Father raised me on his own.

441
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Then how could he allow you

442
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,080
to wander the martial world alone?

443
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,560
Because I have my master.

444
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,960
No wonder your master's words
carry such weight.

445
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Bai,

446
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,000
my master only doubts you

447
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,200
because he doesn't know you.

448
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,200
Don't worry.

449
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,920
I'll make sure

450
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,840
he trusts you

451
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,040
as much as I do, all right?

452
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,840
Now, get some more rest.

453
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,320
I'll go check on the antidote.

454
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,880
Wait.

455
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,200
Did you get the antidote?

456
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,040
The Imperial Preceptor just made it.
Why the rush?

457
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,080
His Majesty's cold poison has flared up.

458
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,000
How could that happen?

459
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,400
It's complicated. Let's head back first.

460
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,560
You're in this condition
and still planning to go out?

461
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,360
I'm going to take Cangcang away.

462
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
In your state,

463
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,920
even if you see her, what can you do?

464
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Cangcang is naive and easily deceived.

465
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm taking her back to the Capital.

466
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,760
Whether by deceit or by force,

467
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,120
I'm taking her back.

468
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,240
The Lingbi Sect's affair
is what matters most right now.

469
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,440
If they really uncover something,

470
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,000
how should we answer to the master?

471
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,840
Father ordered me to protect Cangcang.

472
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,800
If anything happens to her,

473
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,840
how will I face him?

474
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,120
Are you doing this
for your adoptive father's sake

475
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,520
or for your own?

476
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,440
You know the answer better than I do.

477
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,600
So Your Majesty
gave the antidote to Miss Ling.

478
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,200
I failed to notice

479
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Your Majesty's relapse earlier.
I deserve punishment.

480
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,400
I've had this cold poison since birth.

481
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,320
After all these years, I'm used to it.

482
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,040
Have you traced the assassins?

483
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,800
I let one escape on purpose

484
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,400
and sent the Xiaoxing Guards after him.

485
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,560
He eventually turned up

486
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,280
at the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

487
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,640
The Prince of Yuzhang's Manor?

488
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,240
Your Majesty,

489
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
we may have found a clue
about the murder thralls at the mine.

490
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,560
What is it?

491
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,760
The Botang Pleasure Boat.

492
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,000
- The Botang Pleasure Boat?
- The Botang Pleasure Boat

493
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,280
is not that well-known,
but I've heard of it.

494
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,640
Despite its name,
it offers no pleasure of that sort.

495
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,960
Rare and valuable items are
auctioned there. It's highly exclusive.

496
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,680
It's said that one must have

497
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
a special invitation to board.

498
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,960
Zhong Lin can handle that.

499
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,000
I want to see it for myself.

500
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,560
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

501
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,600
You still haven't

502
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,280
found the Ghost King?

503
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,240
What have you all been doing?

504
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
At this rate,

505
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
when will you catch him

506
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,280
and root out the Lingbi Sect?

507
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,840
Make the Ghost King
show himself in three days,

508
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,400
- or bring me your heads!
- Understood!

509
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,720
Your Highness,
Bai Chifan from Fenglai Pavilion

510
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,120
just sent word.

511
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,920
What is it?

512
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,560
Three words: Botang Pleasure Boat.

513
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,239
<i>Why does he</i>

514
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,440
<i>look different today?</i>

515
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,000
<i>Was he always like this?</i>

516
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,480
Good morning, Miss Ling.

517
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,040
Good morning.

518
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,320
Are you feeling better?

519
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,880
Much better.

520
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,760
Thank you
for taking care of me last night.

521
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,560
After all, you were hurt because of me.

522
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,200
It's only right that I look after you.

523
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,200
Why do you seem different today?

524
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,760
So uneasy.

525
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,440
Do I?

526
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,880
- Is it because of last night…?
- No!

527
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,080
What?

528
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,880
I…

529
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,000
I…

530
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,160
I feel a little dizzy.

531
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,920
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

532
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,480
I should go.

533
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,600
Your pulse is racing.

534
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,160
That's not quite normal.

535
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,400
But your complexion doesn't look like
that of someone ill.

536
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,200
Is something bothering you?

537
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,120
How about I take you out

538
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,160
for some fresh air?

539
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,120
Hurry, honey.

540
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,960
I heard the boat had a Harmony Chamber,

541
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,920
and only couples are allowed inside.

542
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,040
A trip on this boat
without a fair lady for company

543
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,080
- would be a waste indeed.
- It'll be a sleepless night.

544
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,560
A night of romance…

545
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,560
- Wait.
- …is what makes the trip worthwhile.

546
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,200
Why did you bring me here
dressed like this?

547
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,720
Look around.

548
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,120
Isn't it obvious what we're here for?

549
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Then I'm not going.

550
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,120
You can't back out now.

551
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,680
Everything's ready. Only you're missing.

552
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
What?

553
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,240
Yes, I've roamed the martial world
and care little for rules,

554
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,520
but I'm not that kind of girl.

555
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,000
What does that have to do
with rescuing missing youths?

556
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,280
What missing youths?

557
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,400
The number of rescued miners didn't match
the missing count.

558
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,960
I suspect many were sold here.

559
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,360
That's why I invited you along.

560
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,480
Anything wrong with that?

561
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,120
Nothing.

562
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Let's go, then.

563
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,480
You two look unfamiliar.

564
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,200
First time aboard?

565
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,000
A green haitang blossom?

566
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,440
Distinguished guests indeed.

567
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Sir and madam, this way, please.

568
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,400
Sir and madam?

569
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,320
After you, honey.

570
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,920
The boat is setting sail!

571
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,280
Setting sail? Why?

572
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,240
You truly are newcomers.

573
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,480
The boat sails to open waters

574
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,480
before trading begins.

575
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,400
<i>Once it's out at sea,</i>

576
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,160
<i>Shi Yan's men on shore</i>

577
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,840
<i>will be of no use.</i>

578
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,000
Sir and madam, come.

579
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,520
- Look at his fan.
- I know.

580
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,320
- Isn't that…?
- He looks

581
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,560
so dignified.

582
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,840
Who would've thought?

583
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,840
What a pity.

584
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,880
- Who would've thought?
- Exactly.

585
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,840
Let's go.

586
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,600
- Did you see that?
- A green haitang blossom!

587
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,520
Did you see it?

588
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,800
- Yes, I saw it.
- What do the different colors

589
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,760
- even mean?
- I have no idea.

590
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,080
Everyone's staring at us.

591
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,000
Zhong Lin said she saw an invitation
with a green haitang blossom,

592
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,320
so she made one just like it.

593
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Maybe we should slip away while we can.

594
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,480
Come, honey.

595
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,680
I'm not your honey.

596
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,520
If we're acting,
we should make it convincing.

597
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,120
Don't forget why we're here, honey.

598
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,840
Sir and madam,

599
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,680
this way, please.

600
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,600
Let's go, honey.

601
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,480
Please come in.

602
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,240
Come on, honey.

603
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,160
Sit.

604
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,640
Playing the loving couple
in the Green Haitang Chamber?

605
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,680
Aren't you tired?

606
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,600
Xiaoyang, mind your tongue.

607
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,160
They're guests. Serve them tea.

608
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,320
What would you like?

609
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
That depends on what you have to offer.

610
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,840
Tiger, snake,
and lion parts, dragon pills,

611
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,880
invincibility pills,
prepared salt, and stink bugs.

612
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
As long as you can pay,

613
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,640
we have whatever you desire.

614
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,640
And how brave you are, sir.

615
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,600
We rarely see male guests
in the Green Haitang Chamber.

616
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,640
- Did you see that?
- A green haitang blossom!

617
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,080
- Did you see that?
- He looks dashing.

618
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,480
- Who would've thought?
- Exactly.

619
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,280
Such a shame.

620
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,200
You don't understand what's going on.

621
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,080
Keep quiet. Let me handle this.

622
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Now, that's not very nice to say.

623
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,920
My husband and I share true affection.

624
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,560
I won't despise him
just because he's frail.

625
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,400
No matter what happens to him,

626
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
- I'll love him all the same.
- How touching.

627
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,040
For such devotion,

628
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,560
I'll give you a discount.

629
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,120
Here's the thing, madam.

630
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,160
Ordinary medicine

631
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,440
doesn't work

632
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,680
on my husband.

633
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,640
Then what are you saying, madam?

634
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,120
I mean,

635
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,880
on a grand pleasure boat like this,

636
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,080
surely there are other chambers
that can help him.

637
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,360
The red, yellow, and blue
haitang chambers.

638
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,640
What are they all for?

639
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,880
Besides medicine, what else can we try?

640
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,800
Do you look down on my chamber?

641
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,360
Not at all.

642
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,360
I don't doubt
the quality of your goods, madam.

643
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,600
It's…

644
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,200
it's my husband's body I don't trust.

645
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,640
Say something, my love.

646
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,840
All these years, has any medicine

647
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,440
worked for you?

648
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
Well,

649
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,800
none so far.

650
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,600
Madam, you heard him.

651
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,920
Please, help us.

652
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,840
Let us enter the other types of chambers.

653
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,160
Sir and madam, please leave.

654
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,080
Go that way.

655
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,680
A boat will take you ashore.

656
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,360
Don't you claim to fulfill
every wish here?

657
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,800
Why drive us out simply for not buying
your medicine?

658
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,000
That's how
the Botang Pleasure Boat operates.

659
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
If you refuse to leave,

660
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,920
you'll be thrown overboard
to feed the fish.

661
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,080
Don't make this hard.

662
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,880
<i>If we're thrown out now,</i>
<i>this trip will be for nothing.</i>

663
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,800
<i>I know.</i>

664
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,080
<i>As Sect Leader of Fenglai Pavilion,</i>

665
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,080
<i>I won't take this lying down.</i>

666
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,240
Go.

667
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,280
Wait.

668
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,720
Those

669
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,400
animal parts, dragon pills, and whatnot.

670
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,880
We'll buy them.

671
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,520
My love,

672
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,640
get… get the money.

673
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,520
In that case, sir and madam,
please follow me.

674
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,320
Sir and madam,

675
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,280
follow me.

676
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,480
Sir and madam, upstairs, please.

677
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,400
Can't we go in there?

678
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,720
We have an invitation.

679
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,280
Please, go upstairs
to the Green Haitang Chamber.

680
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,680
This young lady is a distinguished guest.
