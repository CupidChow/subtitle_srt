All the poisons have already been destroyed.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,540
Why then does the Begonia Pendant still react so strangely?

25
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,410
Could it be that there are still other toxins hidden within the palace?

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,660
Princess Ying's mind is unclear.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,980
Her words cannot be taken as truth.

28

00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,930
Your Highness,

30
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,770
I mean no disrespect.

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,290
It is by His Majesty's command.

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,100
Should a single lamp be lit in this cold palace,

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,130

50
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,260
I brought you osmanthus and red bean dumplings.

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,260
After you eat them,

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,690
you should go to sleep early.

53
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,290

54
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,060

55
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,140
Then do you want to eat them?

56
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,250
When I've killed them all,

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,730
then I'll eat.

58
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,340
Kill whom?

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,220
Why don't you help me,

60
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,410
and kill them all?

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,850
Mother, this teacup is exquisite.

Fine porcelain,

63
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,730
so clear and delicate.

Ying's illness

65
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,730
has always come and gone.

66
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,170
After much effort to nurse her,

67
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,460
her confusion still outweighs her clarity.

68
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,490
That Xiao Huan

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,250
is determined to take our lives!

70
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,850
Mother.

71
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,900
Ying gave poison to the Empress,

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,020
and attempted to assassinate His Majesty.

73
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,580
She was only punished by ten days without lighting a lamp.

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,610
That punishment is already merciful enough.

75
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,610
Ying has never been of sound mind.

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,340
But why did she become this way?

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,610
You know the reason well.

78
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,460
Had it not been for that great fire at Luling Palace back then,

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,100
when Xiao Huan abandoned her,

80
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,540
she would never have been so deeply scarred.

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,580
Then

82
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,780
why did Luling Palace suddenly burn for no reason?

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,980
What do you mean by that?

84
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,490
You are my own flesh and blood,

85
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,130
the child I carried for ten months,

86
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,140
born through hardship and pain.

87
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,700
Do you not know why,

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,100
or for whom, I have done all this?

89
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,730
So Mother has always known

90
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,170
the truth behind Ying's madness,

91
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,020
yet chose never to tell her,

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,900
encouraging her instead to resent His Majesty.

93
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,140
Is this, Mother,

94
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,460
what you call love for me and Ying?

95
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,660
So,

96
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,660
it is because of your sister's matter

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,020
that you have borne a grudge against me all this time.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,660
You were in Southern Chu for so many years,

99
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,410
yet not once did you send a letter home.

100
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,140
Whatever I asked you to do,

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,610
you brushed aside carelessly,

102
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,540
and even

103
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,580
stood against me.

104
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,140
Mother.

105
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,050
You speak too harshly.

106
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,610
Does it hurt?

107
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,340
It does not.

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,020
Mother,

109
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,140
please be at ease.

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,250
Now that I have returned,

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,410
I shall protect you and my sister with all that I am.

112
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,410
I will never let either of you suffer again.

113
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,580
The injustice Ying endured,

114
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,540
I will never forget.

115
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,580
Well?

116
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,610
Did you meet His Majesty?

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,460
Does that mean I can stop practicing?

118
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,300
Look at me,

119
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,820
do I look like I've met him?

120
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,460
Then what should we do?

121
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,300
His Majesty could summon Song Lanxi at any moment.

122
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,610
He values him so highly.

123
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,960
Even if I practice until I'm perfect,

124
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,850
the moment His Majesty sees the real one, I'll be exposed.

125
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,180
His Majesty

126
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,980
is gravely ill now.

127
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,820
He is unlikely to grant an audience for the time being.

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,700
As for you,

129
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,010
put your mind to practicing your calligraphy first.

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,220
We'll talk once you've fooled the officials in the Capital.

131
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,370
Come,

132
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,490
show me.

133
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,770
Your writing

134
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,460
does resemble his,

135
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,130
yet it still lacks spirit.

136
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,370
Anyone who has seen Song Lanxi's true work

137
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,820
will see through it at a glance.

138
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,490
Song Lanxi

139
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,580
is a master of calligraphy.

140
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,490
A four chi scroll of his sells for more than a hundred liang of silver.

141
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,340
How could that be copied so easily?

142
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,420
At the start, you insisted

143
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,370
on accompanying me to the Capital.

144
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,530
You boasted

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,420
as if nothing were beyond your ability.

146
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,180
I said I wished to go to the Capital with you,

147
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,650
but did I say I meant to impersonate Song Lanxi?

148
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,300
If you think my writing is poor,

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,180
do it yourself if you can.

150
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,650

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,300

For the Grand Tutor's kindness to me,

182
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,980
I would give my body and soul,

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,100
and repay it fully.

184
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,490

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,060
She claimed she was going to the Summer Palace,

192
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,420
but went to the Sword Cottage instead.

193
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,300
It seems

194
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,180
her visit to the Sword Cottage isn't simple.

195
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,770
Then Father means...

196
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,650
Regarding Li Lu's death,

197
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,340
she has never let it go.

198
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,820
How is the truth

199
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,690
she seeks coming along?

200
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,990
Master.

201
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,430
I miss you.

202
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,580
The longer I stay in the palace,

203
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,300
the more I miss the carefree days I had here.

204
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,490
But you're gone.

205
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,940
Xiao Huan won't even give me a reason.

206
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,700
Master,

207
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,420
what exactly were you all hiding from me?

208
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,420
The imperial family is heartless,

209
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,010
yet Xiao Huan keeps helping me.

210
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,060
Why is that?

211
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,490
Why did you kill my master?

212
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,610
I promised him

213
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,700
I wouldn't tell you.

214
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,610
What did you say?

215
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,250
What aren't you allowed to tell me?

216
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,460
What are you all hiding from me?

217
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,490
You're back, little glutton.

218
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,340
What do you want to eat?

219
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,770
I will make it for you.

220
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,580
Master, is it ready?

221
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,340
What gift are you giving me?

222
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,300
You may open your eyes now.

223
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,890
What a beautiful pendant.

224
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,250
This is a protector I give you.

225
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,250
You must keep it with you from now on.

226
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,220
Well?

227
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,100
Do you like it?

228
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,130
I do.

229
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,850
Father never remembers my birthday.

230
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,100
Master is much better than Father.

231
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,180
Thank you, Master.

232
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,490
I really like it.

233
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,890
As long as you like it.

234
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,820
Master,

235
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,730
can you tell me

236
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,100
why Xiao Huan

237
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,580
had to kill you?

238
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,300
Who?

239
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,650
Luo.

240
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,010
Cangcang.

241
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,490
Speak.

242
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,250
Why are you here?

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,100
I came to pay my respects too,

244
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,770
to share a drink with him.

245
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,580
But Master never drank Bamboo Leaf Green.

246
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,370
Are you really here to pay respects?

247
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,700
Cangcang,

248
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,370
Father

249
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,980
was worried about you.

250
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,370
Luo,

251
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,420
do you still remember this pendant?

252
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,700
This Begonia Pendant

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,770
was given to me by Master.

254
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,250
He said it would keep me safe.

255
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,730
I remember.

256
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,490
I only learned recently

257
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,300
that it is a treasure beyond price.

258
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,050
With it on me,

259
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,990
no poison can get close.

260
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,010
Master was protecting me all along.

261
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,140
But I do not even know why he died.

262
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,930
I do not even know why he died!

263
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,780
Am I that useless?

264
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,730
Cang...

265
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,060
Cangcang.

266
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,900
I remember when I was little,

267
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,780
I loved leaning against this forge.

268
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,380
No matter how cold it was outside,

269
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,860
it was always warm here.

270
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,820
Tell me,

271
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,250
when have you ever approached me

272
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,380
without a purpose?

273
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,340
No, My Lady.

274
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,930
It was Father...

275
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,250
Master forged the Rex Sword for you

276
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,930
and you used that very sword to kill him.

277
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,780

I remember it being so warm here last night.

How come this morning, now that the sun is out,

335
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,490
it's suddenly chilly?

336
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,540
I remember there was a cellar at home once,

337
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,690

Cangcang.

342
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,100
Could it be

343
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,730
there's a cellar here too?

344
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,970
Let's look.

It's so cold.

Why is the wind so strong?

349
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,250
Could it be

350
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,900
there's a cellar underneath,

351
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,970
connected to Sword Cottage?

352
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,010
Take out the sword.

353
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,650
I didn't expect Master

354
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,650
had hidden a place like this.

355
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,820

356
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,210
These belong to Tang.

357
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,250
Every time I mentioned Tang,

358
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,540
Master would say it was in the past.

359
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,340
But in his heart,

360
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,100
he never really let go.

361
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,690
This is...

362
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,650
This isn't Master's wife.

363
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,900
I remember how she looked,

364
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,900
round-faced,

365
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,010

366
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,860
Then this...

367
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,650
How could her portrait be here with Master?

368
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,170

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,490

381
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,410
Secret art...

382
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,380
This is the secret art of the Ghost King of the Lingbi Sect.

383
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,340
Could it be that Mr. Li Lu is...

384
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,140
Impossible.

385
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,900
I don't believe it!

386
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,780
How many days has the Empress been away?

387
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,210
Report to Your Majesty,

388
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,410
it's been fewer than five days.

389
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,100
Any news?

390
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,970
None that I've heard.

391
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,620
Your Majesty.

392
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,930
Has the Empress sent any word back?

393
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,620
Her Majesty's letters are not here,

394
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,140
but there are a few of Mr. Song Lanxi's writings

395
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,410
that leaked from the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

396
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,300
Why would Song Lanxi be staying in the manor?

397
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,930
He said he was injured on the road

398
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,300
and needed to recuperate at the manor.

399
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,300
I have received some good news.

400
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,620
Though perhaps not entirely good news.

401
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,100
Some bad...

402
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,340
Though not exactly bad.

403
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,620
What news?

404
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,250
His Majesty just issued an order:

405
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,490
Because he is seriously ill,

406
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,060
the final imperial exam is postponed.

407
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,580
It's good news.

408
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,380
But I wonder,

409
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,210
could it be

410
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,170
because he discovered something?

411
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,540
Impersonating Song Lanxi in the Capital is a capital offense.

412
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,650
I am also complicit.

413
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,250
Naturally, I shall protect you.

414
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,620
If you want to go, go yourself.

415
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,410
I'm not going.

416
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,730
After Ling Cangcang entered the palace,

417
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,490
the first gift she received...

418
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,780
Do you know what it was?

419
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,930
What was it?

420
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,490
A finger

421
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,300
of her adoptive brother, Luo Xianxue.

422
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,730
So,

423
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,140
you may not trust me.

424
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,900
Between us,

425
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,970
there is no common interest.

426
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,100
However,

427
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,410
we share a common enemy.

428
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,300
Then what should we do?

429
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,650
If he discovers I'm impersonating Song Lanxi,

430
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,860
you must save me.

431
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,900
Your Highness,

432
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,300
Mr. Xu Feng, requests an audience.

433
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,210
Which Mr. Xu?

434
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,900
No.

435
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,210
He is a student of Mr. Ling Xuefeng.

436
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,730
Ling Xuefeng?

437
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,210
What should we do?

438
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,540
Your Highness,

439
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,730
I heard that Mr. Song Lanxi has been ill for a long time,

440
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,930
and Grand Tutor Ling is very concerned.

441
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,210
This is Physician Liu, a miraculous healer.

442
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,970
Grand Tutor specifically sent him here

443
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,930
to diagnose Mr. Song.

444
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,170
To be honest,

445
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,540
Mr. Song's condition is indeed serious.

446
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,930
To be precise,

447
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,900
on the way here,

448
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,580
he was attacked by assassins,

449
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,210
and the injuries were severe.

450
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,820
Then, in that case,

451
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,250
please summon Mr. Song.

452
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,300
Mr. Song,

453
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,690
have you disguised yourself?

454
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,780
Mr. Song was severely injured on the head and neck

455
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,780
when on the way to the Capital.

456
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,690
His vocal cords were damaged,

457
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,270
and he cannot speak for now.

458
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,060
Since the injuries are severe,

459
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,930
Physician Liu,

460
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,140
please take care of him.

461
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,820
Yes.

462
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,210
Mr. Song was attacked in the night,

463
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,340
and was greatly frightened.

464
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,820
Since then, he has refused any physical contact with others.

465
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,930
Mr. Song,

466
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,170
I have admired you for a long time.

467
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,250
Your calligraphy is renowned throughout the land.

468
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,540
Now that I see you,

469
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,060
I wonder if you might grant me a few characters.

470
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,970
This...

471
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,210
Mr. Song's calligraphy was already circulated yesterday.

472
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,780
Why

473
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,710
can't he display it publicly today?

474
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,060
Xu Feng,

475
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,620
you are taking this too far!

476
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,820
But

477
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,930
since you are Grand Tutor Ling's student,

478
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,690
I naturally have to

479
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,730
show him some respect.

480
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,410
Mr. Song,

481
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,540
what do you think?

482
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,970
Someone,

483
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,490
bring ink and brushes.

484
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,420
[Wuying Hall]

485
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,540
[Calligraphy of Song Lanxi]

486
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,170
Song Lanxi has always been modest.

487
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,620
Why has so much calligraphy been circulated?

488
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,970
It is said that too many people came to request his writing,

489
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,300
and Prince of Yuzhang had no choice

490
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,860
but to ask Mr. Song to comply.

491
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,450
I doubt it.

492
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,380
Your Majesty, what seems off?

493
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,450
Along the way,

494
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,380
there were too many strange things.

495
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,490
Since Your Majesty is doubtful,

496
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,690
then when the Prince of Yuzhang came to request an audience a few days ago,

497
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,100
why didn't you ask directly?

498
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,820
I had just punished Xiao Ying,

499
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,490
and if I saw him now,

500
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,410
wouldn't it only cause trouble?

501
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,930
After all this time, unable to master a single character of Xi.

502
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,970
Your Highness.

503
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,820
[Take care of yourself]

504
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,140
[Take care of yourself, Song Lan]

00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,450
Song Lanxi of the Western Garden in Guzhou,

506
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,220
a character worth a thousand gold coins.

507
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:25,820
This writing

508
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,300
is now given to you.

509
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,930
Since that's the case,

510
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,490
I wish Mr. Song

511
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,050
a speedy recovery.

512
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,740
Your Highness,

513
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,930
I

514
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,260
take my leave.

515
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,970
I'm suffocating.

516
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,090
No.

517
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,660
I nearly died of fright!

518
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,180
If Xu Feng found out, I'd be finished!

519
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,010
If I'm caught impersonating an imperial official,

520
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,050
how many heads do I have for Xiao Huan to chop off?

521
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,180
I can't believe you even know that!

522
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,010
How dare you let Zhong Lin impersonate Song Lanxi?

523
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,820
Song Lanxi was assassinated by your father-in-law.

524
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,180
If I hadn't done it,

525
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,300
how could I have kept it from him?

526
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,260
Kept it from him,

527
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,570
or kept it from me?

528
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,340
As soon as I returned, I came straight to the palace

529
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,530
to confess to you.

530
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,130
But you refused to see me.

531
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,970
I haven't yet punished you for failing to protect him,

532
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,930
and you blame me instead.

533
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,010
Fine.

534
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,050
Fine.

535
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,450
Then please punish me, Your Majesty.

536
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,130
It would be best

537
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,260
to punish Zhong Lin's crime along with mine.

538
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,130
Are you trying to use Zhong Lin to threaten me?

539
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,700
I wouldn't dare.

540
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,010
Zhong Lin is just a commoner.

541
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
How could she possibly threaten Your Majesty?

542
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,050
But I heard

543
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,260
that the Empress misses her dearly.

544
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,860
Then you will bear

545
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,130
Zhong Lin's crime.

546
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,380
Your Highness,

547
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,180
you just saw for yourself.

548
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,450
Ling Xuefeng's people already believe

549
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,010
that Song Lanxi is living safely in my manor.

550
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,820
If you punish me now,

551
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,450
wouldn't that

552
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,820
cause pain to loved ones

553
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,570
and joy to enemies?

554
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,260
So

555
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,660
this is your plan.

556
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,380
You're using Ling Xuefeng to pressure me.

557
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,220
I wouldn't dare.

558
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,530
If Ling Xuefeng knew that Song Lanxi was dead,

559
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,740
it would benefit neither of us.

560
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,660
Why not maintain the lie together?

561
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,380
You truly have a lot of nerve.

562
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,900
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

563
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,260
I am trembling with fear.

564
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,260
Having me cover the lie for you

565
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,790
is not entirely impossible.

566
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,850
But you must do one thing for me in return.

567
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,860
What is it?

568
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,490
Have you heard of

569
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,660
Li Chengtian?

570
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,050
Li Chengtian?

571
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,860
He was once a senior minister in the court.

572
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,700
After losing to Ling Xuefeng,

573
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,010
he retired to the countryside.

574
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,300
Yet his name remains illustrious among the gentry.

575
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,050
Many upright officials in the court were his students.

576
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,220
Song Lanxi was also his student.

577
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,930
Indeed.

578
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,700
Your Majesty is truly cunning and strategic.

579
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,610
So Song Lanxi

580
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,260
was merely a lure to draw out Li Chengtian.

581
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,260
Ling Xuefeng killed his beloved student.

582
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,450
What would he feel?

583
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,410
Your Majesty intends for me to summon Master Li out of retirement.

584
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,700
What do you think?

585
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:12,340
[Take care, Song Lan]

586
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,700
Greetings, Father.

587
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,860
Song Lanxi is not dead.

588
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,940
Impossible.

589
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,640
I personally struck him down.

590
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,100
[Take care, Song Lan]

591
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,260
This is Song Lanxi's calligraphy.

592
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,570
Since you personally attacked him,

593
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,130
there must be hidden circumstances.

594
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,300
I will investigate further.

595
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,300
Get up.

596
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,340
All traces of Li Lu's interactions with us

597
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,410
should be cleared away.

598
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,670
Rest assured, Father.

599
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,450
Everything has been properly handled.

600
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,880
But...

601
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,160
I know you cannot bear it.

602
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,970
And as a father, neither can I.

603
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,860
Yet this is the truth she most wishes to know.

604
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,410
It is also what she must face.

605
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,130
But Young Lady refuses to believe that Li Lu is the Ghost King,

606
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,090
thinking instead that someone framed him.

607
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,530
Who does she suspect?

608
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,900
She has not mentioned it.

609
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,410
She is heading straight to the palace now.

610
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,620
[Wuying Hall]

611
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,010
Is the Empress's favourite pear blossom honey

612
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,130
all ready?

613
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,050
Prepared long ago.

614
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,490
Your Majesty,

615
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,970
the Empress has arrived.

616
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,380
Why

617
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,930
does Your Majesty look so surprised

618
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,090
to see me?

619
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,530
I just thought

620
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,130
you would be happier to step out

621
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,700
of the palace for a while.

622
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,260
Why should I be happy?

623
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,130
This is pear blossom honey from this year's harvest.

624
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,380
Taste it.

625
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,410
You haven't finished speaking.

626
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,970
Why would I

627
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,050
be happy?

628
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,970
Should I be happy

629
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,280
that my master is the Ghost King?

630
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,950
What are you talking about?

631
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,820
All along, you've had people following me,

632
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,860
never leaving my side.

633
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,700
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

634
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,380
I had them follow you

635
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,300
to protect you.

636
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,570
Since you admit it,

637
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,660
then the items of the Ghost King in the Sword Cottage...

638
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,380
You were the one who placed them?

639
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,340
You are suspecting me

640
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,300
of framing your master?

641
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,180
No.

642
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,860
If I truly wanted to frame your master,

643
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,530
why wait until today?

644
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,860
Then tell me,

645
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,660
why did you kill my master?

646
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,090
I promised your master

647
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,180
I wouldn't reveal the truth to you.

648
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,660
Fine.

649
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,970
I'll find out myself.

650
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,410
Cangcang,

651
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,410
have you considered

652
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,010
that perhaps the truth

653
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,700
is more than you can bear?

654
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,410
If I didn't know the truth,

655
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,180
how could I bear it?

656
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,490
Ling Xuefeng,

657
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,340
are you betting that I wouldn't break my vow?

658
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,860
Grand Tutor Ling has been kind to me.

659
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,660
He helped me avenge my daughter's wrongs.

660
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,050
He allowed me

661
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,970
to live again.

662
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,860
For him,

663
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,820
I would face mountains of blades and seas of fire,

664
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,700
even if my soul were to shatter,

665
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,090
I would not hesitate.

666
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,220
If I told you

667
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,340
that it was Ling Xuefeng

668
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,970
who abducted your daughter?

669
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,380
All of this

670
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,130
was orchestrated by him

671
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,740
as a bitter ruse.

672
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,130
Impossible.

673
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,340
It's impossible.

674
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,860
Everything I saw

675
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,010
was real.

676
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,740
Everything I did

677
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,450
was of my own free will.

678
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,900
I was not used by anyone.

679
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,380
I will never regret it.

680
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,300
Is that so?

681
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,180
Then these words,

682
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,380
would you dare to say them to Cangcang?

683
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,410
Do not tell Cangcang the truth.

684
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:21,860
Understood.

685
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,930
A promise from the sovereign

686
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,740
is never broken.
