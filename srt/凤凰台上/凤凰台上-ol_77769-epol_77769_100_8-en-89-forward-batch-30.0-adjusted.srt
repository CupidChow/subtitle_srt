00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:19,980
Sit.

175
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,130
Come,

176
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,250
write.

177
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,460
Your Highness, you're blocking the light.

178
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,180
I can't have anyone standing here when I'm writing.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,580
Fine.

180
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,300
Hurry and write.

181
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,650
For the Grand Tutor's kindness to me,

182
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,980
I would give my body and soul,

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,100
and repay it fully.

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,490
At the palace examination,

185
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,250
I will

186
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,420
take first place.

187
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,060
Good.

188
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,130
You may go.

189
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,340
Well?

190
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,300
Any word of Cangcang?

191
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,060
She claimed she was going to the Summer Palace,

192
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,420
but went to the Sword Cottage instead.

193
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,300
It seems

194
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,180
her visit to the Sword Cottage isn't simple.

195
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,770
Then Father means...

196
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,650
Regarding Li Lu's death,

197
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,340
she has never let it go.

198
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,820
How is the truth

199
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,690
she seeks coming along?

200
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,990
Master.

201
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,430
I miss you.

202
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,580
The longer I stay in the palace,

203
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,300
the more I miss the carefree days I had here.

204
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,490
But you're gone.

205
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,940
Xiao Huan won't even give me a reason.

206
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,700
Master,

207
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,420
what exactly were you all hiding from me?

208
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,420
The imperial family is heartless,

209
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,010
yet Xiao Huan keeps helping me.

210
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,060
Why is that?

211
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,490
Why did you kill my master?

212
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,610
I promised him

213
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,700
I wouldn't tell you.

214
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,610
What did you say?

215
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,250
What aren't you allowed to tell me?

216
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,460
What are you all hiding from me?

217
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,490
You're back, little glutton.

218
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,340
What do you want to eat?

219
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,770
I will make it for you.

220
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,580
Master, is it ready?

221
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,340
What gift are you giving me?

222
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,300
You may open your eyes now.

223
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,890
What a beautiful pendant.

224
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,250
This is a protector I give you.

225
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,250
You must keep it with you from now on.

226
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,220
Well?

227
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,100
Do you like it?

228
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,130
I do.

229
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,850
Father never remembers my birthday.

230
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,100
Master is much better than Father.

231
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,180
Thank you, Master.

232
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,490
I really like it.

233
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,890
As long as you like it.

234
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,820
Master,

235
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,730
can you tell me

236
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,100
why Xiao Huan

237
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,580
had to kill you?

238
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,300
Who?

239
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,650
Luo.

240
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,010
Cangcang.

241
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,490
Speak.

242
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,250
Why are you here?

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,100
I came to pay my respects too,

244
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,770
to share a drink with him.

245
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,580
But Master never drank Bamboo Leaf Green.

246
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,370
Are you really here to pay respects?

247
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,700
Cangcang,

248
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,370
Father

249
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,980
was worried about you.

250
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,370
Luo,

251
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,420
do you still remember this pendant?

252
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,700
This Begonia Pendant

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,770
was given to me by Master.

254
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,250
He said it would keep me safe.

255
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,730
I remember.

256
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,490
I only learned recently

257
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,300
that it is a treasure beyond price.

258
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,050
With it on me,

259
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,990
no poison can get close.

260
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,010
Master was protecting me all along.

261
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,140
But I do not even know why he died.

262
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,930
I do not even know why he died!

263
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,780
Am I that useless?

264
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,730
Cang...

265
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,060
Cangcang.

266
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,900
I remember when I was little,

267
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,780
I loved leaning against this forge.

268
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,380
No matter how cold it was outside,

269
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,860
it was always warm here.

270
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,820
Tell me,

271
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,250
when have you ever approached me

272
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,380
without a purpose?

273
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,340
No, My Lady.

274
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,930
It was Father...

275
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,250
Master forged the Rex Sword for you

276
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,930
and you used that very sword to kill him.

277
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,780
- How am I supposed to trust you again? - I...

278
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,780
How am I supposed to grow old at your side,

279
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,780
to live with you in harmony?

280
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,930
Since I became empress,

281
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,170
I've swallowed every grievance.

282
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,140

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,370
you're awake.

326
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,820
You drank too much last night.

327
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,540
Cangcang,

328
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,060
do you remember

329
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,780
what you said last night?

330
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,690
What did I say?

331
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,900
You didn't say anything.

332
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,690
Strange,

333
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,340
I remember it being so warm here last night.

334
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,170
How come this morning, now that the sun is out,

335
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,490
it's suddenly chilly?

336
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,540
I remember there was a cellar at home once,

337
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,690
just like this,

338
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,900
warm in winter and cool in summer.

339
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,650
Strange,

340
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,900
why is there a cold draft here?

341
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,340
Cangcang.

342
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,100
Could it be

343
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,730
there's a cellar here too?

344
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:18,970
Let's look.

345
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,730
Cangcang.

346
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,820
Try this.

347
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,300
It's so cold.

348
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,540
Why is the wind so strong?

349
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,250
Could it be

350
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,900
there's a cellar underneath,

351
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,970
connected to Sword Cottage?

352
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,010
Take out the sword.

353
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,650
I didn't expect Master

354
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,650
had hidden a place like this.

355
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,820
Cangcang, look.

356
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,210
These belong to Tang.

357
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,250
Every time I mentioned Tang,

358
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,540
Master would say it was in the past.

359
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,340
But in his heart,

360
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,100
he never really let go.

361
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,690
This is...

362
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,650
This isn't Master's wife.

363
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,900
I remember how she looked,

364
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,900
round-faced,

365
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,010
with a mole at the corner of her mouth.

366
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,860
Then this...

367
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,650
How could her portrait be here with Master?

368
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,170
These eyebrows and eyes,

369
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,490
why do they look so familiar?

370
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,340
Cangcang,

371
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,970
let's verify this later.

372
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,490
This is the Ghost King's mask.

373
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,540
How could it be in your master's Sword Cottage?

374
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,650
This is...

375
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,100
How could this be?

376
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,410
How could this be?

377
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,010
Cangcang,

378
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,490
look at this.

379

[Stone Man practicing Gu arts]

380
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,540
Stone Man...

381
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,410
Secret art...

382
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,380
This is the secret art of the Ghost King of the Lingbi Sect.

383
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,340
Could it be that Mr. Li Lu is...

384
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,140
Impossible.

385
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,900
I don't believe it!

386
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,780
How many days has the Empress been away?

387
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,210
Report to Your Majesty,

388
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,410
it's been fewer than five days.

389
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,100
Any news?

390
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,970
None that I've heard.

391
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,620
Your Majesty.

392
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,930
Has the Empress sent any word back?

393
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,620
Her Majesty's letters are not here,

394
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,140
but there are a few of Mr. Song Lanxi's writings

395
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,410
that leaked from the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

396
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,300
Why would Song Lanxi be staying in the manor?

397
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,930
He said he was injured on the road

398
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,300
and needed to recuperate at the manor.

399
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,300
I have received some good news.

400
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,620
Though perhaps not entirely good news.

401
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,100
Some bad...

402
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,340
Though not exactly bad.

403
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,620
What news?

404
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,250
His Majesty just issued an order:

405
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,490
Because he is seriously ill,

406
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,060
the final imperial exam is postponed.

407
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,580
It's good news.

408
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,380
But I wonder,

409
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,210
could it be

410
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,170
because he discovered something?

411
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,540
Impersonating Song Lanxi in the Capital is a capital offense.

412
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,650
I am also complicit.

413
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,250
Naturally, I shall protect you.

414
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,620
If you want to go, go yourself.

415
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,410
I'm not going.

416
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,730
After Ling Cangcang entered the palace,

417
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,490
the first gift she received...

418
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,780
Do you know what it was?

419
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,930
What was it?

420
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,490
A finger

421
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,300
of her adoptive brother, Luo Xianxue.

422
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,730
So,

423
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,140
you may not trust me.

424
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,900
Between us,

425
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,970
there is no common interest.

426
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,100
However,

427
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,410
we share a common enemy.

428
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,300
Then what should we do?

429
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,650
If he discovers I'm impersonating Song Lanxi,

430
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,860
you must save me.

431
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,900
Your Highness,

432
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,300
Mr. Xu Feng, requests an audience.

433
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,210
Which Mr. Xu?

434
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,900
No.

435
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,210
He is a student of Mr. Ling Xuefeng.

436
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,730
Ling Xuefeng?

437
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,210
What should we do?

438
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,540
Your Highness,

439
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,730
I heard that Mr. Song Lanxi has been ill for a long time,

440
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,930
and Grand Tutor Ling is very concerned.

441
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,210
This is Physician Liu, a miraculous healer.

442
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,970
Grand Tutor specifically sent him here

443
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,930
to diagnose Mr. Song.

444
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,170
To be honest,

445
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,540
Mr. Song's condition is indeed serious.

446
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,930
To be precise,

447
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,900
on the way here,

448
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,580
he was attacked by assassins,

449
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,210
and the injuries were severe.

450
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,820
Then, in that case,

451
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,250
please summon Mr. Song.

452
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,300
Mr. Song,

453
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,690
have you disguised yourself?

454
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,780
Mr. Song was severely injured on the head and neck

455
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,780
when on the way to the Capital.

456
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,690
His vocal cords were damaged,

457
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,270
and he cannot speak for now.

458
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,060
Since the injuries are severe,

459
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,930
Physician Liu,

460
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,140
please take care of him.

461
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,820
Yes.

Mr. Song was attacked in the night,

463
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,340
and was greatly frightened.

464
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,820
Since then, he has refused any physical contact with others.

Now that I see you,

469
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,060
I wonder if you might grant me a few characters.

Why

473
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,710
can't he display it publicly today?

show him some respect.

Why has so much calligraphy been circulated?

It is said that too many people came to request his writing,

but to ask Mr. Song to comply.

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,010
If I'm caught impersonating an imperial official,

520
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,050
how many heads do I have for Xiao Huan to chop off?

521
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,180
I can't believe you even know that!

522
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,010
How dare you let Zhong Lin impersonate Song Lanxi?

523
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,820
Song Lanxi was assassinated by your father-in-law.

524
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,180
If I hadn't done it,

525
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,300
how could I have kept it from him?

526
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,260
Kept it from him,

527
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,570
or kept it from me?

528
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,340
As soon as I returned, I came straight to the palace

529
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,530
to confess to you.

530
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,130
But you refused to see me.

531
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,970
I haven't yet punished you for failing to protect him,

532
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,930
and you blame me instead.

533
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,010
Fine.

534
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,050
Fine.

535
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,450
Then please punish me, Your Majesty.

536
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,130
It would be best

537
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,260
to punish Zhong Lin's crime along with mine.

538
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,130
Are you trying to use Zhong Lin to threaten me?

539
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,700
I wouldn't dare.

540
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,010
Zhong Lin is just a commoner.

541
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,130
How could she possibly threaten Your Majesty?

542
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,050
But I heard

543
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,260
that the Empress misses her dearly.

544
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,860
Then you will bear

545
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,130
Zhong Lin's crime.

546
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,380
Your Highness,

547
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,180
you just saw for yourself.

548
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,450
Ling Xuefeng's people already believe

549
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,010
that Song Lanxi is living safely in my manor.

550
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,820
If you punish me now,

551
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,450
wouldn't that

552
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,820
cause pain to loved ones

553
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,570
and joy to enemies?

554
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,260
So

555
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,660
this is your plan.

556
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,380
You're using Ling Xuefeng to pressure me.

557
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,220
I wouldn't dare.

558
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,530
If Ling Xuefeng knew that Song Lanxi was dead,

559
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,740
it would benefit neither of us.

560
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,660
Why not maintain the lie together?

561
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,380
You truly have a lot of nerve.

562
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,900
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

563
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,260
I am trembling with fear.

564
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,260
Having me cover the lie for you

565
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,790
is not entirely impossible.

566
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,850
But you must do one thing for me in return.

567
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,860
What is it?

568
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,490
Have you heard of

569
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,660
Li Chengtian?

570
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,050
Li Chengtian?

571
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,860
He was once a senior minister in the court.

572
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,700
After losing to Ling Xuefeng,

573
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,010
he retired to the countryside.

574
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,300
Yet his name remains illustrious among the gentry.

575
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,050
Many upright officials in the court were his students.

576
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,220
Song Lanxi was also his student.

577
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,930
Indeed.

578
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,700
Your Majesty is truly cunning and strategic.

579
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,610
So Song Lanxi

580
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,260
was merely a lure to draw out Li Chengtian.

581
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,260
Ling Xuefeng killed his beloved student.

582
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,450
What would he feel?

583
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,410
Your Majesty intends for me to summon Master Li out of retirement.

584
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,700
What do you think?

585
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:42,340
[Take care, Song Lan]

586
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,700
Greetings, Father.

587
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,860
Song Lanxi is not dead.

588
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:58,940
Impossible.

589
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,640
I personally struck him down.

590
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,100
[Take care, Song Lan]

591
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,260
This is Song Lanxi's calligraphy.

592
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,570
Since you personally attacked him,

593
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,130
there must be hidden circumstances.

594
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,300
I will investigate further.

595
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,300
Get up.

596
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,340
All traces of Li Lu's interactions with us

597
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,410
should be cleared away.

598
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,670
Rest assured, Father.

599
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,450
Everything has been properly handled.

600
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,880
But...

601
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,160
I know you cannot bear it.

602
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,970
And as a father, neither can I.

603
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,860
Yet this is the truth she most wishes to know.

604
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,410
It is also what she must face.

605
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,130
But Young Lady refuses to believe that Li Lu is the Ghost King,

606
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,090
thinking instead that someone framed him.

607
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,530
Who does she suspect?

608
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,900
She has not mentioned it.

609
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,410
She is heading straight to the palace now.

610
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,620
[Wuying Hall]

611
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,010
Is the Empress's favourite pear blossom honey

612
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,130
all ready?

613
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,050
Prepared long ago.

614
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,490
Your Majesty,

615
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,970
the Empress has arrived.

616
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,380
Why

617
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,930
does Your Majesty look so surprised

618
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,090
to see me?

619
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,530
I just thought

620
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,130
you would be happier to step out

621
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,700
of the palace for a while.

622
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,260
Why should I be happy?

623
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,130
This is pear blossom honey from this year's harvest.

624
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,380
Taste it.

625
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,410
You haven't finished speaking.

626
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,970
Why would I

627
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,050
be happy?

628
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,970
Should I be happy

629
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,280
that my master is the Ghost King?

630
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,950
What are you talking about?

631
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,820
All along, you've had people following me,

632
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,860
never leaving my side.

633
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,700
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

634
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,380
I had them follow you

635
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,300
to protect you.

636
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,570
Since you admit it,

637
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,660
then the items of the Ghost King in the Sword Cottage...

638
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,380
You were the one who placed them?

639
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,340
You are suspecting me

640
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,300
of framing your master?

641
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,180
No.

642
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,860
If I truly wanted to frame your master,

643
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,530
why wait until today?

644
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,860
Then tell me,

645
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,660
why did you kill my master?

646
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,090
I promised your master

647
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,180
I wouldn't reveal the truth to you.

648
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,660
Fine.

649
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,970
I'll find out myself.

650
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,410
Cangcang,

651
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,410
have you considered

652
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,010
that perhaps the truth

653
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,700
is more than you can bear?

654
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,410
If I didn't know the truth,

655
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,180
how could I bear it?

656
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,490
Ling Xuefeng,

657
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,340
are you betting that I wouldn't break my vow?

658
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,860
Grand Tutor Ling has been kind to me.

659
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,660
He helped me avenge my daughter's wrongs.

660
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,050
He allowed me

661
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,970
to live again.

662
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,860
For him,

663
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,820
I would face mountains of blades and seas of fire,

664
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,700
even if my soul were to shatter,

665
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,090
I would not hesitate.

666
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,220
If I told you

667
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,340
that it was Ling Xuefeng

668
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,970
who abducted your daughter?

669
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,380
All of this

670
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,130
was orchestrated by him

671
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,740
as a bitter ruse.

672
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,130
Impossible.

673
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,340
It's impossible.

674
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,860
Everything I saw

675
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,010
was real.

676
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,740
Everything I did

677
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,450
was of my own free will.

678
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,900
I was not used by anyone.

679
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,380
I will never regret it.

680
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,300
Is that so?

681
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,180
Then these words,

682
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,380
would you dare to say them to Cangcang?

683
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,410
Do not tell Cangcang the truth.

684
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:51,860
Understood.

685
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,930
A promise from the sovereign

686
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,740
is never broken.
