[Episode 17]

23
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,130
General,

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,540
we have been stationed here for far too long,

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,570
only guarding and never striking back.

26
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,980
I fear the men may soon lose their spirit.

27
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,220
It should be soon.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,130
Report!

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,490
General,

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,330
I sent our men to search the entire hunting ground,

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,650
and we found nothing unusual.

32
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,980
General, you still suspect that Bai Chifan?

33
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,300
In my view,

34
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,140
he has eyes only for Miss Lin,

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,980
and aside from that,

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,700
he seems to have no other purpose.

37
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,140
But I have always felt

38
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,490
that this man is not so simple.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,850
Mr. Bai.

40
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,940
Your Highness.

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,730
Mr. Bai, you look quite worn and weary.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,060
Is it...

43
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,410
because a certain lady keeps you tossing till dawn,

44
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,450
unable to sleep?

45
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,890
Your Highness,

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,340
please do not make sport of me.

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,540
Did you not say last time

48
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,980
that as long as I won the contest,

49
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,220
you would help

50
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,780
bring Cangcang and me together?

51
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,500
You are too impatient,

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,220
and I have yet to think of a way.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,940
Miss Lin has a stubborn temper,

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,940
and she is not easily coaxed.

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,170
Even acting as your matchmaker is no easy task.

56
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,890
Your Highness is clever and quick-witted.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,340
If even Your Highness is at a loss,

58
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,170
then I truly do not know what else I can do.

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,450
As for a solution,

60
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,540
it is not that there is none.

61
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,130
There is no lady who does not like

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,340
a handsome and dashing young man.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,130
If I dress you up a little,

64
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,060
and have you stand before Miss Lin,

65
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,570
she is sure to take a liking to you.

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,340
I already used

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,570
this little trick

68
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,690
when I first met Cangcang.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,220
Then just cling to her and never give up,

70
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,660
for even the finest lady cannot resist a persistent suitor.

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,170
Am I not pestering her every day already?

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,570
Then,

73
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,850
what do you say I should do?

74
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,100
I have heard

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,610
that there is a frozen lake outside the camp,

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,580
and perhaps Cangcang will like that place.

77
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,980
The ice is slick,

78
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,050
and you and Cangcang will no doubt

79
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,370
have to lean on each other for support.

80
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,170
I understand.

81
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,610
If you happen upon a thin patch of ice,

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,930
and Cangcang happens to slip,

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,580
Mr. Bai, you can leap in to save her, sharing danger and fate,

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,580
and once she is moved,

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,660
her heart will surely soften.

86
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,340
That is indeed a fine idea.

87
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,250
But will it not put Cangcang in danger?

88
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,610
Of course it will not.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,540
Come.

90
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,610
- Once we leave the camp, - Go.

91
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,050
I can find a way to send Cangcang away.

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,140
It is snowing.

93
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,340
- Wonderful, it is snowing! - It is snowing!

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,460
It is snowing.

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,850
It is snowing.

96
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,050
It is snowing!

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,050
Good!

98
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,170
It is snowing!

99
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,980
The snow has finally begun to fall.

100
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,460
Good!

101
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,850
It is snowing!

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,540
It is snowing!

103
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,460
Good.

104
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,540
It is truly heavy.

105
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,050
Such heavy snow!

106
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,340
Indeed.

107
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,730
It is snowing!

108
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,460
- It is snowing. - Wonderful.

109
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,580
It is snowing!

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,660
This snow is truly heavy!

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,340
Good!

112
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,340
Xijiang is bitterly cold,

113
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,730
and snowfall in winter is nothing unusual.

114
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,250
Why are the soldiers so excited?

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,340
Wonderful.

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,170
Wonderful!

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,980
Look.

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,220
Good!

119
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,730
- Good! - Wonderful!

120
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,850
Kumor,

121
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,290
the snowflakes are thick as feathers.

122
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,540
We have finally been waiting for this.

123
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,810
Could it be that Kumor has been waiting for heavy snowfall all along,

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,050
that he was not remaining still,

125
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,050
but waiting for the rivers to freeze?

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,050
Once the waters turn to ice,

127
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,290
he will march across the river and attack the city.

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,370
General.

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,460
Deputy General Zhang,

130
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,700
keep a close watch on Mr. Bai and Miss Lin.

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,220
From this moment on,

132
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,810
they are forbidden from moving freely in the camp.

133
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,490
Yes.

134
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,660
Kumor,

135
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,460
you again?

136
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,250
They are my guests,

137
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,610
not your prisoners.

138
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,580
Minjia.

139
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,290
The battle is upon us,

140
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,490
and for safety's sake I must do this.

141
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,460
As a princess,

142
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,980
you should understand the reason.

143
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,340
Your Highness.

144
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,220
Didn't you say you were going to the frozen lake

145
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,540
to play the hero and save my lady?

146
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,850
Why now...?

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,340
It is snowing heavily today,

148
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,220
so we cannot go.

149
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,850
Even Your Highness cannot help me now,

150
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,810
so it must be fate,

151
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,020
and nothing can be done.

152
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,490
Who says I cannot help you?

153
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,050
There are plenty of ways.

154
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,580
Just not today.

155
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,580
Deputy General Zhang,

156
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,410
when the time comes, lead two squads,

157
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,780
and ambush at this location.

158
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,980
As for the exact timing of the assault,

159
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,980
wait for my command.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,660
Kumor.

161
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,220
Minjia,

162
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,660
you came just in time.

163
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,660
We are discussing the details of the attack.

164
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,610
Come listen.

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,900
After winter arrives,

166
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,660
the moat around Jiangzhou freezes,

167
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,050
and we will launch a surprise attack on the East Gate.

168
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,410
Was that not already decided?

169
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,610
Kumor,

170
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,930
you may settle the details.

171
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,980
I have other matters to attend to.

172
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,220
What is it you need?

173
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,660
I am here to fetch a jar of good wine

174
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,810
for Miss Lin and Mr. Bai.

175
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,460
If you wish to drink,

176
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,140
there is wine in every other tent.

177
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,930
Why must you come to my command tent for it?

178
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,460
I lost at chess, that is all.

179
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,220
Chess?

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,050
What kind of chess were you playing?

181
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,340
Were we not talking about fetching wine?

182
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,540
Why ask about chess?

183
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,340
It was Tiger-Taming Chess.

184
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,730
Kumor,

185
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,980
he won against me in his very first game.

186
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,180
Tiger-Taming Chess tests one's strategy and command of warfare.

187
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,580
How could a wandering swordsman defeat you?

188
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,850
And I even used the moves you taught me.

189
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,340
Perhaps if you played,

190
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,370
you might not beat him either.

191
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,460
Minjia,

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,010
if you are all going to drink,

193
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,890
how could you do so without me?

194
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,850
Then Kumor,

195
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,700
I will fetch it now.

196
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,370
Wait.

197
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,130
Deputy General Zhang.

198
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,730
Yes.

199
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,340
Bring me my Parting Wine.

200
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,980
Yes, General.

201
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,250
Go make the preparations.

202
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,850
Very well.

203
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,250
Drinking in wind and snow.

204
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,940
Mr. Bai,

205
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,980
I hope you will not mind my sudden visit.

206
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,940
This wine today was meant

207
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,730
as a kind gesture from Her Highness,

208
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,610
but I did not expect it would alarm the General.

209
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,250
I am merely here to join in the merriment.

210
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,130
Before we drink today,

211
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,580
allow me first

212
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,460
to tell you a legend of Xijiang.

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,340
Legend holds that in our Xijiang,

214
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,980
there once lived a beautiful young maiden who,

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,580
against all fate, gave her heart to a prince

216
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,610
with whom her family shared a mortal feud.

217
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,250
In that very moment,

218
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,340
war broke out between their families.

219
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,130
The prince himself slew the maiden's kin.

220
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,820
Heartbroken beyond measure,

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,060
the maiden took the prince's life in return.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,650
Later,

223
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,460
she found that after death, the prince became a spring of clear water.

224
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,940
She used that spring to brew a wine.

225
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,530
And once one drinks it,

226
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,610
all memories of past love fade away.

227
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,060
Miss Lin,

228
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,610
what do you think of this legend of the Parting Wine?

229
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,060
It is quite moving.

230
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,770
I did not expect the General to be a storyteller.

231
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,730
Miss Lin,

232
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,370
this is the Parting Wine of legend.

233
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,530
If you no longer wish to have any ties to Mr. Bai,

234
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,980
you may feed this wine to him yourself.

235
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,580
Cangcang,

236
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,220
are you hesitating?

237
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,250
Are you afraid that if you drink this wine,

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,370
you will truly forget him,

239
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,580
because you still cannot forget him?

240
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,340
If a single cup of this wine

241
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,730
could sever all love,

242
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,100
there would be no sorrowful lovers in this world.

243
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,580
Miss Lin,

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,850
from what you say,

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,980
does it mean you do not wish to forget?

246
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,220
Since the General is so kind,

247
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,980
Bai Chifan,

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,340
then drink this cup,

249
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,850
and let us part in peace,

250
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,130
leaving the past behind.

251
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,340
Everything you say is true?

252
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,610
You truly wish for me to forget everything?

253
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,580
Yes.

254
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,580
But I do not wish to forget.

255
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,850
Since Mr. Bai refuses to drink,

256
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,730
Miss Lin may drink instead.

257
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,980
After all, this Parting Wine

258
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,130
needs only one of you to drink it

259
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,850
for love to be severed.

260
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,730
Life and death parted...

261
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,180
Could this be poisoned wine?

262
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,220
Very well.

263
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,180
Then I shall drink it.

264
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,250
Wait.

265
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,220
If anyone should drink it, it ought to be me.

266
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,530
Did you not already cut all ties with me?

267
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,580
Why bother with this Parting Wine then?

268
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,370
Let me drink it instead.

269
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,730
Once I drink it,

270
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,250
I will never cling to you again.

271
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,980
You want to wipe away all that you owe me with one cup?

272
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,490
Would that not be far too easy for you?

273
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,650
What is it?

274
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,250
Could it be you still have feelings for me?

275
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,250
I simply believe

276
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,730
that making you remember everything

277
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,250
is the greatest punishment for you.

278
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,730
Bai Chifan!

279
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,060
Good wine.

280
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,980
You were all fooled by my brother.

281
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,340
This Parting Wine is only a legend.

282
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,340
Cangcang,

283
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,250
do not worry.

284
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,610
Mr. Bai could never forget you.

285
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,650
The moment I tested him,

286
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,010
I knew you had not let him go.

287
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,820
Today my brother and I are witnesses.

288
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,530
Neither of you is allowed to deny it.

289
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,940
Bai.

290
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,650
Bai.

291
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,530
Bai.

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,580
Kumor,

293
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,580
what is happening?

294
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,730
True parting

295
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,850
can only be found in life and death.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,460
This cup of Parting Wine

297
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,530
he drank of his own will.

298
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,650
How is he?

299
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,730
This young man's pulse

300
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,610
is very strange.

301
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,060
There is an overwhelming cold in him,

302
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,220
and it seems restrained by medicine.

303
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,060
Enough talk.

304
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,980
Treat him quickly!

305
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,460
I only travel with the army,

306
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,580
and I specialize in external wounds.

307
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,580
A condition like this...

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,220
I am not confident.

309
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,820
Whether you are confident or not, you must treat him.

310
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,410
If you fail, you will answer to me!

311
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,530
Yes.

312
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,820
I will return

313
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,370
and prepare warming medicines to dispel the cold.

314
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,580
Cangcang,

315
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,460
watch over him first.

316
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,180
So cold...

317
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,220
So the Empress

318
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,250
is not as heartless as you claim to be.

319
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,850
You are at death's door,

320
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,850
yet you still say such things.

321
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,130
I am at death's door,
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

322
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,850
and you still shake me off.

323
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,220
You knew that wine was poisoned.

324
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,580
Why test it with your own life?

325
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,730
If not me,

326
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,850
should I have let you drink it?

327
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,220
Letting the Empress drink poison?

328
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,340
Would that not make me unworthy as a husband?

329
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,850
Besides,

330
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,220
only because I drank the poison

331
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,940
did I see your true feelings for me.

332
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,460
Xiao Huan,

333
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,220
it was you who gave me hope again and again,

334
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,340
only to use me again and again,

335
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,890
and hurt me.

336
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,130
I have finally decided to leave you,

337
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,340
yet here you are again.

338
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,580
What do you want?

339
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,220
What must I do for you to be satisfied?

340
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,130
Have you forgotten?

341
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,180
There is cold poison in me.

342
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,060
Normal poison

343
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,940
has no effect on me at all.

344
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,650
I was only pretending for their sake.

345
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,850
Is that true?

346
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,490
Of course it is.

347
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,650
Liar.

348
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,530
Cangcang, wait.

349
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,860
Come sit here first.

350
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,980
There is something I need to tell you.

351
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:16,860
Give me the antidote.

352
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,490
There is no antidote.

353
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,700
Kumor,

354
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,660
why would you do this?

355
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,220
Minjia,

356
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,530
did you not notice anything wrong with him?

357
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,250
He is just a wanderer.

358
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,660
How could he beat you in Tiger-Taming Chess?

359
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,420
He clearly knows military strategy.

360
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,900
And as soon as the snow fell,

361
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,330
he immediately watched

362
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,660
how you and I reacted.

363
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,810
His eyes are sharp,

364
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,810
deep and unreadable.

365
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,660
He is no ordinary wanderer!

366
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,330
You are simply too suspicious!

367
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,810
The battle is right before us!

368
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,010
As commander,

369
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,010
I must eliminate every threat.

370
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,940
There is definitely something wrong with Bai Chifan.

371
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,770
I absolutely cannot keep him alive.

372
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,940
He saved my life.

373
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,220
I will not let you kill him.

374
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,530
He is barely hanging on anyway.

375
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,810
He will not last long even without me.

376
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,330
You...

377
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,250
General Ling has obtained the map.

378
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,290
He will make his move soon.

379
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,770
You must see General Ling as soon as possible.

380
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,090
Tell him,

381
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,380
Kumor is waiting for the frozen season to arrive.

382
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,330
If I go,

383
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,460
what about you?

384
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,270
I will

385
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,770
create a chance for you to escape.

386
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,180
I asked how you will escape.

387
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,980
Why are you laughing?

388
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,770
Nothing.

389
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,530
Do not flatter yourself.

390
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,860
You are the ruler of a nation.

391
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,620
If you die inexplicably here,

392
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,730
our entire family will be condemned.

393
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,250
It is just that I often think of

394
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,180
our days wandering the martial world.

395
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,620
Tell me,

396
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,810
if we truly were a pair of wanderers,

397
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,620
would it have ended differently?

398
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,980
There are no what ifs.

399
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,570
Mr. Bai.

400
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,140
Mr. Bai.

401
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,460
How are you feeling?

402
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,860
Thank you for arranging everything, Your Highness.

403
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,460
Cangcang no longer bears hatred for me.

404
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,860
I

405
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,180
have no regrets even in death.

406
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,530
It is my fault.

407
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,810
I am the one who harmed you.

408
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,660
This has nothing to do with you, Your Highness.

409
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,220
Do not blame yourself.

410
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,180
I am fine now.

411
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,810
That cup held an extreme cold poison.

412
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,250
Its venom is ruthless.

413
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,530
Mr. Bai, you...

414
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,940
Mr. Bai...

415
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,420
Bai...

416
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,380
Bai...

417
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,530
It is my fault.

418
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,810
All my fault.

419
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,620
I will find the antidote.

420
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,010
It is useless.

421
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,770
This cold sickness has plagued me for years.

422
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,250
Now that it has been triggered,

423
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,980
it may never heal again.

424
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,010
Perhaps this is simply my fate.

425
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,730
I will die here.

426
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,050
What nonsense is that?

427
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,250
I will not let you die.

428
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,250
What did you just say?

429
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,380
I said I will never let you die here.

430
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,220
Mr. Bai,

431
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,140
did you hear that?

432
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,770
This is Cangcang's true heart.

433
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,250
For her sake,

434
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,860
you must not die.

435
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,330
It is too late.

436
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,250
What could Cangcang possibly do?

437
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,860
In Jiangzhou City,

438
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,810
there might be a divine physician who can save me.

439
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,570
But Cangcang cannot leave the camp.

440
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,860
And even if she could,

441
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,010
I would not last long enough for her return.

442
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,770
Jiangzhou City...

443
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,380
To leave the camp,

444
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,140
I need my brother's token.

445
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,460
But with the heavy snow,

446
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,010
he will never allow any of you to leave now.

447
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,980
Your Highness do not trouble yourself.

448
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,330
Perhaps this is indeed my fate.

449
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,380
This happened because of me.

450
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,010
I cannot just stand by.

451
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,530
Nor can I ignore your life.

452
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,250
Cangcang,

453
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,940
I will steal my brother's token right now

454
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,010
so you can leave and find the physician.

455
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,050
Thank you, Your Highness.

456
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,980
I know what you are thinking.

457
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,180
I do need you to save my life.

458
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,330
Before I came to Jiangzhou,

459
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,940
I sent Imperial Physician Li ahead.

460
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,460
Imperial Physician Li...

461
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,770
You only need to tell him my symptoms,

462
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,290
and he will be able to prescribe the remedy.

463
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,570
Very well.

464
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,980
Imperial Preceptor Du must also have your tonic pills.

465
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,180
I will bring those back too.

466
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,770
I never expected

467
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,570
that she would not save you.

468
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,290
She was not like this before.

469
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,940
None of that matters.

470
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,860
What matters now

471
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,180
is saving your life.

Cangcang.

496
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,700
You're wearing my armor,

497
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,730
riding my warhorse.

that I always wear

in winter,

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,250
they won't recognize you.

00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,860
This is my brother's token.

503
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,420
Thank you.

504
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,530
You're not planning

505
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,810
to never return, right?

506
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,250
Don't worry.

507
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,250
Since Bai Chifan is here,

508
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,700
as long as I live, I'll return.

509
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,900
I am Princess Minjia.

510
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,980
By order of the Prince, I am going to the pass to deliver a letter of challenge.

511
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,900
Make way!

512
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,770
Who dares leave the camp?

513
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,380
- Prepare the horses! - Yes!

514
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,570
Quick!

515
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,090
Lower the bridge, open the gate!

516
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,810
Loose!

517
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,420
Retreat!

518
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,620
Cangcang.

519
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,980
Why did you come back?

520
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,290
No time to explain.

521
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,660
Hurry.

522
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,660
Take me to Imperial Physician Li.

523
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,770
Imperial Physician Li?

524
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,220
He is not in Jiangzhou City.

525
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,810
Not in Jiangzhou City?

526
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,700
Cangcang, what is going on?

527
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,940
Preceptor Du...

528
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,810
Where is the Preceptor Du?

529
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,700
I must see her.

530
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,140
Come.

531
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,730
Preceptor Du.

532
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,620
Your Majesty's safe return

533
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,660
is truly Heaven's blessing for Great Qi.

534
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,330
No need for courtesy.

535
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,380
Where is Imperial Physician Li?

536
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,250
Where is his medicine?

537
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,900
Yes.

538
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,220
What did Your Majesty say?

539
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,250
He's trapped in Kumor's camp.

540
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,980
His old illness flared up,

541
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,770
and his life is in danger.

542
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,700
I came back for medicine.

543
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,530
What did Your Majesty say?

544
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,050
You don't know?

545
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,730
Imperial Physician Li

546
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,570
truly isn't in the city.

547
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,570
Could it be...

548
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,090
The letter he gave you.

549
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,010
See what it says.

550
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,320
[Kumor's troops await the freezing of the moat]

551
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,120
[and may at any moment force their way across to strike at the East Gate.]

552
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,020
[Do not act rashly. Move only upon command.]

553
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,660
His Majesty instructs,

554
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,140
according to his judgment,

555
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,250
the Kumor troops are waiting for the moat to freeze,

556
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,330
so they may cross at any time and attack the East Gate.

557
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,010
But His Majesty decrees

558
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,490
that we must not take action on our own.

559
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,530
We are to wait for orders.

560
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,380
Wait for orders?

561
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,660
Nothing else was said?

562
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,490
Nothing.

563
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,090
This is bad.

564
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,420
I'm going to save him.

565
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,090
His Majesty commands

566
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,250
that the Empress must remain in the city.

567
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,770
I cannot disobey the decree.

568
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,700
Kumor!

569
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,490
Kumor.

570
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,380
Mr. Bai can't hold on anymore.

571
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,330
I was the one who let Cangcang go.

572
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,330
If anyone must be punished, punish me.

573
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,050
Kumor.

574
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,460

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,050
Please step outside the tent.

580
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,900
I can tell you myself

581
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,860
who I truly am.

582
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,730
The poison that struck you that day has no cure at all.

583
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,940
It was His Majesty

584
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,250
who gave you the Frost Reed.

585
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,290
He gave you the only Frost Reed

586
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,490
that could save his life!

587
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,290
There is no lifesaving medicine left.

588
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,620
For Your Majesty,

589
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,090
His Majesty risked everything alone,

590
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,570
sneaking into the Kumor's camp.

591
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,660
All his life, His Majesty has been cautious,

592
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,900
disciplined and restrained,

593
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,860
but for you,

594
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,980
he has sacrificed himself again and again.

595
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,860
Have you never thought

596
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,570
that the tenderness he showed you

597
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,380
could not have all been false?

598

Is the Xiaoxing Guards now inside the city?

615
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,660
Yes.

616
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,620
Assign your elite troops and archers to me.

617
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,330
His Majesty commands it,

618
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,730
you are not to leave Jiangzhou City.

619
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,330
Then this will not count as defying the decree.

620
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,090
General.

621
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,050
Do you dare face me in battle?

622
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,460
So you finally drop the act.

623
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,050
Is it because Miss Lin is now safe?

624
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,140
I heard you personally gave chase,

625
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,570
and watched with your own eyes as Cangcang entered Jiangzhou City.

626
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,660
Good.

627
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,420
You truly are devoted.

628
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,090
Very well.

629
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,420
Today, let me see what your blade can do!

630
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,050
Kumor!

631
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,530
Your blade technique is not much weaker than mine.

632
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,050
You are simply disadvantaged by your weapon.

633
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,460
I, as a general, hate being threatened the most.

634
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,380
Do you think

635
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,220
this will let you leave here alive?

636
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,570
Since you dislike coercion,

637
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,330
why did you use Cangcang to coerce me?

638
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,940
What do you mean by that?

639
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,220
Have you not been asking who I really am?

640
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,460
I can tell you now.

641
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,380
Speak!

642
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,810
Rumor spreads throughout your camp

643
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,570
that Xiao Huan, Emperor of Great Qi,

644
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,420
cannot even lift his shoulders,

645
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,730
cannot even carry anything by hand,

646
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,530
and does not dare step outside the palace.

647
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,050
Is that what you believe as well?

648
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,420
You are Xiao Huan, Emperor of Great Qi?

649
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,570
I am.

650
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,980
Then what about Lin Cangcang?

651
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,460
Is she truly the Empress of Great Qi?

652
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,770
Her surname is Ling,

653
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,660
the Ling of lofty aspirations.

654
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,250
Ling Cangcang

655
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,090
is my empress.

656
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,770
I never imagined

657
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,810
that the ruler above all others

658
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,700
would risk death in an enemy camp,

659
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,090
all for a single woman.

660
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,010
How is it risking death?

661
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,530
Do you truly think that you alone

662
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,810
can kill your way out?

663
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,860
You underestimate my Black Tiger Army far too much.

664
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,170
I never intended

665
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,530
to rely on my own strength to escape.

666
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,980
My plan was to send out

667
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,090
the Military Deployment Map first,

668
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,050
then send the Empress away,

669
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,090
and finally,

670
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,530
let the Western Garrison launch a surprise attack on your camp.

671
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,980
But the map is still with me.

672
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,940
The map was redrawn by the Empress and me after we read it.

673
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,380
Of course your copy remains with you.

674
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,820
So your hunting match with Minjia

675
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,940
was to send out the map.

676
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,130
Naturally.

677
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,210
You people of the Central Plains truly are cunning.

678
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,980
But it is a pity.

679
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,340
You are about to die here.

680
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,380
Is that so?

681
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,940
Go.

682
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,210
You truly are not afraid of death.

683
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,130
The one not afraid of death is you.

684
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,940
This is my personal Xiaoxing Guards.

685
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,780
Each one possesses exceptional skill.

686
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,010
Taking the General's head

687
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,610
would be no challenge at all.

688
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,300
Tonight we infiltrate the enemy camp.

689
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,090
Tomorrow we will seize the chance to rescue His Majesty.

690
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,090
Yes.

691
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,010
My Black Tiger Army stands here with one hundred thousand troops.

692
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,170
With just these few of you,

693
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,610
you think you can take my head?

694
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,780
You are far too arrogant.

695
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,740
And what of your hundred thousand troops?

696
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,170
Great Qi commands a million soldiers.

697
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,570
At a single order,

698
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,170
this place will fall.

699
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,340
What will you do then, General?

700
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,420
Do you not care at all

701
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,820
for the lives of your soldiers?

702
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,420
Of course the General cares for their lives.

703
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,060
♪I'm willing♪

704
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,940
♪To wield my sword with you and burn the waning moon♪

705
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,100
♪I'm willing♪

706
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,940

707
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,180
♪I'm willing♪

708
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:10,300
♪To break my wings and become the blade in your hand♪

709
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,180
♪I'm willing...♪

710
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,170
Otherwise why would he wait for snow and ice to launch a surprise attack,

711
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,740
instead of acting recklessly?

712
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,260
Ling Cangcang,

713
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,980
you dare to return?

714
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,980
I am the Empress of Great Qi.

715
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,980
Where His Majesty stands,

716
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,460
so shall I.

717
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,820
The Emperor is cunning,

718
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,420
and the Empress is sly.

719
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,090
You truly make a fine pair.

720
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,980
Kumor.

721
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,130
If we are speaking of cunning,

722
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,980
that cup of Parting Wine you poisoned is no less so.

723
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,740
We are the same.

724
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,490
General, why not hear me out first

725
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,050
before making your decision?

726
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,740
Speak.

727
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,690
Once both sides go to war,

728
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,530
Xijiang will be trampled flat.

729
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,650
I have had the fortune of spending a few days with you,

730
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,340
and found you a disciplined commander

731
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,210
who holds the people in your heart.

732
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,820
Thus,

733
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,650
I can give you a chance,

734
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,530
and give Xijiang a chance.

735
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,900
General,

736
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,340
would you negotiate peace with me?

737
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,010
Speak then.

738
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,130
You have stayed here for some time.

739
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,260
What do you see?

740
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,010
I know,

741
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,570
the General claims one hundred thousand troops,

742
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,650
but in truth your camp

743
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,010
has fewer than sixty thousand.

744
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,820
Sixty thousand, and so what?

745
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,420
Our sixty thousand troops are all fierce and brave.

746
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,010
It is not certain we cannot take your Jiangzhou City.

747
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,300
Jiangzhou City is impregnable.

748
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,740
Its moat is both wide and deep.

749
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,210
I know,

750
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,130
you have held your troops still

751
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,170
waiting for the moat to freeze.

752
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:55,940
But now,

753
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,130
I have already ordered General Ling

754
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,170
to scatter salt into the moat,

755
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,650
slowing the freezing.

756
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,210
Since that is so,

757
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,130
I see no need for peace talks.

758
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,380
We will meet on the battlefield.

759
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,130
You misunderstand, General.

760
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,820
What I mean is this.

761
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,460
You have always loved your soldiers as your own children,

762
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,860
and you cannot let them die in vain.

763
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,050
Once the bow is drawn, there is no turning back.

764
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,460
If there is war,

765
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,650
blood will be shed and lives lost.

766
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,300
But when the time comes,

767
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,900
we sons and daughters of Xijiang

768
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,490
will never fear death in battle.

769
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,260
I know.

770
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,170
Winter came early in Xijiang this year,

771
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,610
bringing a once-in-a-century snow calamity.

772
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,570
The people suffered from cold and hunger,

773
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,740
wandering without shelter.

774
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,860
The granaries of the prefecture office ran empty,

775
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,260
and the relief was ineffective.

776
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,460
Even after the disaster passed,

777
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,860
the hardships still remained.

778
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,740
The status verification system only made it worse.

779
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,980
Thus in this peace negotiation,

780
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,780
I offer three promises.

781
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,260
First.

782
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,780
Great Qi will open our granaries and provide relief to the people of Xijiang,

783
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,340
easing the suffering caused by the snow disaster.

784
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:23,860
Second.

785
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,460
We will seek experts in agriculture,

786
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,900
teach the people to farm,

787
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,010
improve the soil,

788
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,090
and answer the needs of Xijiang.

789
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,740
Third.

790
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,300
I vow

791
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,940
that within three years,

792
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,380
the status verification system will be abolished,

793
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,130
freeing the people from bondage,

794
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,210
and restoring peace to Xijiang.

795
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,860
Kumor,

796
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,740
when Xijiang's fields grow rich,

797
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,780
its harvests are abundant,

798
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,530
and its people live in peace,

799
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,740
storing grain for winter,

800
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,980
is that not what you wish to see?

801
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,530
But I once led troops to attack your city,

802
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,010
and even harmed you many times.

803
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,460
You are, after all, an emperor...

804
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,860
As long as you are willing to turn back,

805
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,490
all that is past,

806
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,300
I shall not pursue.

807
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,050
I, Kumor, do not fear life or death.

808
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,780
I only wish to speak for the people of Xijiang.

809
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,900
If Your Majesty can truly keep your word,

810
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,010
I am willing to give you my life,

811
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,420
and follow you for all generations!

812
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,210
General, please rise.

813
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,980
I stand by every word I say.

814
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,860
Set your mind at ease.

815
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,010
This Black Feather Token

816
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,940
belonged to my father the commander.

817
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,340
Today, I offer it to Your Majesty.

818
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,490
I, Kumor, swear before heaven and earth

819
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,980
that once this token is sent forth,

820
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,490
I shall follow unto death.

821
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,260
[Token]

822
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,210
General,

823
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,650
you are a hero of this age.

824
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,940
I shall protect it.

825
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,570
As for the soldiers and people of Xijiang,

826
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,210
I shall cherish them.

827
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,610
Kumor, King of Xijiang,

828
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,340
leads the Black Tiger Army

829
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,940
to pledge allegiance to Great Qi!

830
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,860
Long live the Emperor!

831
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,530
Long live the Emperor!
