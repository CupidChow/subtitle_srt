00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,600
You scared me half to death!

3
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,039
I've been waiting for you forever.

4
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
Sneaking out of Linghe Hall
isn't that easy.

5
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
What are you drawing?

6
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,680
This is you?

7
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
Back in that fire, you got hit?

8
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
Want to see my scar?

9
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
It's on the back of my neck.

10
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
How did you get hurt?

11
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,760
I used to go play with him.

12
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,360
Him? Who is he?

13
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,720
- The Emperor?
- At his place,

14
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,880
there were all sorts of strange,
fun books.

15
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,920
He said they'd been left
by his late mother.

16
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Back then,
I actually liked being around him.

17
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,160
So later,

18
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,519
it was his place that caught fire?

19
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,440
Hurry!

20
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
- Quick!
- Coming!

21
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
- Hurry up!
- The water's here!

22
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,120
LULING HALL

23
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,760
Faster!

24
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,280
Huan!

25
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,400
- Your Highness, move now!
- Huan, don't go!

26
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,520
Huan, help me!

27
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
The fire was so huge.

28
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,320
They even saved all the crickets he kept.

29
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,280
But no one saved me.

30
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,160
He once told me

31
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,400
he'd take good care of me.

32
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
All liars deserve to die.

33
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Tell me,

34
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,120
am I right?

35
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,360
LULING HALL

36
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,960
<i>You were planted by Mother herself.</i>

37
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,280
<i>Now you've finally withered away</i>

38
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
<i>and left me too.</i>

39
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,760
SPIRIT TABLET OF EMPRESS HE OF GREAT QI

40
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Mother,

41
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm here to see you.

42
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,520
Your Majesty, something's wrong.

43
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
The Empress has fainted!

44
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,200
Why would the Empress
go to the cold palace?

45
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,760
Tonight, Her Majesty went out
for an appointment with someone.

46
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,200
She wouldn't allow us to follow.

47
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,560
I truly don't know
she went to the cold palace.

48
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,840
Please spare my life!

49
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,840
When did I ever say
I was going to kill you?

50
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,240
All of you, get up.

51
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,080
Your Majesty,

52
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,240
did the Empress

53
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,400
- run into Princess Ying?
- Yes.

54
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,600
She not only ran into her
but also fell right into her trap.

55
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Your Majesty,

56
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,000
your cold sickness
has been flaring up a lot lately.

57
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,000
Your health must come first.

58
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,919
Why don't you return
to the palace to rest?

59
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Here, I'll have the imperial physicians
and maids watch over Her Majesty.

60
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,280
It's fine. You may all withdraw.

61
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,360
- Understood.
- Understood.

62
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
<i>You've got that treasure</i>
<i>that drives out every poison,</i>

63
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,960
<i>so I can't poison you.</i>

64
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,520
<i>But you never saw this coming.</i>

65
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
<i>I can still use Puppet Incense on you.</i>

66
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,560
This is the famous Puppet Incense.

67
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
It's not easy to make.

68
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,600
This is the famous Puppet Incense.

69
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
It's not easy to make.

70
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
How interesting.

71
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,480
How interesting.

72
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,440
I must forget

73
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,200
that I came to the cold palace today.

74
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,720
I must forget
that I came to the cold palace today.

75
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,560
I hate Xiao Huan

76
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
to my very core.

77
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,680
I hate Xiao Huan

78
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,280
to my very core.

79
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,360
I will kill him with my own sword.

80
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,280
I will kill him

81
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,800
with my own sword.

82
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,480
Those who break their word

83
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,880
all deserve to die.

84
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,400
Those who break their word

85
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,640
all deserve to die.

86
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,720
I will kill him with my own sword.

87
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,480
Cangcang!

88
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,120
Those who break their word
all deserve to die.

89
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,400
<i>I will kill him with my own sword.</i>

90
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,600
<i>I hate Xiao Huan</i>

91
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,160
<i>to my very core.</i>

92
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,920
No!

93
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>I will kill him with my own sword.</i>

94
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
Cangcang,

95
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,560
your heart has been struggling,

96
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,680
because deep down
you don't really want to kill me,

97
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,600
isn't that right?

98
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,120
I may hate him,

99
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,680
but I refuse to be anyone's puppet.

100
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,840
All of you, remember this.

101
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,280
Nothing happened at Linghe Hall
last night.

102
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,040
Understood.

103
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Your Majesty,
Preceptor Du requests an audience.

104
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,440
She says it's an urgent matter.

105
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
Your Majesty?

106
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,360
When the Empress wakes up,
be careful with her right arm.

107
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Understood.

108
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,960
So this time no needles, no medicine?

109
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,000
You're really that angry?

110
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,760
I will begin fasting from today

111
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,120
to pray for Your Majesty.

112
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,280
Your stomach is already weak.

113
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,480
Why put yourself through this?

114
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,240
If even Your Majesty
won't take care of yourself,

115
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,640
then,

116
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,160
I won't bother with myself either.

117
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,280
I've ordered Imperial Physician Li back.

118
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,720
So, I'll pull through this trial.

119
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,800
Your Majesty.

120
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,840
When Prince of Yuzhang was escorting
the officials into the Capital,

121
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,960
they were attacked by assassins.

122
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,240
But Prince of Yuzhang wrote
that he was prepared,

123
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
and not a single official was injured.

124
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
- Not a single one?
- Yes.

125
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,640
I'm afraid
that even if there were casualties,

126
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,840
he wouldn't dare let me know.

127
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
Besides,

128
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,080
the one accompanying him into the Capital
wasn't Shi Yan, but Zhong Lin.

129
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,560
She must be coming to see Cangcang, right?

130
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,640
It's fine.

131
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,960
It's about time
Cangcang saw an old friend.

132
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,800
WUYING HALL

133
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Preceptor Du.

134
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,560
Eunuch Feng.

135
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
May I ask

136
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,920
where His Majesty has just come back from?

137
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Linghe Hall.

138
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,600
I can manage on my own. I'm fine.

139
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,960
His Majesty specifically instructed us
to be extra careful with your right arm.

140
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,880
So, please let me serve you.

141
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,000
Is His Majesty

142
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
all right?

143
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,560
His Majesty missed his medicine,

144
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,800
then spent his inner strength
purging the poison from you,

145
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,240
and even took a sword strike from you.

146
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,600
His condition is very serious.

147
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,880
Your Majesty, Preceptor Du barged in…

148
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,160
Du Tingxin of Nanrong Palace
pays respects to Your Majesty.

149
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,280
Rise, Preceptor Du.

150
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,720
Leave it to me.

151
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,680
Xiaoshan, you all may go.

152
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,520
- Got it.
- Got it.

153
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,480
You came in person.

154
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,320
Something major happened the day
before yesterday?

155
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,320
You were controlled
by Princess Ying's Puppet Incense

156
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,920
and tried to stab His Majesty.

157
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,600
But you dislocated your own arm

158
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,200
to keep His Majesty safe.

159
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,079
You came in person just to tell me this?

160
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,000
Your Majesty is perceptive.

161
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Then I won't hide anything.

162
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,560
Are you aware

163
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,319
of my background?

164
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,280
Please enlighten me.

165
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,360
I'm the former Preceptor's daughter,
not her disciple.

166
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
An Imperial Preceptor
was supposed to live a spotless life.

167
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,920
But she had an affair with another man
and secretly gave birth to me.

168
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,280
She raised me as her "disciple".

169
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,880
Later, when the truth came out,

170
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,560
my mother was forced
to burn herself alive to atone.

171
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
Her only wish was to keep me safe.

172
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,000
But the ministers

173
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,160
still wouldn't let it go.

174
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,920
<i>I was hiding in the shrine that day.</i>

175
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,240
<i>This girl</i>

176
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,880
<i>is an affront to Heaven and our ancestors.</i>

177
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,560
<i>She has no right to live.</i>

178
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,440
<i>She should be sacrificed to Heaven!</i>

179
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,760
Don't be afraid.

180
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,880
Today, I exercised my right to pardon.

181
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
From this day on,

182
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,720
you are the new Imperial Preceptor.

183
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,640
Why did my master

184
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,800
name the shrine "Nanrong Palace"?

185
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,400
Did she think

186
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,680
I was unwelcome to the world?

187
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,000
Even if the world rejects you,

188
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,040
you must fight to live.

189
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,520
The former Preceptor burned herself alive.

190
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
Isn't this the very result she sought?

191
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,800
<i>That day, when His Majesty took my hand</i>

192
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,840
and led me out of Nanrong Palace,

193
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,480
I made up my mind

194
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,920
that my whole life
would belong to him alone.

195
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,200
If His Majesty can be
with the one he loves,

196
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,320
that is the greatest joy I could ask for.

197
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,680
You don't actually think

198
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
the one His Majesty loves is me, do you?

199
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,600
Why are you so certain it isn't?

200
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,040
Emperors are heartless.

201
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
In the end,

202
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,200
power is all he's ever valued.

203
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,040
I came here today

204
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,040
because the night before last,

205
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,640
you were under someone else's control,

206
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
yet you chose to injure yourself
rather than harm His Majesty.

207
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,680
I believe

208
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
Your Majesty

209
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,760
might truly care for him after all.

210
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,120
I beg Your Majesty
to give His Majesty a little trust.

211
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,720
If affection can grow between you,

212
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,080
then Nanrong Palace

213
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
will be Linghe Hall's most loyal ally.

214
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
And if I can't?

215
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
I should say no more.

216
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,360
Such words would be overstepping.

217
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,560
Your Majesty is still recovering,

218
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,360
so I will take my leave.

219
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,040
WUYING HALL

220
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,560
No…

221
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
Wufu,

222
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,240
where is Imperial Physician Li?

223
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,600
They say he'll arrive in the Capital
in about a day.

224
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,040
For the next seven days,

225
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,320
I will not hold morning court.

226
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,760
Announce to the outside world
that I'm recovering from illness.

227
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,920
No one is allowed to visit me.
Not even the Empress.

228
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

229
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,480
LING MANOR

230
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,600
Are you sure everyone is dead,

231
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
including that Song Lanxi?

232
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,800
They should be.

233
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,840
What is that supposed to mean?

234
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,720
You knew Prince of Yuzhang
would keep them heavily guarded,

235
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
so besides ambushing the posthouse,

236
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,200
we also used Li Chengtian's name

237
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,920
to lure Song Lanxi out to kill him.

238
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,280
But in the end,
Prince of Yuzhang's men showed up.

239
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,560
Still, he was gravely wounded
and surely can't survive.

240
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,400
But Xiao Qianqing
has tightened security this time

241
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,960
and even bought so many injury salves.

242
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,480
What if Song Lanxi

243
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,720
didn't actually die?

244
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,920
Father,

245
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
I drove my sword through his chest myself.

246
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,760
I imagine Prince of Yuzhang
is just putting up a smokescreen.

247
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,040
This time His Majesty's illness
was severe,

248
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,480
yet he won't let anyone visit him.

249
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,800
All right.

250
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
I'll find another way
to find out the truth.

251
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,880
Go make arrangements right away.

252
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,800
Have Xu Feng and his men come see me
before the final exam.

253
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,840
Got it.

254
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,960
Your Majesty is still injured.

255
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,440
The night is getting colder and damper.

256
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,960
You should rest early.

257
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,560
If you're worried about His Majesty,
why not go visit him?

258
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,040
Who said I'm worried about him?

259
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,520
I just slept too much yesterday,

260
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,280
so now I can't fall asleep.

261
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,480
I heard from Wuying Hall

262
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,000
that Imperial Physician Li is back.

263
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,400
Imperial Physician Li?

264
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,880
He's a miracle physician the late Emperor
found out in the martial world.

265
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,800
He was brought in specifically
to treat His Majesty's cold poison.

266
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,480
Preceptor Du takes care of him
in the palace.

267
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,640
Imperial Physician Li

268
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,120
searches the martial world
for medicine for him.

269
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,360
This time they've brought Li back,

270
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,200
so it seems His Majesty's condition
is truly dangerous.

271
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,920
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

272
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,600
Your Majesty really won't go see him?

273
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,920
Physician Li, you still have
those miraculous healing hands.

274
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,320
Your medicine cures me in no time.

275
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,080
Cure you, my foot!

276
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,280
You brat, if you're so eager to die,

277
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,720
why drag me back in such a hurry?

278
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,560
- Physician Li!
- Keep quiet!

279
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
I'm trying to think of a way!

280
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,600
Inside the palace,
is there a woman this brat actually likes,

281
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,200
one who also has inner strength?

282
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
To suppress your cold poison,

283
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,800
the medicine I'm using is blazing hot.

284
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,920
We need a woman of extreme yin
and softness to help.

285
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,360
Your Majesty, the Empress is here.

286
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,200
Send her back.

287
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,080
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

288
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
Let the Empress in!

289
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,280
Her Majesty arrives!

290
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,840
Your Majesty.

291
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,920
You're the right person!

292
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
That brat's already sick like that,

293
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,040
yet he straightens right up
the moment you walk in.

294
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,800
That means he likes you.

295
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,040
Let me just ask you one thing:

296
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,520
Are you going to save
that brat's life or not?

297
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,080
Physician Li was exaggerating.

298
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
It's not a life-or-death matter.

299
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,880
Either way,

300
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,320
I hurt you.

301
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,520
Xiao Ying dosed you with Puppet Incense.
It's not your fault.

302
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,960
I do hate you.

303
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,280
However,

304
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,640
I also don't want you
to just die without even knowing why.

305
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I don't like dragging things out.

306
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,240
Let's get through this first.

307
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,440
<i>I'm here with you. I'll protect you!</i>

308
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,160
Why did you kill my master?

309
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,440
I promised him

310
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,240
I wouldn't tell you.

311
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
What did you just say?

312
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,800
You can't tell me what?

313
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,360
You're awake.

314
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,320
Why am I sleeping here?

315
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,480
You're all right now?

316
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,360
Physician Li pulled me through.

317
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,640
My health
should be stable for a while now.

318
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,840
That's great!

319
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
If there's nothing else,

320
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll be going now.

321
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,440
What's wrong?

322
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,240
You had your reasons?

323
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,920
What reasons?

324
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,120
You had your reasons

325
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,560
for killing my master?

326
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Why do you ask about that?

327
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,440
It's nothing.

328
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,000
I just think

329
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,080
even if the Bai Chifan I once knew
wore a thousand faces,

330
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
he couldn't possibly have

331
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,840
every single one of them be a lie.

332
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Right now,

333
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
come with me to the cold palace.

334
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,160
What?

335
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,480
Do you all know

336
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,760
what "cold palace" really means?

337
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Anyone not from Xuanguang Hall,
step forward.

338
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,120
If there's a single lie,
your whole clan will die!

339
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,840
Well then.

340
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,720
So you're all from Xuanguang Hall!

341
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,560
Bullying servants?

342
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,080
That's nothing to be proud of.

343
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,080
Xiao Huan!

344
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,880
These are all my favorite things.

345
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,560
How dare you destroy them!

346
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,400
If you dare lay a hand on my empress,
there's nothing I won't dare do.

347
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,400
- Li Hongqing!
- Here.

348
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
Throw all these bottles and jars

349
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,880
and the herbs and old books

350
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,480
into the courtyard to be burned!

351
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,640
Xiao Huan, don't you dare…

352
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,600
The Empress Dowager arrives!

353
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,560
Well, she's here at just the right time.

354
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Your Majesty, why are you here personally?

355
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,400
And, why are you rushing here
in such haste?

356
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,840
Governing the inner palace is my duty.

357
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,480
Your Majesty should not interfere
in the affairs of the inner palace.

358
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,480
I truly shouldn't have.

359
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,440
But the Princess used forbidden arts
on my empress.

360
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,840
That leaves me no choice.

361
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,440
As I see it,
the Empress is perfectly fine,

362
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,320
yet the Princess has been frightened.

363
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Such a great incident happened
in Linghe Hall,

364
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,920
and you knew nothing of it?

365
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,360
The Empress

366
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,159
was put under Puppet Incense.

367
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,239
Had she really killed me,
that would've pleased you, wouldn't it?

368
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,000
Please, quell your anger.

369
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,960
It was indeed my oversight in this matter.

370
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,320
I will certainly get to the bottom of it

371
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,400
and give the Empress an explanation.

372
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,719
If it truly was the Princess's doing,

373
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,120
I will by no means be lenient.

374
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,719
Aren't you tired?

375
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,480
You are already advanced in years,

376
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,600
yet still labor over the inner palace.

377
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,520
It's forgivable to overlook small matters,

378
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,679
but to blunder over major ones?

379
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,239
In my view,

380
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,679
the Phoenix Seal
might as well be handed to the Empress.

381
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,160
You're absolutely right.

382
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,440
Since the Princess used forbidden arts,
she indeed should be severely punished.

383
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,040
I ask you to make the final judgment.

384
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,240
All guards here are to be replaced.

385
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
The Princess
is not to leave the cold palace!

386
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,720
For the next ten days,
no lamps are to be lit!

387
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,920
I don't want this!

388
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,920
Qianqing! Qianqing, save me!

389
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,840
Qianqing!

390
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
- The Princess isn't herself.
- Qianqing.

391
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,320
- Your Majesty…
- Qianqing, save me!

392
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,280
- Isn't this too cruel?
- Qianqing!

393
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,880
Qianqing, save me!

394
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,120
- I'm cruel?
- Qianqing!

395
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,320
Qianqing, save me…

396
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,960
- As for cruelty…
- Qianqing, save me.

397
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,920
I'm no match for you.

398
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,680
Don't forget

399
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,880
who really set the fire

400
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,080
that turned Xiao Ying into this.

401
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,160
Your Majesty,

402
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,840
please punish the Princess severely.

403
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
Since it's your request,

404
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,400
I'll do exactly as I just said.

405
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
You say you're afraid of the dark,

406
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,640
but Xiao Ying,

407
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,000
you've never truly seen real darkness.

408
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,600
You know what?
I have never owed you anything.

409
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,680
<i>Li Hongqing,</i>
<i>take charge of the cold palace.</i>

410
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,480
<i>From today on,</i>

411
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,600
<i>the Princess is to be guarded</i>
<i>by the Imperial Guards.</i>

412
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,320
My dear, have you gone soft?

413
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,840
So in this deep palace,

414
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,680
the bond between siblings
and the love between mother and daughter

415
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,480
all end up like this.

416
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,000
Today I've seen

417
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,920
your ruthless side.

418
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,000
Your Majesty,

419
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,520
I dare not ask for much.

420
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,960
I only ask

421
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,400
that for the sake of saving you yesterday,

422
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
you allow me to leave the palace once.

423
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,720
Very well, I grant it.

424
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,800
As for what happened at Wuying Hall
last night,

425
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,920
I hope you won't mention it to anyone.

426
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,520
All you need to know

427
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,960
is that my illness is severe,
and hard to recover from.

428
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
All right.

429
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,400
WUYING HALL

430
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,680
Say whatever you want to say.

431
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,960
Don't hold anything back.

432
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,600
Then I'll be blunt.

433
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,080
This cold sickness of yours

434
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,960
has only been temporarily suppressed.

435
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,760
I knew it! You missed the key point.

436
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,800
It's only temporary!

437
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,760
If you keep wearing yourself out
like this,

438
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,440
even a great immortal
wouldn't be able to save your little life!

439
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,280
Physician Li,
surely you won't abandon me, right?

440
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,440
You brat, always clinging to me!

441
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,360
You're that certain
I can actually cure your cold sickness?

442
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,400
Physician Li,

443
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,520
you've found a new prescription,
haven't you?

444
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,240
In an ancient text,
I found a herb called Frost Reed.

445
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,280
It grows in the southwest.

446
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,080
When it blooms,
its roots fall into a false death.

447
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,080
They need thirty-six years
to revive and bloom again.

448
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,520
It takes thirty-six years
for a single flower to bloom!

449
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,520
A bizarre flower like that
must be hard to get, right?

450
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,960
That's none of your concern.

451
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,840
All these years, I've been roaming
the martial world searching for it.

452
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Recently,

453
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,280
my people sent back good news.

454
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,920
It seems they've found the flower.

455
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,280
If we can actually get our hands on it,

456
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,520
my prescription will finally be complete.

457
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,640
Then I'd have about
a seventy percent chance

458
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,920
of curing your cold sickness.

459
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,800
Good.

460
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,080
Then, I'll leave it to you.

461
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,360
I might just scrape by

462
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,840
for a few more years.

463
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,720
If you keep acting like this,

464
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,960
my life will get shortened instead!

465
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,960
With your skill and kindness,
you'll live long for sure.

466
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,520
If I make it over a hundred days,

467
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,920
that'll already be a miracle
from my ancestors.

468
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,040
You little brat!
Sometimes I really want to…

469
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,160
Hongqing.

470
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,960
Tomorrow, escort the Empress
to the Summer Palace to escape the heat.

471
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,800
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'll make the arrangements at once.

472
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,600
After you've seen her out of the Capital,
come straight back to the palace.

473
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,520
You don't need to worry about her.

474
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,360
A lot happened today. I forgot to ask:

475
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,280
Has Prince of Yuzhang arrived
in the Capital?

476
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,040
Your Majesty,

477
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,960
Prince of Yuzhang requests an audience.
He's waiting outside.

478
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,200
Speak of him, and here he comes.

479
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,560
I won't see him. Send him back.

480
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,280
<i>I heard that this time,</i>

482
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,240
Princess Ying drugged the Empress
and even forced her

483
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,000
to wound His Majesty.

484
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,800
Only then did His Majesty get angry
and punish Princess Ying.

485
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Ying may be at fault,

486
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,160
but he knows she's terrified of the dark.

487
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,680
Why sentence her to ten days
without a single lamp?

488
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,360
WUYING HALL

489
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,000
Your Highness,

490
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,200
His Majesty is unwell today

491
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,560
and has already retired.

492
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,040
Please come pay your respects another day.

493
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
Got it. Thank you, Eunuch Feng.

494
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,280
<i>After so long apart,</i>

495
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,400
<i>he really has prepared</i>
<i>quite the homecoming gift.</i>

496
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,440
LINGHE HALL
