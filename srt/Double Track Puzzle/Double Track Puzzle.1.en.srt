191
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,940
I messed up today.

192
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,460
I apologize.

193
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,620
Just let me go,

194
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,340
please?

195
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,580
You're well-informed.

196
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,100
Keep your mouth shut.

197
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,940
Alright.

198
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,300
Stop running!

199
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,220
Stay right there!

200
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,820
That's my wallet.

201
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,020
It's stolen property.

202
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,380
Words alone are no proof.

203
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
By the rules,

204
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,420
you gotta show your badge first.

205
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,580
Around here,

206
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,540
you're the first to ask for my badge.

207
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,340
Where did you crawl out of, rookie?

208
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,420
Who I am doesn't matter.

209
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,740
But I know you.

210
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,100
You're Tu Hongjiang,

211
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,300
the famous Captain Tu.

212
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,740
Stay put.

213
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm taking this guy.

214
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,380
He's a thief.

215
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,780
He's mine.

216
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,660
I've watched you since you boarded.

217
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,660
You can't even scout a target.

218
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,620
Anyone can tell at a glance

219
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,580
you're either a cop or a thief.

220
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,740
It's all over your face.

221
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,820
Can't even guard your own stuff.

222
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,820
Clumsy and careless.

223
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Who trained you?

224
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,020
Such a disgrace.

225
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,420
Funny.

226
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,380
I've been watching you since I got on.

227
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,740
Already fallen in with thieves?

228
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,740
Who trained you?

229
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,940
You should be ashamed.

230
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,540
You've got some guts.

231
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,420
Asking for a beating, huh?

232
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,420
We young guys run hot.

233
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,620
Gotta have nerve.

234
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,340
Mr. Tu! Mr. Tu!

235
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,660
He's one of us.

236
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,900
Calm down.

237
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,420
Mr. Zhan, hello.

238
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,340
I'm Han Xin, officer from

239
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,620
Xiatong Railway Police Department.

240
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
I was sent to receive you.

241
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,660
I followed you from the station.

242
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,660
What happened between you two?

243
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,300
It's nothing.

244
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,420
No.

245
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,460
Mr. Tu.

246
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,980
We are fine.

247
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,820
If he says it's fine, it's fine.

248
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,740
I'm leaving.

249
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,500
[Xiatong Railway Police Department]

250
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,980
Gosh.

251
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,100
[Xiong Guoliang, Head,
Criminal Investigation Unit,]

252
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,820
[Xiatong Railway Police Department]
Two kilos of drugs.

253
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,180
Haven't seen that many in years.

254
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,740
Have a seat.

255
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,780
Sit.

256
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,100
I got the call.

257
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,660
You're here on special assignment.

258
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,460
This is a major case.

259
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,660
We have to take it seriously.

260
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,380
Just let me know if you need anything.

261
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,540
We'll provide full support.

262
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,100
Mr. Xiong,

263
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,700
let me brief you first.

264
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,780
I think

265
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,500
there's something off
about this operation.

266
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,460
We kept this lead tightly under wraps.

267
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,620
We tracked it all the way to Pingzhang.

268
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,660
After arresting the two couriers,

269
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,860
we interrogated them separately on site.

270
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,580
There was basically no chance
for them to coordinate their stories.

271
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,420
But the operation still failed.

272
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,140
Either we've been

273
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,300
exposed,

274
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
or someone used this

275
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,620
to set a trap.

276
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,900
But I still don't know

277
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,260
who it was and why.

278
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,260
Whatever the motive,

279
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,260
if you pull one thread,
the rest will follow.

280
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
And now that we've got

281
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,140
that thread in hand,

282
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,500
we'll find who's after it.

283
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,700
Right?

284
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,140
You're right, Mr. Xiong.

285
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,660
Before I came,

286
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
our bureau already contacted

287
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,260
the Bureau in Xiatong.

288
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,100
They'd send men to assist.

289
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,220
Should be here soon.

290
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,180
Who did they send?

291
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,100
I know everyone in Criminal Police Unit.

292
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,180
Not from Criminal Police Unit.

293
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,860
It's an officer
at a local police station,

294
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,860
Zhang Nanyi.

295
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
Mr. Zhan, how do you know him?

296
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,460
Met him on the way here.

297
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,740
Just a brief encounter.

298
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,500
Oh, right,

299
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,940
I've already spoken with Mr. Tu

300
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,060
and asked him to pull a few men

301
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,300
from the First Division

302
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,580
to join the special investigation.

303
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,140
They know the area well,

304
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,980
especially around

305
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,020
the train station.

306
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,900
No need for that yet.

307
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
It's all for the job.

308
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,140
So I'll be blunt.

309
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,660
Drug cases are serious business.

310
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,580
I just got here.

311
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,700
I don't know

312
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,780
the team well enough yet

313
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,700
to fully trust them.

314
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,300
Especially the First Division.

315
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Well,

316
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
I heard about what happened

317
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,220
last night.

318
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm not making excuses for him.

319
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,380
But Tu

320
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,900
can be a bit...

321
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,180
Looking for me?

322
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,380
You...

323
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,500
Tea.

324
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,500
Hurry up.

325
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,380
Aren't you hot

326
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,540
in that leather jacket?

327
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,940
You wouldn't get it.

328
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,940
Tu, let me introduce you.

329
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,260
This is Zhan Peng,
Captain of the Third Division,

330
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,660
Criminal Investigation Department.

331
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,180
Have a seat.

332
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,700
He's here on temporary assignment.

333
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,180
He is leading a special investigation.

334
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,900
This is Tu Hongjiang,

335
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,860
Captain of our First Division.

336
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,940
He handles pickpocket cases.

337
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,180
Knows the streets inside out.

338
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,900
If anything, go straight to him.

339
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,100
What kind of case?

340
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,500
A special investigation.

341
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,140
The higher-ups take it very seriously.

342
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,220
Just cooperate.

343
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
What special investigation?

344
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,060
How can I cooperate

345
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,100
if I don't know anything?

346
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,020
I'll fill you in on the details later...

347
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,620
Mr. Xiong.

348
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,900
Hello, Mr. Tu.

349
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,340
I've heard a lot about you.

350
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,980
Appreciate your help.

351
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,700
Just call me Tu.

352
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,740
Welcome.

353
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,460
Just let me know if you need anything.

354
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,820
Hey.

355
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,860
Badge 052819, Officer Zhang.

356
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,620
What a coincidence.

357
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,900
[Task Force]
Almost feels scripted.

358
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,380
Didn't expect we'd meet this way.

359
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,980
Alright. Stop tidying up.

360
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,220
Get ready. You're coming with me.

361
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,900
Where to?

362
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,420
That thief we caught yesterday

363
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,020
didn't cut any of the other bags,

364
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,260
just the one with the goods.

365
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,180
Too much of a coincidence.

366
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,980
Zheng Xiaoshan?

367
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,540
Yes.

368
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,140
Wasn't he released?

369
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,660
I saw him leaving when I arrived.

370
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,420
Released?

371
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,300
Who let him go?

372
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,060
Well, Mr. Tu.

373
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,300
Who told him to?

374
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,780
Mr. Zhan.

375
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,580
Have a seat.

376
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:25,980
Come on.

377
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,260
We'll talk here.

378
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,300
I know Zheng Xiaoshan.

379
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,020
His situation is special.

380
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
We can be flexible.

381
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,620
We reported it
to Mr. Xiong this morning.

382
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,020
He didn't object.

383
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Besides,

384
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,620
we've got nowhere to hold him.

385
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,020
Not like when you guys
nab a drug dealer.

386
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,340
You can just arrest suspects on sight.

387
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,220
We

388
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,180
need evidence to make a bust.

389
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,500
And Mr. Tu said...

390
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,300
What did he say?

391
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,140
Nothing.

392
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,340
He...

393
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,340
I want his exact words!

394
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,820
He said

395
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,380
the only thing of value
in that wallet was your ID card.

396
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,660
Besides, he didn't actually get it.

397
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,780
Right?

398
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,860
Have a seat.

399
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,420
Come on.

400
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,140
Mr. Zhan,

401
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,860
I get the feeling

402
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,140
you have some history with Mr. Tu.

403
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,180
Mr. Zhan!

404
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,860
Look at this.

405
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,780
[10 AM on the 16th, Locker 16,
Dazhong Mart, Station Square.]

406
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,420
Where did you find it?

407
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,100
In my pants pocket.

408
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,980
I just found it when I reached
into my pocket to pay.

409
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,700
And these are the same pants

410
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,220
I was wearing on the train yesterday.

411
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,700
Zheng Xiaoshan?

412
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,220
Yes.

413
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,620
No one else got close to me.

414
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,220
Didn't think he was that sharp.

415
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,020
Turns out he had a backup plan.

416
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
He must

417
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,100
have someone behind him.

418
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,940
This seemingly simple thief

419
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,780
might not be so simple after all.

420
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,060
[09:27:59 AM on the 16th]

421
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,860
This package of drugs is the key bait

422
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,820
to lure out the dealers.

423
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,540
Everyone, stay sharp.

424
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,500
Stick to the plan.

425
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,340
Lock it down tight.

426
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,300
Not a moment of letup.

427
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,540
Mr. Ba.

428
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,540
Mr. Ba.

429
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,220
Got a can for you.

430
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,860
I still remember you love this.

431
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,020
[Alias: Bazijiao,
leader of Xiatong Theft Ring]

432
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,540
That's the stuff.

433
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,940
After all those years inside,

434
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,820
you're the only ones I've got left.

435
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,020
Life shifts,

436
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,260
everyone finds their own path.

437
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,420
I get that.

438
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,940
But biting the hand that fed you,

439
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,380
turning on your own?
That I can't forgive.

440
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,620
I hate traitors the most.

441
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,020
If it weren't for those boys
selling me out back then,

442
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,340
I wouldn't have been
stuck inside so long.

443
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,860
Mr. Ba,

444
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,500
you don't know.

445
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,980
While you weren't here,

446
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,100
everything's gone out of order.

447
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,180
Train pickpocketing, bag snatching,

448
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,140
train stowaways, and luggage rack thefts

449
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,940
are out of control.

450
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,540
These scumbags

451
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,900
are tripping over each other

452
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,660
just to deliver business

453
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,900
to that old fool Tu.

454
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,020
They're asking for trouble.

455
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,620
Mr. Ba,

456
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,140
if we don't keep hands sharp
for even a day, we get rusty.

457
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,820
How'd you keep your skills sharp inside?

458
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,260
You mean I'm getting old?

459
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
No.

460
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,340
I just respect your craft.

461
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,180
Look at my clumsy hands.

462
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,900
I'll never get it down in this lifetime.

463
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,980
Time's almost up.

464
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580
Showtime.

465
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,660
Mr. Ba,

466
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,980
you've still got it.

467
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,620
Nice, really.

468
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,500
It's you who's been
betraying me all along.

469
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,260
Well, if it isn't Ba, inmate 025437.

470
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,900
What a coincidence, huh?

471
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,100
Quite a coincidence.

472
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,060
And if it isn't Tu Hongjiang,
the widower.

473
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,820
What did you say?

474
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,500
Mr. Tu,

475
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,620
he's got that stolen wallet in his hand.

476
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,540
You just got out

477
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,780
and already got the guts?

478
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,180
Not enough prison life?

479
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,580
Or

480
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,900
is your boss Sanmahu back?

481
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,860
Scared?

482
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,900
It's not worth going back inside

483
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,700
over a wallet.

484
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
Let Sanmahu come out and talk to me.

485
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,220
You that eager to see my boss?

486
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,380
What,

487
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,780
got a new wife to lose?

488
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,620
Remember what you said.

489
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,020
No matter how
you try to spit it out now,

490
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,260
I'll

491
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,820
make you swallow it.

492
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,540
Let's go.

493
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
We'll talk at the station.

494
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,820
Freeze!

495
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,140
You got proof I stole anything?

496
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,060
Abort the operation.

497
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,500
Zhang, get the goods back now.

498
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,180
Support me!

499
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,820
Tu Hongjiang.

500
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,500
Why are you here?

501
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,300
This has always been my turf.

502
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,580
My informant's been

503
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,980
watching this ringleader.

504
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,020
My showing up here isn't coincidence.

505
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,100
It's inevitable.

506
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,380
Take him away!

507
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,940
Mr. Zhan!

508
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,860
Get up!

509
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,180
The guy in charge
of the lockers is Mo Shan.

510
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,380
He's definitely involved.

511
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,980
The day before our operation,

512
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,300
we scoped the place during the day.

513
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,220
That same night, Mo Shan

514
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,540
brought in two workers,

515
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,740
and said it was for locker maintenance.

516
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,900
It's all in the security logs.

517
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,900
Mr. Zhan,

518
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,700
take a look at this.

519
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,140
Mo Shan went in with two workers.

520
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,940
But he only came out with one.

521
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,260
The other worker vanished.

522
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,700
Never showed up on camera again.

523
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,780
Look.

524
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,420
When I went to

525
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,540
check the locker,

526
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,020
only this guy came out
from inside the supermarket.

527
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,140
Then he left quickly

528
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,500
through the northeast exit.

529
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,500
We can't find when he entered.

530
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,460
I suspect

531
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,100
this is the missing worker.

532
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,980
That clears it up.

533
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,300
Mo Shan took him in

534
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,500
the night before.

535
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,700
He hid overnight,

536
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,420
waiting for us to stash the goods.

537
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,180
Bring Mo Shan in for questioning.

538
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,420
Officer.

539
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
[Mo Shan, Supermarket
Security Supervisor, Gambling Addict]

540
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,980
I swear I'm not with them.

541
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,180
I don't even know them.

542
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,500
I just wanted to make some extra cash.

543
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,180
If I'd known the police were after them,

544
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,460
I wouldn't have taken them in.

545
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,180
I am

546
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,820
not stupid.

547
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,980
Cut the smirk.

548
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,700
Let me be clear.

549
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,300
The stuff that went missing
from the locker

550
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,060
under your watch was drugs.

551
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,180
Two kilos.

552
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,780
That's two thousand grams.

553
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,020
You...

554
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,420
You must be joking, officer.

555
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,500
You can take it as a joke if you want.

556
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,540
It's been almost eight hours

557
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,380
since the drugs disappeared.

558
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,020
If you keep clamming up,

559
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,140
listen,

560
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,380
every gram that's gone
from now on is on you.

561
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,780
And just so you know,

562
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,060
fifty grams is enough
to get you executed.

563
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,980
Talk to me when you think it out.

564
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,340
Wait, wait!

565
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:08,900
I'll talk! I'll talk!

566
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,260

and his closest friend on the force.

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,180
I want you

757
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,100
to approach this case with fairness

758
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,500
and the right attitude.

759
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,060
Please rest assured.

760
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,460
I know how to separate
personal from professional.

761
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,620
I'm there for the case.
