00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,020
but I never thought he'd go this far.

193
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,580
He's selling heroin.

194
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,220
You can't tell me you didn't know.

195
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,900
It's a dead end.

196
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,220
You should know that.

197
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,140
I do.

198
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,260
Back when we're in northern frontier,

199
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,100
I told Mr. Hu

200
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,580
who touched this stuff
was finished.

201
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,940
It was that couple who egged him on.

202
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,740
Who are they?

203
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,500
When Mr. Hu and I came there,

204
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,460
those two

205
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,980
had a bit of a name

206
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,340
in the circles.

207
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,740
The woman is Bai Taohua.

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,740
Her man

209
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,420
is Sickly Dou.

210
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,980
They had dealings

211
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,380
with Mr. Hu a few times

212
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,340
and became friends.

213
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,340
Later, Sickly Dou

214
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,060
got hooked on the drug.

215
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,820
His boss found out

216
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,220
and wanted to take him out.

217
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,220
Said he broke the rule.

218
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,180
Mr. Hu stepped in and saved him.

219
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,820
After that, he started
working for Mr. Hu.

220
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,380
[1998]
The Sun family from Da'an League

221
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,660
isn't the kind to mess with.

222
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,260
Trying to get you out,

223
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,620
I've been walking on eggshells.

224
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,660
Who knows

225
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,540
when they might show up again.

226
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,660
What's your plan?

227
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,060
Since you've
shown me this kindness,

228
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,500
I humbly ask

229
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,420
if you might

230
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,180
take me in?

231
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,980
If you take me in,

232
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,140
from now on,

233
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,620
I'll go through fire for you.

234
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,980
I won't hesitate.

235
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,060
You?

236
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,380
You're not worthy.

237
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,300
Are you?

238
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,780
You look like a stray dog.

239
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,980
Come on.

240
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,620
Give us one reason

241
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,740
to take you in.

242
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,500
Money.

243
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,380
I can make money for you.

244
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,380
Lots of it.

245
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,100
Mr. Hu,

246
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,460
you're a man with big plans.

247
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,940
You don't need timid old fossils

248
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,060
who pretend to be

249
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,580
offering advice.

250
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,260
Go on.

251
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,100
What you need is a wolf.

252
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,140
A wolf who'll go through fire

253
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,780
and fight on the front lines.

254
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,140
Mr. Hu.

255
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,420
From now on,

256
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,580
we're in the same boat.

257
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,300
Frictions

258
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,260
are bound to happen.

259
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,700
Come on.

260
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,900
Let's

261
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,460
have a drink.

262
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,660
Pleasure working together.

263
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,380
Later, because of drugs,

264
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,500
I had a falling out with Sickly Dou.

265
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,220
Then Mr. Hu let me come back here.

266
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,260
What's Sanmahu's plan

267
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,500
this time in Xiatong?

268
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,940
No idea.

269
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,140
I don't mess with heroin.

270
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,580
He didn't tell me.

271
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,260
All Mr. Hu said

272
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,100
was to cause you trouble.

273
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,980
The bigger, the better.

274
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,420
The messier, the better.

275
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,940
I catch thieves,

276
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,780
not dealers.

277
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,260
He's doing drug business.

278
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,820
What's the point of coming after me?

279
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,740
Doesn't make sense.

280
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,420
If something seems off,
there's trouble behind it.

281
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,180
Those two from the northern frontier

282
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,500
really are ringleaders.

283
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,220
They've got a boss named

284
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
Sanmahu.

285
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,780
Word is he's pulled off
many big jobs lately.

286
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,220
Got quite the swagger

287
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,900
in their circle.

288
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,260
Sanmahu?

289
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,620
Sounds like a cartoon character.

290
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,060
Doesn't sound too bright.

291
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,580
Why give up being a solid ringleader

292
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,220
just to mess with heroin?

293
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,860
What's he thinking?

294
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,260
If you ask me,

295
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,860
we might as well just take them out.

296
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,660
Why bother with some cartoon character?

297
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,020
They're throwing money at us.

298
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,540
They're our golden geese.

299
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,740
We should treat them well,

300
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,820
not hurt them.

301
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,380
You're right.

302
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,340
Long,

303
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,140
you think we can trade this stuff

304
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,340
for money?

305
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,140
Absolutely.

306
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,180
[Monitoring and Tracking System]

307
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,260
Liu, get the location now.

308
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,860
Got it.

309
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,380
Mr. Zhan,

310
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,380
the number Hu Yidao gave us
just went active.

311
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,020
Now it is in the west of the city.

312
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,140
Still narrowing down the exact location.

313
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,700
Keep on it.

314
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,060
Got it.

315
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,740

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,620
Here's the plan.

319
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,980

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,500
Get in the car!

325
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Copy that!

326
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,380
Mr. Long,

327
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,100
you're a man of your word.

328

Trust goes both ways.

329
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,380
Next time you're late,

330
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,340
we're done talking.

331
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,780
Understood.

332
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,820
It's our first time dealing.

333
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,860
No harm in being cautious.

334
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,820
Right?

335
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,180
Money?

336
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,780
Goods?

337
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,500
I need to see the money first.

338
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,180
I need to see the goods first.

339
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,140
Cash on delivery.

340
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,620
Fair enough.

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,660
Dou.

342
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,380
Dou.

343
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,100
It's heavy.

344
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,700
What are you laughing at?

345
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
Did I say you could laugh?

346
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,300
I've shown you some respect, huh?

347
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,020
Pick up the money case.

348
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
Can't we laugh?

349
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,620
My apologies then.

350
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Really didn't mean to offend.

352
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,020
What do you mean?

353
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,660
I want to see the product first.

354
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,260
Don't push your luck.

355
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,580
Understand?

356
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,740
If there's no basic trust,

357
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,060
why are we even doing business?

358
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,860
Long, let's go.

359
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,660
You can leave.

360
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,180
But leave the goods.

361
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,540
What did you just say?

362
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,700
Say it again.

363
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,580
Turn left ahead into Mining Area No. 8.

364
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,420
Got it.

365
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,180
Go that way.

366
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,300
About two kilometers.

367
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,500
Alright.

368
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,980
Weren't we having a good talk?

369
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,380
Why did it turn physical?

370
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,700
What did I tell you back at home?

371
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,980
Money comes from peace.

372
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,780
Do you even know the rules?

373
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,420
Buddy,

374
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,020
you haven't tested it, have you?

375
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,260
We gotta do this right.

376
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,780
Dou.

377
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,380
We appreciate your effort, Long.

378
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,180
Let's strike it rich together.

379
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,260
That's it then.

380
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,980
We'll meet again next time.

381
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,020

how many bags in total?

384
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,100
Test all of them.

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,020
this stuff's strong...

387

test all of them.

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,180
You're cops?

390
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,380
If the goods are with me,

391
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,340
I'm the one who's doomed.

392
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,300
Use your head!

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,860
what's going on?

398
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,420
They must've turned the phone off.

399

Long,

400
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,180
you've really got a way with things.

We don't have any goods right now.

How are we supposed to work with them?

For professionals,

407
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,980
we truly got nothing.

But these guys?

you haven't tested it, have you?

414
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,380
We gotta do this right.

415
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,540

did you see that smug face of his?

421
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,220
I really wanted to tear it apart.

422
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,500

I thought they already left.

we found fresh crash marks.

460
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,900
They probably escaped through there.

on the back hill.

472
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,780

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,020
the tire marks at the scene.

474
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,460
Look at this one.

475
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,020
Deep treads.

476
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,580
Even wear.

477
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,380
Probably a sedan.

478
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,340
And over there.

479
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,820
Brand new treads.

480
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,940
Barely any wear.

481
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Most likely a recently purchased van.

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,980
to check surveillance along the route

485
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,220
and find the suspect vehicles.

486
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,100
Once identified, track their route.

487
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,580
Figure out where they came from
and where they're headed.

488
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,620
Understood.

489
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,340
Team One, canvas the area

490
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,460
for witnesses with me.

491
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,020
Team Two, stay here
and keep combing the scene.

492
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,340
Hair, cigarette butts, packaging.

493
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,260
Anything could be a key lead.

494
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,700
Once Dou's product arrives,

495
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,460
send someone to deliver them

496
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,340
to the location Mr. Qi specified.

497

498
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,460

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,980
Yes, sir.

502
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
It's about time.

503
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,140
Make a call and check in.

504
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,500
Sir!

505
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,740
Hua Long is a rogue!

506
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
What happened?

507
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,140
We were being genuine with him

508
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,700
and he called the cops on us.

509
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,060
Hua Long's connected to the cops?

510
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,780
How's that possible?

511
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,580
We had just gotten the goods

512
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,700
when the cops showed up.

513
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,260
Can you believe that?

514
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,220
Too much of a coincidence!

515
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,340
Where are the goods?

516
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,940
Sir.

517
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,100
Who tested it?

518
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,300
I did.

519
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,220
You did?

520
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,340
So what do you

521
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,780
think of the stuff?

522
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,180
I think it's pretty good.

523
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,660
No, no!

524
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,260
Crewcut!

525
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,380
Crewcut,

526
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,140
it's not like that.

527
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,740
Not like that!

528
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,820
Crewcut!

529
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,020
Sir.

530
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,180
Please give me another chance.

531
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,300
Sir,

532
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,100
this was clearly Hua Long setting us up.

533
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,780
We'll accept any punishment.

534
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,260
Just give us a chance.

535
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,500
We need to demand
an explanation from him.

536
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,660
Losing out is one thing,

537
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,060
but we need to know

538
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,300
the reason.

539
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,500
Hua Long took advantage of you

540
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,620
because you're not professional.

541
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,860
Testing goods

542
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
is a skill.

543
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,580
We need to

544
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,940
find someone qualified to do it.

545
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,940
Enough. Get up.

546
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,140
I'm heading out to the northern frontier
to find an expert.

548

on outsiders.

549
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,620
Always has been.

550
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,220
No matter how capable you two are,

551
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,980
if you want to

552
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,900
go against him,

553
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,700
you need local muscle.

554
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,740
I guess

555
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,980
Ba's done for,

556
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,780
but his men

557
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,620
might still be useful.

558
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,940
Sir,

559
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,300
do we...

560
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,940
really have to use Ba's people?

561
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,780
What do you think?

562
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,220
Dou.

563
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,620
The boss has real vision.

564
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,060
We've gotta learn from that.

565
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,540
No matter who Ba's men are,

566
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,300
if they're willing to follow us,

567
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,220
we take them in and put them to work.

568
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,940
Right, sir?

569
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,220
Hmm.

570
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,340
Don't worry.

571
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,060
We will

572
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,260
win Ba's men over.

573
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:33,860
Long,

574
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,780
all checked.

575
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Basically no consecutive numbers.

576
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:42,900
Long,

577
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,980
you think it was this phone number

578
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,100
that brought the cops.

579
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,620
Did the cops

580
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,100
go after that guy making IDs?

581
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,420
Stop overthinking it.

582
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,220
Just remember one thing.

583
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,700
We are

584
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,580
on the cops' radar now.

585
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,460
Whenever you're out,

586
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,740
you gotta stay sharp.

587
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,140
Better safe than sorry.

588
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,580
If you run into any strangers,

589
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,380
you just run.

590
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,140
I get it.

591
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,020
I'll lay low.

592
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,700
But I'm getting
more and more pissed off.

593
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,260
We were doing just fine before.

594
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,060
Nothing's going wrong.

595
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,140
Then these two losers show up,

596
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,700
and suddenly the cops are on us.

597
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,220
What is that about?

598
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,500
I've been thinking about that too.

599
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,020
Hello?

600
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,260
Long,

601
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,260
you think turning off your phone
would keep me from finding you?

602
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,620
You're naughty.

603
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,740
Picking on me because I'm green,

604
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,100
and I'm new here, huh?

605
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,340
You got the money.

606
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,620
Where are the goods?

607
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,220
Yeah, I'm messing with you.

608
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,100
What will you do?

609
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,500
Go ahead and call the cops again.

610
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,660
Hua Long.

611
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,780
Listen up.

612
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,340
Next time we meet,

613
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,260
it'll be the end of you.

614
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,260
You think I'm scared?

615
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,580
Stop talking and do something.

616
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,260
Bring it on.

617
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,380
What was that?

618
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,340
Long,

619
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,980
did I hang up too soon?

620
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,460
After that,

621
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,180
what was there left to say?

622
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,420
At least you got to vent.

623
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,340
Long,

624
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,700
these guys dare to mess with heroin.

625
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,180
Then...

626
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,340
If that so,

627
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,140
they're not simple.

628
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,060
Why don't we

629
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,780
take them out

630
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,820
and cut it clean

631
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,380
before they realize?

632
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,740
Alright.

633
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,860
Get it done quickly.

634
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,380
But remember,

635
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,460
don't show your face.

636
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,460
Get someone sharp to do this.

637
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,580
And leave no loose ends.

638
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,940
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

639
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,100

Wait outside. I'll call if I need you.

What's wrong with you?

654

Time. It's time.

They're late.

656
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,500
I hate people who can't be on time.

657
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,220
Are you going through menopause?

658
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,140
You're so irritable.

659

Are all these local hicks

660
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,380
this rude?

661
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,300
Can't you just be a little patient?

662

They just want to put on airs.

667

What's with you?

668
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,340
Would it kill you

669
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,860
to show a little respect?

670
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,100
When they get here later,

671
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,260
keep your mouth shut.

672

765
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,420
You've seen

766
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,620
my brother's raw power.

767
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,020
Ergou,

768
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,140
up there, just listen to your brother.

769
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,620
When it's done,

770
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,740
I'll buy you that game card.

771
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,020
The newest one. Deal?

772
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,580
My brother never lies to me.

773
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,220
Alright.

774
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,580
Ergou,

775
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,900
give me the game console.

776
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,980
We'll play after we're done,

777
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,420
alright?

778
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,460
Good boy.

779
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,180
Let's go.

780
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,020
Come with me.

781
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,500
Come on.

782
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,860
[Task Force Office]

783
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,260
Thanks.

784
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,580
I like eating this.

785
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,940
Everyone, take a look.

786
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,860
Wake up. Wake up.

787
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,220
Everyone, take a look.

788
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,500
See?

789
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,900
The target vehicle's signal
is in Mining Area No. 8.

790
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,460
From the moment the vehicle disappeared

791
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,860
to the time we arrived,

792
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,420
sixteen cars passed through.

793
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,300
I've filtered them.

794
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,620
Four Jettas

795
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,700
and one van.

796
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,500
But look,

797
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,940
this van is clearly much more beat-up.

798
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,340
That doesn't match the condition

799
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:30,980
we logged at the scene.

800
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,300
We can rule it out.

801
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,860
Now

802
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,540
we need to track these four Jettas.

803
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,220
Dig up clearer footage,

804
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,100
confirm the occupants'

805
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,500

806
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,100
and exact routes.

807
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,580
Got it?

808
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,700
Got it.

812
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,060
but this is a critical moment.

813
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,260
I need you all to push through.

814

815
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,580
Alright.

Let's go!

817
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,940
Perk up a bit.

818
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,900
Here's "Where Lies the Path Ahead?"

819
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,460
for you all.

820
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Thank you!

821
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,220
Plenty to go around.

822
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,220
Who...

823
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,820
Who are you?

824
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,180

You three are big names in Xiatong.

832

We're all friends in the life.

836
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,100
No need for formalities.

837
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,700
But it depends on how we make money.

838
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,180
We heard

839
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,420
you're not in the same line.

that's the road to glory!

844
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,380
Ms. Bai, you're a real one.

845
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,380

847
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,580
No problem.

We gotta team up

to get rich.

859
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,940

860
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,740

they won't come out. What do we do?

It's packed in there.

00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,540
No opportunity.

870
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,300
and get out fast.
