Bao, thank you.

4
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,620
Alright.

5
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,660
That's Bao calling.

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,900
Hello?

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,500
Got it.

8

Don't worry, Bao.

Man, you're something else.

10
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,140
You got Bao to step in

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,860
and save this punk's ass.

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,580
Fine.

13
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,460
Kid,

14
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,380
today's your lucky day.

15
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,940
We are

16

letting it slide this time.

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,540
But

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,420
don't let me see you

Let's go.

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,660
Stay out of my way!

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,580
We're all in this for the money.

26

My guy crossed you.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,660
But he was paid to do this.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,940
Just doing his job.

29

You're a class act, man.

Respectable.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,900
What should I call you?

36

My last name is Jiang.

Just call me Mr. Jiang.

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,420
Mr. Jiang.

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,780

[Episode 19]

45
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,260
Based on Sheng's statement,

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,100
we've basically mapped out the structure

47
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,580
of the local drug trafficking ring
in Xiatong.

48
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,620
Initially, Han Weidong was the convener.

49
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,460
Under him was Sun Bojun,
who's still at large.

50
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,460
Further down were Hua Long and Mao,

51
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,620
and later, Sheng as their replacement.

52
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,940
Now, aside from Sun Bojun
who's on the run,

53
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,140
the Dragon Unleashed
drug trafficking ring

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,460
has basically been wiped out.

Sheng

57
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,860
heard this name during the negotiations

58
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,980
between Han Weidong and Sanmahu.

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,940
Both sides were wary of this person.

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,340
His existence also explains

61
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,140
why there were so many doubts before.

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,260
Dragon Unleashed's gang
and Sanmahu's gang

63
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,860
have been fighting

64
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,780
yet negotiating all along.

65
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,100
That's because there was

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,180
always someone behind the scenes
controlling them.

67
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,660
I feel sorry

68
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,180
for what happened to Mr. Han.

69
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,060
I've been under him for many years.

70
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,420
He's always been good to me.

71
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,180
But he made mistakes.

72
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,980
And mistakes

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,900
come with consequences.

74
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,700
With Mr. Han gone,

75
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,060
there's a big gap left

76
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,380
in your operation.

77
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,940
Mr. Wang,

78
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,100
I heard you used to be

79
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,180
a straight-up businessman

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,580
and you were never

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,660
involved in anything this risky.

82
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,580
How about this?

83
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,860
Why not hand over

84
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,220
all their previous business to me?

85
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,380
That's thoughtful of you.

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,140
I've been scratching my head over this.

87
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,260
I need to find someone to take over.

88
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,540
You know Xiatong so well.

89
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,140
You'd be

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,620
the right fit.

91
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,340
Exactly.

92
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,700
Don't worry.

93
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,860
Rest assured, Mr. Wang.

94
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,940
You'll get every penny

95
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,380
of your cut.

96
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,900
When Mr. Jiang called me, he said

97
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,380
business decisions are mine to make.

98
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,860
If I don't want to do it,
I hand it over.

99
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,540
Once you take over,

100
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,500
you'll soon be the king
of Xiatong's underworld.

101

You can do whatever you want.

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,020
But there's one thing

103
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,420
you absolutely can't touch.

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,820
What is it? Please tell me.

105
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,460
Mr. Jiang says you can't

106
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
lay a finger on Tu Hongjiang.

107
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,900
So Mr. Jiang wants to

108
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,020
let him off the hook?

109
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,860
Of course not.

110
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,180
He just doesn't think

111
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,220
you're qualified to take him on yet.

112
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,740
I'm not qualified?

113
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,300
I don't like the sound of that.

114
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,940
I've been dealing with him for 20 years.

115
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,340

can outplay him except me!

Don't be mad.

120

If you disagree,

122
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,060
you can take it up with Mr. Jiang.

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,700

124
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,020
Sorry about that.

126
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,660
leave him alone,

127
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,980

How do we get our money back?

192
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,140
- Answer us!
- Answer us!

193
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,820
- Pay us back!
- Pay us back!

194
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,260
Yeah!

195
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,020
- Pay us back!
- Pay us back!

196
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
Calm down.

197
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,260
Calm down!

198
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,500
[Han Group]
I'll repay every debt

199
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,540
my father owed!

200
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,100
If you don't believe me,

201
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,740
I'll write new IOUs.

202
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,940
You'll really write new IOUs?

203
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,740
When?

204
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,700
Yeah, when?

205
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
I'll do it today.

206
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,860
Alright.

207
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,780
Mr. Wang,

208
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,100
take them to the finance office.

209
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,660
Follow me.

210
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,460
One at a time.

211
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,780
One at a time. Take it easy.

212
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,940
Tu,

213
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,780
what's your take on Han Weidong's death?

214
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,020
Based on the scene investigation,

215
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,660
homicide's been ruled out.

216
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
I don't believe he'd jump
to escape his problems.

217
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,660
You're saying someone pushed him to it?

218
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,100
Weidong and I met back in the army.

219
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,780
He had no means,

220
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,600
and it was impossible for him

221
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,920
to get involved
with drug trafficking on his own.

222
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,340
Not long after he left the force,

223
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,580
he started his company.

224
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,180
He said

225
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,020
he made his money in transport.

226
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,020
I didn't think too much about it.

227
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,500
I was just happy for him.

228
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,020
But later, I thought about it.

229
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,140
There's no way he could have made
that much money

230
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,700
that fast

231
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,380
just from transport.

232
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,900
And during that time,

233
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,420
he was drinking a lot.

234
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,300
Right?

235
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,220
He seemed deeply preoccupied.

236
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,540
If I'd been there for him more,

237
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,500
maybe none of this would've happened.

238
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,700
I know you two had a special bond.

239
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,540
But Han Weidong was in the wrong.

240
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,380
This isn't on you.

241
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,660
We joined the army

242
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,660
and became cops together.

243
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,260
He never should've turned to drugs.

244
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,220
What a pity.

245
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,020
I know you wanted
to take the fall for him.

246
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,380
So, you insisted you were the one
who fired that shot.

247
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
And Han Weidong?

248
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,700
From what I've learned,

249
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,660
he was too shocked

250
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,220
to speak.

251
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,420
If not

252
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,100
for your gun records,

253
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,780
I think he

254
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,180
would have just

255
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,180
let you take the fall for him.

256
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,740
His family was struggling.

257
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,860
He needed the job more than I did.

258
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,980
No matter what his reasons were,

259
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,820
he shouldn't have turned
to drug trafficking.

260
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,660
And he kept at it for years.

261
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,180
No remorse.

262
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,100
He was driven by greed.

263
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,780
No excuse for that.

264
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,420
Have some water.

265
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,740
So, this is the situation.

266
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,460
All our accounts have been frozen.

267
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,220
There's no cash left
to pay the salaries.

268
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,180
Contact the bank for me.

269
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,220
I can take out a mortgage on the house.

270
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,340
We need to pay the employees
what they're owed.

271
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,180
Don't you know

272
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,540
the property and company assets

273
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,780
are already mortgaged?

274
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,460
Everything's mortgaged?

275
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,420
Then where did the money go?

276
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,500
It was all used
for the company's daily operations.

277
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,700
Fine.

278
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,820
I'll figure something else out.

279
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,860
I want to work at the company.

280
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,980
Is that okay?

281
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,060
Of course.

282
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,540
It's your family's company.

283
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,540
But

284
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,180
what about your current job?

285
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,500
I'll handle it.

286
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,740
Mr. Jiang,

287
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,300
you were right.

288
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,780
Sanmahu

289
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,100
is furious that you won't let him

290
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,980
touch Tu Hongjiang.

291
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,820
People from the company
have been called in

292
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,100
for questioning at the police station.

293
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,020
I just got back from being questioned.

294
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,100
Time's running out.

295
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,500
Since he's in such a hurry to die,

296
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,500
give him a push.

297
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,780
Keep an eye on him.

298
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,500
Update me anytime.

299
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,220
Understood.

300
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,820
- Mr. Wang.
- Mr. Wang.

301
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,660
Working late?

302
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,140
Were you looking for me?

303
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,260
Told you to go to the northern frontier
and clean up the mess.

304
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,300
Why haven't you left?

305
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,420
I was supposed to leave tonight.

306
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,900
But I heard something.

307
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,300
I'd like to talk to you about it.

308
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,980
Mr. Jiang.

309
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,900
I'm telling you the truth.

310
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,300
Do you think it's possible?

311
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,900
I see.

312
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,860
So you want to take over
Han Weidong's operations.

313
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,820
I don't have that kind of ambition.

314
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,100
I just want to

315
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,060
help you

316
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,780
manage part of the business.

317
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,980
Someone else has already volunteered.

318
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
You

319
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,860
don't need to worry about this.

320
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,660
Are you handing it all over to Sanmahu?

321
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,460
Mr. Han and I

322
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,020
built this territory
in Xiatong together.

323
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,300
We figured out

324
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,220
the northern frontier route bit by bit.

325
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,580
You're just gonna
let Sanmahu take it all?

326
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,820
That doesn't seem right.

327
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,260
With Han Weidong dead,
this matter is settled.

328
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,540
Drug trafficking is too dangerous.

329
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,780
Go to the northern frontier
and take over the Han family's mines.

330
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,980
Then you can go straight.

331
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,020
I know you're looking out for me.

332
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,500
But

333
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,260
I don't know the first thing
about mining.

334
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,620
Five years ago,
you didn't know anything either.

335
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,620
Now you run

336
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,980
all of Xiatong's operations.

337
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,180
So,

338
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,140
don't underestimate

339
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,900
your ability to start over.

340
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,900
Impossible.

341
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,500
If I get caught now,

342
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,780
I'm dead for sure.

343
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,580
There's no going straight for me.

344
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,540
As long as you're not caught,

345
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,900
there's still a chance.

346
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm not giving

347
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,420
Xiatong's operations to Sanmahu.

348
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,980
I'm getting out for good.

349
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,500
If that's the case,

350
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,620
then I guess I have to give up.

351
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,580
But

352
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,460
if I get caught someday

353
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,780
and can't hold out, and end up

354
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,500
telling the cops about you...

355
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,700
Are you threatening me?

356
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,820
I just want a chance

357
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,980
to control my own fate.

358
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,940
I won't let you down.

359
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,580
Fine.

360
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,940
I'll give you

361
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,340
a fair shot against Sanmahu.

362
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,660
May the best man win.

363
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,620
You'll have to live
with the consequences.

364
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,420
Uncle.

365
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,180
I went through

366
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,140
Mabao's list again.

367
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,580
A few got caught.

368
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
A few ran.

369
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,340
Only three are left.

370
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,420
They say the heat's too intense now,

371
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,740
so they're afraid to take the goods.

372
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,020
What do we do?

373
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,980
It's good that they're afraid.

374
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,900
Anyone bold enough to ask for that much

375
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,180
is either trying to screw us over,

376
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,540
or

377
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,340
is a cop's informant.

378
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,300
Hello?

379
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,060
Mr. Sanmahu,

380
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,420
Elder Sun

381
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,500
from the Da'an League just sent word.

382
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,340
Says Qi Lianshan's nephew,

383
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,140
Qi Fengzi, wants to join us.

384
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,580
Asks if we'll take him in.

385
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,660
He says he'll vouch for him.

386
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,260
If Elder Sun vouches for him,
we can't say no.

387
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,460
Well,

388
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,100
put him under you.

389
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,420
Keep an eye on him for three months.

390
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,740
If he's got what it takes,

391
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,260
send him

392
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,380
to the northern frontier

393
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,660
to take back

394
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,580
Qi Lianshan's turf.

395
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,420
Understood.

The Dragon Unleashed
drug trafficking ring

402
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,900
in Xiatong has been basically wiped out.

403
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,860
Only Sun Bojun remains at large.

404
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
He goes by Mr. Sun.

405
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,100
Sir,

406
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,980
has the merged case report

407
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,220
I submitted

408
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,740
on Sanmahu's criminal group
been approved yet?

409
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,980
Mr. Tai approved.

410
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
The official documents

411
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,780
will be issued to Xiatong today.

412
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,060
It's merged into the joint task force.

413
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,860
You and Zhang Cheng
will remain in charge.

414
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,700
Call me if you need

415
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,100
any coordination.

416
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,100
Got it.

417
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,100
Thanks.

418
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,260
Mr. Tu.

419
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,500
Any news?

420
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,860
East suburbs.

421
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,300
Around the Shisitiao area, Wuliying.

422
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,380
That's as specific

423
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
as it gets.

424
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,580
Alright.

425
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,660
Leave the rest to me.

426
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,980
Not a single one.

427
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,780
What's going on

428
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,140
with you today, old timer?

429
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,860
Haven't fished in a while, maybe.

430
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,020
Or maybe I'm just getting old.

431
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
What happened?

432
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,340
Nothing.

433
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,860
Nothing.

434
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,580
Mr. Tu.

435
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,940
Lately, I've been
really missing my hometown.

436
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,460
I want to go back for a visit.

437
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,060
I remember

438
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,340
you have no family left there, right?

439
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,380
Yes.

440
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,780
I left at fourteen,

441
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,620
and never planned to go back.

442
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,420
Lately, I don't know why,

443
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,940
but I keep dreaming about the place.

444
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,700
It's where I was born and raised.

445
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,140
To return to one's roots, I guess.

446
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,180
Feels like it's time to go back.

447
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,260
For the first time,

448
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,900
I've felt like I've lived a long life.

449
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,420
You're saying that

450
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,780
in front of an old man like me?

451
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,100
It feels long enough.

452
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,460
All my old friends are gone,

453
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,740
one by one.

454
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,420
Especially Mr. Qian.

455
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,660
He helped so many people,

456
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,420
and did so much good.

457
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,900
But he didn't meet a good end.

458
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,580
Mr. Tu.

459
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,940
Is this how it ends

460
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,500
for people like us?

461
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,420
What goes around, comes around.

462
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,180
Don't overthink it.

463
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,140
Let me know before you leave.

464
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,380
We'll get together.

465
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,860
These gatherings

466
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,740
are numbered now.

467
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,980
I understand.

468
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,500
Send me the materials later.

469
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,340
I'll let you know when I receive them.

470
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,580
Alright, that's it.

471
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,140
Han Xin.

472
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,020
I'm leaving.

473
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,100
I wanted to

474
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,660
say goodbye to Mr. Tu and the others,

475
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,460
but they're all out on missions.

476
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,100
Wait a moment.

477
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,740
All packed?

478
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,060
Yes.

479
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,100
I forgot something,

480
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,140
so I came back to get it.

481
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,380
Is it because of your father?

482
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,220
Not entirely.

483
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,900
There are issues he left behind

484
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,060
that I need to resolve.

485
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,220
But my role as a cop
doesn't allow it.

486
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,220
Resigning

487
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,300
is my best option.

488
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,140
Han Xin,

489
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,060
you are you.

490
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,260
And your father is your father.

491
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,220
Some things are clearly right or wrong
in the eyes of the law.

492
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,540
Some are judged by morality.

493
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,060
You don't have to carry this alone.

494
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,260
And you shouldn't
bear the weight of his mistakes.

495
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,980
Mr. Zhan.

496
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,540
I know your father was a hero

497
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,820
and a martyr.

498
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,180
You're stepping

499
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,460
into the responsibility
and mission he left behind.

500
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,180
So am I.

501
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,100
Though my father's gone,

502
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,180
the company remains.

503
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,060
So do the responsibilities he left.

504
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,620
I have to take them on.

505
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,260
No matter the outcome,

506
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,700
I'll face it.

507
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,100
Han Xin,

508
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,460
remember this.

509
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,460
Your colleagues here

510
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,460
will always be your comrades
and friends.

511
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,820
If you run into trouble,

512
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,980
come to us.

513
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,900
There's something

514
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,020
I need to ask of you.

515
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,900
Go ahead.

516
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,100
I know the evidence
at the scene suggests

517
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
my father killed himself.

518
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,420
But I firmly believe
he wouldn't do that.

519
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,060
I will find proof.

520
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,740
Please don't give up on this, alright?

521
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,180
We still haven't caught Sanmahu
and Sun Bojun.

522
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,260
As long as there's the slightest doubt,

523
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,860
we'll never close the case.

524
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,340
That's good.

525
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,980

Bridge. There's a bridge.

543
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Alright.

544
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,780

Mr. Tu.

548
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,420
Cuff him.

549
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,060
Let's go.

550
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,980
Be gentle.

551
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,540
Behave.

552
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,700
Xin.

553
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,700
I suppose I should call you Ms. Han now.

554
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,500
These are the financial statements
from all the subsidiaries.

555
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,700
Except for Dasheng Transport,
which is still under seizure,

556
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,340
the others are operating normally.

557
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,700
Take a look first.

558
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,020
Let me know if you have any questions.

559
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,380
Thanks.

560
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,300
Thanks to you,

561
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,020
the company is still running

562
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,140
and the employees can keep their jobs.

563
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,740
Don't mention it.

564
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,540
Mr. Han has always been good to me.

565
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,420
When I came back from the south,

566
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,500
my business had failed.

567
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,980
If Mr. Han hadn't given me a hand,

568
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,700
I'd be working
on an assembly line somewhere.

569
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,940
Even though he's gone,

570
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,620
I'll make sure
to keep the company in good shape.

571
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,500
By the way,

572
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,380
this was Mr. Han's office.

573
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,060
It was just unsealed when you arrived.

574
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,260
Haven't had time to tidy up.

575
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,780
Let me know if you
have any concerns about it.

576
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,900
Should we bring in
a feng shui consultant?

577
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,780
Or maybe move to a different office?

578
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,860
No need.

579
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,940
I used to be a cop.

580
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,740
I'm as tough as nails.

581
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,580
Besides,

582
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,900
being in a place where my father worked

583
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,300
will only make me more motivated.

584
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,180
Alright then.

585
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,580
Take your time getting settled.

586
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,660
If you need anything,

587
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,420
just reach out to your secretary, Li.

588
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,140
Dad,

589
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,100
what were you doing here
all these years?

590
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Where do I

591
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,940
even start?

592
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,740
You said

593
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,780
the simplest way

594
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,060
is often the most effective.

595
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,100
Let's get started.

596
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,460
Mr. Jiang.

597
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,420
It's me.

598
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,460
I think Sanmahu's about to snap.

599
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,020
He's on the edge,

600
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,340
ready to go all out.

601
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Then let him.

602
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,620
But you said the timing wasn't right.

603
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,820
Should we wait a bit longer?

604
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,620
Plans change.

605
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,300
But maybe it's for the best.

606
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,460
Stick with him for now.

607
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,060
I'll call him tonight

608
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,740
and tell him what to do.

609
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,820
Understood.

610
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,380
Do you need something?

611
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,540
I looked through the materials,

612
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,340
but I couldn't understand them.

613
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,700
Can I see the company's

614
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,980
recent financial statements?

615
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,140
So I can get a clearer picture

616
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
of the financial situation.

617
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,900
I'll have the accountant
bring them to you.

618
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,900
I already asked.

619
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,980
They're closing the books
at the end of the month,

620
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,940
so we'll have to wait until next month.

621
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,420
Do you have a backup copy?

622
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,580
Yes.

623
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,620
Just a moment.

624
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,620
Everything is here.

625
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,740
Let me know

626
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,620
if you have any questions.

627
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,100
Thank you.

628
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,780
From Majia Village?

629
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,660
Yeah.

630
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,700
Who's Sanmahu to you?

631
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,180
He's my uncle.

632
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,900
Also my idol.

633
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Have you seen him lately?

634
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,140
No.

635
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Think carefully.

636
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,180
Have you?

637
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,180
You can say I have if you want.

638
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,540
But I don't know where he is.

639
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,340
Officer,

640
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,220
is that okay?

641
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,980
Kid,

642
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,660
do you know who I am?

643
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,820
Mr. Tu.

644
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Heard of me?

645
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,900
I know you guys from Majia Village
have guts and can't be messed with.

646
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,180
But let me tell you,

647
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,500
ten years ago,
I could've crushed you guys.

648
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,100
And I still can.

649
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,940
Think hard.

650
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,620
Say it when you've figured it out.

651
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,260
Mr. Tu.

652
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,380
Mr. Tu!

653
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,140
Mr. Tu.

654
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,260
I'd like to

655
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,540
treat you and the other guys
in First Division tonight.

656
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,540
How about it?

657
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,020
No other intentions.

658
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,980
The bureau has decided to
merge the cases for investigation.

659
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,060
So Sanmahu is our shared target now.

660
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,180
You've been going against him
for over 20 years.

661
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,500
You're the veteran here.

662
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,820
I can handle drug dealers,

663
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,780
but when it comes to dealing
with an cunning fox like Sanmahu,

664
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,180
I'll need to learn from you.

665
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,420
Alright.

666
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,940
At seven tonight.

667
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,100
I'll pick the place.

668
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,660
You're paying.

669
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,860
Alright.

670
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,100
Mr. Sanmahu.

671
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,940
Have something to eat.

672
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,380
No sense of timing at all.

673
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,820
I'm starting to think

674
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,620
this Jiang guy

675
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,620
is a fraud!

676
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,540
Hello?

677
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,180
Mr. Jiang.

678
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,020
Finally, your called.

679
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,140
I heard what happened during the day.

680
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,260
Then do it.

681
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,660
Mr. Sanmahu,

682
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,020
let me remind you,

683
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,220
taking action against Tu Hongjiang
is a big deal.

684
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,980
He's a fixer for the law-abiding,

685
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,500
a grim reaper for the underworld.

686
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,300
If you're going to move,

687
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,300
make it clean.

688
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,060
No hesitation, no loose ends.

689
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,020
Either

690
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,740
take him out in one strike,

691
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,300
or

692
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,900
be prepared to burn together.

693
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,300
Understood.

694
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,260
Perfect, Mr. Jiang.

695
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,780
With your support,

696
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,980
I'm more confident

697
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,540
about all the scores

698
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,020
with him.

699
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,100
Actually,

700
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,380
I have a more thorough, reliable plan.

701
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,780
Today's incident was fate.

702
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,020
Then let's just follow it

703
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,620
and finish him tomorrow.

704
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,860
Let me remind you again.

705
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,860
Don't act rashly.

706
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,500
Stick to my plan.

707
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,300
If all goes well,

708
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,280

Mr. Zhan.

721
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,260
Hey, don't.

722
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,020
By age,

723
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,700
I am almost as old as your uncle.

724
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,460
By seniority,

725
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,100
we're peers.

726
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,100
Your father was my master.

727
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,380
He taught me a lot.

728
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,780
How to conduct myself

729
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,060
and how to handle things.

730
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,340
I'll never forget that.

731
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,500
I know sometimes

732
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,060
you look down on my methods.

733
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,020
I won't hold it against you.

734
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,300
Times are different,

735
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,740
and so are the people
and situations we face.

736
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,860
But no matter when

737
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,900
or what era,

your father is your father.

My master is my master.

740

That won't change.

741
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,340
I'll remember that.

742
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,700
How was this money collected?

Why is Sanmahu on here too?

00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,820
I could find my way even blindfolded.

755
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,140
Go back.

756
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,220
I'll get going then.

757
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:45,980
You all go ahead.

758
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,940
I'll walk him home.

759
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:47,900
Bye.

760
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,420
Mr. Tu, I've got things to do.

761
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:48,900
I'll head out.

762
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,540
Alright.

763
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,420
Mr. Tu, take care.

764
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,380
Sneaking off early again?

765
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,780
What's your problem?

766
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
Watch where you're going.

767
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,180
The road's wide,

768
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,300
and you crash right here?

769
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,700
Mr. Sanmahu has a message for you.

770
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,180
Tomorrow, T766, hard seat.

771
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,260
If you've got any guts,

772
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,900
come alone.

773
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,700
Tell him

774
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,740
I'll be there on time.

775
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,780
Tomorrow's a big day.

776
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,780
Should I do something?

777
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,380
Be ready.

778
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,260
Don't worry about Tu Hongjiang.

779
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,060
Just keep your eyes on Sanmahu.

780
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,060
Whether he kills Tu Hongjiang or not

781
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,060
doesn't matter.

782
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,300
What matters is whether
you get the chance to take over

783
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,980
Xiatong's business.

784
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,180
Understood.

785
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,900
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

786
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,740
You're right.

787
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,060
May the best man win.

788
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,180
It's him or me.

789
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,140
Tomorrow, only one of us two

790
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,180
will be coming to see you.
