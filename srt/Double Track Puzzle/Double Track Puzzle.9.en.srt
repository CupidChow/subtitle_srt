1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,940
Who knows when we'll

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,140
[1987]
see each other again after this.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,340
Be careful out there.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,180
Don't worry.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,100
Changfeng,

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,980
this is far enough.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,740
Always keep

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,020
Xing's Precepts in mind.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:24,900
Got it.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,020
It's what Master demands.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,820
And also what we need
for our own discipline.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,900
Alright.

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,940
You still remember them?

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,180
Yeah.

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,020
Like the back of my hand.

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,780
Recite them then.

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,100
Do not kill.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,660
Do not

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,220
corner another into the empty end.

20
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,260
It's the "dead end".

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,580
Into the dead end?

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,580
Alright.

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,340
Do not

24
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,660
corner another into the dead end.

25
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,380
Do not harm the elderly, weak,
sick, or the disabled.

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,180
The elderly, weak,
disabled, or the sick.

27
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,540
Close enough.

28
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,460
Do not... Do not fight among our own.

29
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,660
Do not clash with the authorities.

30
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,740
Do not use our skills

31
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,820
to profit in other ways.

32
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,380
Am I right?

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,940
Pretty much.

34
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,380
Master said

35
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,380
though you came to this craft midway,

36
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,340
with the skills you already had,

37
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,740
you've shown real talent.

38
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,300
Other disciples

39
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,940
take six years of dedicated training

40
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,620
before they can finish the training.

41
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,300
But you did it in three.

42
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,020
Master is proud.

43
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,340
The journey ahead is long.

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,740
No matter where life takes you,

45
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,940
I hope

46
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,380
you'll always keep Xing's Precepts

47
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,820
in your mind.

48
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:33,820
I will.

49
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,100
Changfeng,

50
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,780
please tell Master

51
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,100
I will always

52
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,620
remember his teachings

53
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,900
and never bring shame to you all.

54
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,580
Alright. Head back now.

55
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,140
Master needs someone by his side.

56
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,740
Alright.

57
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,380
Take care.

58
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,060
Just wait. I'm gonna

59
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,260
make it big.

[Episode 9]

63
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,180
I'll give you this one chance.

64
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,900
What happened

65
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,460
to my three batches of goods?

66
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,380
Spell it out.

67
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,460
If I hear one word that doesn't add up,

68
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,740
you're both die here.

69
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,980
Mr. Sun,

70
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,620
the first batch was hidden
by Zheng Xiaoshan.

71
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,140
We never found it.

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,460
The second

73
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,620
got snatched on the train

74
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,140
by those from the northern frontier.

75
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,460
This batch must've been taken
by them too.

76
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,780
And, Mr. Sun,

77
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,820
our guy who went to pick up
the goods on the train

78
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,580
got caught by the cops.

79
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,940
You think I'm stupid?

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
What are they, clairvoyant?

81
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,220
How could they possibly know

82
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,620
when we were picking up the goods?

83
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,180
And how could they know

84
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,500
exactly where?

85
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,740
Mr. Sun,

86
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,140
look at us.

87
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,900
We've got no reason to lie to you.

88
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,020
Could it be

89
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,580
that the supplier's setting us up?

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,100
Or maybe

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,420
the cops

92
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,300
planted an informant
inside the suppliers,

93
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,700
and it led right to us.

94
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,940
How else

95
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,020
could we get hit three times in a row?

96
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,380
And every time with cops involved?

97
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,980
This is way too strange.

98
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,660
You're all useless.

99
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,020
I don't care where these people

100
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,140
are from.

101
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,900
And I don't care what they're after.

102
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,420
All I know is

103
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,140
I paid

104
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,980
but got no goods.

105
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,540
And the courier

106
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,580
got taken down right at the pickup spot.

107
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,180
Now the supplier keeps hounding me

108
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,420
for an explanation.

109
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,220
This whole mess is on you two.

110
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,740
So I don't care how you do it,

111
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,660
you will clean this mess up.

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,020
My goods will move

113
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,660
the way they used to.

114
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,620
Your lives,

115
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,420
and every part of you,

116
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,860
are mine to hold onto for now.

117
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,780
Understand?

118
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,860
Understood.

119
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,380
Mr. Sun,

120
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,620
this is the last chance
you're giving us.

121
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,420
We won't waste it.

122
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,060
We'll take care of this cleanly.

123
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,900
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

124
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,540
And

125
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
about the supplier...

126
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,140
Until we know what's really going on,

127
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,540
we're not taking in any new goods.

128
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,540
You two better hurry up

129
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,620
and clean up every last mess.

130
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,860
If you can talk it out,

131
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,980
then settle it.

132
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,820
If not,

133
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
settle it another way.

134
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,820
Tu, you're really playing with fire.

135
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,140
When you pulled stunts before,

136
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,020
our own people could cover for you.

137
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,540
But this involves the task force now.

138
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,500
If anything goes wrong,

139
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
even I can't protect you.

140
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,700
You know exactly

141
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,180
what kind of guy Sanmahu is.

142
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,940
He's a cold-blooded killer.

143
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,060
I've planted an informant around him.

144
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,740
He's gambling with his life.

145
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,580
It's not that I don't want to
loop in Zhan Peng.

146
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,100
I just don't dare.

147
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
I don't know who that kid takes after.

148
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,860
He's all about rules and principles.

149
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,340
Well...

150
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,340
If he turns his back on me,

151
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,060
and exposes my plan,

152
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,060
then we're in real trouble.

153
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,780
Now I get

154
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,700
why you agreed to Zhan Peng's plan.

155
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,100
Who said I agreed to his plan?

156
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,020
Don't play dumb with me!

157
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,780
You backed him
when he sent Dagou out as bait

158
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,980
because you're
using the same move yourself!

159
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,540
I knew you were up to no good.

160
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,580
No, I...

161
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,940
What choice did I have?

162
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,420
I couldn't say it out loud,

163
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
but the job still had to be done.

164
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,260
So I nudged him along.

165
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:00,900
Come in.

166
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,660
Zhan.

167
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,260
Mr. Xiong. Mr. Tu.

168
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,500
Tu just briefed me

169
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,700
on the situation.

170
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,300
Thieves stealing drugs

171
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,780
is indeed unusual.

172
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,340
But it's not entirely impossible.

173
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,860
Right?

174
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,660
They've been watching that crew

175
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,780
for a long time.

176
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,380
We just happened to
intercept the drugs this time.

177
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,420
That counts as a credit.

178
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,020
Mr. Tu,

179
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,940
I was out of line on the platform.

180
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,980
First, I should thank you.

181
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,140
We owe it to you.

182
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,100
Losing the drugs is no small matter.

183
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,900
Then comes the question.

184
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,860
Question?

185
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,140
What question?

186
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:37,860
Mr. Xiong,

187
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,260
you already said it just now.

188
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,100
Regarding thieves stealing drugs?

189
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,020
But now the question is gone.

190
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,220
Only pressure remains.

191
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,060
I've drafted
a follow-up investigation plan.

192
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,940
It is regarding this issue.

193
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,380
Please have a look, Mr. Xiong.

194
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,580
Regarding what?

195
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,260
The thieves stealing drugs?

196
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,100
Yes.

197
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,180
The core idea is simple.

198
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,460
We hope Mr. Tu

199
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,140
can provide more support.

200
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,460
If he

201
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,580
can share more details,

202
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,060
it'll really help the task force.

203
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
Please review

204
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
the details, Mr. Xiong.

205
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,460
If there's nothing else,

206
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,380
I'll be leaving.

207
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,740
Alright.

208
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,100
Go ahead.

209
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,380
Since when did this kid
change his style?

210
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,900
Starting to remind me of his father.

211
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,220
Mr. Sun,

212
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,100
their crew

213
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,180
is led by that guy Sanmahu.

214
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,860
He used to be a train pickpocket.

215
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,140
No idea why he's

216
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,820
trying to break into the drug trade now.

217
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,540
Sure,

218
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,700
they've got our stuff,

219
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,780
but without distribution channels,

220
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,900
they can't handle it.

221
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,580
They came to me before,

222
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,820
but I blew them off.

223
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,340
That's why this happened.

224
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,340
Forget

225
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,060
how they figured out the route
we move our stuff.

226
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,340
Those batches

227
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,500
are cash in our hands.

228
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,620
But in theirs? They're time bombs.

229
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,540
The more they have,

230
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
the bigger the risk.

231
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,020
So,

232
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,740
should we reach out to them?

233
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,660
First,

234
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,180
we bait them

235
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
with our channels.

236
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,780
Second,

237
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,660
we see what they're really made of.

238
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,580
If it works out,

239
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,100
we will work together.

240
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,460
If not,

241
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,660
we will walk away clean.

242
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,740
What do you think?

243
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,300
How you handle it is your business.

244
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,020
I only care about two things.

245
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,500
We've got to make money.

246
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,380
And we call the shots.

247
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,900
I'll say this one last time.

248
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,940
You've got five days

249
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,300
to clean up every mess.

250
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,740
If you

251
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,140
get any other ideas before it's done,

252
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,260
this won't just be about you two.

253
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,860
His blind mother

254
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,660
will go down with you.

255
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,020
None of this

256
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,220
is surprising.

257
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,900
Changfeng,

258
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,460
now,

259
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,700
the local bosses in Xiatong

260
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,860
are finally beaten down.

261
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,020
Now they're begging to talk.

262
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,340
Dou and Taohua

263
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,900
deserve the credit

264
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,460
for that.

265
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,140
We didn't do much.

266
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,820
It was

267
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,180
all your planning, sir.

268
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,340
Dou and I

269
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,100
were just following your orders.

270
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,580
Taohua knows how to talk.

271
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:43,900
See?

272
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,980
Don't worry.

273
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,980
Once the distribution network

274
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,380
is fully open,

275
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll make sure

276
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,580
everyone gets their share

277
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,860
of the credit.

278
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,460
Victory is within reach.

279
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,420
Long,

280
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,260
where is this place?

281
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,740
Smack dab in the middle of nowhere.

282
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,740
This isn't some shady joint, is it?

283
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,260
If someone gets killed here

284
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,340
and dumped in the reservoir,

285
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,380
no one would ever find the body.

286
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,660
Relax.

287
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,940
They are in the business
of risking their necks.

288
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,020
Meeting here makes sense.

289
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Dou,

290
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,180
sorry I'm late.

291
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,340
[Favors and Loyalty]
You definitely have high standards.

292
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,300
It's mealtime,
and you still haven't eaten.

293
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,620
Don't let the rough look fool you.

294
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm a good cook.

295
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,140
I saw some geese outside.

296
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,420
Let me cook you

297
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,660
an iron-pot goose stew.

298
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,700
It's incredibly good.

299
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,060
Let's go, Mao.

300
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,940
We'll kill a goose.

301
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,260
Dou,

302
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,060
what do you mean?

303
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,100
Incredibly good.

304
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,100
Mr. Long, you're being so generous.

305
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,420
How could we let you do this yourself?

306
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,060
Last time you gave us so much,

307
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,820
we almost couldn't handle it.

308
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,420
Yeah, what's that old saying again?

309
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,180
You don't move when pulled,
but you do when whipped.

310
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,380
Sounds like it's talking about

311
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,300
you hicks.

312
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,900
Pig-headed!

313
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,100
Enough!

314
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,380
You men always

315
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,500
resort to knives and guns.

316
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,540
Aren't we here to talk business?

317
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,780
Money comes from peace.

318
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,020
Long,

319
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,780
I've prepared plenty of good dishes.

320
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,820
Let's sit down.

321
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,700
Ms. Bai is right.

322
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,820
Dou,

323
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,780
I was

324
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,140
out of line before.

325
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,300
Hope you can forgive me.

326
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,140
You're magnanimous.

327
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,620
And I really want to taste your dishes.

328
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,260
We've got a long future ahead.

329
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,780
As long as you like it,

330
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,380
I'll make it for you.

331
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,100
I'll like anything you make.

332
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,820
After you.

333
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,140
I've seen

334
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,260
what both of you are capable of.

335
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,620
Now

336
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
all I feel

337
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,540
is regret.

338
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,660
Mao,

339
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,540
let's toast Dou and Ms. Bai.

340
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,220
Mao.

341
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,860
That's more like it.

342
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,380
Dou,

343
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,380
I'm looking forward to working with you.

344
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,780
But

345
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,300
let me be clear

346
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,900
about one thing.

347
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,460
Selling drugs

348
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,620
isn't like your line of work.

349
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,100
If you get caught,

350
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,620
you're dead.

351
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,740
So

352
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,460
if we're gonna be tied together,

353
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,420
you have to offer a pledge of loyalty.

354
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,420
A pledge?

355
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,900
Doing something big
to prove your loyalty.

356
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,420
Like

357
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,660
taking someone out together.

358
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,900
So nobody can turn back.

359
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,380
Long,

360
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,140
next time, just say it.

361
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,660
Stop feeding it to me bit by bit.

362
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,860
Now that we're

363
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,900
in the same boat,

364
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,140
we stick together

365
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,060
and work together.

366
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:27,860
Let's do it.

367
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,420
Long,

368
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,300
why don't you spell it out?

369
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,700
Here's the thing.

370
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,740
One of my men got caught by the cops.

371
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,820
Luckily,

372
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,180
you swapped the real stuff.

373
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,500
He wasn't caught red-handed.

374
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,780
But we don't know

375
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,180
if he'll make it through.

376
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,900
And we don't know

377
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
how long he can hold out.

378
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,460
But that kid knows too much.

379
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,260
We have to get rid of him.

380
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,020
And honestly,

381
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,020
it's a tough job.

382
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,060
Never mind.

383
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,420
It's fine.

384
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,180
Dou,

385
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,140
if it's too difficult,
just forget it.

386
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,140
Let's keep drinking.

387
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,540
Come on.

388
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,980
Wait.

389
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,020
You're saying

390
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,220
he's still inside the police station?

391
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,100
Yes.

392
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,580
Hua Long,

393
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,500
you think I'm stupid?

394
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,820
What?

395
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,340
You want me
to go into the police station

396
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,540
and take him out there?

397
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,980
Scared?

398
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,060
Dou.

399
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,500
We're partners.

400
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,500
We wouldn't make you handle it alone.

401
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,940
We'll get him out of the station.

402
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,180
After that,

403
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
whether he ends up dead is up to you.

404
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,020
Fine.

405
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,380
Once he's out,

406
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,300
I'll handle

407
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,380
the rest.

408
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,060
Now we're talking!

409
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,900
Dou!

410
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,740
Come on.

411
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,740
A toast to you.

412
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:57,980
Ms. Bai,

413
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,940
here's to

414
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,180
a smooth partnership.

415
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,300
No rush.

416
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,220
We can have this drink

417
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,660
after you get him out.

418
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,420
Okay.

419
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,860
Then we'll

420
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,300
save the toast for your victory.

421
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,420
Changfeng,

422
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,820
what are you doing here?

423
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,900
Just bored.

424
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,860
I drank too much inside.

425
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,460
Thought I'd went out to clear my head,

426
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,460
then I got lost.

427
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,620
No idea how I ended up here.

428
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,260
You've got a lot of ephedra
planted here.

429
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,220
And all this equipment.

430
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,780
What's all this for?

431
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,020
Starting a pharmaceutical plant?

432
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,220
Something like that.

433
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,060
You're full of secrets.

434
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,460
Oh, come on.

435
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,900
Don't make it sound so distant.

436
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,980
Between us,

437
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,140
there are no secrets.

438
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,580
Changfeng,

439
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,380
come this way.

440
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,060
Let me show you around.

441
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,900
Come on.

442
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,860
This place

443
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
used to be a state-run farm.

444
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,220
Too remote.

445
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,900
Got abandoned long ago.

446
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,540
I like it that way.

447
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,740
Out here, nobody's watching.

448
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,180
I bought it

449
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
six years back.

450
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,820
Did some renovations.

451
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,580
At first, I thought

452
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,700
I'd raise camels

453
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,740
and horses.

454
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,180
Didn't work out.

455
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,420
They all died.

456
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,220
By the way,

457
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,620
someone used to

458
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,940
grow poppies here before.

459
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,980
But that's not our business.

460
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,420
We grow medicinal herbs.

461
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,020
Ephedra's usually

462
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,900
just for calming nerves.

463
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,700
Normally,

464
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,380
you wouldn't need this much.

465
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,820
I don't really know much about that.

466
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,180
Hired two experts.

467
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,340
Cost me a fortune.

468
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,340
They've just made a breakthrough.

469
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,300
Let me tell you,

470
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,540
if

471
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,500
this works,

472
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
we are

473
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,700
sitting on a gold mine.

474
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,820
Sanmahu,

475
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,100
Master said

476
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,020
not to profit in other ways.

477
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,220
I know.

478
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,220
I know.

479
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,660
It's too stuffy in here.

480
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,780
Tell you what,

481
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,820
today,

482
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,180
I'll take you out.

483
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,140
Let's get

484
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,580
some fresh air.

485
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:34,980
Let's go.

486
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,980
[Serve the People]

487
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:50,460
[Sanmahu? Old man? Herder?]

488
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,140
Based on Dagou's statement,

489
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,660
it's clear

490
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,940
that before Sanmahu showed up,

491
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,620
the drug trade in Xiatong

492
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,820
was dominated by one player.

493
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,060
Not because they were tough,

494
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,900
but because they had steady supply.

495
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,020
Sanmahu

496
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,020
has been making moves,

497
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,220
causing all this chaos.

498
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,180
They're definitely

499
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,700
not in it for a one-time deal.

500
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,700
By repeatedly
beating Dragon Unleashed down,

501
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,260
he's probably

502
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
trying to

503
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,940
force them to beg for a partnership.

504
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,460
Dagou took part
in the drug deal this time.

505
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,620
The courier got caught.

506
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,060
Which means he's exposed too.

507
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,180
The only bait we had

508
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,380
is now gone.

509
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,980
What do we do now?

510
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,700
I thought about

511
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,780
how that old man
slipped away in the car.

512
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,740
It definitely has something
to do with Mr. Tu.

513
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,740
So I submitted a report yesterday

514
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,300
requesting to share intel with Mr. Tu.

515
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,860
We're stuck on our end.

516
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,140
Maybe

517
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,860
they'll find another way forward.

518
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,060
I see.

519
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,260
This is quite a place.

520
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,220
Gentle slopes on three sides,

521
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,580
backed by a mountain.

522
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,420
Like a treasure bowl.

523
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,580
It's not easy to find a place like this

524
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,420
in Xiatong.

525
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,900
Why is there

526
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,700
a strange smell?

527
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,620
What is it?

528
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,500
Yeah.

529
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,340
Because of the smell,

530
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,060
we rarely come out.

531
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,540
But today,

532
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,300
I'll take you out

533
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,180
for some fresh air.

534
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,180
Sure.

535
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,580
The car's here.

536
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:23,780
After you.

537
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,460
Sir, over here.

538
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,980
Right here.

539
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,500
Here.

540
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,460
Specs,

541
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,220
let me ask you something.

542
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,340
There's always
this strange smell around here.

543
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,380
Why?

544
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,940
There's a sewage ditch nearby.

545
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,420
It's not too bad right now.

546
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,140
Around five in the morning,

547
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,060
it's so strong
you can't even open your eyes.

548
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,980
After you.

549
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,780
Alright.

550
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
Getting out is such a hassle.

551
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,460
Specs.

552
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,100
I feel like you haven't been

553
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,380
looking well lately.

554
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,300
Sir,

555
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,220
you're right.

556
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,820
I haven't been sleeping well at all.

557
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,020
Stick out your tongue and let me

558
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,980
take a look at the coating.

559
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,260
Come closer.

560
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,700
Crimson tongue. Yellow coating.

561
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,260
What does that mean?

562
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,820
Something evil's working against you.

563
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,540
The stronger the evil,
the more the body fights back.

564
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,380
They're clashing inside you.

565
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,180
So,

566
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,700
am I

567
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,220
done for?

568
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,940
Let me check your pulse.

569
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,700
Your pulse

570
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,780
feels a bit unusual.

571
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,580
Is there a sewage outlet

572
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,460
near where we live?

573
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,740
There's a paper mill nearby.

574
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,180
Probably from there.

575

771
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,580
if you were the cops

772
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300

773

If I were the cop...

775
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,620
I'd think

776

783
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,780
in one of two ways when they see this.

First,

786
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,940

Second,

788

789

956
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,000
Put the bag down.

957
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,420
I...

958
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,160
I'm looking for my brother.

959
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,320
Stand still, Ergou!

960
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,520
Take another step and I'll shoot!

961
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,000
I...

962
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,040
Ergou, don't move!

963
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,440
Tell him to put the bag down!

964
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,400
Or I'll shoot!

965
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,600
Ergou!

966
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,920
Put the bag down!

967
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,960
Listen to me!

968
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,640
No!

969
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,840
Do as I say!

970
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,200
Put it down slowly!

971
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,600
Ergou!

972
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,000
Ergou!

973
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,040
Mr. Zhan!

974
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,820
Let go of me!

975
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,840
Ergou!

976
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,280
Ergou!

977
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,160
Take him back now!

978
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,120
Got it!

979
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,400
Let go of me!

980
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,040
Ergou!

981
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,440
Thrilling, wasn't it?

982
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,120
Quite a show, right?

983
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,000
What are you looking for?

984
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,040
Is this thing?

985
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,680
Come on, he's not your brother.

986
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,360
Why panic?

987
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,200
Ergou has intellectual difficulties.

988
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,440
He can't even speak clearly.

989
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,120
Why kill him?

990
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,160
You're the ones
who started playing dirty.

991
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,360
You set this trap for us to fall into.

992
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,600
Am I wrong?

993
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,600
Don't say I didn't warn you.

994
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,080
Hurry up.

995
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,960
Once Dagou fully realizes
what's happening,

996
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,160
you might not have time to run.
