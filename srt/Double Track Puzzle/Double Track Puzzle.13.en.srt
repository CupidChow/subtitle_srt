00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,860
You caught Specs.

193
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,740
Even in that mess,

194
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,260
Sanmahu didn't lift a finger

195
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,900
to intervene.

196
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,740
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

197
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,540
Mr. Zhan!

198
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,660
A burned body was found
in the southern suburbs.

199
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,380
The situation on the scene suggests

200
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,060
it might be the suspect, Mao.

201
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,180
Nancheng Police Station received

202
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,580
our bulletin on Mao.

203
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,420
They remembered that tattoo pretty well.

204
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,100
So they notified us immediately.

205
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,580
Get a shot over here.

206
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,500
Mr. Zhan.

207
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,780
No signs of a fight.

208
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,180
He was probably moved into the car

209
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,100
after death.

210
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,260
From the scene reconstruction,

211
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,580
the killer shows some
counter-surveillance awareness.

212
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,860
Check the burn residue carefully.

213
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,420
Where's the person who reported it?

214
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,940
Those two over there.

215
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,060
Those two?

216
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,420
Yes.

217
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,620
Hello.

218
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,580
You reported this?

219
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,460
I did,

220
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,260
Officer.

221
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,460
Was the car still on fire

222
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,620
or already burned out

223
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,260
when you reported it?

224
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,100
It was still on fire.

225
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,620
We reported it when we found the guy

226
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,420
while trying to put it out.

227
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,420
Officer,

228
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,700
we've been working all day.
We're exhausted.

229
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,140
Got anything else to ask?

230
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,980
That's all.

231
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,620
Thanks for your cooperation.

232
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,300
You're free to go.

233
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,340
Let's go.

234
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,020
Nanyi,

235
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,260
look into those guys

236
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,380
and see if anything's off.

237
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,020
Understood.

238
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
[Restricted Area]

239
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,220
Mao?

240
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,100
Seems like this

241
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,740
surprises you.

242
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,260
Do you know if he had any enemies?

243
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,540
I just work for pay.

244
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,540
Don't know much.

245
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,780
What about his family?

246
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,540
Mao's mother is blind.

247
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Heard he has a buddy too.

248
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,060
People in the line call him Hua Long.

249
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,460
But I've never met him.

250
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,420
When Mao wasn't around,

251
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,780
Hua Long took care of her.

252
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,660
He even became her godson, I think.

253
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,620
Mr. Sanmahu

254
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,420
really killed

255
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,140
Mao?

256
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,460
Yeah.

257
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,620
He was killed by Sanmahu

258
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,580
and burned beyond recognition.

259
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,900
I knew you were full of lies.

260
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,060
You're already in here,

261
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,500
and you still think Mr. Sanmahu
would get you out?

262
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,260
Alright.

263
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,100
No more stalling.

264
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,940
I won't pry it out of you.

265
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,820
I'll let you out.

266
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,740
Give you your freedom.

267
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Then

268
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,460
I'll throw you

269
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,900
a grand farewell party.

270
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,860
Let all your buddies

271
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,020
know you're out.

272
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,780
Then

273
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,940
let

274
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,900
Mr. Sanmahu

275
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,980
personally

276
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,860
bring you back in.

277
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,220
Come on.

278
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,100
No, no!

279
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,180
Don't, Mr. Tu.

280
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,620
Well,

281
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
I appreciate the concern, really.

282
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,820
But I'm good here.

283
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,260
We don't keep freeloaders here.

284
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,180
No, I...

285
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,940
I'm...

286
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm not a freeloader.

287
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,020
I'll tell you

288
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,260
whatever you want to know.

289
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,060
Alright?

290
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,460
You're offering this yourself.

291
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
Why

292
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,580
did Sanmahu kill Mao?

293
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
I've been wondering too.

294
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,780
Mao

295
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,460
was indeed annoying.

296
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,220
But this

297
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,140
doesn't feel like Mr. Sanmahu's style.

298
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,180
Besides, Mr. Sanmahu's busy

299
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,580
fighting those guys
from the northern frontier.

300
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,300
He wouldn't bother with...

301
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,260
Guys from the northern frontier?

302
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,220
Who?

303
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,580
I just overheard them

304
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,500
talking about some plan or something.

305
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,580
Officer.

306
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,620
Officer.

307
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,700
Mr. Sanmahu

308
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,460
really killed Mao?

309
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,060
Here.

310
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,060
Thanks, Mr. Tu.

311
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,460
Guys from the northern frontier?

312
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,740
What do they want

313
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,100
with them?

314
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,140
Didn't get that out of him.

315
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,140
By the way,

316
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,300
what did Mao's autopsy report say?

317
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,420
Strangled?

318
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,060
Strangled first, then burned.

319
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,380
What a messy way.

320
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,420
What's your plan?

321
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,940
If Hua Long and Mao's relationship

322
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,420
is really what Dagou described,

323
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,300
then Mao's blind mother

324
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,820
could be our key
to reconnecting with him.

325
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,140
I've already sent people
to Maojia Village

326
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,140
to dig for leads.

327
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,020
If this is really an internal cleanup,

328
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,260
his blind mother

329
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
could be in real danger.

330
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,580
Mr. Tu,

331
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,900
since we both think

332
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,140
Sanmahu's behind Mao's death,

333
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,140
his motives and intentions

334
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,180
are crucial now.

335
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,780
You know what those drug dealers

336
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,060
from the northern frontier

337
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,060
hate the most?

338
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,060
Xiatong.

339
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,500
Xiatong's the threshold.

340
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,940
Eighty percent of the goods
from the northern frontier

341
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,020
pass through here.

342
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,660
When the threshold is high,
the goods get expensive.

343
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,300
When it's low, they get cheap.

344
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,180
Sanmahu's contacting people
from the northern frontier

345
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,260
and using Mao's situation

346
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,300
to take down Hua Long.

347
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,020
He wants control over both supply

348
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,380
and distribution.

349
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,500
He's trying to dominate the market.

350
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,220
Mr. Tu,

351
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,980
what's your plan?

352
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,740
Whether Sanmahu's playing both sides

353
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,340
doesn't matter.

354
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,580
He's only got two hands.

355
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,820
We know what he's holding.

356
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,100
Alright.

357
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,020
You handle Hua Long.

358
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,380
I'll take care of guys

359
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,300
from the northern frontier.

360
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
We'll work together

361
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,620
and finish him off

362
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,860
for good.

363
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,140
Alright.

364
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,620
[Hongmianhua]

365
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
No need to say more.

366
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,900
I'll remember everything

367
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,460
you've done for me.

368
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,300
It's nothing.

369
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,980
We'll

370
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,340
see it in actions.

371
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,700
Alright?

372
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,140
Sure.

373
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,860
Okay.

374
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,500
No need to see me out.

375
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:41,820
Alright.

376
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,220
Please head back.

377
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,020
Bye.

378
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,420
Take care.

379
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,340
Bye.

380
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,180
Weirdo.

381
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,460
What is it?

382
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,380
Sheng,

383
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,740
Sihai sent someone to ask.

384
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,100
You really not planning to go back?

385
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,780
They're offering twenty percent more.

386
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,300
Twenty percent?

387
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,220
We'd be

388
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,940
risking our fingers going back.

389
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,580
How much profit
is twenty percent anyway?

390
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,700
Listen,

391
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,620
this

392
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,100
is the dawn of a new era for us.

393
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,300
Sheng,

394
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,900
I almost forgot.

395
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,500
Lately, our groups
haven't been too stable.

396
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,700
Dragon Unleashed

397
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,380
has been dead silent

398
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,700
in the previous groups.

399
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,380
But in the new ones,

400
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,700
he's super active.

401
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,420
Why do you think that is?

402
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
It's like running a game.

403
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,060
If you don't shuffle the deck,

404
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,780
you'll never get a good hand.

405
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,020
But now the deck's being shuffled.

406
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,460
What does that mean?

407
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,580
It means everyone has a chance

408
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,700
to become Dragon Unleashed.

409
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,660
Get it?

410
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,340
Everyone has a chance

411
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,020
to become Dragon Unleashed?

412
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,020
You're such a moron.

413
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,980
It's like talking to a brick wall.

414
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
I can't get through to you.

415
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,460
Anyway,

416
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,900
how's that thing

417
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,780
I asked you to handle?

418
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,580
Don't worry.

419
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,740
That old guy's greedy.

420
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,580
I'll handle him.

421
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,860
Wrap it up soon.

422
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,540
Get to it.

423
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,820
Alright, I'm off.

424
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,580
Mr. Zhan?

425
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,140
Mr. Zhan,

426
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,100
what are you...?

427
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,900
My fault.

428
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,220
I've been swamped lately.

429
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,420
Didn't have time to call you back.

430
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,180
It's fine.

431
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,540
How have you been?

432
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,100
I've been doing alright.

433
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,340
Just keeping busy

434
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,580
and scraping by.

435
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,660
Of course,

436
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,580
Mr. Zhan, you trust me so much.

437
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,420
I won't let you down.

438
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,500
I'd never go back

439
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,140
to breaking the law like before.

440
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,940
I just entertain the big shots

441
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,140
to earn some extra cash.

442
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,020
Anyway, Mr. Zhan,

443
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,700
what brings you here?

444
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,260
In the drop chats we're monitoring,

445
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,260
Dragon Unleashed has been dead silent.

446
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
What about yours?

447
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,380
The groups I joined...

448
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
Well, they're...

449
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,020
No, Mr. Zhan.

450
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,780
Those drug addicts

451
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,900
dragged me into those groups!

452
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,580
Seriously.

453
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,420
I haven't had a chance to report it yet.

454
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,260
Is Dragon Unleashed still the admin?

455
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,820
The username's the same.

456
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,740
But

457
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,540
from what I've seen,

458
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,420
I think it's a different person.

459
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,380
The original Dragon Unleashed

460
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,580
was like clockwork,

461
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,780
working nine-to-five,

462
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,060
logging off right on time.

463
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
But this one now?

464
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,380
Look.

465
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,020
He's practically

466
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,820
pushing goods 24/7.

467
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,980
And he'll take any customer.

468
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,580
Mr. Zhan,

469
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,780
did something

470
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,940
happen to Dragon Unleashed?

471
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,180
I don't care how many groups you're in.

472
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,500
I want you to compile
all the member info

473
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
and hand it over to me.

474
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,140
No problem, Mr. Zhan.

475
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,820
Your wish is my command.

476
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,500
I'll find a net café

477
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,940
and get that file sorted for you.

478
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,660
But...

479
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,020
Mr. Zhan,

480
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,180
which groups

481
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,500
are you monitoring?

482
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,420
No offense.

483
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,540
I just figured

484
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,900
I could

485
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,740
skip those

486
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,340
to work more efficiently.

487
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,180
Or not skipping is fine too.

488
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,820
Hello?

489
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,060
Hey, Mr. Zhan.

490
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,020
We got a photo of Mao's mother.

491
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,140
And someone said

492
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,020
they saw a man
who looked a lot like Hua Long.

493
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,860
After investigation,
we've basically confirmed

494
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,300
Mao's mother is at her brother's place

495
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
in Hua'an mountainous area.

496
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,100
Alright.

497
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,220
I'll be right there.

498
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,020
[Xiatong Railway Hospital]

499
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,620
I'm here.

500
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,340
What's going on?

501
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,260
Why is it taking so long
to reach that old guy?

502
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,060
It's not that, Mr. Tu.

503
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,780
Ever since he lost his hand,

504
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,260
he's been getting jumpier by the day.

505
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,060
We hear whispers,

506
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,860
but can't pin him down.

507
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,460
As long as he's still
doing business here, we're good.

508
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,140
If he can't handle the respect
we show him,

509
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,100
then I'll find him my own way.

510
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,020
Who did you spot?

511
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,540
Mr. Tu, look.

512
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,220
That woman
who's handing out flyers ahead.

513
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,860
And the guy in the jacket

514
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,820
next to her,

515
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,060
carrying a briefcase.

516
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,620
Interesting.

517
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,780
The middle-aged woman

518
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,420
is likely

519
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,340
abducting children using drugs

520
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,840
and trafficking women.

521
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,260
As for the guy with the briefcase,

522
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,140
chances are

523
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,660
he's in charge of sourcing
for a pyramid scheme.

524
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,900
The person we're after isn't that bold.

525
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,780
No wonder these scumbags hide out here

526
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,820
when things go wrong.

527
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,540
Take a look!

528
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,780

[Children's Toys]
buy some toys for your kids?

533
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,260
Take a look. Grab something.

534
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,180
Have a look, sir.

535
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,340
Hey, how much for this?

536
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,380
Eight yuan.

537
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,300
So expensive. Make it five.

538
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
I'm buying it for my grandson.

539
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,260
Alright.

540
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,340
Since it's for your grandson,

541
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,100
I won't haggle over a little money.

What are you doing?

543
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,580
I said it's for my grandson.

544
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,460
Tell me

557
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,740
asking a few questions.

558

Mr. Zhan.

559
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,860
Confirmed?

560
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,780
The police station has verified it
with the local neighborhood committee.

561
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Unit 26, Group A

562
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,260
is confirmed to be Mao's uncle's place.

has been staying there recently.

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,100
that Mao often hangs around there.

are migrant workers back home.

570
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,540
passed by, and were drawn by the fire.

571

there was another person near the scene.

We matched the physical description.

573
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,620
It should be our target, Hua Long.

574
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,300
Mr. Zhan, look.

575
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,940
[Lijia Village]
This is Unit 26, Group A.

576
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,860
Alright.

577
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,380
Everyone,

578
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,140
move!

579
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,660
Freeze!

580
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,060
Zhang!

581
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,260
Nothing.

582
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,460
Clear.

583
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,500
Are you Li Shaoliang?

584
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,740
Yes.

585
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,180
Where's your sister?

586
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,540
She's not here.

587
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,660
Tell the truth!

588
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,700
I knew it!

589
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,860
Nothing good ever happens!

590
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,220
Your nephew

591
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,580
never shows his face.

592
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,180
Then suddenly he shows up
carrying his mother.

593
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,580
Said they'd just stay a few days.

594
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,820
A few days?

595
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,060
Since when do you leave
that much money for a few days?

596
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,580
Something's wrong!

597
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,420
Enough.

598
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,820
Where is she?

599
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,420
Gone.

600
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,300
Gone?

601
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,900
Just got picked up.

602
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,380
What a mess.

603
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,740
They left

604
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,260
and even took the money back!

605
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,060
Is it this person?

606
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,020
Yes.

607
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,220
Godmother.

608
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
I told you to rest.

609
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,540
Why did you come out?

610
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,300
Come on.

611
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,180
Have a seat.

612
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,220
You've been through a lot on the road.

613
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,940
Long.

614
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,620
Tell me the truth.

615
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,980
Why the sudden move?

616
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,500
And in such a hurry?

617
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,980
What's really going on?

618
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,340
Godmother,

619
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,540
it's nothing, really.

620
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,900
I've told you so many times.

621
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,380
It's just that

622
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,380
Uncle's place is too far.

623
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,900
It's easier for us

624
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,500
to take care of you here.

625
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,620
Long,

626
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,980
where's Mao?

627
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,980
Where is he?

628
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,660
Godmother,

629
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,100
he's busy right now.

630
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,100
He's got things to handle.

631
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,220
So

632
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,900
I'm back here doing the heavy lifting.

633
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,020
Godmother,

634
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,660
don't worry.

635
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,060
Once we're done with this busy period,

636
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,580
we'll both come back.

637
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,820
You should go rest now.

638
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,100
It's been a long journey.

639
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,740
Nothing can go wrong.

640
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,900
Don't let anything go wrong.

641
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,780
Godmother, just relax.

642
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,900
I've got everything arranged

643
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,740
for Mao.

644
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,460
Don't worry.

645
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,580
Don't let anything go wrong.

646
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,460
Don't worry.

647
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,780
Get some rest.

648
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,420
Have the guests
from the northern frontier arrived?

649
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,060
Three more hours.

650
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,340
Get ready to receive them.

651
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,700
They're country folk.

652
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,780
Be careful around them.

653
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,500
What do you mean?

654
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,500
Picking on me?

655
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,140
It wasn't me who chopped your hand off.

656
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,420
Tu Hongjiang,

657
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,700
you came all this way to find me.

658
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
What do you want?

659
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,460
The ones who chopped your hand

660
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,540
and slashed your face

661
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,460
are both in Xiatong now,

662
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,780
making big money

663
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,580
with your sworn enemy.

664
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,660
I'm not their father.

665
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,180
They can do whatever they want.

666
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,900
None of my business.

667
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,060
You're hiding out
in the northern frontier.

668
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,900
It really has nothing to do with you.

669
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,420
But they're about to move in here.

670
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,180
The pie in the northern frontier
is only this big.

671
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,660
You're an old man with nothing to lose.

672
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,580
Do you wait for them

673
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,300
to choke you,

674
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,300
or do you stand up

675
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,420
and chop their hands off to get even?

676
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,620
I see now, Tu Hongjiang.

677
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,380
You're here to have me do your work.

678
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,620
Yes.

679
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,620
That old scumbag
has a grudge against me.

680
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,820
But he also killed your wife.

681
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,380
What?

682
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,500
You can't handle him,

683
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,740
so you want me to?

684
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,940
You don't have what it takes for that.

685
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,860
I just want you to help out.

686
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,140
Set up traps in advance,

687
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,060
and be our informant

688
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,440
in the northern frontier.

689
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,900
Xu Laizi.

690
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,420
Don't push your luck.

691
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,620
You know Sanmahu.

692
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,660
You know what he's done

693
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,700
in the northern frontier before.

694
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,300
If he really reaches here,

695
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,980
with the history between you two,

696
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,860
plus Sickly Dou,

697
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,220
even if you could be a one-man army,

698
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,860
they'd still take you apart.

699
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,660
You might not care.

700
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,540
You've lost most of your parts already.

701
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,540
You've basically got nothing to lose.

702
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,820
You want them

703
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,700
to end up like those guys
at the station,

704
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,380
using drugs to abduct kids

705
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,140
and scamming people?

706
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
This is all the turf we have left.

707
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,980
And someone's trying to reach in here.

708
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,260
They really must want me dead.

709
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,780
Qi Lianshan.

710
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,760
[Qi Lianshan, Mastermind
of a Northern Frontier Crime Syndicate]

711
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,260
Mr. Sanmahu.

712
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,820
Hello.

713
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,540
Man.

714
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,780
Look at your Mercedes.

715
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,940
Have you been waiting long?

716
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,060
It must've been a rough trip.

717
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,420
Thanks for coming.

718
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,060
If this works out,

719
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,060
it'll be worth the trouble.

720
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,420
If it doesn't,

721
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,260
it'll just be trouble.

722
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,060
No way it fails.

723
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,820
I'm riding in this?

724
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,620
Get in.

725
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,660
Qi Lianshan

726
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,260
is a heavy hitter from Da'an League.

727
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,020
He only popped up a few years ago.

728
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,060
He only deals drugs, nothing else.

729
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,540
He cleaned up all the small-time players

730
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,700
in the northern frontier.

731
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,660
He's got people,

732
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,740
money,

733
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,820
and connections.

734
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,780
Even his hardware

735
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,660
is top-tier stuff

736
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,180
from the northwest wolves.

737
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,260
Automatic fire.

738
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,260
Mr. Xu!

739
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,220
Mr. Xu.

740
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,980
Got it figured out.

741
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Someone did see
Qi Lianshan's men heading south.

742
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,220
When?

743
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
It started a week ago.

744
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,140
Several groups have been going there
one after another.

745
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,100
Only deals drugs. And he's new.

746
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,580
I never heard of him

747
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,620
before Sanmahu came to Xiatong.

748
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,380
How did they connect?

749
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,780
Like I said,

750
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,340
besides Sickly Dou, Sanmahu also

751
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,540
has that woman with him.

752
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,380
She used to run with Qi Lianshan.

753
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Bai Taohua?

754
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,580
Yes.

755
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,180
Interesting.

756
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,740
They're all hunting each other.

757
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,380
But who's the real prey in the end?

758
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,020
Mr. Sun.

759
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,420
Tell Sanmahu we'll meet

760
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,380
at Pavilion of Seclusion

761
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,100
at 3 PM tomorrow.

762
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,020
Got it, Mr. Sun.

763
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,340
Mr. Sanmahu,

764
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,500
my boss said the meeting is

765
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,060
at the warehouse in the western suburbs

766
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,820
at 1 PM tomorrow.

767
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,220
Don't worry.

768
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,580
I'll be there

769
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,700
on time.

770
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Go get Changfeng.

771
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,420
Mr. Qian?

772
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,120
Mr. Qian?

773
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,620
What is it?

774
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,180
They'll meet me at the warehouse

775
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,100
in the western suburbs

776
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,640
at 1 PM tomorrow.

777
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,660
Hua Long

778
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,060
has made his move.

779
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,900
Our next move

780
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,300
depends on how things go tomorrow.

781
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,700
Gotta admit,

782
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,900
Qi Lianshan's showing up

783
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,260
at just the right time.

784
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,700
Sir,

785
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,260
Qi Lianshan

786
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,900
rose too fast in the northern frontier.

787
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,940
He's highly elusive.

788
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,940
Is he reliable?

789
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,060
That doesn't matter.

790
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,420
As long as

791
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,260
the bargaining chip is valuable enough.

792
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,900
Tomorrow,

793
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,620
I'll go to the warehouse
in the western suburbs myself.

794
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,420
I'm leaving Qi Lianshan

795
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,500
to you, Changfeng.

796
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,060
Sure.

797
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,340
Alright.

798
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,260
Mao,

799
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,700
tomorrow someone
will be joining you underground.
