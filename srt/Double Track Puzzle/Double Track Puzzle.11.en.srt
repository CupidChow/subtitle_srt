Mr. Sanmahu,

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,220
I'm toasting you

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,520
with these three drinks

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,940
to thank you for saving my life.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,220
If you ever need anything,

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,500
just say the word.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,620
Honestly,

I'm not one to meddle.

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,780
I only bailed you out

you're the real one.

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,540
To be honest,

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,420
this time I was in trouble,

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,380
I was just grateful

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,500
that those people I helped

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,420

Why would you mess with drugs?

Don't you regret it?

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,460
In truth,

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,460
I only regret not finding

33
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,420

Yeah, you can.

38

With what I'm doing now,

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,420
if you want to make money,

41
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,060

have guts and luck,

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,620
and the money will come rolling in.

then I'm sorry.

54

Even the founding master

55
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,380

193
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,060
Everyone,

194
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,820
we're carrying out a critical operation.

195
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Please try to understand.

196
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,260
We get what you're doing,

197
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,300
but you need to understand us too.

198
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,580
What should we do?

199
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,700
What are we supposed to do?

200
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,620
What do we do?

201
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,540
There's no reasoning with them.

202
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,820
If you don't let them through,

203
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,020
they'll keep causing trouble.

204
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,020
If

205
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
anything goes wrong,

206
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,100
there's nothing I can do about it.

207
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,700
Hey, can you hurry up?

208
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,580
Someone's running a high fever!

209
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,540
Alright, here's what we'll do.

210
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,660
Everyone line up.

211
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,020
Check one by one.

212
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,940
If there are no issues,

213
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,140
we'll let you through.

214
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,740
We've all lived here our whole lives...

215
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,900
Fine, we'll line up.

216
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,180
Come on.

217
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,300
Get in line.

218
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,820
Line up.

219
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,380
Let the sick ones through first.

220
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,820
Go ahead.

221
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Sick ones first.

222
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,580
Come on, ID cards.

223
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,380
Line up.

224
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,900
Check carefully.

225
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,460
Take out your ID cards.

226
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,220
You can go.

227
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,460
You two are way too slow.

228
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,260
Stay in line!

229
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,180
Follow me.

230
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,260
Yes.

231
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,780
Yes.

232
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,620
We're trying to avoid
causing a mass incident.

233
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,260
Alright.

234
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,860
Understood.

235
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,340
What's the situation?

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,820
Can we get a definite timeline?

237
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,220
Mr. Tai is already getting calls

238
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,900
from city officials.

239
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,820
He promised

240
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,340
to buy us some time,

241
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,740
but we can't

242
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,380
drag this out forever.

243
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,380
Now you're worried?

244
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,660
When I asked for two thousand officers,

245
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,860
if you had agreed,

246
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,300
we wouldn't have been
in such a passive position now.

247
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,700
Hey,

248
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,500
don't panic.

249
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,460
Calm down.

250
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,660
Look.

251
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,300
[Chenjia Village Topographic Map]
This checkpoint.

252
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,180
And this one.

253
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,820
Keep these two active.

254
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Strictly check the IDs
of anyone leaving the mountains.

255
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,820
The rest can be pulled back.

256
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,380
Not searching the mountains further?

257
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,380
We arrested

258
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,500
over twenty suspects at the resort

259
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
and seized a large quantity of drugs.

260
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,660
That's enough for the report.

261
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,460
If we drag this out

262
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,700
with more resources and manpower,

263
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,060
it'll be hard to justify.

264
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,780
Besides, this area is huge.

265
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,980
We're short-handed.

266
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,180
With no leads to work with,

267
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
it's practically impossible.

268
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,940
Instead of searching for a needle
in a haystack,

269
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,700
we should wait for them to come to us.

270
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,660
Let them show themselves.

271
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,060
Hello?

272
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,940
Okay, got it.

273
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,220
Keep a close watch.

274
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,020
Mr. Sanmahu.

275
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,420
Dou says

276
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,300
except for the outermost checkpoint,

277
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,660
everyone in the mountains
is pulling out.

278
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,500
Go handle your business.

279
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,180
What's Mr. Sanmahu's deal?

280
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
He locked us up.

281
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,740
Does he suspect us?

282
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,100
We almost got killed

283
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,260
diverting the cops!

284
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,820
Hey,

285
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,940
stop whining.

286
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,580
It's good to be cautious.

287
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,300
It's completely normal.

288
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,100
You're such an idiot.

289
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,220
He clearly doesn't see us
as one of his own!

290
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,580
Keep your voice down.

291
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,260
If he hears...

292
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,940
You've lost your mind.

293
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
What's there to be scared of?

294
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,340
What did I even say?

295
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,780
And

296
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,260
it's not just our mind
that's suffering in here.

297
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,620
Sir,

298
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,100
you tell us.

299
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,180
What's our next move?

300
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,460
I'll do as you say.

301
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,380
We do what Mr. Sanmahu says.

302
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,260
Mr. Sanmahu wants to see you.

303
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,980
I've poured my heart
into this for five years!

304
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,580
You think my goal

305
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,460
was just Xiatong?

306
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,900
Just the northern frontier?

307
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,900
Hua Long's channels

308
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,540
are nothing!

309
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,540
The most important thing was the farm!

310
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,740
The research base!

311
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,500
The new product.

312
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,900
If this works out,

313
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,060
everyone

314
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,340
would be begging me!

315
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,780
We'd have the biggest share!

316
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
By then,

317
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,580
I'd be the king
at the top of the pyramid!

318
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,380
But now?

319
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,860
The experts are arrested.

320
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,020
The equipment is seized.

321
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,420
I have to start from scratch again!

322
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,220
Such a hidden spot.

323
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,900
How did the cops find out?

324
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,860
If we

325
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,820
don't get to the bottom of this today,

326
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,340
everyone here

327
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,380
is dead.

328
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,420
Hua.

329
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,300
Sir.

330
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,980
I'm giving you one chance.

331
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,900
You

332
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
suspect me?

333
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,220
Sir,

334
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Dou and I...

335
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,700
We...

336
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,620
Sir,

337
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,500
We're involved with drugs

338
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,420
and murder.

339
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,220
If it weren't for you,

340
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,660
we would have died long ago.

341
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,020
Then who do you think

342
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,820
it is?

343
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,100
Sir,

344
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,020
I never leave

345
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,420
without your orders.

346
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,740
But Lu Dingzhong is different.

347
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,140
Are you insane?

348
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,460
Last Tuesday at 8 PM.

349
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,220
Don't tell me you didn't go out.

350
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,420
I was playing cards.

351
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,060
I was at Sihai Teahouse.

352
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,180
In a private room.

353
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,020
The guys I play with are old friends.

354
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,340
They can't be cops.

355
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,700
Say something.

356
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,420
You never told me.

357
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,580
But he does love to play cards.

358
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
I can vouch for that.

359
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,740
Crewcut.

360
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,940
Couldn't it be said over the phone?

361
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,620
Why did we have to meet here?

362
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,300
Mr. Tu.

363
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,940
You're amazing.

364
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,900
Thirsty?

365
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,340
Let me get you some tea.

366
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,460
No, no, you...

367
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,500
I just

368
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,340
saw those crime scene photos

369
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,820
and the semi-finished products
they brought back.

370
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,820
If they'd succeeded,

371
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,540
it would have been
a massive drug production operation.

372
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,220
Here.

373
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,220
Careful, it's hot.

374
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,300
Mr. Tu,

375
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,140
do you know

376
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,140
who those old men you brought back are?

377
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,020
Chemistry teachers doing experiments?

378
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,260
Internationally renowned
drug production experts.

379
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,640
They've been
on the Ministry of Public Security's

380
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
Class-A wanted list for years.

381
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,820
Sanmahu has that kind of money

382
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,020
to hire experts like that?

383
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,580
That scumbag must have been
making a fortune these years.

384
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,020
Not just ordinary wealth.

385
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,180
Rumor is

386
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,380
he had the Tan family from Nanhai

387
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,980
bring them back from abroad.

388
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,940
For Sanmahu,

389
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,340
to get them back,

390
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,380
the terms he offered
must have been incredible.

391
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,620
Good.

392
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,500
This time, we'll teach him a lesson.

393
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,140
Next time,
we'll take him down for good.

394
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,540
Mr. Tu.

395
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,980
So, uh,

396
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,660
this operation

397
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,820
has given me a whole new perspective

398
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,420
on your capabilities.

399
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,580
Well,

400
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,380
I have to admit,

401
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,820
I was out of line with you before.

402
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,260
I owe you an apology.

403
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,980
Sorry, Mr. Tu!

404
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,660
Hey, hey.

405
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,300
Knock it off.

406
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Put your hand down.

407
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
I don't deserve this, really.

408
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,860
Honestly, I liked you better

409
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,380
when you were all cocky and defiant.

410
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,620
If you're gonna flatter me, just do it.

411
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,580
Don't set me up for a fall.

412
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,500
Mr. Tu,

413
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,180
I'll get straight to the point then.

414
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,180
Yesterday

415
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,220
I caught a small-time drug dealer.

416
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,420
He used to work for Sanmahu.

417
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,900
Recently, he started pushing heroin.

418
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,580
Well,

419
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,540
this guy...

420
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,740
He's a tough nut to crack.

421
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,860
His mouth is sealed shut.

422
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,180
You have a lot of experience
with this type.

423
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,180
Maybe

424
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,700
you could help me out?

425
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,260
I thought you were all about rules
and procedures?

426
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,980
Let me.

427
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,580
Oh, you don't have to.

428
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,780
It's fine.

429
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,980
So,

430
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,660
I was hoping you could help me out.

431
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,180
Feels good, right?

432
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,940
Look.

433
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,180
This Sanmahu guy

434
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,220
is nothing but trouble.

435
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,380
He's full of weak spots!

436
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,940
If I make a breakthrough,

437
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,900
you'll benefit too.

438
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,700
Don't you want to finish him off
while he's down?

439
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,540
That guy is
in the detention center, right?

440
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,100
I'll take care of him.

441
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,900
Alright.

442
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,660
Thanks, Mr. Tu!

443
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,300
Well,

444
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,420
I'm leaving.

445
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,100
Appreciate it, Mr. Tu!

446
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,740
Don't you think this kid
has changed lately?

447
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,380
He's grown up.

448
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,500
Let go!

449
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,900
You're really going for it!

450
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,140
So stingy.

451
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,340
Here, have one.

452
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,220
You've gone too far!

453
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,340
What kind of person does that?

454
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,140
Mr. Sanmahu.

455
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,620
Man!

456
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,060
I believe everything
you just said is true.

457
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,020
But

458
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,500
you're the only one

459
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,620
who sneaked out behind my back.

460
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,660
Sir,

461
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,060
if I were really working with the cops,

462
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,580
I'd find a legit excuse

463
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
to meet them.

464
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,260
Why would I

465
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,180
do something so stupid

466
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,340
to make you suspicious?

467
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,220
What do you all think?

468
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,780
Sir.

469
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,780
He does have that bad habit of gambling.

470
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,620
But

471
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,340
he wouldn't snitch.

472
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
If you ask me,

473
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,300
he doesn't have the brains to plan it

474
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,100
or the guts to do it.

475
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,420
Everyone has a phone now.

476
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,580
We all see outsiders

477
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,900
when we're out handling business.

478
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,980
It wouldn't be hard

479
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,500
to pass info to the cops.

480
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,420
Right?

481
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,740
You sure have a way with words.

482
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,180
I get it.

483
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,540
You two are close, after all.

484
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
He and I aren't as close

485
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,100
as you think.

486
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm not saying he's above suspicion.

487
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,540
I'm saying

488
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,580
everyone

489
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,980
is a suspect.

490
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,100
Fine.

491
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,740
Then we'll start with you.

492
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,500
Prove you're not a suspect.

493
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,500
Your prescriptions

494
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,780
are passed around all the time.

495
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,620
Would've been easy
to pass messages, right?

496
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,620
How do you explain that?

497
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,380
What's wrong with my prescriptions?

498
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,620
Explain yourself!

499
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,900
What's wrong with my prescriptions?

500
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,980
All my prescriptions

501
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,540
are handed out through your people,
aren't they?

502
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,140
You probably know what's on them
better than I do.

503
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,020
So now I'm getting blamed

504
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,820
for treating your illnesses?

505
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,380
You ingrate.

506
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,940
Sanmahu,

507
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,700
is this how your man behaves?

508
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,020
No sense of respect

509
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,820
or boundaries.

510
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,860
No manners at all!

511
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,820
Let me tell you,

512
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,900
I've had enough of him!

513
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,020
What do you want,

514
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,820
you brat?

515
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,420
Bring it on.

516
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,340
I'm ready.

517
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,740
Are you trying to muddy the waters?

518
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,100
You old fossil,

519
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,580
listen up!

520
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,700
Me,

521
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,940
Taohua,

522
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,220
Crewcut,

523
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,580
and Mr. Sanmahu
are all involved with murder.

524
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,580
What do we need to explain?

525
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,260
So what?

526
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,740
I'm involved with drugs!

527
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,380
This is a capital offense,
you understand?

528
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,700
All the dirty work you made me do?

529
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,900
I never wanted any of it!

530
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,220
You forced me into all of it!

531
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,540
What?

532
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,580
And now

533
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,580
you suspect me?

534
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,300
You want to make me the scapegoat?

535
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,380
I'm telling you,

536
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,180
no way!

537
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,740
Sanmahu,

538
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
say something.

539
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,300
Or let's just rush out now

540
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,420
and fight our way out!

541
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,460
I'll take the lead!

542
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,460
You dare?

543
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,060
Do you dare?

544
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,060
You brat.

545
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,980
I just thought of someone.

546
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,860
Who?

547
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,140
Specs.

548
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,620
No way.

549
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,340
I can vouch for him.

550
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,660
What do you mean, no way?

551
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,660
Anyone could break

552
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,620
under pressure.

553
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Alright.

554
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,540
My apologies, everyone.

555
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,980
I

556
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,340
was a little hot-headed earlier.

557
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,740
I lost my temper.

558
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,740
We're good now.

559
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,780
We finally

560
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,700
found the mole.

561
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,700
From now on,

562
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,460
we

563
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,580
stick together like always.

564
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,300
We're solid as a rock.

565
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,340
Let's

566
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,780
focus on the big plan.

567
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,380
Come on.

568
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,180
Now, get up.

569
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,260
Get up.

570
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,180
But from now on,

571
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,740
everyone

572
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,500
follows the rules.

573
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,740
No more acting on your own like Lu,

574
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,620
thinking you can get away with it.

575
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,360
[Restricted Area]

576
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,180
Let's make a deal.

577
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,900
You two have to protect me.

578
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,140
The detention center is too unsafe.

579
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,820
We'll only be truly safe

580
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,220
once we've caught them all.

581
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,020
Think harder.

582
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,980
Where else does Sanmahu usually stay?

583
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,660
Besides that farm,

584
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,700
I've never been anywhere else.

585
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
I really don't know.

586
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,780
How does Sanmahu and Dragon Unleashed

587
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,500
communicate?

588
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,260
Through Dou.

589
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
He handles all the contact.

590
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,220
I was never involved.

591
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
I remember something.

592
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,260
There was this guy

593
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,140
bragging that he knew
the original Dragon Unleashed.

594
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,100
Maybe

595
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,020
you could

596
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,180
ask him?

597
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,660
He might know.

598
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,140
Where is he?

599
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,900
Xinyuan Pool Room.

600
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,660
Hello?

601
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,460
Long.

602
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,380
When are you coming back?

603
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,180
Without you around,
people always cause trouble.

604
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,820
The guys can barely handle it.

605
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,460
If you can't control it,
just shut it down for now.

606
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,380
Lay low until things cool off.

607
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,060
Remember,

608
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,620
keep an eye on those guys
from the northern frontier.

609
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,900
Long,

610
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,140
those guys haven't shown up.

611
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,980
But lately there've been

612
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,440
a lot of people
with northern frontier accents

613
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,120
hanging around here.

614
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,620
Could it be them?

615
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,860
Are you stupid?

616
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,740
I only told you to watch those two.

617
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,700
Don't worry about anyone else.

618
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,700
As long as they don't cause trouble,

619
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,060
you don't make any either.

620
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,620
Got it?

621
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,620
And

622
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,260
don't contact me unless it's important.

623
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,140
Long.

624
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,900
Lately,

625
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,140
I've got things to do.

626
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,300
I won't be around.

627
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,540
Call me if anything comes up.

628
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,340
Alright.

629
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,620
Well?

630
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:11,900
Found it.

631
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,520
[Location Confirmed]
Near the waste treatment plant

632
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:13,960
in the south of the city.

633
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,860
The car's here.

634
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,540
Let's move.

635
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,180
What a genius.

636
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:28,900
After them!

637
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,220
Let's split up!

638
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,620
Zhang!

639
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,660
Notify the fire department!

640
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,740
Hello?

641
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,860
Fire department?

642
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,180
We need backup!

643
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,020
We'll leave this to you guys.

644
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,300
Alright. Appreciate it.

645
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,100
What is this place?

646
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,340
Why are there so many firecrackers?

647
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,220
What?

648
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,020
Someone was killed in an explosion?

649
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,440
Ninety-five years old.
A blessed passing.

650
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,180
All the relatives are here.

651
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,540
They're taking him to be cremated.

652
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:58,900
Let us through!

653
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,660
Alright, okay.

654
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,580
You can pass.

655
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,300
No, no.

656
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,740
Stay calm. Easy now.

657
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,980
I know the rules.

658
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,340
I won't give you a hard time.

659
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,780
But you have to guarantee

660
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,580
there are no outsiders in the group.

661
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,460
There aren't.

662
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,580
We're all family!

663
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,780
We checked their IDs.

664
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,900
No outsiders.

665
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,500
Alright.

666
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:14,980
What outsiders?

667
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,220
That car...

668
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,260
You rented that car, right?

669
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,820
The hearse.

670
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,300
From the funeral home.

671
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,020
It arrived yesterday.

672
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,980
Got here last night.

673
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,820
Alright.

674
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,380
It really is just our family.

675
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,380
Hurry up!

676
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,980
Can't you be reasonable?

677
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,180
Let us go!

678
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,100
We're running out of time!

679
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,140
When are you letting us through?

680
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,940
We're on a tight schedule!

681
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,900
Just let us through!

682
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,260
You'll get your karma for this!

683
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,700
When?

684
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,220
When are you letting us go?

685
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,380
What's going on here?

686
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,460
When are you letting us go?

687
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,380
Answer us!

688
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,300
When are you letting us go?

689
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,940
We'll let you go.

690
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,220
Let them through.

691
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,580
Sir, you're really something.

692
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,540
If it weren't for your planning,

693
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,180
we'd be done for today.

694
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,180
Thanks to Changfeng's heads-up.

695
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Do you have any idea how much effort

696
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,380
I put into those groups?

697
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,780
And you?

698
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,380
In just a few days, you ruined them all!

699
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,420
And my buddy.

700
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,540
He's gone because of you!

701
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,020
You owe me

702
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,220
an explanation for this!

703
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,660
Long,

704
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,500
I really

705
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,540
messed this up.

706
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,140
Sorry.

707
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,100
What did you say?

708
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,660
Sorry?

709
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,900
You ruined my business!

710
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,580
And got my buddy killed!

711
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,500
You think

712
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,260
a simple "sorry" is gonna cut it?

713
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,660
Dream on!

714
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,180
I'm reevaluating

715
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,220
our partnership!

716
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,260
Dou is my man.

717
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,300
First off,

718
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,820
we were definitely in the wrong here.

719
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,060
We can revise the partnership agreement

720
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,180
and renegotiate

721
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,140
the division of work in Xiatong.

722
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,500
Also, I'm willing to give up

723
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
a portion of my shares

724
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,420
in the northern frontier market.

725
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,380
How does that sound?

726
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,340
You're Dou's boss.

727
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
Your word carries weight with me.

728
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,300
Alright.

729
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,740
I'll consider the specifics.

730
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,300
Alright.

731
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,340
Cheers.

732
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,700
Long.

733
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,220
Impressive.

734
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:19,820
Long.

735
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,180
This time,

736
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,020
the cops won't be after me anymore,

737
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,380
and we've put those guys in their place.

738
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,500
We took back what's ours.

739
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,820
That's just the appetizer.

740
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,420
The real prize isn't that.

741
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,900
There's more?

742
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,180
The one who died wasn't the suspect?

743
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,380
Right.

744
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,460
Based on the scene investigation,

745
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
there were no signs of struggle

746
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,580
and no evidence of a fight before death.

747
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,300
The forensic experts found no traces

748
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
of inhaled dust in the victim's lungs.

749
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,220
He used a patsy?

750
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,860
What are the odds

751
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,900
he'd be in that warehouse,

752
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,180
and

753
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,980
with flammable materials stored there?

754
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,700
No way it's a coincidence.

755
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,500
The explosion site and the patsy

756
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,140
were both set up.

757
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,460
From the moment we hit the scene,

758
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,260
Mao was already prepared.

759
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,180
He had an escape route planned
all along.

760
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,700
The question is,

761
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,540
how did they know

762
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,420
we were coming last night?

763
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,420
And drug dealers

764
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,540
usually prefer to keep a low profile.

765
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,740
They wouldn't make such a big scene

766
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,100
unless they had no other choice.

767
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,500
If he just wanted to escape,

768
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,420
setting off an explosion
would've been enough to stop us.

769
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,380
Why give up a life too?

770
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,660
My conclusion is

771
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,180
he used this fake death

772
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,220
to disappear completely.

773
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,620
Because someone wants him dead.

774
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,420
Most likely his supplier

775
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,380
or a rival.

776
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,380
Mr. Xiong,

777
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,540
we need to find Mao fast.

778
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,220
If he gets killed,

779
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,980
our lead will go cold.

780
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,660
Why are you looking at me?

781
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,860
I don't have that kind of capability.

782
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,100
Mr. Tu.

783
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,220
You're overthinking it.

784
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,060
I'm not asking you to catch Mao.

785
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,020
Investigate the explosion scene.

786
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,340
Who was the patsy?

787
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,620
Who owns the warehouse?

788
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,780
Is there a connection between them?

789
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,140
When it comes to ground operations,

790
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,980
there's no one better
for the job than you.

791
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,020
It's worth a shot, right?

792
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,260
Like that
small-time drug dealer yesterday.

793
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,180
You broke him

794
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,340
with barely any effort.

795
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,300
Right, Mr. Xiong?

796
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,220
Exactly.

797
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,700
Hey, Tu.

798
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,940
Come on.

799
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,820
The capable ones handle more work.

800
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,460
I've still got my own mess to handle.

801
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:36,820
I...

802
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,020
Mr. Tu.

803
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,780
Appreciate it.

804
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,220
Sir.

805
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,780
Maybe that hick was the one

806
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,820
who got Specs caught.

807
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,620
Should I go teach him a lesson?

808
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,540
We finally

809
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,260
have a safe place to lay low,

810
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,300
and you want to draw attention again?

811
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,780
Then those shares...

812
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,140
Those shares

813
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,780
in the northern frontier market.

814
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,940
Are you really giving them a cut?

815
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,500
This feels too generous for them.

816
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
When it comes to making money,

817
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,340
I never joke.

818
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,900
Now we'll see

819
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,180
if they can handle

820
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,420
such a windfall.

821
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,060
Is the intel reliable?

822
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,020
Absolutely.

823
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,860
To conform it,

824
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,580
I double-checked with Wei.

825
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,860
Hu Shangfei and Lu Dingzhong
are together.

826
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,020
They seem pretty down.

827
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,140
From what I heard,

828
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,420
Sanmahu is already out.

829
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,100
But no one knows where he's hiding.

830
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,460
What else did you hear?

831
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,420
Lu Dingzhong said

832
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,660
Sanmahu wasn't in a hurry
to come out at first.

833
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,020
Seems like he's got
some major business trouble.

834
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,260
He needed to meet for negotiations,

835
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,380
so he rushed out.

836
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,980
Tell your guys

837
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,500
to keep their ears open these days.

838
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Let me know immediately

839
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,180
if you hear anything.

840
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,420
Got it, Mr. Tu.

841
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,100
Long.

842
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,380
I apologize to you

843
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,220
with these three drinks.

844
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,980
I really messed things up.

845
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,740
I'm so mad at myself.

846
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,180
Alright, enough.

847
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,860
I'm also

848
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,580
to blame for this.

849
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,540
I didn't think it through.

850
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,380
I shouldn't have let go so quickly.

851
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,220
I forgot

852
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,060
this isn't something
just anyone can do well.

853
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,140
Long.

854
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,180
This is just a little something from us.

855
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,460
Ms. Bai,

856
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,340
you're too kind.

857
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,100
Not at all.

858
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,900
Long.

859
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,180
This is compensation for you.

860
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,900
Please accept it.

861
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,220
After all,

862
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,020
we still have to make money together,

863
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,740
right?

864
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,620
Well,

865
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,260
Mr. Sanmahu's proposal

866
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,860
was indeed tempting,

867
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,580
but I've heard

868
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,880
the market situation
in the northern frontier

869
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,920
is a bit chaotic.

870
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,740
Chaotic?

871
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,820
It might be because of this.

872
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,740
The northern frontier is a big place.

873
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,100
Lots of people, lots of opinions.

874
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,380
Things can get complicated.

875
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,460
So

876
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,060
we only have the bargaining power,

877
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,540
not the decision-making power.

878
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,820
What does that mean?

879
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,140
Long,

880
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,540
we absolutely trust you.

881
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,300
But how do we get

882
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,620
our guys in the northern frontier

883
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,980
to trust you like we do?

884
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,500
You need to show them
what you're made of.

885
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,300
That idea makes sense.

886
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,660
But how exactly do I do that?

887
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,500
Our goods got seized by the cops.

888
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,100
So we urgently need to restock.

889
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,700
You need the goods?

890
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,100
How much?

891
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,060
Five kilos.

892
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,620
Five kilos?

893
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,540
You sure?

894
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,380
Please.

895
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,460
The goods won't be a problem.

896
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,740
But I'll need some time.

897
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,500
Two days.

898
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,180
Long,

899
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,620
I know.

900
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,460
I know exactly what it means

901
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,820
to get five kilos in two days.

902
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,460
If we really manage to get five kilos

903
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,300
within two days,

904
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,140
trust me,

905
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,980
we'll shut everyone up

906
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,820
in the northern frontier.

907
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,180
Then the northern frontier market

908
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,620
will be ours.

909
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,700
What do you say?

910
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,220
Fine.

911
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,380
Two days it is.

912
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,940
