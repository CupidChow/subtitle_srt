193
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,060
what's the emergency?

194
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,580
Hua Long is still alive.

195
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,660
I should have killed him.

196
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,380
It's my fault.

197
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,980
It wasn't a clean job.

198
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,340
This is pointless now.

199
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,540
What Hua Long knows

200
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
ends with you.

201
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,740
That's why you need to
leave Xiatong immediately.

202
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,660
Lay low elsewhere.

203
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,580
I heard that Sanmahu

204
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,860
was ready in the northern frontier.

205
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,380
You should go there, too.

206
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,740
First,

207
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,860
to avoid things.

208
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,260
Second,

209
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,380
we can test the waters, too.

210
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,380
Alright.

211
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,460
How about Xiatong?

212
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,980
Leave it to Sheng.

213
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,060
He is smart,

214
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,860
but...

215
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,140
I'm afraid that he is not fierce enough

216
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,060
and cannot hold the floor.

217
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,740
You are right,

218
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,780
but do we

219
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,060
have another option now?

220
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,260
Well,

221
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,780
when you are in the northern frontier,

222
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,540
find some tough guys

223
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,100
to back him up.

224
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,020
Before you leave, tell Sheng

225
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,940
to get a firm grip

226
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,500
of Xiatong's market

227
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,100
while Sanmahu is away.

228
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,580
Same old method.

229
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,300
Turn their power against them.

230
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,540
But...

231
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,700
But if we do that,

232
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,820
will Mr. Jiang be upset?

233
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,100
He is already unhappy about us

234
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,540
for the matter with Qi Lianshan.

235
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,060
He can be upset.

236
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
So what?

237
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,500
As long as Xiatong's market
is in our hands,

238
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,820
he has no choice but to partner with us.

239
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,540
Got it?

240
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,540
Yes, sir.

241
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,900
I will get ready.

242
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,140
We've turned Xiatong upside down.

243
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,580
There is no sight of Mr. Qian.

244
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,020
Dang it.

245
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,620
Xiatong is a small city,

246
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,580
but it's big enough
for Sanmahu to hide someone.

247
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,700
However, as long as Mr. Qian
is still in Xiatong,

248
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,660
it's only a matter of time
before we find him.

249
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,540
Sanmahu is ruthless.

250
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,860
It might be too late.

251
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,920
[Xu Laizi]

252
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,820
Hello?

253
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,460
Since the arrest of Qi Lianshan,

254
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,580
someone has been messing things up
in the northern frontier.

255
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,900
Bai Taohua is the leader,

256
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,620
but I guess Sanmahu is also around.

257
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,580
Those drug-dealing big shots

258
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,020
are so distraught lately

259
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
as if their father had died.

260
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,780
Stay on top of this.

261
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,260
Let me know

262
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,300
if anything happens.

263
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,540
Alright.

264
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,180
Sanmahu is not back in Xiatong yet.

265
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,300
That's a good thing.

266
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,620
It means that Mr. Qian is safe for now.

267
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,740
We have more time to find him.

268
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,660
Normally, Sanmahu

269
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,020
would have settled it long ago.

270
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,620
Too many things are going on,

271
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,900
and that's why
he didn't deal with it yet.

272
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,780
We don't have much time.

273
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,540
You need to hurry up.

274
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,860
You must find Mr. Qian

275
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,820
before Sanmahu is back.

276
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,500
Got it.

277
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,460
Sun's full name

278
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,020
is Sun Bojun.

279
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,220
He is 38 years old,

280
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,820
from Sunhe Village,

281
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,740
Huali, Xiatong.

282
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,620
There aren't many others in his family.

283
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,420
He ran a small business for a while

284
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,620
but lost some money,

285
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,500
and then he left home for work.

286
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
No word since then.

287
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,140
According to Hua Long,

288
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,900
Dragon Unleashed has a flat structure

289
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,860
with unlimited opportunities.

290
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,100
In a sense, there is no ruler.

291
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,540
Dragon Unleashed

292
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,420
is the supplier,

293
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,460
and the source

294
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,340
is all in the hands of Sun.

295
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,900
Sun Bojun

296
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,620
is being closely monitored by us now,

297
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,900
but the accounts of Dragon Unleashed
remain active.

298
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,340
The drug distribution network in Xiatong
hasn't been affected either.

299
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,100
That means someone else is managing it.

300
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,780
As long as we get this person,

301
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,460
we can get Sun Bojun.

302
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,300
Dragon Unleashed
is extremely cautious at the moment.

303
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,740
All the information is encrypted,

304
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,100
and they change
the transaction methods frequently.

305
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,540
We got a few small fries,

306
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,700
but they have no idea
who their higher-ups are.

307
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,500
They are dead ends.

308
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,780
How about the intel from Sheng?

309
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,540
His intel was true,

310
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,820
but those we got
were not from Dragon Unleashed.

311
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,260
They work for Sanmahu.

312
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,700
Whether it's Sanmahu or Sun Bojun,

313
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,980
as long as we disrupt
the drug market in Xiatong,

314
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,900
someone is bound to lose patience

315
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,900
and step up.

316
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,780
Bigger

317
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
and stronger?

318
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,180
What does that have to do with me?

319
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm just a businessman.

320
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,900
That's right, Sanmahu.

321
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,820
You are just a businessman.

322
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,460
All you need to do
is to sell your stuff.

323
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,780
The market of the northern frontier

324
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,900
is none of your business.

325
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,460
You weren't like this
when Mr. Qi was around.

326
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,220
That's right.

327
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,300
When Mr. Qi was here,

328
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,380
I didn't have to worry about anything,

329
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,020
because he took

330
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,860
all my stuff

331
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,540
and he sold them all.

332
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,940
However, right now,

333
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,420
can any of you

334
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,540
or anyone in the northern frontier

335
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,540
pull off the same thing?

336
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,740
Perhaps you can do it, young man?

337
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,060
Whether I can do it or not

338
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,660
is none of your concern.

339
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,660
I'm here today

340
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,020
for the sake of Mr. Sun
from Da'an League.

341
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,140
It's not because of you darn guys.

342
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,540
To be honest,

343
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,900
you are the one who got Mr. Qi arrested.

344
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,580
And moving forward,

345
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,180
messing with my livelihood
is like killing my folks.

346
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,620
The market of the northern frontier
is only this big.

347
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,220
Everyone wants to have it
for themselves.

348
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,380
Am I right?

349
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,460
Who are you?

350
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,580
Do you know your place?

351
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,940
If you have the guts,

352
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,980
step outside

353
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,940
and take me on for real.

354
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,740
If you don't,

355
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,940
get out of here

356
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,180
and go back to your city.

357
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,180
Wait for our notice.

358
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,940
Great speech.

359
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,580
Messing with one's livelihood

360
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,620
is like killing their folks.

361
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,300
Hey, Hua,

362
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,660
let's do it.

363
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,700
Fei...

364
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,980
Fei, help us!

365
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,780
Fei!

366
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,540
Fei,

367
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,740
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,300
Sanmahu, what do you mean?

369
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,260
What are you doing?

370
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,900
Sit down!

371
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,620
Do you know why I can get to your folks?

372
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,060
And why

373
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,660
this is happening to you?

374
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,620
It's because you are not strong enough.

375
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,300
If you are not strong enough,
don't be so greedy.

376
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,660
Good deeds bring good returns,

377
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,780
evil deeds bring evil returns.

378
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,940
Justice may be delayed, but never...

379
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,460
Look at this.

380
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,060
What a pity.

381
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,660
He was a young man.

382
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,220
Hey, Hua.

383
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,660
It's fine.

384
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,020
Don't make it ugly.

385
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,420
That's good.

386
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,380
They are a family,

387
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,140
and they can keep each other company.

388
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,460
Don't forget

389
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,420
to give some money
to the restaurant owner.

390
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,780
They consider this unlucky.

391
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,380
I'm sorry, everyone.

392
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,460
Fei wanted

393
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,700
to be the next Mr. Qi.

394
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,580
He wanted to

395
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,300
have everything

396
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
in his hands.

397
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
Honestly,

398
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,660
if he was capable,

399
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,220
I wouldn't mind.

400
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,380
The problem is

401
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,820
that he wasn't,

402
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,620
and he made

403
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,060
the northern frontier a messy place.

404
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,220
Now he's gone.

405
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,820
I believe

406
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,820
it's good for me and everyone here.

407
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,740
Anyway,

408
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,300
join my alliance

409
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,500
and once the stuff is here,

410
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,380
all of you can have a share,

411
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,700
big or small.

412
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,940
What do you think?

413
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,980
I'm in, Mr. Sanmahu.

414
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,660
Previously, Mr. Qi owned the market,

415
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,460
and we didn't even get a share.

416
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,500
Now, we are sitting here
having a banquet.

417
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,540
There's no point in fighting anymore.

418
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,700
It's fine.

419
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,140
I'm just throwing it out there.

420
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,620
Joining or not

421
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,580
is your own

422
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,260
decision,

423
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,620
alright?

424
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
But if anyone tries to start trouble,

425
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,380
he will be

426
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,740
our common enemy.

427
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,900
I'm in.

428
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,460
I'm on board.

429
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,900
Same here.

430
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,580
- I'm in.
- Yes.

431
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:51,980
Great.

432
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,580
Let's make a toast.

433
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,500
Looking forward to our cooperation.

434
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,860
To Mr. Sanmahu.

435
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,720
[Xiatong]

436
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,200
[Two weeks later]

437
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,780
In only two weeks,

438
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,140
you've fixed the network of Xiatong.

439
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,300
Is that right?

440
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,380
And you explored many areas

441
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,100
that we didn't set foot in before.

442
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,020
As for the territories Hua Long lost,

443
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,140
you took them back.

444
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,580
It was not an easy job.

445
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,540
Mr. Han,

446
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,420
Xiatong

447
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,620
has always been your territory.

448
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,340
You've been running it for years.

449
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,380
How dare Sanmahu lay a hand

450
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,140
on it?

451
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,460
He should take a good look at himself

452
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,980
and know his place.

453
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,180
I'm different.

454
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,980
I know my role.

455
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,260
I'm only running errands.

456
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,860
What I have today

457
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,980
is all thanks to you and Mr. Sun.

458
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,220
Then you should know

459
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,860
why we decided to bring you along.

460
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,660
Of course.

461
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,180
Take a seat.

462
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,620
Mr. Han,

463
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,740
Mr. Zhan and I have been

464
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,180
staying on good terms for a while now.

465
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,980
Before getting into the business,

466
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,820
I've been looking up
all kinds of intel for him.

467
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,220
That's why he still trusts me.

468
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,220
Your relationship with him

469
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,620
is your own business,

470
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,020
but speaking of that,

471
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,140
what we do

472
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,820
is also relevant.

473
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
If you can

474
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,540
run it well,

475
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,700
you will be the next Sun.

476
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,300
Everything is yours for the taking.

477
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Seize the opportunity

478
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,620
and enjoy life to the fullest.

479
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,140
However, if you fail

480
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,300
to handle it properly,

481
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,140
you get it wrong,

482
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,980
let's say,

483
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,740
then like Hua Long,

484
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,820
you will die

485
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,980
with no place to bury your remains.

486
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,500
Am I clear?

487
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,780
Yes, Mr. Han.

488
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,860
I understand.

489
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,740
I will do my best

490
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,460
to solve your problems for sure.

491
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,740
I won't cause you any trouble.

492
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,900
What's wrong, Mr. Han?

493
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,100
Nothing.

494
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,380
Someone is getting impatient.

495
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,020
I should have treated you

496
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,180
two weeks ago.

497
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,540
All that mess kept getting in the way.

498
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Twelve years ago,

499
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,500
because of Tu Hongjiang,

500
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,660
I didn't get to
be at your retirement ceremony.

501
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,060
Today, it's also because of him

502
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,300
that we are making up for the drinking.

503
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,500
The first cup

504
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,740
is to our founding master,

505
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
Liu Xiazhi.

506
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,980
The second one

507
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,740
is to our master.

508
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,180
And the third one,

509
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,780
Changfeng,

510
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,460
is to you.

511
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,860
You don't want to rush it?

512
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,580
No problem.

513
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,500
We can

514
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,860
have a chat first.

515
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,660
Tell me.

516
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,340
Why

517
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,980
is it okay to be a thief,

518
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,100
but not a drug dealer?

519
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
The west of the city.

520
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,820
It's the roasted chicken from Bai's
in the west of the city.

521
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,060
Delicious.

522
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,500
Just like the old days.

523
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,300
Sanmahu,

524
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,740
if you had gotten into that business

525
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,180
more than ten years ago

526
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,220
and got all the young kids in Xiatong

527
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,860
hooked on your white powder,

528
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,420
you won't get to enjoy
this delicacy today.

529
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,900
You beg for food,

530
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,860
so don't talk about the taste.

531
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,060
We are both hustling on the side.

532
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,740
Don't look down upon me.

533
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,220
There is no noble man in this room.

534
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,700
Hustling on the side,

535
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,820
or scraping by in the underworld,

536
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,260
you should at least have humanity.

537
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,660
The first lesson
our master taught us when we joined

538
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,380
was about rules.

539
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,140
Those who break the rules

540
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,940
will have their hand chopped at best,

541
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,140
or take a bullet at worst.

542
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,140
And what you are doing

543
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,460
has no rules.

544
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,900
Money is the only thing matters.

545
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,940
Changfeng,

546
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,380
I can forget about the money,

547
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,980
but everything

548
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,700
needs money in this world.

549
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,460
You are not only after the money,

550
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,580
but also taking lives!

551
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,500
That's not my concern.

552
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,620
I know better than everyone

553
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,300
about your skills

554
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,180
and your personality.

555
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,780
I can pay for my choice.

556
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,140
What about you?

557
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,620
Can you say the same?

558
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,780
You are better at talking than I am.

559
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,380
Come on.

560
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,500
Let's have a drink.

561
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,580
Never mind.

562
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,140
We've both lived most of our lives.

563
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,220
We have our own choices.

564
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,060
I've said everything,

565
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,620
but you don't care.

566
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,060
Forget it.

567
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,740
Let's have a drink.

568
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,700
Alright.

569
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,500
Can I ask for a favor?

570
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,060
I know what you are thinking about.

571
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,780
Hello?

572
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,500
This is not my phone.

573
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,300
Do you know the owner?

574
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,860
Alright, kid.

575
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,740
You've learned to speak politely now.

576
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,340
Doesn't sound like an idiot anymore.

577
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,380
Mr. Qian?

578
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,900
Mr. Qian,

579
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,500
when will you be back?

580
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,460
The clinic needs you.

581
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,820
I'm not qualified.

582
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,060
I can't handle everything.

583
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,060
It's a good thing that you know it.

584
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,420
That's what you have to go through.

585
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,820
Let the pressure be your motivation.

586
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,580
This is perfect.

587
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,980
It's a good opportunity for you.

588
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,460
I'm busy

589
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,220
lately.

590
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,020
I can't get back.

591
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,220
The clinic

592
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,100
is yours now.

593
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,300
Mr. Tu,

594
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,900
Mr. Qian called.

595
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,980
I sent the number to you.

596
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,620
Don't hang up.

597
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,060
Listen to their conversation.

598
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,140
By the way,

599
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,180
there are a few medical books

600
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,100
in the third drawer from the right

601
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,100
of the desk in my room.

602
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,380
My father

603
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,420
left them behind
after he became a barefoot doctor.

604
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,060
Go through them carefully.

605
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,940
When you are done with that,

606
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,060
you can take up the responsibility.

607
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,540
You hear me?

608
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,700
Wait, no.

609
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,420
Mr. Qian,

610
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,860
what are you talking about?

611
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,660
You can't just leave me here.

612
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:51,780
And...

613
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,860
about the books you mentioned,

614
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,140
I can't just grasp everything

615
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,380
right away.

616
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,060
The clinic has been running
for so many years.

617
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,340
The reputation is what keeps it going.

618
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,500
What if I ruin it?

619
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,940
And...

620
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,500
I...

621
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,700
I'm not qualified.

622
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,060
It's not a big deal that I can't

623
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,820
cure them,

624
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,420
but what if

625
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,100
I make them worse?

626
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:09,940
It...

627
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,380
It will ruin your reputation too.

628
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,420
Please come back.

629
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,260
Alright.

630
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,420
Cut it off.

631
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,780
Your nagging is annoying.

632
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Take care.

633
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,460
I will be back.

634
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,740
Alright?

635
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:22,980
Bye.

636
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,620
Hello?

637
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,300
Mr. Qian?

638
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,140
Mr. Qian?

639
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,060
Mr. Qian?

640
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,660
He hung up.

641
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,580
Hi, Mr. Tu,

642
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,340
you...

643
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,780
you said

644
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,780
that Mr. Qian will be back
safe and sound,

645
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,380
but what he said

646
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,780
is like his last words.

647
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,980
Mr. Tu,

648
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,580
please,

649
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,780
save Mr. Qian.

650
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,500
Please, Mr. Tu.

651
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,220
I...

652
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,340
What will happen to Mr. Qian?

653
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Mr. Tu...

654
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,300
Mr. Qian...

655
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Please save him.

656
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:51,940
Mr. Tu,

657
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,100
the technical department said
it was too short.

658
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,180
They can only trace the signal
to the approximate base station.

659
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,540
It's near Pinghu Village.

660
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,620
Thank you.

661
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Bottom up,

662
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,220
and this is the end

663
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,140
of our brotherhood.

664
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,580
Do you have anything else to say?

665
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,300
Please,

666
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
spare Dou.

667
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,900
Fine.

668
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,500
After all, you are my senior.

669
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,340
Changfeng,

670
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,300
see you

671
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,420
on the other side.

672
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:44,780
Mr. Sanmahu,

673
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,620
he's here.

674
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,220
Great.

675
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,620
Mr. Han.

676
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,300
Mr. Han.

677
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,220
I've always heard

678
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,740
that you are the big wheel

679
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,140
in Xiatong.

680
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,420
I didn't know

681
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,300
that you are also an important figure

682
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,780
in the eyes of Mr. Jiang.

683
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,140
It's my honor to meet you.

684
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,460
Likewise.

685
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,380
Mr. Sanmahu,

686
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,780
your ambition

687
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,060
is much bigger
than the rumors suggested.

688
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,780
It's not that.

689
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,340
That's why Mr. Jiang
shows you respect as well.

690
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,940
Am I right?

691
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Mr. Han, take a seat,

692
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:36,700
please.

693
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,820
Alright.

694
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,860
Tea, please.

695
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,620
I've admired you

696
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,100
for a long time.

697
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,540
I heard

698
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,180
that you and Mr. Tu

699
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,620
are old friends.

700
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,900
We are

701
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,340
more than old friends.

702
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,460
We were comrades in arms.

703
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,860
We've caught

704
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,460
thieves together.

705
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,220
That makes our relationship closer.

706
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,780
I've been curious.

707
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,540
What will be his reaction

708
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,060
if Tu Hongjiang finds out

709
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,060
your true identity?

710
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,820
If you are so curious,

711
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,580
you should have invited him as well.

712
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,900
What for?

713
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,980
You've been

714
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,060
running this business for years.

715
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,540
You know every trick.

716
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,460
Even if he is here,

717
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,100
I don't think I will get the answer.

718
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,100
You see, I am

719
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,380
a very simple person.

720
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,820
Business is business.

721
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,780
Friends are friends.

722
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,180
I won't make friends

723
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,900
when I do business,

724
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,460
and I won't do business
when making friends.

725
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,140
Things between us are a bit different.

726
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,020
If Tu is here,

727
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,820
I will be happy

728
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,380
and we will still be friends,

729
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,980
but I will still do

730
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,700
whatever needed to be done.

731
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,500
No difference.

732
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,740
But if Tu sees you,

733
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,260
I don't know what will happen.

734
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,940
Exactly!

735
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,940
You are right.

736
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,980
Mr. Han,

737
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,100
you've got what it takes.

738
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,580
You don't need to play any tricks.

739
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,060
But I'm different.

740
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,660
I'm not there yet.

741
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,860
I want to be a decent man,

742
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,820
but I don't have the standing yet.

743
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,420
My abilities don't allow it.

744
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,220
I have to fight

745
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,420
for my fill

746
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,060
and to get the recognition.

747
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,260
You can do that,

748
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
but I'm telling you.

749
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,100
This is my territory.

750
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,380
I make the rules. Is that clear?

751
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,540
I can guarantee

752
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,940
that as long as you follow the rules,

753
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,820
you can not only eat your fill,

754
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,980
but also eat very well.

755
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,380
Let's be straightforward.

756
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,420
We've had the fight.

757
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,580
I lost my man,

758
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,300
and you lost the money.

759
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,140
It was

760
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,620
a lose-lose situation.

761
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm afraid that your table is too small.

762
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,540
I can't get enough.

763
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,580
Are you saying

764
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,740
that you want to have your own table?

765
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,700
Mr. Jiang wants us

766
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,780
to team up.

767
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,300
Isn't that what you are here for?

768
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,740
Of course you can join the table.

769
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,020
Do you have any chips?

770
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,820
Qi Lianshan is gone,

771
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,820
and I'm in control of the market

772
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,780
in the northern frontier now.

773
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,540
Of course, I know

774
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,380
you sent Sun there too.

775
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,980
The thing is

776
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,700
it's different for the two of us.

777
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,660
I'm going back to the old place,

778
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,260
but for him,

779
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,340
he is

780
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,260
being a pioneer.

781
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,380
Those aren't the same
in difficulty levels

782
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
Think about it.

783
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,900
The business of the northern frontier

784
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,100
is indeed a bid deal for Mr. Jiang.

785
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,460
Since

786
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,540
you sound confident, Mr. Sanmahu,

787
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,060
I look forward to your good news.

788
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,180
No problem.

789
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,380
Mr. Han,

790
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,700
rest assured.

791
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,860
The northern frontier

792
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,700
is on me.

793
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,140
However,

794
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,300
I want to ask for a favor.

795
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm in the middle

796
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,580
of something,

797
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,300
but I'm lost.

798
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,820
Tell me.

799
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,540
Sanmahu,

800
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,420
look at you.

801
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,420
You are breaking the rules,

802
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,340
alright?

803
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,940
This is your own business!

804
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,220
I have nothing to do with it!

805
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,540
Calm down, please.

806
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,500
I'm telling you.

807
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,820
Even if Mr. Jiang finds out,

808
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,580
you are not on the right side.

809
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,220
You know him?

810
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,100
That's great.

811
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,380
You can find

812
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,540
a better balance.

813
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,100
Shut up!

814
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,380
You see, I am

815
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,620
too kind.

816
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,900
I can't do it myself.

817
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,580
If you find it difficult,

818
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,620
you can

819
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,940
leave him here.

820
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,100
I guess

821
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,420
in about thirty minutes,

822
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,900
the cops will be here.

823
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,900
If you are fine with it,

824
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,580
I have nothing to worry about.

825
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,300
See you.

826
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,460
I do really want to see

827
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,500
the reaction of Tu

828
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,820
when he finds out about it.

829
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:21,860
Let's go.

830
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,020
Mr. Han,

831
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:33,900
they truly left.

832
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,300
Then

833
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,540
what should we do?

834
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,700
He saw our face.

835
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,460
You saw him.

836
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,180
He is an old man.

837
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,340
There is nothing to be afraid of,

838
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,300
right?

839
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,540
Go.

840
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,740
Kill him.

841
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,340
Mr. Han,

842
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,700
wait.

843
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,140
I...

844
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,900
I've never done anything like this.

845
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,460
I'm afraid that I will mess it up.

846
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,020
You've never done
any business before either,

847
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,460
but you did it well.

848
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,100
Business is business.

849
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,060
This is different.

850
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:26,700
Mr. Han,

851
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,020
what if I didn't make a clean job?

852
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,300
I'm telling you.

853
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,140
It's not a discussion.

854
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,100
I'm not asking for your opinion.

855
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,260
Listen carefully.

856
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,540
It's part of the business.

857
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,820
Either you do it,

858
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,380
or drop out completely.

859
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,460
Don't force yourself.

860
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,980
If you don't want to,

861
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,180
it's okay.

862
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,060
It's a big world,

863
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,100
a fancy world

864
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,580
with many chasing after the money.

865
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,060
Any of them can do it, right?

866
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:04,980
What's wrong?

867
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,780
Are you scared?

868
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,380
Leave.

869
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,380
Get lost!

870
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,220
I will do it.

871
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,300
I can do it.

872
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,380
Sheng, do you know

873
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,540
how many people told me
you couldn't handle it

874
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,340
when I let you run the business?

875
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,540
Because you weren't ruthless enough!

876
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,580
Once you get this done,

877
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,420
no one dares to talk

878
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,580
behind your back.

879
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,180
If you get this done today,

880
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:55,940
starting tomorrow,

881
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,620
you will be in charge

882
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,900
of all the business of Dragon Unleashed

883
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,860
in Xiatong.

884
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,220
And I'm telling you.

885
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,660
The shipment from the northern frontier,

886
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,460
all the supplies,

887
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,260
will be in your hands!

888
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,140
Thank you for the opportunity.

889
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,620
I will leave it to you.

890
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,540
Sure.

891
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,780
Come on.

892
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,860
Make it easy for me.

893
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,700
However,

894
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,540
kid,

895
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,140
you'll have bad dreams in your life.

896
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,620
Drop it.

897
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,900
Let them do it themselves.

898
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,420
Don't take the fall for them.

899
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,300
Don't become their tool.

900
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,540
Turn around?

901
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,340
Do you even believe your own words?

902
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,780
If it's possible to turn around,

903
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,580
why are you here?

904
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,700
I made too many mistakes
when I was young.

905
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,300
I thought

906
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,780
one finger could make up for them,

907
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,540
but now

908
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,900
I know

909
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,740
it's nowhere near.

910
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,380
Perhaps only with my life,

911
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,580
I can get a chance
to be a good person again.

912
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,140
So you should thank me.

913
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,460
I'm here to set you free.

914
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,820
Am I right?

915
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,020
No, kid. You don't set me free.

916
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,660
You replace me.

917
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,420
I don't want you

918
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,820
to be ruined.

919
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,060
You are a young man.

920
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,860
You still have a long way ahead.

921
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,940
You can be a decent man.

922
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,340
"Go. Kill him."

923
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,180
"Once you get this done,

924
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,700
no one dares to talk

925
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,260
behind your back."

926
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,420
Do not kill.

927
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,660
Do not corner another into the dead end.

928
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,860
"You will be in charge
of all the business in Xiatong."

929
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,420
Stop it.

930
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,460
Do not harm the elderly, weak,
disabled, or the sick.

931
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,700
"All the supplies

932
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,700
will be in your hands."

933
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,780
Stop it. Did you hear me?

934
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,180
Do not clash with the authorities.

935
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,700
"You will be Dragon Unleashed's..."

936
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,340
I told you to stop!

937
00:51:59,260 --> 00:51:59,820
Do not...

938
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:01,620
Do

939
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,420
not...

940
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,820
Do not...

941
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,660
Do not...
