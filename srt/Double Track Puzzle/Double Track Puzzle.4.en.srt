00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,060
is directed at you.

195
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,700
So,

196
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,220
whether we like it or not,

197
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,380
we have to

198
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,500
take this Sanmahu job.

199
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,980
If you dare to undermine me,

200
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,020
I'll quit.

201
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,980
I know you're in a difficult position.

202
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,500
The task force is short-handed.

203
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,940
Catching Sanmahu

204
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,100
is the most important task
for the First Division.

205
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,460
If Zhan Peng has a problem,

206
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,420
tell him to talk to me.

207
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,860
Tu.

208
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,300
Sweating is fine,

209
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,740
but no more bleeding,

210
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,620
understood?

211
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,700
You know,

212
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,420
the more timid a person is,

213
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,020
the more they talk tough.

214
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,700
Timid people often

215
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,940
put on a front just to feel brave.

216
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,620
Sir,

217
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,460
Mr. Ba won't say anything
out of line, will he?

218
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,180
Speaking of that,

219
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,260
he's practically my protégé.

220
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,220
We may be close in age,

221
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,420
but the seniority still stands.

222
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,340
You know the old saying,

223
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,220
a master and protégé are like family.

224
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,940
He's done all he could and should.

225
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,060
He was stubborn

226
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,060
about a few things.

227
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,940
If not for that,

228
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,180
we'd still be close.

229
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,980
Honestly, he's more loyal than you.

230
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,140
Forget it.

231
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,340
If he doesn't want to work together,

232
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,740
we'll part ways.

233

we've got the guest.

How should we

236
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,860
receive him?

237
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,780
He deserves a full spread.

238
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,380

239
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,220

[Lease Agreement. Part B: Wang Hai]

241
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,220
Mr. Zhan,

242
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,420
I've asked the landlord and neighbors.

243
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:49,980
He has

244
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,100
lived here for over a year,

245
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,300
and has been punctual
with the rent.

246
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,860
He's also polite to others.

247
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,260
There's nothing unusual about him.

248
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,340
This is

249
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,860
the files about his renting.

250
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,660
Don't bother looking.

251
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,700
That info's obviously false.

252
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,900
He's been living here for over a year,

253
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,860
and this is all he's got?

254
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,220
He plans to run at any time.

255
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:09,980
Mr. Zhan,

256
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,940
we found something.

257
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,380
This brat has so many aliases.

258
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,340
This is too well-made.

259
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
If you pulled one out

260
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
on its own,

261
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
you'd never know it was fake.

Forged holographic film.

263
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,020
The plastic seal still smells fresh.

264
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,220
Color-changing, anti-counterfeit.

265
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,060
They used infrared ink.

266
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,060
The technique

267
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,820
is quite impressive.

268
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:42,820
Hello?

269
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,500
I've got an urgent task.

270
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,940
Can you help me look into

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,220
the people making fake certificates?

272
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,460
Yes.

273
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,540
The craftsmanship is top-notch.

274
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,380
It could easily pass as real.

275
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,220
See who can do it

276
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,340
and report back fast.

277
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,260
It's rare not to be on duty or standby.

278
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,500
I don't care what Xiong told you.

279
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,980
We can have a drink,

280
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,060
but I can't give you my men.

281
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,660
Mr. Tu,

282
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,540
you are the captain
of the First Division.

283
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,460
What you do has nothing to do with me.

284
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
But if we need intel

285
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,820
or support on the ground,

286
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,980
you'll have to send people
to work with us.

287
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,580
It seems catching thieves

288
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,420
isn't any safer
than catching drug dealers.

289
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,540
If it weren't for me,

290
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,860

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,540
What's your connection to him?

293
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,220
Why's he so fixated on you?

294
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
Back then,

295
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,180
I transferred back from the army,

296
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,260
and joined the Anti-Pickpocket Unit.

297
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,940
I wasn't good enough.

298
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,340
Not only did I fail to catch anyone,

299
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,460
but I got played like a fool by them.

300
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,260
To save face,

301
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,340
I took a leave of absence,

302
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,140
and specifically traveled north

303
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,340
to visit an old gentleman.

304
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,900
He was no ordinary person.

305
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,020
He had a reputation even before 1949,

306
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,300
one of the best in the business.

307
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,660
Later, he retired.

308
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,580
I learned the trade from him.

309
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,780
Bit by bit,

310
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,660
I found my way around the thief bosses.

311
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,260
Later, I found out

312
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,140
Sanmahu was also his protégé.

313
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,140
He was

314
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,220
ruthless

315
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
and made enemies everywhere.

316
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,500
While the old gentleman was still alive,

317
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,780
he kept him in check.

318
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,140
But before he passed,

319
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,540
he warned me and his eldest protégé

320
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,740
that Sanmahu was too ambitious,

321
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,340
clever with his moves,

322
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,500
and

323
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,820
bound to become a threat.

324
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,820
If he ever crossed the line,

325
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,140
we should eliminate him.

326
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,340
As a police officer,

327
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,500
I'm sworn to uphold justice.

328
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,100
And then,

329
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,460
his eldest protégé

330
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,580
retired.

332
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,380
went wild.

333
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,620
The last time I confronted him,

334
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,420
I broke his leg.

335
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,060
Later, in retaliation against me,

I'll join you in one, Mr. Tu.

339
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,340
So that's how it is.

340
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,100
Then Sanmahu

341
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,460
really deserves to die.

On every level,

343
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,180

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,980
Please calm down.

384
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,180
Come in.

385
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
For hotpot,

386
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,860
this mutton

387
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,140
has to come from the grasslands
in the northern frontier,

388
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,460
preferably lamb.

389
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,940
Mr. Long,

390
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,140
please try some.

391
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,420
Brought in from the grasslands
in the northern frontier,

392
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,940
just to show our respect.

393
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,820
What exactly

394
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,420
do you want?

395
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,020
Food's done.

396
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,060
Drinks are done.

397
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,420
Let's get to the point.

398
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,660
Speak.

399
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,380
No need to rush.

400
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,580
We're

401
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,740
new around here,

402
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,780
still finding our way.

403
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,740
We'd really like to get to know you.

404
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,940
And I heard

405
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,900
your business hasn't been
so good lately, has it?

406
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,900
It's fine.

407
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,380
Is that so?

408
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,180
In our line of work,

409
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,820
first is skill,

410
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,420
second is information.

411
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,220
You've

412
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,420
got both,

413
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,300
but what does that have to do with me?

414
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,620
If you're not in the game,

415
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,620
don't play like you are.

416
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,980
Slick fingers

417
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,700
won't get past our guns.

418
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,020
Mr. Long,

419
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,500
your guns are powerful,

420
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,020
but they don't always hit right.

421
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,380
One slip,

422
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,380
and you're six feet under.

423
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,260
Dead men don't make deals.

424
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,460
So,

425
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,700
if the guns

426
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,660
can stay holstered,

427
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,300
let's keep them that way.

428
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,340
Mr. Long,

429
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,140
caution is wise when choosing allies.

430
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,420
But we chose you

431
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,420
carefully.

432
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,460
It's the right call.

433
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,140
You want to be friends with me?

434
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,820
Well, that's not your call to make.

435
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,380
Thieves have a way out,

436
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,900
but I don't!

437
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,940
Our lives

438
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,180
stopped being our own a long time ago.

439
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,300
If you have the guts,

440
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,140
then bring it on!

441
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,940
If I go down, you're coming with me!

442
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,220
The road to the underworld

443
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,100
is less lonely with someone beside me!

444
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,580
Are you serious?

445
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,420
Mr. Long,

446
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
you've got guts.

447
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,980
I respect that.

448
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,300
I'll down three cups

449
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,540
to make up for our rash behavior.

450
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,420
Please accept my apology.

451
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,180
I trust someone

452
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,340
as generous as you

453
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,620
won't take it to heart.

454
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,220
We

455
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,060
mean it.

456
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,500
We want to be friends with you.

457
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
Your way of making friends

458
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,460
is quite special.

459
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:12,980
Alright.

460
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,060
So,

461
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,460
how do you plan to work with me?

462
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,860
Straight to the point.

463
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,820
Then here's our pitch.

464
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,460
We want to be your couriers.

465
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,020
Really?

466
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,060
That's right.

467
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,380
You have top-tier goods,

468
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,660
but bottom-tier couriers.

469
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,260
Am I right?

470
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,380
Even scum

471
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,540
like Zheng Xiaoshan

472
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,700
had you dancing.

473
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,700
A few more slip-ups like this,

474
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,020
and word gets out,

475
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,420
what's left of your name?

476
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,740
Mr. Long.

477
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,060
We mean business.

478
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,580
You can count on us.

479
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,660
And as long as we're in play...

480
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
[Dou]

481
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,300
Your goods will always

482
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,860
land where they're supposed to.

483
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,300
Alright.

484
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,940
Tell me,

485
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,820
how much cut do you want?

486
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,340
No way.

487
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,540
Mr. Long,

488
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,540
trust us.

489
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,780
We will be worth way more than

490
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,420
what you're paying.

491
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,860
The police have been chasing you,

492
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,420
right?

493
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,780
Are you threatening me?

494
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,180
Let's make money together,

495
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,020
make it big.

496
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,220
Alright then.

497
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,820
There's a batch,

498
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,420
two kilos.

499
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,100
Buy

500
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,220
and smoke it.

501
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,780
Then we talk.

502
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,860
These are the rules.

503
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
Perfectly fine.

504
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,500
Let's see if you can back that up.

505
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
Happy cooperation.

506
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,580
Thanks, buddy.

507
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,380
Alright.

508
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,620
I'll treat you sometime.

509
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,780
Okay.

510
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,980
Mr. Zhan.

511
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,700
I've asked around.

512
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,860
Some people can get infrared ink,

513
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,300
but true craftsmanship
is hard to come by.

514
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,380
Talent doesn't go unnoticed.

515
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,540
They earn well, but it comes at a cost.

516
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,940
They've either been caught by the police

517
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,340
or targeted by rivals.

518
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,660
Did you send the photos
to the Records Office?

519
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,220
Yes.

520
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,820
Mr. Zhan.

521
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,700
Careful.

522
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,180
Are you feeling better?

523
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,780
Fully recovered.

524
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,820
That's good.

525
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,620
What is it?

526
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,140
Here are

527
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,020
files from fake certificate cases

528
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,580
over the last two years.

529
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,700
Thanks for your hard work.

530
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,380
Mr. Zhan,

531
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,660
I've seen the photos Nanyi sent.

532
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,900
The person you're looking for
isn't among them.

533
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,260
What.

534
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,900
We spend every day out in the field,

535
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,780
dreaming of a desk job.

536
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,580
And you, already in an office,

537
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,860
want to be out here?

538
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,700
Give me a reason.

539
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,700
I messed up the task Mr. Tu gave me.

540
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,700
But I'll rise from where I fall,

541
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,220
whether I'm in the office
or out in the field.

542
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,700
Alright, I understand.

543
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,340
Give them to me.

544
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,380
Mr. Zhan,

545
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
fieldwork should be done

546
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,340
by those in the field.

547
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,940
The First Division's short-handed.

548
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,060
Everyone's out on missions.

549
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
So let's be clear.

550
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,140
This is your decision.

551
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
We couldn't stop you.

552
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,940
Come in.

553
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,740
There was an economic fraud case
last year in Xiatong.

554
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,220
Three individuals used fake identities

555
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,220
and a full set of forged documents

556
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
to defraud Weisheng Group
of seven million yuan in goods.

557
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,860
The Financial Crime Unit
notified the Second Division,

558
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,340
and the suspects
were apprehended on the train.

559
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,660
But that's not the key issue.

560
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,420
What matters is

561
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,940
the fake ID cards they used

562
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,900
had the same flaw as these.

563
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,260
We've seen these before, though.

564
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,300
What flaw?

565
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,260
Mr. Zhan, look.

566
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,900
This character on these cards
has a flaw.

567
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,780
The left stroke is thicker

568
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,540
at the top but thinner at the bottom.

569
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,420
Let me see.

570
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,860
Really the same width
top and bottom.

571
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,740
These are photos of the evidence
when it was filed.

572
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,740
It really is.

573
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,620
You wouldn't catch it
if you didn't know.

574
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,300
But once you do, it stands out.

575
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,780
What about the one
who made the fake certificates?

576
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,100
Still at large.

577
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,900
Why?

578
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,660
Only two were caught on the train.

579
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,180
The third never boarded.

580
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,780
According to his accomplices,

581
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,100
he was a local,

582
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,100
mainly in charge of forging certificates

583
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,420
and handling on-site reception.

584
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,580
He wasn't involved in anything else.

585
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,380
He got away,
so it became a separate case.

586
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,180
It didn't go anywhere after that.

587
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,900
Didn't expect you
to know so much about it.

588
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,340
It was a joint investigation.

589
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,180
While organizing the case files,

590
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,980
I overheard
the Household Registration Section

591
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,660
discussing hidden marks on ID cards.

592
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,860
It left a strong impression.

593
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,180
It shouldn't be.

594
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,460
A computer

595
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,100
could've fixed that easily.

596
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,980
It's not computer printed,

597
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,420
but hand-engraved.

598
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,940
That is more precise work.

599
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,380
So the problem must be
with the master plate

600
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,260
and

601
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,620
that's what led to all this.

602
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,820
If it was really hand-engraved,

603
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,660
our investigation will narrow down.

604
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,540
People who can do that

605
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,060
are probably much fewer

606
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,300
than those who make fake certificates.

607
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,780
Alright,

608
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,260
Zhang, Nanyi,

609
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,100
you two stay.

610
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,100
Everyone else,

611
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,140
led by Gao Buyi

612
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,300
and Han Xin,

613
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,300
investigate

614
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,820
the underground hand-engraving experts.

615
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,740
Cast a wide net to create a stir,

616
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,620
and see

617
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,660
if we can

618
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,980
flush him out.

619
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:46,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

620
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,020
Mr. Tu.

621
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,020
I'm sorry.

622
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,900
I get it.

623
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,700
I'll head back

624
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,820
to end the informant arrangement.

625
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:15,980
I...

626
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,620
You have families.

627
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,380
I understand.

628
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,380
I've got nothing to lose.

629
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,020
I'll fight him to the end.

630
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,220
Keep this.

631
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,300
Grab a drink with them later.

632
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm leaving.

633
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,900
Mr. Tu.

634
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Stop fighting.

635
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,780
We're worried about you.

636
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,740
Sanmahu isn't who he used to be.

637
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,740
He wants money more than his life.

638
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
He's selling heroin.

639
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,380
Drugs involved?

640
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,420
I want to help.

641
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,820
I really do.

642
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,700
But I can't risk my daughter's life.

643
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,740
If he thinks dying takes too long,

644
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,020
I can make it quick.

645
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
We found him.

646
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,540
Local guy, surname Hu.

647
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,340
Name's Hu Yidao.

648
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,820
Here is all his information.

649
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,180
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

650
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,260
Over there.

651
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:42,940
This room.

652
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,140
Gao Buyi,

653
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,100
guard the door.

654
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:45,580
Okay.

655
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,260
The meal is ready.

656
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,300
Godmother,

657
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,780
take a break.

658
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,460
Hurry.

659
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,340
Come on.

660
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,020
Take some rest.

661
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,420
Come on.

662
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,460
Come on.

663
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,220
Take a seat.

664
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,220
Leave this

665
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,500
for Mao when he gets back.

666
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,540
You're joking.

667
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,700
If he says he'll be right back,

668
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,980
he won't show up for one day.

669
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,780
If it's up to him,

670
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,980
it's hard

671
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,460
to get tap water,

672
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,620
let alone a meal.

673
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,340
Godmother,

674
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,220
here,

675
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,180
have some water.

676
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,300
Here.

677
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,940
Take it slow.

678
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,060
Alright.

679
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,340
Mao

680
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,500
has been busy

681
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,980
and away a lot,

682
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,300
but he cares

683
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,980
about you and always talks about you.

684
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,780
Don't cover for him.

685
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,500
Of course I know

686
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,820
what kind of person he is.

687
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,900
If only he were half as good as you,

688
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,420
that would be great.

689
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,740
Godmother,

690
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,860
everyone has their strengths.

691
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,140
Back when I was a kid,

692
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,860
I used to get beaten up.

693
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,620
Mao was always the one
who stood up for me.

694
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,100
If it weren't for him,

695
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,300
I have no idea

696
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,860
how many beatings I would've got.

697
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,220
After all these years,

698
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,660
Long,

699
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,020
if it weren't for you,

700
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,340
he might've been in jail long ago.

701
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,220
Godmother,

702
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,420
don't worry.

703
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:19,660
Sit here.

704
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,380
Thank you.

705
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,100
Hu Yidao, right?

706
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,420
Yes.

707
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,060
Take a look.

708
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,260
This is

709
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
your work, isn't it?

710
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,620
Look closely.

711
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,100
Who did you sell

712
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,300
these five to?

713
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,860
Be straight

714
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,700
with me.

715
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,660
You made five.

716
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,060
No way you forgot.

717
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,820
I swear, I don't know the name.

718
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,660
But we do keep their phone numbers

719
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,380
for major orders.

720
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,940
Have you met him?

721
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,380
Yes.

722
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,380
He was wearing a mask when he came,

723
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,980
so we

724
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,180
couldn't see his face.

725
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,700
Go.

726
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:10,940
Get the sketch artist.

727
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,740
Check the phone number.

728
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,300
Okay.

729
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,060
Mr. Zhan,

730
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,380
I think I've seen him before.

731
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,660
Take a good look.

732
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,460
It's him.

733
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,820
The murderer of Gao Si.

734
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,740
Are you sure?

735
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,100
There's no way I wouldn't recognize him.

736
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,900
That means...

737
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,180
Zheng Xiaoshan and Gao Si

738
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,500
were both killed by him.

739
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,820
He and Dragon Unleashed

740
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,860
are also connected.

741
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,340
He's the biggest suspect.

742
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,820
Wherever you're hiding,

743
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,460
we'll bring you to justice.
