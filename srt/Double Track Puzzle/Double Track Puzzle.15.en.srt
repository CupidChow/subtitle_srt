3
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,100
Get over here.

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,980
Who are you?

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,340
My last name is Han.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,180
I'm sorry for what happened

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,220
to you.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,420
I want to help you.

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,860
Come here.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,740
What are you afraid of?

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,660
How can you help?

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,300
I can't.

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,140
Just hear me out.

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,900
These people

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,220
stole your identity and records.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,180
They must have some serious backing.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,340
They're not afraid
of you making a scene.

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,660
Look what happened this time.

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,940
You came asking for answers,

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,300
and you ended up arrested.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,700
They played the victim.

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,980
If not for me,

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,020
paying a fine would've been
the least of your worries.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,380
You'd better

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,420
face reality.

26
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,380
Stop making things harder for yourself.

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,940
Understand?

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,140
So you're saying

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,380
I should just accept it, is that it?

30
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,500
Man,

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,020
I'm not with them.

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,540
Don't look at me like that.

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,460
Understand?

34
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,500
I get what you're going through.

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,220
I've been where you are.

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,580
But once you have money?

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,220
Everyone treats you different.

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,260
All smiles.

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,780
You want justice?

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,900
Then you need to have what it takes.

41
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,220
You get that?

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,020
I don't even have an identity right now.

43
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,500
How am I supposed to make money?

44
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,620
Here's 10,000 yuan.

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,740
Take 5,000 for compensation,

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,180
and the other 5,000
is earnest money from me.

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,420

you're a man of few words.

53
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,780
You're tight-lipped.

54

What exactly do you
need me to do, Mr. Han?

59
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,140
Don't call me that.

60
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,580

As for what exactly needs to be done,

63

64

65
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,540
I'll discuss it with you in detail.

66

How did it go?

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,420
The traffic police helped us

77
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,580
track down a suspicious car.

78

82

The round trip took
about twenty minutes.

I talked to the neighbors.

84
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
They heard a loud commotion inside.

85
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,300

He's still out of it.

111

from the interrogation

Something external

119
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,860
must have influenced him.

No one gets near him.

127
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,060
- Got it.
- Go now.

We'll do

146
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,140
as you say.

then get bailed out under a settlement.

178
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,380
They gave him an in-game item
worth twenty thousand yuan.

179
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,300
What was the message?

180
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,140
It was

181
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,380
"The old lady got home safe.
Don't worry."

182
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,140
I have no idea what that means.

183
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,660
Come on,

184
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,580
don't look at me like that, Mr. Zhan.

185
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,420
I'm telling the truth.

186
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,620
If you don't believe me,

187
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,140
I'll print out

188
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,100

189
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,380

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,420
when he was bragging about it.

193
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,500
If I had known,

194
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,020
I never would've let him do it.

195
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,020
He didn't cause you any trouble, did he?

196
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,980
Kid,

197
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,340
I feel like

198
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,100
you're playing
some kind of spy game with me.

199
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,060
I would never dare,

200
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,860
Mr. Zhan.

201
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,060
I swear

202
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,700
this has nothing to do with me!

203
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,020
If that punk really caused you trouble,

204
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,020
I can lure him out right now.

205
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,140
You can arrest him on the spot.

206
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,260
I've just gotten this operation
off the ground.

207
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,020
I can't let him ruin it.

208
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
Right, Mr. Zhan?

209
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,300
What's all this?

210
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,700
Nothing much.

211
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,820
You're so thorough,

212
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,580
preparing all these materials.

213
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,460
But I'm swamped.

214
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,260
No time to read.

215
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,580
You handle

216
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,780
who answers to whom.

217
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,220
Get me the intel, and we're good.

218
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,700
But if you don't,

219
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
when Sun Zhongze

220
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,260
goes back in,

221
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,180
you'll be the one who made it happen.

222
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,500
And this recording

223
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,340
is gonna get you on TV

224
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,380
and get an award.

225
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,460
You're full of tricks.

226
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,060
Think it over.

227
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,500
You wanted to see me this late?

228
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,140
Guess that really hit a nerve, huh?

229
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,140
Cut the crap.

230
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,100
Taohua couldn't possibly
have anything to do with you guys.

231
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,300
You don't even know
what's really going on with her, do you?

232
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,780
Trying to trick me?

233
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,260
Have you ever thought

234
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,340
your intel

235
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,700
might be wrong?

236
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm sure you have.

237
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,260
Otherwise, you wouldn't be

238
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
talking so ambiguously.

239
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:05,940
Spit it out.

240
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
Who told you?

241
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,700
Xu Laizi?

242
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,940
You're so clever.

243
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
You figure it all out.

244
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,060
Why even talk to me?

245
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,420
After coming to Xiatong,

246
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,220
Taohua did go back
to the northern frontier a few times.

247
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,980
I want to know

248
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,100
what her relationship

249
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,980
with Qi Lianshan really was
after she started with me.

250
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,300
Didn't expect you

251
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,500
to be a hopeless romantic.

252
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,340
Guess Sanmahu
didn't see that coming either.

253
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,980
I just want to know

254
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,980
if she and Qi Lianshan

255
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,140
were working together.

256
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,980
Don't get me wrong.

257
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,620
I

258
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,260
hate being kept in the dark.

259
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,540
Now that I'm in here,

260
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,060
I want them all in here with me.

261
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,900
As long as we have enough chips,

262
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,540
once we catch those brats,

263
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,620
you can settle your scores face-to-face.

264
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,820
Hua Long was small-time.

265
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,580
Sanmahu's real goal

266
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,780
is to control Xiatong's transport routes

267
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,820
to move goods to the northern frontier.

268
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
Qi Lianshan's ambitious

269
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,060
but cautious.

270
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,380
His coming to Xiatong personally means

271
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,460
Sanmahu made him
an offer he couldn't refuse.

272
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,340
All I can say is

273
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,380
they're planning something big.

274
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,180
Once it's done,

275
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,900
Sanmahu

276
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,580
will connects both ends

277
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,820
of the bridge.

278
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,500
Sanmahu never loses money on a deal.

279
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,700
One end is Qi Lianshan.

280
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,620
Who's on the other?

281
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,340
I don't know.

282
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,700
Let that old fossil

283
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,540
tell you himself.

284
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,700
If he lives long enough

285
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,300
to see you.

286
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,660
Mr. Sanmahu,

287
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,540
this is our first deal.

288
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
A word from you,

289
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,220
and I came all the way to Xiatong.

290
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,300
Seriously.

291
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,500
This isn't how we do business.

292
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,380
We agreed on ten kilos, right?

293
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,500
Why is it...

294
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,660
Why is it suddenly five?

295
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,540
What's going on?

296
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,380
Mr. Qi,

297
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,780
getting started is the toughest part.

298
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,780
But

299
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,980
where there's a first,
there's a second.

300
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,860
Right?

301
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,100
This time,

302
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,700
I wasn't

303
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,460
fully prepared.

304
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,980
If you're not happy with the terms,

305
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,740
it's fine.

306
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,460
I'll cover it myself.

307
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,460
I'll give up a ten percent cut.

308
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,540
How's that?

309
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,420
Let's get this deal done first.

310
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,620
We can stick to the agreement after.

311
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,060
Mr. Sanmahu,

312
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,700
you have no idea
how big your reputation is

313
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
in the northern frontier.

314
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,260
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here

315
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,660
just because Master Sun
from Da'an League

316
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,500
called me.

317
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,700
Alright.

318
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,060
You handle things with respect.

319
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,460
But this is the last time.

320
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,540
Pull this again,

321
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,700
and I'll plant myself in Xiatong.

322
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,380
My operation

323
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,020
can't accommodate
someone of your stature.

324
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,100
How about this?

325
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,140
Tomorrow

326
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,420
at 10 AM,

327
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,100
Train T626

328
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
will stop in Xiatong

329
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,700
for twenty minutes.

330
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,700
Have your men

331
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
pick up the goods in Carriage 3.

332
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,660
Deal.

333
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,420
It's settled then.

334
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,900
Alright then.

335
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,540
Bye.

336
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,940
Look, I'd never even

337
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,420
met Sanmahu before this.

338
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,020
Master Sun from Da'an League

339
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,460
called him,

340
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,020
then he called me.

341
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,940
You heard it.

342
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,100
That's why I'm here.

343
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,660
Mr. Han,

344
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,900
this is

345
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,780
our first time dealing too.

346
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,020
So

347
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,060
I want no part

348
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,740
of whatever's between you two.

349
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,340
Well,

350
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,420
I've got a crew to run a business with.

351
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,700
You know

352
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,780
what matters to me.

353
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,500
Right?

354
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,580
I did what I promised you.

355
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Just don't forget what you promised me.

356
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,660
What do you mean?

357
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,140
This is the payment

358
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,180
I prepared for you

359
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,860
for tomorrow's pickup.

360
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,940
The goods and the money are both yours.

361
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,940
I can feel your sincerity, Mr. Qi.

362
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,380
I have to show mine, right?

363
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,540
Besides,

364
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,300
what you

365
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,700
care about most

366
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,900
is the supply chain.

367
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,420
Right.

368
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,860
I can ensure you

369
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,620
get as much as you can

370
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,860
get in the northern frontier.

371
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,420
I think

372
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,460
as long as no one else interferes,

373
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,580
we can work something out.

374
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,100
Right?

375
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,940
Absolutely.

376
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,940
Now,

377
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,180
the best goods on the market

378
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,020
are from the Tan family, right?

379
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,660
Cheap and good.

380
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,500
There was a misunderstanding before.

381
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,420
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

382
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,540
gone to Kai Sa for supplies.

383
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,060
Lame and overpriced.

384
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,780
Right?

385
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
You're a stand-up guy.

386
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,620
A real stand-up guy.

387
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,220
You know

388
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,020
what I care about most.

389
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,100
Honestly,

390
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,300
doing business with you

391
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,420
would be way better than with Sanmahu.

392
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,940
Right?

393
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,980
So rest assured.

394
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,260
I'll work with you seriously

395
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
and steadily.

396
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,020
Pleasure working with you.

397
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,700
Likewise.

398
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,940
Dou got caught

399
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,020
and Taohua's hurt.

400
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,740
The help we called

401
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,180
is still on the way.

402
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,580
What do we do now?

403
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,900
Changfeng.

404
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,740
Looks like

405
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,900
you'll have to handle this one yourself.

406
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,100
If this deal goes through,

407
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,340
you can return

408
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,860
to the clinic, I promise.

409
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,580
I can deliver the goods.

410
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,340
But I'm just one person.

411
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,700
If anything goes wrong,

412
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,900
I might not be able to handle it alone.

413
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,780
But right now,

414
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,780
you're the only one I trust.

415
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,340
But then again,

416
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,220
fewer people mean less noise.

417
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,780
We won't attract

418
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,020
the wrong kind of attention.

419
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,060
Right?

420
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,660
But your concern

421
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,860
is understandable.

422
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,660
This is the first deal.

423
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,660
Hard to tell they're friends or foes.

424
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,900
How about this?

425
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,220
Zhong and Hu

426
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,660
will go with you.

427
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
They'll back you up.

428
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,540
Give them a call.

429
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,260
Let them know

430
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,140
they'll go tomorrow.

431
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,060
Got it.

432
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,740
Answer the phone.

433
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,020
Answer the phone!

434
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,980
Get off me!

435
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,780
Hello?

436
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,700
Hu,

437
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,620
get Zhong.

438
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,620
Meet me in an hour

439
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,180
at the place
where I picked you up last time.

440
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,820
Yeah.

441
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,980
There's a job tomorrow.

442
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,260
Come tonight.

443
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,420
Alright.

444
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,820
Wait.

445
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,820
Hand me the phone.

446
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,060
I need to tell him something.

447
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,700
I'll ask him to grab something for me.

448
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,180
Hu,

449
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,580
it's Qian.

450
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,220
Listen,

451
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,660
tomorrow's matter is very important.

452
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,220
Nothing can go wrong.

453
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,500
Go to the clinic
and get something for me.

454
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,740
Tell Dou

455
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,820
that under the big cabinet
in my bedroom, there's a box.

456
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,940
Inside is some of my stuff

457
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,860
I used for disguises.

458
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
There are

459
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
three wigs next to it.

460
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,180
Bring all of them over.

461
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,420
Got it.

462
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,460
Tomorrow,

463
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,780
it's all on you.

464
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,980
After this job,

465
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,500
can I really go back to the clinic?

466
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,940
You have my word.

467
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
You've said that a million times.

468
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,460
Sir,

469
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,260
that call he made was a bit...

470
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,660
A bit suspicious.

471
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,020
Should I keep an eye on him?

472
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,020
Not an issue right now.

473
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,580
Don't worry about it.

474
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,620
Remember the mission for tomorrow.

475
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,860
Got it.

476
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,220
Is everyone here?

477
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
They arrived the day before yesterday.

478
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,140
Alright.

479
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,140
You two

480
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,820
go together tomorrow.

481
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,540
If anything seems off,

482
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,340
take the money

483
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,100
and the goods.

484
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,140
And don't come find me.

485
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,020
Get back

486
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,420
to the northern frontier fast.

487
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,900
I'll find you later.

488
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,460
Understood?

489
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,180
Got it.

490
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,660
Go get ready.

491
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,500
Take the money. Let's go.

492
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,860
Mr. Han,

493
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,780
if we handle it this way,

494
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,300
will Mr. Jiang have a problem?

495
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,100
In this bloody world,

496
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,420
there's only one Mr. Jiang.

497
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,860
He understands better than us

498
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,660
that there's only room for one top dog.

499
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,940
Letting Sanmahu in

500
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,060
might seem like
he's creating competition,

501
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,940
but it's really a punishment for us.

502
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,300
I messed up

503
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,020
with the Hua Long matter.

504
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,900
Sorry for dragging you down.

505
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,020
The most pointless thing

506
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,660
is regretting

507
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,660
what's already happened.

508
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,860
Mr. Jiang wants to create competition.
It's a good thing.

509
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,780
It gives everyone a chance
to show what they're made of.

510
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,100
Only what you demonstrate

511
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,180
has value.

512
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,140
I've looked into it.

513
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,820
Qi Lianshan

514
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,580
is from Da'an League.

515
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,540
He's ruthless and treacherous.

516
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,500
Not someone you can trust.

517
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,940
Who

518
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,220
are we sending for the job tomorrow?

519
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,580
On one side, there's Qi Lianshan.

520
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,620
On the other, Sanmahu.

521
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,100
Plenty of people are interested in them.

522
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,260
No need for us to get involved.

523
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,220
I didn't give him that money

524
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,100
for nothing.

525
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,660
It's compensation for them.

526
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,300
Call the cops?

527
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,300
Wouldn't that backfire on us?

528
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,820
It's risky.

529
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,340
Set up a buffer.

530
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,060
I think that kid who wanted to
take Hua Long's spot

531
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,660
is pretty good.

532
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
He's been cozy with Mr. Zhan, right?

533
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,700
Have him put on another act.

534
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,340
Throw the bait.

535
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,780
The kid

536
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,900
is sharp

537
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,300
and quick.

538
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,300
But he's timid.

539
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,020
He's got no backbone.

540
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,460
I'm afraid he might

541
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,220
become a liability.

542
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,420
Sun,

543
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,980
no one's born fearless.

544
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,940
I remember my first run.

545
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,420
I carried 200 grams of heroin

546
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,740
from Kunyang to Xiatong.

547
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,180
It was split
into three milk powder tins.

548
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,660
The moment I got on the train,

549
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,540
I held those tins tight

550
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,740
and wouldn't let go.

551
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,620
For 28 hours,

552
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,020
I didn't sleep a wink.

553
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,780
Then I got to Xiatong,

554
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,620
delivered the goods, and got paid.

555
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,180
And suddenly, it clicked.

556
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,460
That's all there is to it.

557
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,540
What's the worst that could happen?

558
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,460
For the second run,

559
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,300
I was moving way more goods.

560
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,620
I got on the train,

561
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,420
tossed the goods on the luggage rack,

562
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,140
and slept.

563
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,020
I slept all the way to Xiatong.

564
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,100
Nothing happened.

565
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,780
So,

566
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,580
everything takes a process.

567
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,860
Mr. Tu,

568
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,900
last time it was
an unusual prescription.

569
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,620
This time, someone's here
to pick something up.

570
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,660
Is my master in trouble?

571
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,020
Dou,

572
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,220
it's fine.

573
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,900
Your master is just under suspicion now.

574
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,340
That's why he's informing us this way.

575
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,540
After this,

576
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,660
he can pull out.

577
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,460
Don't worry.

578
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,380
It'll be okay.

579
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
Then you two carry on.

580
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,700
Mr. Tu,

581
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,020
Mr. Qian went to great lengths

582
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,300
to get this message out.

583
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,260
What does it mean?

584
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,700
The only big move Sanmahu can pull now

585
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
involves the northern frontier.

586
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,260
Tomorrow morning, there's only one train

587
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,060
from Xiatong to Shangguan.

588
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,380
Train T626.

589
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,940
I'm guessing

590
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,540
the suitcase means

591
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,180
boarding the train.

592
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,300
The three wigs

593
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,700
likely mean

594
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,820
Carriage 3.

595
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,660

596

Wait.

599
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,700
Mr. Qian may have already...

600
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,860
Whatever Sanmahu's planning,

601
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
our priority is

602
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,380
to help Mr. Qian break free.

603
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,020
He is

604
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,340
on the verge of exposure.

605
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,980
This mission

606
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,380
must be kept strictly confidential.

607
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,940

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,500
Yes, sir!

I'm back.

611
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,980
I followed up based on the map

612
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,980
Cheng gave me.

613
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,020
That whole area is old neighborhoods

614
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,860
and shantytowns.

615
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Hard to search.

616
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:40,980
But

617
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,180
I found info on the van's owner.

618
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,820
It's Mao.

619
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,460
He's got two vehicles under his name.

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,820
[Motor Vehicle Information Inquiry]
One is the car from the death scene.

621
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,340
The other one is this van.

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,220
Wait,

623
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,540
they used Mao's car
to kidnap his mother.

624
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,580
And sent someone
to pass a message to Hua Long.

625
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
Hua Long must know a lot

626
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,580
for someone to be this scared.

627
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,020
Alright, got it.

628
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,460
Wait.

629
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,940
Good work.

630
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,420
No big deal.

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,740
Hey, Nanyi.

632
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,180
How's Hua Long?

633
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,420

636
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,380
Okay.

637
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,420
Mr. Zhan.

638
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,500
Sheng is looking for you.

639
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,820
Says he's got what you asked him

640
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,740
to check out.

You wanted to see me?

644
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,500
Have a seat.

followed me,

648
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,820

Over three years, sir.

650

You're nothing like him.

is written all over his face.

653
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,380
But yours

654
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,900
is buried deep.

655
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,620
I don't have any ambition.

656
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,380
No need to explain.

backup plans.

659
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,220
Just in case.

Think about it.

In Xiatong,

662
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,780
there are plenty of spots to move goods.

663
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,460

And

665
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,620
why Qi Lianshan?

It's because of you.

667
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,420

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,460

There are only two major supply routes
from the south.

One is Nameng.

676
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,540
People there are too powerful.

677
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,020
Qi Lianshan can't touch it.

678

The other one is Xiatong.

680
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,780
to come to Xiatong and check things out.

we'll

Don't you think?

715
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,420

you get thirty percent.

to trace the IP from that QQ account.

733

I got it.

734
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,500
The IP shows

00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,100
he used China Tietong.

736
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,340
Pretty rare.

737
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,620

still use Tietong.

00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,340
Listen up.

765
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,500
If no one answers,

766
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,020
have the neighborhood committee
reach the owner.

767
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,060
If they can't,

768
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,540
and something feels off,

769
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,540
breach the door.

770
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,100
Copy that.

771
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,220
What are you doing?

772
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:13,940
Hello.

773
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,940
Mr. Zhan, we've got something!

774
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,660
Go ahead.

775
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
Mrs. Mao is dead.

776
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,700
What?

777
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,540
Preliminary assessment

778
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
puts time of death
within the last two hours.

779
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,060
And the cause

780
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,620
was blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

781
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,340
Appreciate your work.

782
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,420
No problem.

783
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,740
Mr. Zhan,

784
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,340
I'm confused now.

785
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,940
Well,

786
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:46,940
if the people behind Hua Long

787
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,380
didn't want him to talk,

788
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,060
they wouldn't have to kill Mrs. Mao.

789
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,780
Based on the scene,

790
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,340
it's clearly not the same group.

791
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,940
Mr. Zhan,

792
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,020
found a hard drive.

793
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,980
It should be recoverable.

794
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,780
Good, work on it fast.

795
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,860
Mr. Han.

796
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,380
They're here.

797
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,660
I don't get

798
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,020
why we're taking such a big risk.

799
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,060
Having that kid pass the message

800
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,420
and check the computer
should've been enough.

801
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,340
Why did the old lady have to die?

802
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,660
Listen,

803
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,820
if you're putting on a show,

804
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,220
you go all the way.

805
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,660
Sun,

806
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,100
you don't get it.

807
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
They don't get it.

808
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,300
Nobody gets it.

809
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
And that's perfect.

810
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,500
It gives us time to do
what needs to be done.

811
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,660
Also,

812
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,380
the real deal

813
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,460
with a smoke bomb

814
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,780
isn't about how much smoke it makes.

815
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,340
It's all about

816
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,380
when it starts puffing out smoke.

817
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,660
Understand?

818
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,860
Understood.

819
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,020
Mr. Zhan!

820
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,220
It's out.

821
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,300
It's a ledger.

822
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,260
Look.

823
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,460
Purchase quantities,

824
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,380
sales quantities,
and transaction amounts.

825
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,860
Is the entry marked "Long"

826
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
refers to Hua Long?

827
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,140
It seems the person
who used this computer

828
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,020
was Hua Long's supplier.

829
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,940
Then who

830
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,140
smashed the computer
and killed Mrs. Mao?

831
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,380
This whole thing feels eerily off

832
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,740
in a way I can't put my finger on.

833
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,420
Mr. Zhan.

834
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,540
There's an anonymous MSN email.

835
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,160
[The situation's out of control.
They're about to make the deal.]

836
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,540
[On the 4th, Train T626. Intercept it
during the stop at Xiatong.]

837
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,340
On the 4th?

838
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,740
That's tomorrow.

839
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,540
Who are "they"?

840
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,860
The point isn't "they".

841
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,460
It's "intercept".

842
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,660
Tomorrow, Train T626.

843
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,140
Mr. Zhan.

844
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,100
Should we notify Tu?

845
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,220
We don't know if it's real yet.

846
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,060
So, not for now.

847
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,100
What about Hu and the others?

848
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,500
Sent them back already.

849
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,580
Mr. Sanmahu just called,

850
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,380
saying Qi Lianshan
is causing trouble again.

851
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,620
He and Taohua are handling it.

852
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,700
We'll deliver after it's settled.

853
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,300
Head back.

854
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,460
Sit tight.

855
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:54,980
Okay.

856
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:06,940
Mr. Sanmahu.

857
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,100
What's our next move?

858
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,660
Wait for word.

859
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,140
Be ready to pull out at any time.

860
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,880
[Train T626]

861
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,020
An eagle flies over the sky.

862
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,820
At my place.

863
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,820
What are you doing? Let go!

864
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,620
Move!

865
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,140
Stay down!

866
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,980
Move!

867
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,940
Make way!

868
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,940
Move!

869
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,740
Out of the way!

870
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,860
Freeze!

871
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,380
Where are the guys who came with you?

872
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,500
Just us two.

873
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,060
No one else.

874
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,820
Take him away.

875
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,500
Zhan Peng!

876
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,860
Mr. Tu?

877
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,180
Did you see that person?

878
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,420
No.

879
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,780
What's going on today?

880
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,740
Why are you here too?

881
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,660
Mr. Tu!

882
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,980
Fake.

883
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
That scumbag Sanmahu.

884
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,260
Today was a trap.

885
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,660
We're completely exposed.

886
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,780
It's confirmed.

887
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,340
Take care of Mr. Qian.

888
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,460
We'll handle it when I get back.

889
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,700
Some things

890
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,580
are better discussed in person.

891
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,340
Got it.

892
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,340
The subscriber you have dialed is busy.

893
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,020
Please redial later.

894
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,180
Mr. Han.

895
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,020
What's your game?

896
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,220
My goods and my men
are both off the grid.

897
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,980
Mr. Qi,

898
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,620
we've been played by Sanmahu.

899
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,700
He has a cop's informant in his team.

900
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,660
Your men have all been nabbed.

901
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,340
Mr. Han,

902
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,780
Qi Lianshan isn't stupid.

903
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,020
And Sanmahu can talk.

904
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,900
This won't be easy to act out, will it?

905
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,100
The facts speak for themselves.

906
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,060
What Qi Lianshan thinks doesn't matter.

907
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,700
What matters is

908
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,780
Sanmahu failed,

909
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,420
and what Mr. Jiang
will think about that.

910
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,620
Hello?

911
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,420
Hello, Mr. Qi.

912
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,700
Mr. Sanmahu,

913
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,140
I'm giving you a chance.

914
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,460
I came all this way
to do business with you.

915
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,300
Where are my men?

916
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,420
Where are my goods?

917
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,900
You're working with me

918
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,460
while sitting on a live bomb?

919
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,020
Things did get pretty lively just now.

920
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,260
Let me tell you something.

921
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,860
The cops didn't just show up.

922
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,740
They came in two separate groups.

923
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,100
One was after my men.

924
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,180
The other was targeting yours.

925
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,940
There's a cop's informant

926
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,900
in my team.

927
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,980
I know that.

928
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,700
But you've got

929
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,660
a mole in your team too.

930
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,020
Don't give me that nonsense.

931
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,220
Do you hear me?

932
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,940
Who brought them here?

933
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,420
Whoever brought them here

934
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,340
has to clean it up!

935
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,580
You owe me an explanation

936
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,100
for my men and my goods.

937
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,780
If you can't give me one,

938
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,700
we're not doing business.

939
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,820
We'll do something else.

940
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,020
Mr. Qi.

941
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,220
I came into this

942
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,700
with sincerity.

943
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,780
I was actually

944
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,300
using this fake batch

945
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,660
to smoke out the mole in my team.

946
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,380
Didn't expect

947
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,580
to help you test loyalties.

948
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,660
Don't worry.

949
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,380
The goods were fake.

950
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,100
Your men

951
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,820
and your money

952
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,620
are both safe.

953
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,940
As for the real goods,

954
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,540
I'll deliver them to you personally.

955
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,660
I'll be at Shangguan in about ten hours.

956
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,780
Have your men ready

957
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,900
with the money

958
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,780
to pick up the goods.

959
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,900
I know

960
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,500
you don't really

961
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,820
trust me right now.

962
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,340
There's been some misunderstandings.

963
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,260
But to show my sincerity,

964
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,220
I won't jack up the price.

965
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,420
How's that sound?

966
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,820
Fine.

967
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,940
You've handled this with respect.

968
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,100
What happens on your end
is your business.

969
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,020
You deal with it.

970
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,820
But

971
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,740
since I'm working with you,

972
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,220
I'll make sure

973
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,300
that whatever amount you can supply,

974
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,380
I'll take it all.

975
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,860
Perfect.

976
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,540
Pleasure working with you.

977
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,620
Likewise.

978
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,180
Working with you?

979
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,260
My foot.

980
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,340
Keep up.

981
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,820
Officer, my arm is injured!

982
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,980
Don't push your luck!

983
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,080
Officer.

984
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,980
Wait a moment!

985
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:46,780
Wait!

986
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,180
Well,

987
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,860
what's going on over there?

988
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,540
Hey,

989
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,220
you can't do this!

990
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,820
Don't hit people!

991
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,420
You're up next.

992
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,740
What am I up for?

993
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,620
I don't know anything!

994
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,340
For what?

995
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,540
Questioning,

996
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,340
of course.

997
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,100
Just say whatever you know.

998
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,900
Answer what we ask you.

999
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,260
Don't make things up if you don't know.

1000
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,060
Got it?

1001
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,100
Got it.

1002
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,260
Is this

1003
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,420
what you call
extort a confession by torture?

1004
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,300
What do you think?

1005
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,540
Buddy.

1006
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,100
No, officer,

1007
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,540
you're still young.

1008
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,100
You can't go down a life of crime.

1009
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,380
It's not worth losing your badge
over someone like me!

1010
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,060
Did he confess?

1011
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,700
No.

1012
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,300
He asked if we're
extorting a confession by torture.

1013
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,060
Impressive.

1014
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,420
You even know
about "extort a confession by torture"?

1015
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,500
Come on, let's have a chat.

1016
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,580
About what?

1017
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,060
I don't know anything!

1018
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,900
What do you want me to say?

1019
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,820
How do you want to do this?

1020
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,620
How do I talk

1021
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,620
without the "torture" part?

1022
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,820
Zhong,

1023
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,500
Xiatong isn't a big place.

1024
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,220
But there are
lots of troublemakers here.

1025
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,500
Who do you think you are?

1026
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,620
Why did you work under Sanmahu?

1027
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,340
You've got one sentence left.

1028
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,860
Choose it carefully.

1029
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,580
Make it clear,

1030
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,500
and you walk away safe.

1031
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,820
If not,

1032
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,180
you'll end up like Hu next door,

1033
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,500
reflecting on your life
in a hospital bed.

1034
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,700
Mr. Tu,

1035
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,260
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

1036
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,260
Mr. Tu, just ask me!

1037
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,660
Well,

1038
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,380
where

1039
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,020
is Sanmahu hiding?

1040
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:06,980
The west of the city.

1041
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,540
The east side of Dahaiyan Village.

1042
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,300
A detached villa.

1043
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,900
The west of the city.

1044
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,500
Dahaiyan Village.

1045
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:18,980
Wait, what you...

1046
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,540
What you said
doesn't match what Hu said.

1047
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,860
Of course it doesn't!

1048
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:24,980
If it did,

1049
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,100
I'd be the one getting beaten!

1050
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,220
I'm smart.

1051
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,980
I'm telling the truth.

1052
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,140
Mr. Tu, you don't get it.

1053
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,420
Every time,

1054
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,020
they blindfolded us and drove us there.

1055
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,460
That scumbag Sanmahu

1056
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,380
didn't know

1057
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,860
my grandma lives in Dahaiyan Village.

1058
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,660
Zhong.

1059
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:47,980
Remember,

1060
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,380
stay on the right path.

1061
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,700
Mr. Tu.

1062
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,020
Mr. Tu.

1063
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,220
How was my screaming?

1064
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,300
Take him away.

1065
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,020
Mr. Tu, what do you mean?

1066
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,100
Mr. Tu!

1067
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,180
Show me a way out!

1068
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,300
I didn't understand!

1069
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,020
Mr. Tu!

1070
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,060
Contact

1071
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,620
the local police station
and check it out now.

1072
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,900
Aren't you coming, Mr. Tu?

1073
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,020
What happened on the train today

1074
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,780
feels like a trap set by Sanmahu.

1075
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,580
He's probably gone.

1076
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,940
You two, go check again.

1077
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,020
See if there are any leads left behind.

1078
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,260
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1079
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,540
Mr. Tu,

1080
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,820
there's a medicine pot in the backyard.

1081
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,740
Still warm.

1082
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,580
No one's there.

1083
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,940
Probably Mr. Qian.

1084
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,180
Bring it back.

1085
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,780
Have Dou verify it.

1086
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,300
Got it.

1087
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,820
Take all this back.

1088
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,820
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

1089
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,220
Mr. Sanmahu really
can predict everything.

1090
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,100
Good thing we got out.

1091
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,700
Otherwise, we'd have been
wiped out completely.

1092
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,220
Right,

1093
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,900
Mr. Qian?

1094
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,580
Mr. Qian.

1095
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,860
As long as you don't do anything rash,

1096
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,180
we can get along.

1097
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,540
Mr. Sanmahu really knows you well.

1098
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,340
Before he left,

1099
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,620
he warned me about you.

1100
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,980
He said

1101
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,380
you seem refined,

1102
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,020
but

1103
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,140
you're actually as tough as nails.

1104
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,380
He asked me to pass on a message.

1105
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,740
He said

1106
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,180
if you're thinking about ending it all,

1107
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,900
you'd better drop that idea right now.

1108
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,900
Your apprentice, Dou,

1109
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,660
is the only one you still care about.

1110
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:06,900
Right?

1111
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,620
We all know

1112
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,820
how close you two are.

1113
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,180
If you were gone,

1114
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,340
he probably wouldn't make it either.

1115
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,900
I have nothing to say to you.

1116
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,980
I want to see Sanmahu.

1117
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,100
Fine.

1118
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,260
Mr. Sanmahu,

1119
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,700
Mr. Qian wants a word with you.

1120
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,820
Sanmahu.

1121
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,420
Did Crewcut mean what you meant

1122
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,540
when he said that?

1123
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,940
Changfeng,

1124
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,100
that's pretty vague.

1125
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,820
Which part are you referring to?

1126
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,500
You're using Dou

1127
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,340
to threaten me.

1128
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,420
Put yourself

1129
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,700
in my shoes.

1130
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,740
We board the train twice.

1131
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,340
Both times, the cops showed up.

1132
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,180
There's a mole among us.

1133
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,980
To be honest with you,

1134
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,740
Bai Taohua is being treated
the same way you are right now.

1135
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,580
I see.

1136
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,980
So you've decided

1137
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,060
either me or Bai Taohua

1138
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,500
is the mole.

1139
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,340
What about Crewcut?

1140
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,940
He saved my life

1141
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,740
back in the northern frontier.

1142
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,260
You think

1143
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,660
he'd do that?

1144
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,420
You've

1145
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,820
never changed.

1146
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,260
Just sit tight for a couple more days.

1147
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,780
We'll talk when I get back.

1148
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,580
Like I've always said,

1149
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,820
I'll get to the bottom

1150
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,740
of this mole thing.

1151
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,740
If I'm wrong, I'll take responsibility.

1152
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,420
But if you're wrong,

1153
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,580
don't

1154
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,380
blame me later.

1155
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,660
