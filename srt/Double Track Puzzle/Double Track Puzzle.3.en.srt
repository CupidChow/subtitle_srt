191
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,820
was wrapped in Mo Shan's IOU.

192
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,780
Dragon Unleashed told me

193
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,300
to give that IOU to Zheng Xiaoshan,

194
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,740
so he could threaten Mo Shan with it,

195
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,940
then dig a hole under locker 16

196
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,140
and wait for him to pick up.

197
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,340
That's all I know.

198
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,620
Nothing else.

199
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,940
Can I have it now?

200
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,100
This is just syrup, isn't it?

201
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,260
Mr. Tu.

202
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,500
We don't know what's going on inside.

203
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,220
Backup is on the way.

204
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,180
Maybe we should wait.

205
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,420
This is a matter of life and death.

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,380
Go find the power switch!

207
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,580
Cut the power!

208
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,020
Got it!

209
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,180
Hurry!

210
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,540
Get him down, now!

211
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:46,900
Easy.

212
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,780
I've got you.

213
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,820
Hang in there.

214
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,100
Looks like Ba finally grew a spine.

215
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
He's crossed the line.

216
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,940
Hold on.

217
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,820
It wasn't Ba.

218
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,180
It was Sanmahu.

219
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,140
I'm afraid

220
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,620
I won't make it.

221
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,700
Quick,

222
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,500
to the hospital!

223
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,340
Come on.

224
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,060
Mind his fingers!

225
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,940
- Watch his hand!
- The hand...

226
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,980
Okay.

227
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,900
Mr. Sun,

228
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,860
from the drug bust

229
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,660
to Zheng Xiaoshan's death,

230
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,220
and now Gao Si's arrest,

231
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,060
we're closing in on the truth.

232
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,820
According to Gao Si's statement,

233
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
his supplier

234
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,660
is a netizen called Dragon Unleashed.

235
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,860
Next,

236
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,540
we plan to use Gao Si as bait

237
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,700
to draw out Dragon Unleashed.

238
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,780
Just a reminder,

239
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,420
the last time the bait was drugs.

240
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,180
There was room to adjust.

241
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,620
This time it is a person.

242
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,100
Nothing can go wrong.

243
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,460
Understood?

244
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,260
Yes, sir.

245
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,140
All details

246
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,980
must be cleared

247
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,340
with Mr. Xiong,

248
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,780
okay?

249
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,500
Got it.

250
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,980
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

251
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,340
Dragon Unleashed is crucial.

252
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,460
Once we take him down,

253
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,620
everything will become clear.

254
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,460
We'll find who killed Zheng Xiaoshan,

255
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,380
give the bureau an answer,

256
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,260
and dismantle this drug ring totally.

257
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,660
I've dealt with thieves before,

258
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,140
but never drug dealers.

259
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,620
Still, I know one thing.

260
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,580
The riskier the op,
the tighter we need to play it.

261
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,580
You want to fish,

262
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,100
but what if it's not a fish that bites?

263
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,540
If there's money on the line,

264
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,940
they'll take the bait.

265
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,700
Gao Si's arrest
won't stay quiet for long.

266
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,980
We're racing against time.

267
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,140
We have to move fast.

268
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,860
They can smell trouble a mile away.

269
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,220
What happened

270
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,420
at the net café

271
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,100
might've tipped them off.

272
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,220
Zhang,

273
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,140
where are we at?

274
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
Gao Si's girlfriend showed up.

275
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,340
Turns out he's a romantic.

276
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,300
She's clean, though.

277
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,700
After some persuasion,

278
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,060
he's willing to cooperate.

279
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,420
We just talked to Dragon Unleashed
with his help.

280
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,220
They haven't noticed a thing.

281
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,900
A couple hundred grand worth of drop,

282
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,020
more than Gao Si usually handles.

283
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,980
It's attractive enough.

284
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,940
Drop's scheduled

285
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,340
for 4 PM,

286
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,300
trash can at Zone B,

287
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,740
Huanong Market.

288
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,300
Nice job.

289
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,220
Mr. Zhan,

290
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,420
you

291
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,700
went around me on this,

292
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,860
and now I'm the one taking the heat.

293
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,220
Mr. Xiong,

294
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,940
it's the only feasible plan right now.

295
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,860
Tu,

296
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,300
the First Division

297
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,940
takes charge of the ground op.

298
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,700
Make sure it's all coordinated.

299
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,180
Is that OK?

300
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,460
Like I have a choice.

301
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,460
Zhan,

302
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,020
from now on,

303
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,180
the First Division will assist you.

304
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,740
Remember,

305
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,220
no matter how the op goes,

306
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,500
keep him closely watched.

307
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,940
Understood.

308
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
No one died,

309
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,420
but it caused quite a stir.

310
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
Everything was handled
as Mr. Hu instructed.

311
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,420
I know that wretch Tu Hongjiang

312
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,740
all too well.

313
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,020
He'll come after me,

314
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,740
so I need to lay low for a while.

315
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,780
Alright.

316
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,980
How long is it this time?

317
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,740
Not long.

318
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,340
I have to

319
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,860
get back in business.

320
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,260
If you leave,

321
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,060
what about me?

322
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,700
What the heck is this?

323
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,500
How am I supposed
to get information if you leave?

324
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,380
[Blind Bat, local drifter]
You took my eye,

325
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,500
so I took your woman.

326
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,320
Fair, right?

327
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,700
Blind Bat?

328
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,780
Liu Liu,

329
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,940
take a few guys and hold this position.

330
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,980
This entrance.

331
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,300
Wu, you cover this side.

332
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,780
Hey,

333
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,020
do I have to go?

334
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,820
How else are you gonna earn credit?

335
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,860
With your record,

336
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,300
unless you make a real move,

337
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,500
you'll be stuck inside for long.

338
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,220
Buddy,

339
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,980
I can tell you and your girl
are the real deal.

340
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,940
She said she'll wait for you.

341
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,220
Don't waste that.

342
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,060
My mentor.

343
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,860
Cut it out. I'm no mentor.

344
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,940
Come on, you said

345
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,100
if I helped,

346
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,060
you'd show me the ropes.

347
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,260
Going back on your word again?

348
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
One more thing,

349
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,820
protect yourself.

350
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,620
Understood.

351
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,740
Keep a close watch.

352
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,340
Got it.

353
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,660
Mr. Zhan.

354
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,460
Get in the car.

355
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,780
Hello?

356
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,620
You got him?

357
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,140
Can't make it right now.

358
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,820
If you don't come,

359
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,140
Bazijiao will die,

360
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,540
and Blind Bat will go down too.

361
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,500
Put him on.

362
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,300
It's Mr. Tu.

363
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,740
Wait,

364
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,580
wait until I get there.

365
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,820
Mr. Zhan.

366
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,700
What's wrong, Mr. Tu?

367
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,660
I can't make it.

368
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,100
What did you say?

369
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,620
One of my contacts

370
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,060
was almost killed by Bazijiao today.

371
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,500
Bazijiao got nabbed

372
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,100
by someone I used to know.

373
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,980
They're mortal enemies.

374
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,500
If I don't show up,

375
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,580
Bazijiao's dead for sure,

376
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,380
and my old pal is going down too.

377
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,820
What else can I do?

378
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,740
Mr. Xiong said

379
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,340

Mr. Tu,

388
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,660
I've heard people say you're unreliable.

389
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Seems it's true.

390
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,620
Let's move!

I won't make this hard.

393

Call Sanmahu.

394
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,900
Your big shot doesn't care anymore, huh?

395

Get out.

Take him.

plus core team from provincial capital,

right under your noses?

I don't know how I should explain this.

438

You had better
find your own excuses first.

439
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,100
Catching dealers is dangerous indeed.

440
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,980
Spare me!

441
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,620
Did you just join the force?

442
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,380
Where were you?

443
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,580
I told you to back them up.

444

This is how you do it?

445
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,780
You don't care
about your First Division anymore?

446

If you don't want the badge,

clear your desk now!

448

Tell me, didn't we finish our job?

470

You ditched him,

and charged in to make the collar.

This isn't the time
for pointing fingers.

A murder in broad daylight,

is a complete disgrace.

as you ordered.

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,340
thank you,

572
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,260
and sorry for the trouble.

573
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,740
Learn from this.

574
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
Keep a close eye on him.

575
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,580
With his strength,

576
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,020
if something serious happens,

577
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,220
you'll regret it too late.

578
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,260
I will, I promise.

579
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Thank you, officers.

580
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,860
You can go now.

581
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,740
Erming.

582
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,340
Let's go.

583
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,580
How about we go home and play?

584
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,740
Here, give it to me.

585
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:07,820
Let's go.

586
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,900
Be good. We'll play at home.

587
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,580
Let's go.

588
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,980
Say goodbye to the officers.

589
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,980
Keep a close eye on him.

590
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,580
Notify the local station

591
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,380
to watch those two brothers carefully.

592
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,460
Got it.

593
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,500
It's beyond cruel

594
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,660
to use someone like that.

595
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:30,820
Well,

596
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,380
this lead's dead again.

597
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,620
The First Division
isn't much help either.

598
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,660
What now?

599
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,260
Get ready.

600
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,220
We're bringing Mo Shan in again.

601
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,140
I don't know this guy.

602
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,660
Are you sure?

603
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,740
Look carefully.

604
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,860
Really.

605
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,820
Where'd you get the loan before?

606
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,820
Sihai Teahouse.

607
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,380
From who?

608
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
The guy's

609
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,460
Sheng.

610
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,180
At first I thought
he was just another player,

611
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,460
but that wretch was setting me up.

612
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,060
Sheng?

613
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,060
You've got to catch him.

614
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,260
No one's gouging your eyes out here.

615
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,820
You think you're hot stuff again, huh?

616
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,420
You're just fishing
for something on Mr. Sanmahu.

617
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
I'll say it again.

618
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,100
I've got nothing.

619
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,700
Stop pressing me.

620
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,540
My eyes are killing me.

621
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,180
I don't feel like talking.

622
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,940
After all these years,
I never would've thought

623
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,060
you were such a loyal dog.

624
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,140
"Mr.", really?

625
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,140
You could beg him like a son,

626
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,620
and he'd still toss you aside.

627
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,500
You think just saying it

628
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,300
makes it true, huh?

629
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,420
Who do you think you are?

630
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,500
I'm asking you one thing.

631
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,140
Was killing Baldy your idea?

632
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,180
You petty thief

633
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,860
dare kill someone?

634
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,300
I don't think you have that guts.

635
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,820
Sanmahu put you up to it, right?

636
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,620
Don't play dumb.

637
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,220
The heat's on you.

638
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,700
Stop trying to split us up.

639
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,620
Why would I do that?

640
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,300
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

641
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,420
Attempted murder

642
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
starts at ten years. You got that?

643
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,100
Who is it?

644
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,820
Hello.

645
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,020
Is this Mr. Tu Hongjiang?

646
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,100
What is it?

647
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,340
Mr. Tu.

648
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,420
You've captured someone
you shouldn't have.

649
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,660
Now,

650
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,860
I'm giving you a chance.

651
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,060
Should we talk this over?

652
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,740
Save it!

653
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,500
Sanmahu's hiding like a coward

654
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,820
and sent a rookie to talk nonsense, huh?

655
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,980
If he wants to talk,

656
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,180
he can say it to my face.

657
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,300
Blind Bat,

658
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,980
my apologies.

659
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,620
Did you hear that,

660
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,580
Mr. Tu Hongjiang?

661
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,860
If you want to talk to Mr. Sanmahu,

662
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,060
you'll need to earn that privilege.

663
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,100
And I'm no rookie.

664
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,500
This time he lost an eyeball.

665
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,340
Next time,

666
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,260
it could be his life.

667
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,820
What do you want?

668
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,220
Six o'clock.

669
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,820
You bring Bazijiao,

670
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,660
and I'll bring Blind Bat.

671
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,780
We'll meet in Angel Square.

672
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,540
We'll send three people.

673
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,060
If you can take them all down,

674
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,660
Blind Bat is all yours.

675
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,540
If you can't,

676
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,220
Bazijiao is mine.

677
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
[Angel Square. Southeast Entrance]
This is the First Division's position.

678
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,260
The Second Division.

679
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,500
They know our faces,

680
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,780
so keep your distance

681
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,220
and stick to your zone.

682
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,860
As soon as you see those three,

683
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,460
no matter what,

684
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,140
take them down.

685
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,420
[Angel Square]
We three are covering the core area.

686
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,260
If anything comes up,
we'll call you.

687
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,540
Got it?

688
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,100
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

689
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,260
Get to work.

690
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,060
Mr. Tu,

691
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,300
should we

692
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,460
report this to Mr. Xiong?

693
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,020
It's within our normal duties.

694
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,420
Why would we report it?

695
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,220
What are you doing here?

696
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,300
Go.

697
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,780
You stay and stand guard.

698
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,500
Any updates from Zhan Peng,

699
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,420
let me know right away.

700
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:23,900
Yes.

701
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,820
Don't say anything you shouldn't.

702
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,520
[Angel Square]

703
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,540
Don't get any funny ideas.

704
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,500
You won't get away.

705
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,380
You gave Mo Shan the loan?

706
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,700
[Sheng, local drifter]

707
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,380
Yes,

708
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,980
but I only did that one loan,

709
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,460
and the interest was really low.

710
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,140
Honestly,

711
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,020
that's all it was.

712
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:22,780
I

713
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,380
did it because at the time,

714
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,740
Gao Si was making money

715
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,020
like it was nothing.

716
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,980
I guess I got jealous.

717
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,620
Since I had some money,

718
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,380
and Mo Shan was desperate after losing,

719
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,980
I lent him a little.

720
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,300
But I never thought

721
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
collecting was such a hassle.

722
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,020
It can't be a main job.

723
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,620
Your main gig is running scams.

724
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,700
Taking drugs for side hustle.

725
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,980
I'm not wrong, am I?

726
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,860
No.

727
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
I've been clean for a while now, really.

728
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,980
I didn't check that.

729
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,900
But

730
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,500
if you insist I get involved, I can.

731
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,140
It just

732
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,700
depends on whether you cooperate.

733
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,660
I will,

734
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,780
definitely.

735
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,700
Alright.

736
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,140

To a group owner

743
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,060
Right.

744
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,180
He uses that name in several groups.

745

00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,500
I'm not as interested in him

761
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,820
as I am in you.

762
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,300
This is

763
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,780
just my first gift for you.

764
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,780
Don't be so anxious.

765
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,340
Listen carefully.

766
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,700
Stay alive.

767
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,420
I'll be the one to lock you down,

768
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,020
even if I have to
rip Xiatong apart brick by brick.

769
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:38,900
Alright.

770
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,500
I'll be waiting.

771
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,500
[Xiatong Railway Hospital]

772
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,180
Tu Hongjiang.

773
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,140
What is it?

774
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,460
I need to ask you a favor.

775
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,620
Go on.

776
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,540
You know,

777
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,780
Han Xin always tells me

778
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,380
that you are her idol.

779
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,620
Stop beating around the bush.

780
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,420
Just say what you want, okay?

781
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,700
Just tell her this job is not for her.

782
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,300
Ask her to take off the uniform

783
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,300
and walk away,

784
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,220
please.

785
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,180
I can't do that.

786
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,380
I think she's meant for this job.

787
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,860
Tu Hongjiang,

788
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,620
I'll give you one more chance.

789
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,420
Say that again,

790
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,100
I dare you!

791
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,820
What if I say it again?

792
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,180
She's meant for this job.

793
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,820
Don't get worked up.

794
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,860
Just listen to me.

795
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,140
At first,

796
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,740
when she joined the police force,

797
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,940
I also thought
it was just a moment of passion,

798
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,660
and it wouldn't last.

799
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,540
But I was wrong.

800
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,220
I underestimated her.

801
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,620
She truly loves this job.

802
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,860
She's tough, driven.

803
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,820
She's got real potential.

804
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,500
I can't just lie
with my eyes wide open, can I?

805
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,220
You know better than anyone

806
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,300
what I've been making money for
all these years.

807
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,180
Of course I know.

808
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,620
You want her to have a good life,

809
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,780
to stop suffering.

810
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,300
But she has grown up.

811
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,260
She chose her own path.

812
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,740
You want to protect her,

813
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,300
but you have to ask her
if she wants that.

814
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,140
But what if

815
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,100
something really happens to her?

816
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,860
This is a path she chose herself.

817
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,060
We should respect her choice.

818
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,100
You don't understand what I'm feeling,

819
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
because you've never had a child.

820
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,300
You've never been a father!

821
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,540
You can't possibly know

822
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,780
what it's like
to worry about your daughter.

823
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,380
You're heartless,

824
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,060
you know?

825
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,140
You didn't even care
when your wife died!

826
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,060
Tu Hongjiang, you can't expect

827
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,740
everyone around you

828
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,100
to be just like you.

829
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,660
I've been alone for so many years.

830
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,060
Honestly, I don't know your feelings.

831
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,700
You said

832
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,580
Han Xin became a police officer

833
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,940
because I'm her idol.

834
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,820
You're wrong.

835
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,420
Do you know it?

836
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,780
She never stopped asking me

837
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
your story of being a police officer.

838
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,380
She's so dedicated to this

839
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,660
because her father was one.

840
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
It's because of you.

841
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,380
I know this is dangerous.

842
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,180
I regret failing to save my wife...

843
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,980
and those who shouldn't have died.

844
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,660
But I have never once regretted
being a police officer.

845
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,700
Han Weidong,

846
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,660
she has grown up.

847
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,340
She's finding her own path.

848
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,860
We don't get to choose it for her.
