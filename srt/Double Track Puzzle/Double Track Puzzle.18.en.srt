I handled the money, you kept the books.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,660
Now that I've left the force,

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,060
it just isn't right for me
to stay involved.

6

Right?

7

How about...

How about you just
take over the whole thing?

Stop talking nonsense.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,820
This was a duty
Master entrusted to both of us.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,660
No matter what,
we have to see it through.

12

Besides,

bookkeeping and money handling

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,340
are two separate jobs.

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,780
How am I supposed

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,340
to do both alone?

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,580

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,100
You're really forcing me
into an impossible position.

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,980
I told you,

I left the force.

24

77
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,300

78
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,260

79

Since they made the first move,

165
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,100
they can't blame me for the next.

166
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,140

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,020
before we've finished
talking this through,

192
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,420
let's not let the bosses know, alright?

193
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Just come alone.

194
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,180
With fewer people,
the conversation is easier.

195
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,020
Don't worry.

196
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,220
I'll be there on time.

197
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,340
Alright.

198
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,780
Alright, see you tonight.

199
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,900
Mr. Zhan.

200
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,780
What's so urgent
you needed to see me right away?

201
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,580
This.

202
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,540
Just scoped out a few spots.

203
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,900
These spots
have been really active lately.

204
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,220
Haven't seen the dealer.

205
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,420
They call him Mabao.

206
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Not bad.

207
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,060
You're getting sharper by the day.

208
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,180
You did this all on your own?

209
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,820
No way I could cover all this alone.

210
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Had a little help from one of my guys.

211
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
That punk Zhong
who caused you trouble last time.

212
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,500
Sun Zhongze.

213
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,780
He

214
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,580
is tight-lipped.

215
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,820
And he gets things done.

216
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,540
After that last incident,

217
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,100
I've been keeping him on a tight leash.

218
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,140
I told him

219
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,580
to stop hanging around

220
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,020
with those riff-raff

221
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,940
and focus on doing our job properly.

222
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,740
Right?

223
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,500
Our job?

224
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,580
I mean

225
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,060
the tasks you assigned me.

226
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,140
I just had him run some errands

227
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,060
when I was swamped.

228
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,380
If there's nothing else,
I'll be leaving.

229
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,740
Wait.

230
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,020
You haven't been pestering me
for the funding.

231
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,020
Guess you're flush with cash.

232
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
Not at all.

233
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,180
Only because the crew's got my back.

234
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,820
About the funding...

235
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,180
I was too embarrassed to ask.

236
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,220
If it's convenient,

237
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,540
could you spare some?

238
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,060
Sheng,

239
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,900
I brought you into this.

240
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
I'll take responsibility.

241
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,060
But on the condition

242
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,780
that you don't get any funny ideas.

243
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,780
It's good to have a quick mind.

244
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,540
But

245
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,780
you can be too clever

246
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,460
for your own good.

247
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,420
Understood.

248
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,220
Go ahead.

249
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,380
Alright.

250
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Keep watching him.

251
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,140
Don't spook him.

252
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,820
We're waiting for the big fish
to show up.

253
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,780
Wait for my call.

254
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,820
We move together.

255
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,020
With Zhang Cheng's side included,

256
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,260
almost everyone's shown themselves.

257
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,300
Except this one.

258
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,660
The Mabao they mentioned
still hasn't appeared.

259
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,140
Did he get wind of something and run?

260
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,140
Probably not.

261
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,460
From when we caught that fat guy

262
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,260
to him giving up Mabao,

263
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,260
it was only 20 minutes.

264
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,340
Here's the plan.

265
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,900
You two wait in the car.

266
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,460
I'm going to check on Gao Buyi.

267
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,260
Understood.

268
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,780
Relax.

269
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,780
Look ahead.

270
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,020
Smile.

271
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,020
Come on, smile.

272
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,020
Yeah.

273
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,700
Listen,

274
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,740
if Mabao doesn't show up tonight,

275
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,900
you're taking the fall.

276
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,780
Got it?

277
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,420
What's so surprising?

278
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,860
Officer,

279
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,460
this counts as me
redeeming myself, right?

280
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,580
We'll talk if he shows up.

281
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,380
Now groove to the beat.

282
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,220
Food's here.

283
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,100
What are you doing here?

284
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,260
If I didn't come, you'd be stuck
eating cookies all day.

285
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,340
You'll ruin your stomachs.

286
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,380
We're used to it.

287
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,900
How are you guys holding up?

288
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,140
How did it go?

289
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,180
It's getting late.

290
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,300
You should head home.

291
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,820
Mr. Zhan will give you an earful
if he sees you here.

292
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,660
He has the nerve to lecture me?

293
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,140
We're on the same team.

294
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,820
But he always leaves me out

295
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,740
whenever there's a mission.

296
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,860
Fine.

297
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,140
I'll grab you some water

298
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,380
and then I'll go, alright?

299
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Hey, Mabao.

300
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,420
Where are you?

301
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,020
In the booth.

302
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,900
Usual spot.

303
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,820
Ms. Bai.

304
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,580
What are you doing here?

305
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,740
You got any goods on you?

306
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,300
Yeah. Last batch.

307
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,180
What's wrong?

308
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,460
We might have been watched.

309
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,380
Split up and run.

310
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,060
Nanyi, cover the back door.

311
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,020
Freeze!

312
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,100
Don't move!

313
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,420
Drop the axe!

314
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,900
Put the gun down!

315
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,300
Okay.

316
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,780
I'm putting it down.

317
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,380
It's down.

318
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,860
You're Mabao, right?

319
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,700
Mabao,

320
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,940
calm down.

321
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,220
Put the axe down first.

322
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,060
What you've done so far

323
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,780
only gets you a few years inside.

324
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,260
But if you keep going down this path,

325
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,940
you're looking at a bullet.

326
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,940
Don't throw your life away.

327
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,700
Right?

328
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,020
Put the axe down.

329
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,740
Just stay calm.

330
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,500
Hey, Mabao.

331
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Why aren't you back yet?

332
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,100
Go find Uncle.

333
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,620
I might not make it back.

334
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,140
Mabao,

335
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,580
where are you?

336
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,380
Uncle,

337
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,180
I got busted by the cops on a delivery.

338
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Might not make it back.

339
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,740
Any way out?

340
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,460
You still got any goods on you?

341
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,660
Yeah.

342
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,460
There's no way out.

343
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,060
Uncle,

344
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,900
I understand.

345
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,980
Take care of Magan for me.

346
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,020
Han Xin.

347
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,180
Han Xin.

348
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,380
Ambulance.

349
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,580
Call an ambulance!

350
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,140
How's my daughter?

351
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,780
Well...

352
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,540
She... She got cut.

353
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,220
But we got her here in time.

354
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,140
Should be okay.

355
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,380
Got cut?

356
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,580
Where?

357
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,740
Where was she cut?

358
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,860
The neck.

359
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,180
A cut on the neck?

360
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,780
A cut on the neck,

361
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,660
and you're telling me it's okay?

362
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,220
Her carotid artery is in her neck!

363
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,140
If it had gone any deeper...

364
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,540
Tu Hongjiang,

365
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,980
you promised me you'd take care of Xin!

366
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,900
Are you out of your mind?

367
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,380
You send her
into every dangerous operation!

368
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,380
Mr. Han,

369
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,420
this isn't Mr. Tu's fault.

370
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,660
Han Xin is a member of the task force.

371
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,540
I'm the leader of the task force.

372
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,100
The responsibility is mine.

373
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,000
[Emergency Intervention in Progress]

374
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,100
Doctor.

375
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,540
How... How is she?

376
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,460
The wound is stitched up.

377
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,500
She'll be fine.

378
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,140
But she lost a lot of blood.

379
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,540
She needs to rest for a few days.

380
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,900
Thank you.

381
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,380
You're Mr. Zhan, right?

382
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,180
Yes.

383
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,340
Mr. Zhan, hello.

384
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,060
I'm...

385
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm Han Xin's father.

386
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,540
My name is Han Weidong.

387
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,700
I know my daughter's capabilities

388
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,180
and her situation very well.

389
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,020
I don't think she's contributing much

390
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,700
to your task force.

391
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,340
Can... Can you let her leave?

392
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,060
She's my only daughter.

393
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,300
Mr. Han,

394
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,100
emotionally, I understand.

395
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,300
But as her colleague,

396
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,420
I can't make that decision for her.

397
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,620
She's excellent and she works hard.

398
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,860
If leaving the task force

399
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,620
is her own wish,

400
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
I'll respect it.

401
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,220
Everyone knows this job is dangerous.

402
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,580
If she listened to reason,

403
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,780
I would've talked her out of it.

404
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,020
She wants to prove herself
more than anyone else.

405
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
Weren't you the same?

406
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,740
Are you blaming me?

407
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,900
It's all my fault.

408
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,300
My fault.

409
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,380
Mr. Zhan,

410
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
my daughter has grown up.

411
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,780
I can't control her.

412
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,380
I know she has her own mind.

413
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,340
But she's under your command.

414
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,020
Right?

415
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,620
You're her superior.

416
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,140
You have a responsibility

417
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,580
to keep her safe, right?

418
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,020
Just like

419
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,660
how Mr. Zhang Yaohua

420
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,460
looked out for me and Tu back then.

421
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,900
I'm begging you.

422
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,100
I'm begging you, too, for heaven's sake.

423
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,300
So he had connections
with my father too.

424
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,500
You didn't know?

425
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,020
No, I didn't.

426
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,900
Mr. Tu,

427
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,820
when can we talk about

428
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,980
what happened with my dad?

429
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,540
Let's discuss that
after we wrap up this case.

430
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,380
Hello?

431
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,300
Mr. Jiang.

432
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,940
Just as you predicted,

433
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,180
Bai Taohua is dead.

434
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,740
Sheng did it.

435
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,780
Killing can be addictive.

436
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,860
Since he's so eager to prove himself,

437
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,460
let's use him as the catalyst.

438
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,300
Pour some gasoline on Sanmahu's fire

439
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,780
and make it burn even hotter.

440
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,620
Understood.

441
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,420
Did Mr. Qian ask

442
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,660
about the prescription

443
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,620
before he died?

444
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,140
No.

445
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,700
Give me the prescription.

446
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,180
Sir,

447
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,220
are we still

448
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,500
delivering the prescription?

449
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,060
Hello?

450
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,620
Mr. Jiang,

451
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,100
I've arranged for the prescription
to be delivered.

452
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,380
How's Han Xin?

453
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,340
Why are only you two here?

454
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,580
It's late.

455
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,700
I sent the others to get some rest.

456
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,300
Han Xin

457
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,500
is out of immediate danger.

458
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,900
Our people will report immediately

459
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,260
if there's any change.

460
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,380
What about the situation
with Bai Taohua?

461
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,180
No surveillance cameras near the scene.

462
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,740
No solid leads for now.

463
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,420
Did we get statements from the suspects?

464
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,260
Yes.

465
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,180
They're all novices.

466
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,580
They just spilled everything.

467
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,660
Mr. Zhan.

468
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,380
Sit.

469
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,620
But something

470
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,220
[Interrogation Record]
feels off about this.

471
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,300
What do you mean?

472
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,260
This raid

473
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,900
felt orchestrated.

474
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,780
Right.

475
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,460
We hit seven spots tonight.

476
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,380
Five of them

477
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,580
were supplied by that dead guy, Mabao.

478
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,060
The other two
were secondary distributors.

479
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,500
All seven have one thing in common.

480
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,620
They're all under Sanmahu.

481
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,500
Dragon Unleashed wasn't involved at all.

482
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,700
Combined with last time,

483
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,300
it's too much of a coincidence.

484
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,660
Sheng

485
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,580
is playing games with me.

486
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,100
The intel he gave us

487
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,740
was hand-picked.

488
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,380
Maybe he's being played.

489
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
Do you think someone that cunning

490
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,620
would get played?

491
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,940
I think

492
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,060
it's highly likely

493
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,060
he's already part
of Dragon Unleashed's gang now.

494
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,540
Whether it's true or not...

495
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,700
Here's the plan.

496
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,300
Nanyi,

497
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,140
you and Gao Buyi are on him 24/7

498
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,580
starting tomorrow.

499
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,900
Feel free to act whenever needed.

500
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,420
Yes, sir.

501
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,860
I've asked around.

502
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,620
That Sheng guy is behind

503
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,940
all the recent cop raids.

504
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,100
And he's definitely connected

505
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,780
to the deaths of Taohua and Mabao.

506
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,580
I underestimated him.

507
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,940
Uncle!

508
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,020
Mabao didn't die for nothing, right?

509
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,780
Don't worry, kid.

510
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,500
I can owe others,

511
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,340
but anyone who owes me

512
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,020
will pay me back.

513
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,900
Mr. Sanmahu,

514
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,380
the heat is on.

515
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,020
The cops are looking for you everywhere.

516
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,700
It's not worth it to go out
and confront them head-on right now.

517
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,820
Let things cool down.

518
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,660
We'll find the right moment

519
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,860
to settle all the scores with him.

520
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,100
But the problem is,
there isn't just Sheng.

521
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,100
There's also Han Weidong.

522
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,900
If we let him off now,

523
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,660
he'll push for more.

524
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,420
We need to find a way

525
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,940
to hurt him badly.

526
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,660
What about Mr. Jiang?

527
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180
As long as we don't kill that Han guy,

528
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
it's fine.

529
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,060
Mr. Jiang

530
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,540
just wants a result.

531
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,860
Everyone, get ready.

532
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,140
Ready,

533
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,980
go!

534
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,940
- Mr. Tu, welcome here
- Mr. Tu, welcome here

535
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,460
- to guide the task force!
- to guide the task force!

536
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,140
No, no.

537
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,660
This is your meeting.

538
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,940
Count me out of this.

539
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,900
Mr. Xiong said you needed to
see me about something?

540
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,220
Yes, Mr. Tu.

541
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,580
The whole Sanmahu thing
has hit a dead end.

542
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,340
So we're asking for your guidance.

543
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,940
Say a few words to the team.

544
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,740
Have a seat.

545
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,540
We just need one final push,

546
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,740
and we can't do it without you.

547
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,340
Go get some tea.

548
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,860
Make it the good stuff.

549
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,180
Mr. Xiong called me this morning.

550
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,700
Said it was Mr. Tai's idea.

551
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,180
When the bosses speak,

552
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,740
I listen.

553
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,380
Thanks, Mr. Tu.

554
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,820
Careful, it's hot.

555
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,500
Alright, Mr. Tu,

556
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,500
we'll cut to the chase.

557
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,140
Get the files.

558
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,300
Just give them to Mr. Tu.

559
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,460
Right, sorry.

560
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,420
Mr. Tu,

561
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,960
the suspect who was shot dead last night

562
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,000
[Suspect Information Form]
was Ma Shengliang.

563
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,220
From the Majia Village in the city.

564
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,660
He's from the same place as Sanmahu.

565
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,340
By seniority,

566
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,660
he was Sanmahu's nephew.

567
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,580
We also tracked the person
he was on the phone with.

568
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,460
He's Ma Shengji,

569
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,420
and his nickname is Magan.

570
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,740
He's Ma Shengliang's younger brother.

571
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,940
We asked around the village too.

572
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,100
They said he went out for work.

573
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,900
Couldn't get in touch with him.

574
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,460
From Majia Village?

575
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:22,980
Yes.

576
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,420
That's a bit tricky.

577
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,980
But at least it's a street-level issue.

578
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,260
I'll figure something out.

579
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,420
Thank you, Mr. Tu.

580
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,740
With Bai Taohua dead,

581
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,660
Sanmahu just lost a key courier.

582
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,500
Do you think

583
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,660
he might flee back
to the northern frontier?

584
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,260
Without this incident, maybe.

585
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,100
But given the current situation,

586
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,180
even if he had the chance,

587
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,460
he wouldn't leave.

588
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,100
Sanmahu's nephew is dead.

589
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,660
If he doesn't get some answers,

590
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,780
he won't be able to
face anyone in the village.

591
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,460
Understood.

592
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,780
Mr. Tu,

593
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,140
last night's operation

594
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,380
targeted Sanmahu's distribution network.

595
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,660
He must be aware by now.

596
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,140
Let's trace the information source.

597
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,300
Once

598
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,300
this person ends up
on Sanmahu's hit list,

599
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,580
we can follow the trail

600
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,500
right to Sanmahu.

601
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,380
Who is this guy?

602
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,740
He used to be

603
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,180
one of my informants.

604
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,820
Now,

605
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,140
it's hard to say.

606
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680

I told you all

619
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,260
I trained professionally in this!

620
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,380
Singer drinks!

621
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,260
Come on.

622
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,660
Everyone, raise your glasses!

623
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,620
Come on, let's keep playing.

624
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,460
Hello?

625
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,500
This is Sanmahu.

626
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,220
Mr. Sanmahu.

627
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,940
What brings your call?

628
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,420
I heard

629
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,420
you had

630
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,980
quite a few of my spots seized.

631
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,060
So this call

632
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,940
is to hold me accountable?

633
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,260
Don't get me wrong.

634
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,820
I just figured

635
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,860
with all the spots you run now,

636
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,420
you must need goods.

637
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,380
I still have a lot of them.

638
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
If you want them,

639
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
I'll let them all go to you
for a low price.

640
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,060
How could I possibly accept that?

641
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,300
You know how it is.

642
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,980
I've got no place

643
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,940
left in Xiatong.

644
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,260
I'm planning to

645
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,420
go back to the northern frontier.

646
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,500
I can't turn these goods

647
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,100
into cash.

648
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,180
If you can take them all,

649
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,220
I'd be grateful.

650
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,740
Mr. Sanmahu,

651
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,420
no need for such formalities.

652
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,100
You said it, so of course I'll help.

653
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,660
Right?

654
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,700
Tell you what.

655
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
How many goods do you have?

656
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,460
I'll take all of them.

657
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Hey, Mr. Zhan.

658
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,180
Sheng just left the bar

659
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,220
with two of his guys.

660
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,660
Heading out to the suburbs now.

661
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,660
Nanyi and I think something's off.

662
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:58,980
Alright.

663
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,860
Alright.

664
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,540
Mr. Sanmahu.

665
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,100
How much stuff you got?

666
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,020
You brought all these people?

667
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,900
Where are the goods?

668
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,540
You really have no respect for me.

669
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,060
You dared come see me
with just these two losers?

670
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,500
Looks like

671
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,340
the goods aren't here today.

672
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,460
Well, another time, Mr. Sanmahu.

673
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,020
Another time.

674
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,500
Another time.

675
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,300
Mr. Sanmahu.

676
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,100
Can't we

677
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,740
just talk this out?

678
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
I've always wanted to
talk things out with you.

679
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,540
But

680
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,820
you people never listen.

681
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,940
I

682
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,380
am just a small fry.

683
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,420
You know that, Mr. Sanmahu.

684
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,740
We just follow the boss's orders.

685
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,780
Raiding your spots

686
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,180
was what the boss told me to do.

687
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,140
It really has nothing to do with me!

688
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,100
Yeah, I know.

689
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,140
None of this

690
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,500
is your fault.

691
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,460
See? What did I tell you?

692
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,540
Mr. Sanmahu

693
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,020
is a reasonable man.

694
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,940
No wonder...

695
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,060
No wonder you've built
such a big operation, Mr. Sanmahu.

696
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,660
Right?

697
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,820
Don't worry, Mr. Sanmahu.

698
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,820
When I get back,

699
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,420
I'll have a good talk with my boss.

700
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,940
That Mr. Han!

701
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,060
Do you think he's the kind of man
who listens to reason?

702
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,460
That son of a gun.

703
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,220
We won't get anywhere

704
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,500
without playing hardball.

705
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,500
Besides,

706
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,460
about Mabao

707
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,860
and Taohua,

708
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,500
don't you owe me an explanation?

709
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,460
What are you two standing around for?

710
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,500
Run!

711
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,860
Avenge your brother

712
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,220
and Taohua.

713
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,420
Freeze!

714
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,860
Let's go!

715
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,780
Take it easy.

716
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,500
Buyi!

717
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,740
Are you alright?

718
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,220
I'm fine.

719
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,860
Stop right there!

720
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,700
Let's go!

721
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,780
Gao Buyi.

722
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:24,860
Gao Buyi!

723
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,260
Are you alright?

724
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,060
I'm fine.

725
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,260
Let me see.

726
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,420
Zhang Nanyi,

727
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,300
call an ambulance.

728
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,180
Right, an ambulance.

729
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,020
Why were you at the scene?

730
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,260
I...

731
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,740
I heard some intel about Sanmahu.

732
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,980
So I wanted to check if it was real.

733
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,540
That's all?

734
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,780
That's all.

735
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,140
Sheng,

736
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,020
I'm giving you one more chance.

737
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,020
Use your head.

738
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,980
Think carefully before you answer me.

739
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,380
Mr. Zhan, I...

740
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,940
No matter how much I think about it,

741
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,020
that's really all there is.

742
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,180
That's it.

743
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,660
Then why do you think

744
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,380
we were at the scene?

745
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,220
How...

746
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,220
How should I know

747
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,020
why you were there?

748
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,500
What do you think?

749
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,740
You were there

750
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,380
to protect me undercover, right?

751
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,260
Protect you?

752
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,420
Sheng,

753
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,740
you're not just quick-minded.

754
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,340
You've got some nerve too.

755
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,300
If you weren't there to protect me,

756
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,660
then were you there to tail me?

757

774

779

But my love for you

781
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,900

782
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,180
The transport company
was built from the ground up by me.

783
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,660
It has no connection
to my later dealings.

784
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,820
I hope it can provide you shelter

785
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,540

786
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,980
It's the only thing I can do for you.

787
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,860
I lost myself in the abyss of sin.

788
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,860
But I always hoped

789

793
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,820
You did this all on your own?

794
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,460
No way I could cover all this alone.

795
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,460
Had a little help from one of my guys.

796
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,780

who caused you trouble last time.

797

799
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,460

800

After that last incident,

801
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,740
I've been keeping him on a tight leash.

802

Did that punk Sun Zhongze
do something stupid?

803
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,980
I knew it.

804

Here's the thing, Mr. Zhan.

805
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,500
I... I recently

806
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,300
started a gaming studio.

807
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,420
Basically, we help

808
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,300

809

810
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,700
That punk

811
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,100
saw a recruitment post

812
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,060
in the local chat channel.

813
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,580
Get himself arrested for brawling,

814
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,660
deliver a message to someone inside,

815
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,900
then get bailed out under a settlement.

816
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,660
They gave him an in-game item
worth 20,000 yuan.

817
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,580
What was the message?

818
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,420
It was

819
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,660
"Tell them the old lady
got home safe. Don't worry."

820
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,420
I have no idea what that means.

821
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,100
I only found out today

822
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,060
when he was bragging about it.

823
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,140
If I had known,

824
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,660
I never would've let him do it!

825
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,180
I swear

826
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,820
this has nothing to do with me!

827
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,140
If that punk really caused you trouble,

828
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,140
I can lure him out right now.

829
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,220
And you can arrest him on the spot!

830
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,940
He'll be out

831
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,180
