00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
where's that pungent smell

192
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,740
coming from?

193
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,820
There's a Xiaofeng Paper Mill
back there.

194
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,540
Probably the smell
of discharged wastewater.

195
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,260
I remember that sanatorium.

196
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
It's deep in the mountains.

197
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,580
Narrow paths.

198
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,980
It's a great hideout.

199
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,020
Get ready.

200
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,180
We move out tonight.

201
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
We're checking out Chenjia Village.

202
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,780
You should lay low for a while.

204
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,860
Wait for things to cool down.

205
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,420
But Long,

206
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,180
you're supposed to meet

207
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,500
with them tomorrow.

208
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,540
Those guys are shady.

209
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,700
You'll get played.

210
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,060
It's fine.

211
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,700
We're all in the same boat now.

212
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,620
They won't try anything.

213
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,420
Don't worry.

214
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,580
No.

215
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,420
I'm not leaving you here alone.

216
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,580
Why aren't you listening?

217
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,620
They bombed Ergou to get at you!

218
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,420
They're trying to force you out!

219
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,660
Then they can deal with me alone

220
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,180
and make me hand over the network!

221
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,220
I knew it!

222
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,900
I knew they were playing me!

223
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,340
Fine.

224
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,260
I'll just go all out against them!

225
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,260
Take one down, we break even.

226
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,460
Take two, we come out ahead!

227
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,700
Are you out of your mind?

228
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,460
You always rush in recklessly.

229
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,300
Is that gonna solve anything?

230
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,380
Use your head and think carefully!

231
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,500
Take this money.

232
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,140
Always have enough for the road.

233
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,060
Take your mother with you.

234
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,100
Don't live too rough.

235
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,980
Buddy,

236
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,580
I've still got tricks up my sleeve.

237
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,180
We can't keep taking hits like this.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,060
Mr. Sun.

239
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,500
Why's there a toll booth up ahead?

240
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,900
Toll booth?

241
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,740
That's a checkpoint.

242
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,140
Sanmahu's?

243
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,180
Hard to say.

244
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,020
Maybe the village is wary
of unannounced inspections.

245
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Let's just go through.

246
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,420
Where are you going?

247
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
We're here to look for someone, sir.

248
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,060
Look for someone? That'll be fifty

249
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,660
per vehicle.

250
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,220
Fifty?

251
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,300
What...

252
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,100
What is this fee for?

253
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Doesn't matter what it's for.

254
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,020
It's free during the day.

255
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,260
You can come then.

256
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,020
The mountain area isn't safe at night.

257
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,220
We're charging a mountain patrol fee

258
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,780
to keep you safe during night travel.

259
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,860
Sir,

260
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,140
look, we're two guys.

261
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,100
There's no danger for us.

262
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:58,980
Buddy.

263
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,700
So why do you guys

264
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,020
fuss over a little cash?

265
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,860
It's just too much.

266
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,140
Fifty.

267
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,780
Buddy.

268
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,620
You...

269
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,260
Buddy.

270
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Thanks for your work.

271
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,980
Here.

272
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,020
We're friends of Dou.

273
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,180
We came at night because it's urgent.

274
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,300
Could you cut us some slack?

275
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,660
Dou?

276
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,140
Who's that?

277
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,700
Don't know him.

278
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,660
If you wanna go through,

279
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,700
we'll just make it ten.

280
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,380
Alright.

281
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,300
Ten, right?

282
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,100
Alright.

283
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,500
Thank you.

284
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,820
Here, ten.

285
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,380
Ten.

286
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,460
Where are they staying?

287
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,340
I said

288
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,220
I don't know them.

289
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,060
Find them yourself.

290
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,340
Are you going in or not?

291
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,940
Alright.

292
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,620
Thanks.

293
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,140
Thank you, buddy.

294
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,420
Thanks.

295
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,220
Thank you.

296
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,100
[Chenjia Village]

297
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,980
Mr. Sun.

298
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,140
Mao's come to see you?

299
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,780
Yeah.

300
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,180
The cops are watching closely.

301
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,940
So I told him to lay low for a while.

302
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,260
An explosion at the train station.

303
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,020
They won't let this slide.

304
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,340
It's not like the old days.

305
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,540
You can't just lay low for a bit

306
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,460
and come back.

307
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,900
You really can't get away with it.

308
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,780
Mao

309
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,300
is a good guy.

310
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,140
But he's been exposed.

311
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,060
We can't let him

312
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,820
drag the rest of us down with him.

313
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,540
So there's only one way

314
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,820
to fix this.

315
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,220
Let Mao

316
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,980
take the fall for everything

317
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,940
and make Dragon Unleashed
disappear completely.

318
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,300
You want Mao to take the fall alone?

319
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,780
No, Mr. Sun.

320
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,660
Absolutely not.

321
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,740
He's my buddy!

322
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,700
I know you're close.

323
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,660
But there's no other way.

324
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,020
Things have come to this.

325
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,460
Someone has to take the heat.

326
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,700
Who's gonna take it?

327
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,780
You want me to let you take it instead?

328
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,580
Even if you did,

329
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,020
tell me,

330
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,540
if you're gone,

331
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,180
how long do you think Mao would last?

332
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,700
He's not quick-minded enough.

333
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,940
He can't outplay them.

334
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,660
You have to handle that!

335
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,940
I understand all that.

336
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,100
I just think

337
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,860
it's so unfair to Mao!

338
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,900
The world isn't fair!

339
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,740
You have to make a choice.

340
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,140
Either we all go down,

341
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,500
including his blind mother,

342
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,340
or...

343
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,140
Or Mao

344
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,340
takes the fall,

345
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,980
and we fight our way out.

346
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,060
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

347
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,620
I'll make sure this is handled.

348
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,300
Someone's out in this wasteland?

349
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,140
That's the paper mill over there.

350
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,980
This should be the place.

351
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,900
[Serve the People]

352
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,420
What's wrong with you?

353
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,340
Reading that report

354
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,180
turned you into a bobblehead.

355
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,900
Are you okay?

356
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,340
What do you think?

357
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,500
After reading your report,

358
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,860
my head is spinning.

359
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,460
It's not that big a deal.

360
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,580
Not that big a deal?

361
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,300
Take a good look.

362
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
A real good look.

363
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,180
Two thousand officers.

364
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,780
Fully armed.

365
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,260
Complete secrecy.

366
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,100
Mobilized in three days.

367
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,140
We know you're catching thieves.

368
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,940
But others

369
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,820
will think you're
putting down a rebellion.

370
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,220
Tu Hongjiang,

371
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,180
do you know how many officers
we have in total?

372
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,380
Even if I gave you all of them,
it still wouldn't be enough!

373
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,060
Just coordinating local support

374
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,420
would take at least ten days.

375
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
Get real, would you,

376
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
for heaven's sake?

377
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,540
I know we don't have the resources.

378
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,140
I was just
letting my imagination run wild.

379
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,300
This plan is feasible.

380
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:29,980
Take a look.

381
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,420
No.

382
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,780
Just tell me.

383
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,060
I'm afraid reading your report

384
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
will give me a heart attack.

385
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,780
I need backup from the SWAT team.

386
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,260
Tomorrow night.

387
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,020
The operation is confidential.

388
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,500
That's it?

389
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,220
That's it.

390
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
Just this few people?

391
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,860
Can we even surround them?

392
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,380
Different numbers

393
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,580
call for different tactics.

394
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,740
Just tell me

395
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,940
if you can make it happen.

396
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,980
If we can catch Sanmahu,

397
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,900
absolutely I can.

398
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,540
Mr. Zhan.

399
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,060
The Municipal Criminal Police Unit
did a routine check yesterday.

400
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,300
They found someone
selling small quantities

401
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,620
of heroin at Letiantang Bar.

402
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,500
After comparison,

403
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,300
it's very similar
to the batch we seized.

404
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,140
Dragon Unleashed?

405
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,500
With us watching this closely,

406
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,460
they'd still dare to operate?

407
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,580
Doesn't feel like
Dragon Unleashed's style.

408
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,340
What do you mean?

409
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,740
Small quantities.

410
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,860
Unstable pricing.

411
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,220
The arrested members are a mixed bag.

412
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,620
Most are novices.

413
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,220
And they just deal with the supplier.

414
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,300
There's no established
distribution network.

415
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,660
It means

416
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,500
the source is the same,

417
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
but the street dealers
aren't from Dragon Unleashed.

418
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,660
Right.

419
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,220
What does that tell us?

420
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,060
Someone's muscling in on the market.

421
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,460
Dragon Unleashed's sales
are getting squeezed.

422
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,100
I think

423
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,500
this is our chance
to get closer to them.

424
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,380
Dou, you're a straight shooter.

425
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
We're gonna

426
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,980
make a killing together.

427
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,180
You're my benefactor.

428
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,860
Honestly,

429
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,860
I've never

430
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,700
made this much money

431
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,300
in such a short time before.

432
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,060
To you.

433
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,260
This is just the beginning.

434
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,260
I only gave you two groups,

435
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,300
and you're already making this much.

436
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,220
I've got

437
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,460
dozens more like them.

438
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,460
I'll hand them all over

439
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,860
to you.

440
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,660
No backing out.

441
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,620
"Backing out"

442
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,380
isn't in my vocabulary.

443
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,700
But Dou,

444
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,300
let's keep this businesslike.

445
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,740
I can't give you

446
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,420
all the groups at once.

447
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,500
Five per set.

448
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,300
Two sets at a time.

449
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,180
Payment is due weekly.

450
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
Once the payment clears,

451
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,860
you get the next set.

452
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,700
What do you say?

453
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,180
You don't trust me.

454
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,300
It's not about trust.

455
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,820
I've put

456
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,780
a lot of effort into these groups.

457
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,220
You need someone sharp

458
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,380
to handle them properly.

459
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,260
If this gets messed up,

460
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,540
we'll all end up with nothing.

461
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,780
Don't worry.

462
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,220
I'll manage these groups

463
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,820
flawlessly.

464
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,500
I'll do even better than you.

465
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,260
Good luck.

466
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,140
[Market Management]

467
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,940
Sheng?

468
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,340
How's everything coming along?

469
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,820
Sheng, here, have a smoke.

470
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,540
Cut it out.

471
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,740
Come on.

472
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,540
Sheng.

473
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,860
Um,

474
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,500
could you talk to Wang for me?

475
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,820
Could you extend my rent deadline

476
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,020
a few more days this month?

477
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,460
Business has been slow.

478
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,620
I'm a little short on cash now.

479
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,260
We already gave you
an extension last month.

480
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,300
Wang only came to me

481
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,180
because he's out of options.

482
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,220
No, Sheng,

483
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,100
you've got it wrong.

484
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
I'm not trying to stall.

485
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,100
It's just a temporary

486
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,300
cash flow issue.

487
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,260
You know.

488
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Business is tough right now.

489
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,060
I know. Times are hard for everyone.

490
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,380
But

491
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
my position is different.

492
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm under pressure too.

493
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,820
Wang gave me a job.

494
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,940
If I don't get it done,

495
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,420
I can't answer to the higher-ups.

496
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,380
You get it?

497
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,500
Yeah.

498
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,380
I understand.

499
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,300
Any chance you could cut me some slack?

500
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,980
Cut you some slack?

501
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,500
Maybe.

502
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,580
But

503
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
you've got to give me a deadline.

504
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,140
When will you pay?

505
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,140
Next... Next Monday.

506
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,220
I promise,

507
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,300
the moment the money comes in,
I'll pay up.

508
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,260
It's settled then.

509
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,500
If you don't pay by next Monday,

510
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,220
don't blame me if I have to get tough.

511
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,260
Absolutely.

512
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,740
Can this mug be used for coffee?

513
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,820
Yes, definitely.

514
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,580
Just take it.

515
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,460
This guy

516
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,460
has been telling everyone he's got
connections in the police department.

517
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,500
He charges informant fees

518
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,460
to keep tabs on the ground level.

519
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,100
Says he can have anyone
who doesn't cooperate locked up,

520
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,660
and get those who play along
out of trouble.

521
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,060
People actually buy that nonsense?

522
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,820
He already said

523
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,140
he wants informant fees.

524
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,220
Saves us the talk.

525
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,740
Let's go.

526
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,660
Sheng, don't you worry.

527
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,660
I'll deliver on time every month.

528
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,860
Not a cent less.

529
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,500
This coffee

530
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,380
tastes a bit bitter.

531
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,220
I heard there's a new blend
that's less bitter.

532
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,660
It's called...

533
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,460
- I know.
- I'll bring it

534
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,220
to your office tomorrow.

535
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,620
Look at you. I'm not...

536
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,900
Just a little will be fine. See you.

537
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,460
Alright.

538
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,300
Take care, Sheng.

539
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,140
Sheng!

540
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,260
Sheng!

541
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,460
What's the rush?

542
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,340
Slow down.

543
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,500
Someone's causing trouble at the office.

544
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,140
Who?

545
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,820
No idea.

546
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,580
You didn't name-drop me?

547
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,500
I did.

548
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,540
They asked for you specifically.

549
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:21,900
You...

550
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
Here, take this. Let's go!

551
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,100
I'd like to see which idiot

552
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,260
dares to mess with me.

553
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,460
Sheng, it's this idiot!

554
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,340
This is the one, huh?

555
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:28,940
It's...

556
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,300
Who are you calling an idiot?

557
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,220
I...

558
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,700
You're the idiot!

559
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,780
You're all idiots!

560
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,740
Don't you recognize Mr. Zhan?

561
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,580
He's our boss!

562
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,540
Greet Mr. Zhan!

563
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,740
- Mr. Zhan.
- Mr. Zhan.

564
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,020
Get out.

565
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,180
I need to have a word with our boss.

566
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,860
Close the door.

567
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,940
Mr. Zhan.

568
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,780
Perfect timing.

569
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,820
I

570
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,060

571
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,380
Good.

572

You catch drug dealers.

605

606
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,580
it's probably for...

607
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,940

609

610
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,980
Look.

611
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,340
Mr. Zhan, have some mercy.

612
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,340
Those people are desperadoes.

613
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,020
I really don't dare cross them.

614
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,060

619

I do know a few spots.

They're selling that stuff there.

621
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,740
But

622
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,940
they don't seem like locals.

623
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,820
And they operate
at random times and locations.

624
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,860
No clear pattern.

625
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
Well,

626
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,340
I definitely don't
touch that stuff myself.

with the business now,

Sheng.

761
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,060
You know, you're actually
pretty good at haggling.

762
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,780
Good at...

763
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,700
But this money

764
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,660
isn't mine.

765
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,300
It's from the police department's funds.

766
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,500
If you pocket cash,

767
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,580
on a minor level, it's embezzlement.

768
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,220
On a major level...

769
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,300
No, no, no.

770
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,940
Let's not go there.

771
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,420
I'll go.

772
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,300
Fine, I'll go.

773
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,140
It's just that...

774
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,500
Mr. Zhan,

775
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,420
if I go,

776
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,500
can that money count as a service fee?

777
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,140
Well, I can

778
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,820
put in a request for you.

779
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,420
But

780
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,060
it depends on your performance.

781
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,220
Fine.

782
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,260
I'll perform well.

783
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,900
A major operation.

784
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,060
Back when I first joined the force,

785
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,100
I saw a full-department
mobilization once.

786
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,100
To Pingzhang.

787
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,620
That was a major operation.

788
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,220
Is the place big tonight?

789
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,060
Yeah.

790
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,940
We barely have
enough people to cover it.

791
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,260
Stay safe.

792
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,780
Get in.

793
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,580
Li.

794
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,340
Thanks for your team's hard work.

795
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,220
[SWAT]
Everyone, stay safe.

796
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,220
Move out!

797
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,660
Li, thanks for the hard work.

798
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,740
Just doing my job.

799
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,660
The two teams inside

800
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,660
are in position.

801
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,540
Ready to move on your command.

802
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,060
Good.

803
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,980
Whether we succeed tonight

804
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,540
depends on your support, Mr. Li.

805
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,180
Don't worry.

806
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,540
We'll flush everyone out on schedule.

807
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,860
I'm heading in with my team now.

808
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,860
Hey, buddy.

809
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,460
Want some?

810
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,460
I've cleared all the stock.

811
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,500
I'm here to collect payment.

812
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,380
Mr. Zhan.

813
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,780
The target is moving
toward the back alley.

814
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,460
Liu.

815
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,660
You're something else.

816
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,980
Top seller, huh?

817
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,900
Keep it up.

818
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,140
All thanks to your guidance.

819
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,620
Specs,

820
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,300
just give me more supply.

821
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,260
I'll push even harder.

822
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,620
You push harder,

823
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,180
and I'll make sure you're always

824
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,900
stocked up.

825
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,940
Alright.

826
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,340
Keep it up.

827
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,660
Don't move!

828
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,140
Easy, easy.

829
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,140
Freeze!

830
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,260
Mind your manners.

831
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,100
Manners!

832
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,820
Take him away.

833
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,500
Hello?

834
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,660
How's it going?

835
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,300
The guy with glasses

836
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,660
has been taken away.

837
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,020
Alright.

838
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,940
You're free for the night.

839
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,060
Wait for my call.

840
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,900
Be careful.

841
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,540
Alright, Long. Don't worry.

842
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,140
Mr. Sanmahu.

843
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,100
Where are those two experts?

844
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,540
Didn't make it out.

845
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,460
Cops are almost here. What do we do?

846
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,340
Fight our way out?

847
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,780
Nonsense.

848
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,820
Let's go.

849
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,220
When was this built?

850
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,420
Why did Mr. Sanmahu never mention it?

851
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,260
He bought the place above

852
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,100
because of this tunnel.

853
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,900
No one knows when it was built.

854
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,900
Mr. Li.

855
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,420
None of the four
from the photos are here.

856
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,660
The scene was chaotic.

857
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,820
They didn't seem tipped off.

858
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,540
They must have a secret escape route.

859
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,380
[Slow Down]
[Stop for Inspection]

860
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,380
Mr. Tu.

861
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,940
They're out.

862
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,900
Tighten the perimeter

863
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,780
and wait for them.

864
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,780
Understood.

865
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,500
Change of plans.

866
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,780
Execute Plan B.

867
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,980
Everyone, move!

868
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,540
