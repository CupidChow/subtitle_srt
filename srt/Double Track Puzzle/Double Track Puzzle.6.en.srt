00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,380
Thanks for today, Mao.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,580
What are you waiting for?

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,380
Eat up, Ergou.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,060
Is the pork knuckle not good?

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,060
Come on, dig in.

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,660
Eat up.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,260
If Mao says eat,

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,940
you eat.

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,500
No, this...

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,180
It's fine.

12
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,140
Dig in.

13
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,660
What did I teach you at home?

14
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:23,980
You can't...

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,220
Oh my goodness.

16
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,580
Slow down.

17
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,180
Drink this.

18

Come on.

22

Take it slow.

23
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,140
You eat too.

24
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,460
Alright.

25
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,100
Mao,

26

you came for me to...

27
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,860
Nothing much.

28
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,580
Dagou,

29
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,860
you've been with me

30
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,820
for five or six years now, right?

31
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,340
Three years short of six months.

32
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:48,980
No.

33
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,620
I mean, three months short of six years.

34
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,300
You...

35
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,900
I'm in a good mood today.

36
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,500
You've got a sharp mind.

37
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:56,940
Quick-minded.

38
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,620
Besides

39
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,820
being smooth with words,

40
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,100
my brain's my only asset.

41
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,580
Not much else is going for me.

42
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,180
I've got

43
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,660
a deal going right now

44
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,820
that needs someone

45
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,780
quick-minded like you.

46
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,140
Well,

47
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,500
thank you for throwing work my way.

48
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Let me toast you.

49

Here.

50
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,340
No rush.

51
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,940
I haven't finished.

52
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,460
There's good money

53
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,980
in this job.

54
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,580
But

55
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,900
you'll be

56
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,580
risking your neck.

57
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,580
Dare to take it?

58
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,740
We got so caught up talking.

59

Ergou,

61
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,380
look what I've got you.

62
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,020
Mao, this is expensive.

63
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,060
- We can't accept...
- Take it.

64
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,460
Come on.

65
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,100
Just take it.

66
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,860
Come on.

67
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,660
Say thank you to Mao.

68
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,180
Get up.

69
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,980
Thank you.

70
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,460
It's nothing.

71
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,620
Come on.

72
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,580
Sit.

73
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,620
Alright.

74
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,500
Alright, here.

75

76
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,300
Okay.

77
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,020
Let me open it.

78
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,260
Here, you can play.

79

80

look at your life these two years.

81
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,060
Barely scraping by.

82
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,860
But

83
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,220
you've always taken care of Ergou.

84
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,740
You saved good food for him.

85
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,980
You really are

86
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,700
a good brother.

87
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,460
But let's be real,

88
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,780
you're both

89
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,500

92
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,180
just gonna accept that?

93
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,620
Dagou,

94
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,340
you know where we are?

95

Here?

96
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,340
A private room.

97
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,700
You...

98
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,420
You think this is just any private room?

99
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,740
This is a premium one!

100
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,420
Listen,

101
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,940
we'll only eat in private rooms.

102
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,260
No more shredded potatoes!

103
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:54,980
No.

104
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,740
Their shredded potatoes here are good.

105
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,380
Yeah.

106
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,860
Don't cut me off.

107
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,820
I mean,

108
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,980
if you work with me,

109
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,660
you brothers can eat whatever you want,

110
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,100
and play with whatever you want.

111
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,020
Right?

112
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,300
Sure,

the job

114
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,340

116
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,020
with your smarts,

117
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,020
we will

118
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,420
nail it together.

119
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,220
No, I...

120
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,580
As an old saying goes,

121

fortune favors the bold.

122
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,020
Right?

123
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,300
If you want to make money,

124
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,940
you gotta have some guts.

What's the situation?

Any leads?

133
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,740
The dead guy's name is Qian Sanshui.

134
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,500
A pickpocket in Xiatong.

135
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,020
He used to work under Bazijiao.

136
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,940
The preliminary assessment is

137
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,300
that he died from a broken neck
caused by extreme backward bending.

138
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,900
No eyewitnesses.

142
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,420
The man saw two people enter

143
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,700
but didn't get a clear look.

144
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,060
The woman saw nothing.

145
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,740
We checked the cameras.

146

Two waiters entered this room,

147
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,860
but their faces weren't visible.

148

153
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,300
you said this was connected to my case.

154

How did you figure that?

155
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,580
Qian Sanshui used drugs

156
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,460
before he died.

157
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,980

00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,980
two people who were inside.

They work for Sanmahu.

161
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,420
From the northern frontier.

162
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,380
Their main business

163
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,340
isn't theft.

164
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,540
It's selling drugs.

165
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,940
You got files on those two?

166
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,140

did Mr. Tu really reach out

198
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,100
just because the victim used drugs?

199
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,460
Not entirely.

200
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,420
Sanmahu's involved with drugs now.

201
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,740
This is more serious

202
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,620
than we thought.

203
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,420
Mr. Tu

204
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,900
needs our tech support now.

205
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,740
But can't say it outright.

206
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,740
So he's feeding us info

207
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,980
to show his stance.

208
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,700
The rest

209
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,300
depends on how things develop

210
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,820
and how we cooperate.

211
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,900
No wonder

212
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,140
he's being so proactive this time.

213
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,780
Now you get it?

214
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,660
Sir.

215
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,380
You know why I like this part?

216
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,820
A lone wolf can't achieve much,

217
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,940
but a pack can.

218
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,860
Sit.

219
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,940
You're right.

220
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,420
Even a tiger can't stand up
against a pack of wolves.

221
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,580
No matter how strong you are alone,

222
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,420
you can't beat a tight-knit team

223
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,060
that works together.

224
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,260
Even animals know this.

225
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,300
Let alone people.

226
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,580
Don't you agree?

227
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,420
How did the talk go?

228
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,340
Very smoothly.

229
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,380
They all want in.

230
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,260
But,

231
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,700
sir,

232
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,620
there was a little hiccup.

233
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,340
One guy stepped out to take a call
and never came back.

234
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,780
He ran?

235
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,980
He was killed.

236
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,980
Dead?

237
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,660
Yeah.

238
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,060
Right under your noses?

239
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,100
Yeah.

240
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,500
Who did it?

241
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,380
I think it was Hua Long.

242
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,020
Sir,

243
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,820
they were brutal.

244
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,420
The guy

245
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,900
was snapped in half

246
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,980
at the waist.

247
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,980
Snapped?

248
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,500
How brutal.

249
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,140
We're new here. Do we have enemies?

250
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,940
No.

251
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,340
Except Hua Long.

252
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,860
Sir,

253
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,580
before it happened, I got a call.

254
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,980
It was weird.

255
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,980
They kept trying to lure me out.

256
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,420
This guy took the hit for me.

257
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,940
And he ended up dead.

258
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,300
It was

259
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
definitely meant for me.

260
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,980
Who are you?

261
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,700
Hey, I need to talk to you.

262
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,620
It's too noisy there! I can't hear you!

263
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,820
Who are you?

264
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,340
I don't even know you!

265
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,420
Probably a scam call.

266
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,500
Nobody scams better than me.

267
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,380
Oh, hello.

268
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,580
Yeah.

269
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,420
Yeah, that's me.

270
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,180
Go ahead.

271
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,820
These hicks are something else.

272
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,420
Who died?

273
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,660
Qian Sanshui.

274
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,140
Qian Sanshui?

275
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,100
I understand, sir.

276
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,340
I get it.

277
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,100
He was young.

278
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,420
It's a shame he's gone.

279
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,380
But honestly, sir...

280
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,820
Sir,

281
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,740
was there

282
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,260
something special about him?

283
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,940
Fate

284
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,380
is a funny thing.

285
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,020
When you want to cut it off,

286
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,340
it won't break.

287
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,500
But when you don't want it to,

288
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,100
it snaps just like that.

289
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,900
No room for second chances.

290
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
The cops don't have anything
on us yet, do they?

291
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:16,780
No.

292
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,860
That means we can still fix this.

293
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,180
Here's the plan.

294
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,060
You two go back

295
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,220
and get ready.

296
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,340
A big job

297
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,300
is coming.

298
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,100
Hello?

299
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,180
Mr. Jiang.

300
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,180
We've got a situation.

301
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,500
[Hongmofang]

302
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,700
Let me say it again.

303
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,540
I don't know that woman!

304
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,220
We're both victims here.

305
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,540
That's the key point.

306
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,140
Stop grilling me
with all these questions.

307
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,260
Please calm down, sir.

308
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,260
Don't worry.

309
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,020
We'll find the phone
as soon as possible.

310
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Please confirm again.

311
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,700
Is this the number?

312
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,580
Yes.

313
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,740
Contact me the moment you find it.

314
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,180
Hey, Han Xin,

315
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,900
I just sent you a phone number.

316
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,580
Track it now.

317
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,100
Update me the moment there's news.

318
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,460
Wait, what?

319
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,740
We're actually helping him
look for his phone?

320
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,180
We've got a ton of other things to do.

321
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,740
Silly boy,

322
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,660
listen,

323
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,620
that phone

324
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,660
is the only lead we have

325
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,700
in our hands.

326
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,500
What do you mean?

327
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,980
Before we got here, Mr. Tu already

328
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,020
searched the place.

329
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,940
He took
all the key surveillance footage.

330
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,820
He definitely doesn't know
about the phone.

331
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,900
Think about it.

332
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,940
Who would take

333
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,620
the latest model phone
from a murder scene?

334
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,460
The killer?

335
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,620
Or

336
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,220
someone who knows the truth.

337
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,660
Hu and Zhong

338
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,260
are with Sickly Dou?

339
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,340
How...

340
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,140
How is that possible?

341
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,700
I've told them a million times

342
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,900
not to get involved with them.

343
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,900
Why won't they listen?

344
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,100
Your nephew knows better.

345
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,260
He listens to you.

346
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,740
But

347
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,260
it doesn't really help.

348
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,820
What do you mean?

349
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,220
Who did this?

350
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,500
The kid died

351
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,620
in the room across from Sickly Dou's.

352
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,980
How ruthless.

353
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,060
Just because he refused to cooperate?

354
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,620
That's beyond ruthless!

355
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Do you think Sickly Dou
would dare do this?

356
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,020
My brother-in-law died young.

357
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,460
This kid

358
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,780
never took school seriously.

359
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,460
My sister had no choice

360
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,500
but to leave him with me.

361
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,500
I didn't want him in this line!

362
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,540
But he's messing around on his own.

363
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,780
There's nothing I can do.

364
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,100
Mr. Hu knows about our connection

365
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,820
and still did this.

366
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,700
He's burning all bridges.

367
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,220
Sanmahu is suspicious and ruthless.

368
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,860
That's just how he treats people.

369
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,180
Hu and Zhong are
on that crooked path now.

370
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,700
They probably can't get off.

371
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,140
Whether they live or die
depends on fate.

372
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,820
Mr. Tu,

373
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,380
with what happened to Sanshui,

374
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,180
it reminds me of someone.

375
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,940
When I returned to Xiatong,

376
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,860
Mr. Hu kept telling me

377
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,860
to visit someone.

378
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,580
I tried twice
but got turned away.

379
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,780
You know him.

380
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,380
The only one in Xiatong

381
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,500
in the last decade who managed to

382
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,780
get out of the line.

383
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,260
The traditional Chinese medicine doctor?

384
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,700
He's Sanshui's uncle.

385
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,860
They haven't been
in touch much these years,

386
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,180
but Sanshui was the only heir
in their family.

387
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,140
This must hit him hard.

388
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,340
If he's willing to come out again,

389
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,860
Mr. Hu will be interested.

390
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,740
[Qian's Traditional Chinese
Medicine Clinic]

391
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,420
Next one.

392
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,500
Mr. Qian.

393
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,140
It's me.

394
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,180
How's your father doing?

395
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,580
I should thank you.

396
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,380
He's much better.

397
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,340
Let me write you another prescription.

398
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,780
One more course

399
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,100
of this

400
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,460
should do it.

401
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,660
Alright.

402
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,620
What's with all the secrecy?

403
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,180
I need to tell you something.

404
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,220
Go ahead.

405
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,180
Just between the two of us.

406
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,860
Mr. Qian,

407
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,220
something's happened.

408
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,900
Sanshui is...

409
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,220
Mr. Zhan!

410
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,180
We've got something.

411
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,060
Come take a look.

412
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,740
The movement trail
of those two waiters.

413
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,820
They came out of Room 801,

414
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,700
passed by here,

415
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,300
went through the lobby,

416
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,180
and left through the main gate.

417
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,660
I pulled the footage from outside.

418
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,460
He got into this Jetta.

419
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,460
Now compare it with earlier footage.

420
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,820
Look at these two clips.

421
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,340
The Jetta's color matches,

422
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,300
and the last two digits
of the license plate are the same.

423
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,820
This can't be a coincidence.

424
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,420
Definitely the same car.

425
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,420
Good work.

426
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,140
Keep digging.

427
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,220
Track the car's route.

428
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,700
Find the car,

429
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
and we'll find the people soon.

430
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,220
Everyone's done well.

431
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,140
Alright.

432
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,060
I'll keep at it.

433
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,220
Get to work.

434
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,660
- Alright.
- Liu.

435
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,300
Pull all the road surveillance footage

436
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,380
near the nightclub.

437
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,260
Two big shot
from northern frontier are here.

438
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,660
Definitely not the kind type.

439
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,780
With Mr. Ba gone,

440
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,700
I'm not sure what to do.

441
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,860
But if I don't go,

442
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,740
I'm afraid

443
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,020
more trouble might follow.

444
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,340
Mr. Qian,

445
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,780
could you give me some guidance?

446
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,540
Well,

447
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,420
I've got my limits.

448
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,580
I only heal people.

449
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,300
Anything else is not my business.

450
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,540
Hu,

451
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,140
everyone walks their own path.

452
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,900
You'll have to decide for yourself.

453
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,980
But, Mr. Qian...

454
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,820
Hello?

455
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,980
You're not in your room.

456
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,860
Where did you go?

457
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,220
My dad's medicine ran out.

458
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,100
I went to get more.

459
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,340
What's up?

460
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,420
We're boarding at Jiagou at 2 PM.

461
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
Don't be late.

462
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,340
At Jiagou?

463
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,780
Okay, got it.

464
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,260
Alright, Mr. Qian.

465
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
I'll

466
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,420
leave the money with you.

467
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,260
If anything

468
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,580
happens to me,

469
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,580
please make sure

470
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,980
my dad gets his medicine on time.

471
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,540
Whatever's left

472
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,980
can be his pension.

473
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,980
I don't have anyone else I can trust.

474
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,060
Please.

475
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,860
Alright.

476
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,700
I'll leave now.

477
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,780
What is wrong with you?

478
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,780
I told you

479
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,940
Mr. Qian isn't seeing patients today.

480
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,540
He's not available.

481
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,580
Why won't you listen?

482
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,100
I've said it a million times.

483
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm not here for treatment.

484
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,380
I'm here to meet a friend.

485
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,940
Meet a friend?

486
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,980
Go meet them outside then.

487
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,060
Who is your friend here?

488
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,980
We are running a business...

489
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,340
Why...

490
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Why are you so stubborn?

491
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:33,700
Dou.

492
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,100
I...

493
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,260
Mr. Qian,

494
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,820
I told him we're closed.

495
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,940
But he just wouldn't leave.

496
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,620
Step out for a bit.

497
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,500
Old pal.

498
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,020
Haven't seen you in years.

499
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,820
So you've been hiding out here?

500
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,980
Crows all over the sky,

501
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,980
evil spirits banging on doors.

502
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,100
What brings you here?

503
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,380
Still so superstitious.

504
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,740
What do crows

505
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,580
have to do with anything happening?

506
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,300
Sit.

507
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,300
Sanmahu is back.

508
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,260
I know.

509
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,820
Your nephew's dead.

510
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,220
I know.

511
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,700
He died pretty badly.

512
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,900
Sooner or later.

513
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,380
And then?

514
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,500
What do you mean?

515
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,460
That's it.

516
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,660
If that's it, why did you say
you know everything?

517
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,700
Qian,

518
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,980
self-cultivation

519
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,540
isn't the same as indulging evil.

520
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,540
Washing your hands of it
doesn't mean cutting all ties.

521
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,140
You sit at home,

522
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,860
yet trouble still comes crashing down.

523
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,420
You can snub Bazijiao,

524
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,900
but can you crush Sanmahu's obsession?

525
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,180
Even if Sanshui

526
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,700
was bound to get in trouble,

527
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,180
why did it have to be last night?

528
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,260
Do you really not get it,

529
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,980
or you just don't want to?

530
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,940
Go on.

531
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,220
What do you want?

532
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,580
Help me, please.

533
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,940
I've been out of the game

534
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,580
for years.

535
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,620
Sanmahu's involved in drugs.

536
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,820
He's selling heroin in Xiatong.

537
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,100
This isn't just
an underworld matter anymore.

538
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,820
Both in reason and in principle,
you should take a stand.

539
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,980
Is he insane?

540
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,140
Well,

541
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,820
you should ask him that.

542
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,380
I'm getting old.

543
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,140
I have the will, but not the power.

544
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,300
The will is enough.

545
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,740
We'll figure out later

546
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,700
if you can act.

547
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,460
I'll wait for your word.

548
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
2 PM.

549
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,900
Jiagou Station.

550
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,580
Stick close to Hu.

551

[Jiagou Station]

552
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,820
I want a banana!

553
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,260
Excuse me.

554
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,260
That's my seat.

555
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,300
Sir, mind if I put this here?

556
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,180
No problem.

557
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,420
Dear passengers,

558
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,900
the train has departed.

559
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,620
Welcome aboard.

560
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,780
I'm your attendant.

561
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,300
I'll be serving you throughout the trip

562
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,700
[Pick up the goods.]
to ensure a safe and pleasant journey.

563
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,460
Sir,

564
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,620
could you watch my bag for a sec?

565
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,220
Sure.

566
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,660
Hurry up in there.

567
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,540
I can't hold it!

568
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,620
Buddy, what's the rush?

569
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,980
You're taking forever.

570
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,420
A guy being this slow?

571
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,180
I'll sit for a bit.

572
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,580
Standing's killing me.

573
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,180
Occupied.

574
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,180
Hurry.

575
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,740
Almost done.

576
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,380
What's the rush?

577
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,660
I haven't even pulled my pants up yet.

578
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,500
What's your problem?

579
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,780
You think this is your home?

580
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,460
You can't just stretch your legs
wherever you want.

581
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,380
Did I bump into you?

582
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,180
Sorry, sorry.

583
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,220
I was half-asleep.

584
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,140
You bumped into me,

585
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
and then I bumped into the old lady!

586
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,500
You're the root cause here!

587
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:45,940
No.

588
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,780
Let's be clear,

589
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,100
I didn't even know I tripped you!

590
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,340
Her fall has nothing to do with me.

591
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,180
That's between you two.

592
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,300
Ma'am, get up.

593
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,420
Let go of me.

594
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,540
Everyone, be the judge.

595
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,580
Did he bump into me first,

596
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:54,940
and then I...

597
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,180
- It was you!
- It was you!

598
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,700
How could it be me?

599
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,340
You can't pin her fall on me!

600
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,100
You can't.

601
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,260
Did he bump into me,

602
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,300
- and then I bumped into her?
- You bumped into her!

603
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,980
- We saw you do it!
- Pay up!

604
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,540
Get up.

605
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,020
Get up first, please?

606
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,340
Let's talk this out.

607
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,900
Ma'am,

608
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,180
let go of me.

609
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,700
Here, get up first.

610
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,580
Then we talk.

611
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,100
I'm not leaving.

612
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,020
Don't worry.

613
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,820
Take it easy.

614
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,580
How much do I need to pay?

615
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,180
Alright,

616
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,940
stop pulling on me.

617
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,620
I'll give you the money.

618
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,220
Here, take it.

619
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,580
Get up first.

620
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,620
Ma'am, please get up.

621
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,140
Let's talk...

622
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,860
I'm not leaving.

623
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,660
I won't run.

624
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,540
Pay up.

625
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,060
Ma'am,

626
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,700
here's the deal.

627
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,300
I'll cover your medical bills. Alright?

628
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Let's just settle this.

629
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,820
Where's my bag?

630
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,620
Mr. Tu!

631
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,300
Kid,

632
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,060
do you think Bazijiao is bored in there,

633
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,540
and you wanna keep him company?

634
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,980
Mr. Tu,

635
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,180
come on.

636
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,500
Even if I wanted to go in

637
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,340
and show loyalty to him,

638
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,740
it's not like I can just waltz in there.

639
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,780
Milk powder?

640
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,340
I bought it myself.

641
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,460
To be honest, Mr. Tu,

642
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,860
I knew you were here
the moment I got on the train.

643
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,660
If I tried to pull something
under your nose,

644
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,180
I'd be asking for trouble.

645
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,820
Not bad.

646
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,460
With Ba gone,

647
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,380
you little punks think you can
call your own shots

648
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,140
and run wild?

649
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,220
Didn't get enough of that stupid booze

650
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,380
at Hongmofang last night?

651
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,780
Remember this,

652
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,100
in Xiatong,

653
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,820
once I set my sights on a thief,

654
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,620
not a single one can get away.

655
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,620
Don't step out of line.

656
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,420
Busting you over something this small

657
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,220
is a waste of police resources.

658
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,540
Most importantly,

659
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,100
I want you to take a message back.

660
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,820
When you can't sleep at night,

661
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,660
think it over.

662
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,340
Now get lost.

663
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,540
Thanks, Mr. Tu.

664
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,060
Buddy.

665
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,260
What?

666
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,020
Nothing.

667
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,060
Just check if you've lost anything.

668
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,020
Who are you?

669
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:51,940
What are you doing?

670
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,580
Why did you kick me?

671
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Hey, let's just talk it out.

672
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,500
Officer?

673
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,580
Sorry about that.

674
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,300
Just cooperate and check.

675
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,860
Open it.

676
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,100
Have a look.

677
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,780
My phone's here.

678
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,100
Everything is here.

679
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:11,700
Open it.

680
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:12,980
Open it.

681
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,860
All here.

682
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Nothing's missing.

683
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,180
All here.

684
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,340
It's all here.

685
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,060
There's nothing missing in here.

686
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,820
Hello?

687
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,500
Okay.

688
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,780
Got it.

689
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,060
That's good.

690
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,220
It's crowded on the train.

691
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,420
Keep an eye on your belongings.

692
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:34,700
Alright.

693
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,860
Definitely.

694
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,620
Thanks, officer.

695
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,340
Appreciate it.

696
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,620
Found it.

697
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,700
Surveillance footage shows

698
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,380
the Jetta was last seen

699
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,780
at Xiatong Railway Station parking lot.

700
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,740
It entered the parking lot

701
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,100
at 1:15 PM

702
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,820
and parked in spot B29.

703
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,220
Good work.

704
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,180
Hey, Mr. Zhan.

705
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,940
Found it.

706
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
The black Jetta

707
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,100
is parked in the underground lot
at Xiatong Railway Station.

708
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:20,780
Mr. Tu,

709
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,540
something feels off.

710
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,780
That kid wouldn't just wander around
for no reason.

711
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,220
The problem is, the victim said
nothing was missing.

712
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,900
Only two possibilities.

713
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,780
One,

714
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,860
he's the scout

715
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,300
testing how much we're paying attention.

716
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:34,900
Two,

717
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,820
there was someone on the train

718
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,940
we didn't notice

719
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,060
watching us from behind.

720
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,100
Have you seen

721
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,420
that couple

722
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,620
from the northern frontier?

723
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,300
We've dealt with them before.

724
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,060
Left quite an impression.

725
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,340
If they were on the train,

726
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,500
we'd have recognized them.

727
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,540
Whether they were or not,

728
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,180
we've already rattled the cage.

729
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,460
Let's see what their next move is.

730
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,060
[Xiatong Station]

731
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,940
Mr. Zhang?

732
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,340
How did you become a security guard?

733
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,300
I get it.

734
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,580
You're undercover, right?

735
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,500
Don't worry.

736
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,940
I didn't see you.

737
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,020
Bye.

738
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,220
All teams, attention.

739
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,700
Hello?

740
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,500
Mao,

741
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,900
there are cops in the parking lot.

742
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:11,940
You sure?

743
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,820
Yes.

744
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,900
They're the same ones who arrested

745
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,980
my brother at the market last time.

746
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,180
Head to the old compound
in the western suburbs.

747
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,180
Oh my goodness.

748
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,740
You're on board?

749
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,300
Okay, alright.

750
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,580
Have a safe trip.

751
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:23,980
Alright.

752
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,860
Let me know when you arrive.

753
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,220
Bye.

754
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,580
Keep watching.

755
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,140
Hello?

756
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,860
Mao,

757
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,380
I got the goods.

758
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,580
Next time, there'll be interest.

759
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,660
Mao?

760
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,420
Mao?

761
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:19,940
Over here!

762
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,020
Mao,

763
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,380
that was scary, right?

764
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,220
Good thing I recognized that cop.

765
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,460
Otherwise, we'd be in trouble today.

766
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,540
Where are the goods?

767
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,700
Right here.

768
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,820
Here.

769
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,300
Mao,

770
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,020
we really got lucky today.

771
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,060
Almost got checked on the train.

772
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,220
Almost got caught at the station.

773
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,420
But we slipped away both times.

774
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,020
You haven't tested it, have you?

775
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,060
We gotta do this right.

776
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,740
Heaven's looking out for us.

777
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,220
The goods were swapped.

778
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:49,980
What?

779
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,780
Swapped?

780
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,380
No way!

781
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,020
Smell it yourself.

782
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,420
What's that smell?

783
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,980
Sweet?

784
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,380
Sweet...

785
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,860
No way!

786
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,620
After...

787
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,980
After I got it,

788
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,260
it never left my side.

789
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,940
How could it be swapped?

790
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,820
Who did you kill at Hongmofang?

791
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,060
I killed the guy who was on the phone.

792
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,460
You killed the wrong person!

793
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,300
I killed the wrong person?

794
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,820
That can't be.

795
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,460
I...

796
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,220
I was waiting for him right at the door.

797
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,020
He came out the room across
while on the phone.

798
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,980
Then he was standing at the doorway.

799
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,980
I yanked him into the room.

800
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,140
What are you doing?

801
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,540
Ergou

802
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,420
snapped his neck,

803
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,020
and he just died on the spot.

804
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,180
[Call log] [Delete]
I even checked his phone.

805
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,580
The last call he got

806
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,580
was from your number.

807
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,900
I wiped it clean.

808
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:10,700
Ergou,

809
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,460
we're leaving.

810
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,180
Let's go.

811
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,420
Then who did I see at the station exit?

812
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,380
They're the ones who swapped the goods!

813
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,380
I really killed the wrong guy?

814
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,620
Then

815
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,540
what do we do, Mao?

816
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,260
The goods are gone.

817
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,260
All of it.

818
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,060
How are we gonna pay for this?

819
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,860
You didn't swap the stuff.

820
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,740
We don't owe a single thing.

821
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,860
Mao.

822
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,780
I'm really sorry.

823
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,700
I messed up,

824
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,460
and now we're in deep trouble.

825
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,100
It's no use for them
even if they get the goods.

826
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,820
Long will have a plan.

827
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,260
Wait for my call.

828
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,180
Mao.

829
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,420
I didn't get the job done.

830
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,020
I can't take the money.

831
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,020
This money is for Ergou's game card.

832
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,940
A promise is a promise.

833
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,340
Remember that.

834
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,380
Take care of it first when you get back.

835
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,260
Sir,

836
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,540
this batch is definitely top quality.

837
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,420
And as you instructed,

838
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,700
the bag of flour

839
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,020
and the straw

840
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,100
were returned to their owner.

841
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,140
Well done!

842
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,820
They need to remember

843
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,620
this experience.

844
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,860
They need to know

845
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,260
we've got a presence

846
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,660
in Xiatong.

847
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,780
Exactly.

848
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,580
Sir,

849
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,020
if we control this route,

850
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,100
not just Xiatong,

851
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,540
even the market in the northern frontier
will be ours!

852
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,660
Control?

853
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,700
How?

854
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,500
Tell me how.

855
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,260
Don't forget.

856
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,940
Mr. Jiang helped us this time.

857
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,020
He gave us

858
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,020
the car number

859
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,220
and the seat number.

860
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,940
But what about next time?

861
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,860
Which day?

862
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,660
Which train?

863
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,180
Who's coming?

864
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,500
Forget about that.

865
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,820
You haven't even

866
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,260
secured Xiatong yet.

867
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,260
Say we've got the goods now,

868
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,180
how do we move them?

869
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,660
Which spot?

870
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,820
Who handles it?

871
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,660
Arrogance will get you in trouble.

872
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,660
Sir, you really see the big picture.

873
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,180
You've got things planned out ahead.

874
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Dou and I

875
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
will just

876
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,220
keep following your lead, step by step.

877
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,420
Just tell us

878
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,140
what to do.

879
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,540
Sometimes Dou

880
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,260
gets a little carried away,

881
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,300
but he gets the job done.

882
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,660
He knows what he's doing.

883
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,540
You hear that?

884
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,500
You need to learn from Taohua.

885
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,340
What's the deal with Tu Hongjiang?

886
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,580
You ran into him on the train?

887
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,780
No.

888
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,140
He must've gotten tipped off beforehand.

889
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,300
Luckily, Dou moved fast

890
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,900
and swapped the goods with Fei in time.

891
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,980
Any later,

892
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,300
and they would've been seized.

893
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,180
What's your problem?

894
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,460
You think this is your home?

895
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,580
Did I bump into you?

896
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,380
Ma'am,

897
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,940
get up, please.

898
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,940
Let go of me.

899
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,140
Everyone, be the judge.

900
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,260
Did he bump into me first,

901
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,820
and then I...

902
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,620
No, I didn't even touch you!

903
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,740
Everyone saw it.

904
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,780
He tripped me, right?

905
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,220
No, ma'am.

906
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,940
Please get up.

907
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,700
He bumped into me.

908
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,380
Ma'am, let go of me.

909
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,140
I won't run. Just let go.

910
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,660
Actually, both Taohua and I think

911
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,860
Tu Hongjiang didn't know
I was on the train.

912
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,420
He probably had people

913
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,540
watching Hu Shangfei and Lu Dingzhong.

914
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,740
After all, those two

915
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,100
have been in Xiatong for years.

916
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,580
It's normal for them to be targeted.

917
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,420
But there's one thing.

918
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,100
Before getting on the train,

919
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,700
Hu Shangfei went to
get medicine for his father.

920
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,300
He was gone for two hours.

921
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,100
Medicine?

922
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,380
What kind of medicine?

923
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
Who's the doctor in charge?

924
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,340
I looked into it.

925
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,660
It's an
traditional Chinese medicine doctor.

926
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,980
Pretty famous in Xiatong.

927
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,820
Surnamed Qian.

928
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,980
What's his full name?

929
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,820
Qian Changfeng.

930
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,780
Qian Changfeng?

931
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,900
You know him?

932
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,540
Fate, huh.

933
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,740
Maybe it's destiny.
