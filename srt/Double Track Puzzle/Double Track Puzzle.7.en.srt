572
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,740
I got beaten every day.

573
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,700
But Changfeng always had my back.

574
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,420
He taught me patiently.

575
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,500
That's how I made it through

576
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,340
and how I became who I am today.

577
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,580
Let's toast

578
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,340
to my senior brother,

579
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,260
Here.

580
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,180
Cheers.

581
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,620
Come on.

582
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,540
Dig in.

583
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,900
Forget the past.

584
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,900
Those days are long gone.

585
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,740
Don't be modest.

586
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,020
I know

587
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,740
what you're capable of.

588
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,780
I'm getting old.

589
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,620
Can't do much anymore.

590
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,700
This young man beside you.

591
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,020
Sure,

592
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,340
he's got some skills,

593
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,340
but

594
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,460
he's too hot-headed.

595
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,220
Without us old-timers

596
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,820
at the helm,

597
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,300
it just won't work.

598
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,740
Mr. Qian here

599
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,060
is my senior brother

600
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,460
by seniority.

601
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,820
In terms of bond,

602
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,220
he's like

603
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,420
my own brother.

604
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,100
Back then, he was a train pickpocket.

605
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,860
But,

606
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,620
it wasn't the short-haul

607
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,020
petty stuff.

608
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,300
He worked long-haul routes.

609
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,740
All the way from the south
to the northern frontier.

610
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,020
Go ask around.

611
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,460
Everyone knew his name.

612
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,980
Am I right?

613
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,500
Never expected.

614
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,420
Your eyesight's gone,

615
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,340
and your fingers are missing.

616
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,620
Never thought you were

617
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
such a legend back in the day.

618
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,260
Not convinced, huh?

619
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,380
Let me tell you,

620
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,420
four years ago,

621
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,340
that scar on Xu Laizi's face,

622
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,380
the one who put you down?

623
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,220
That was Mr. Qian's work.

624
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,500
Impressive, old man.

625
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Xu Laizi was skilled.

626
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,460
But hey,

627
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,340
I chop off one of his hands

628
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,060
when he wasn't paying attention.

629
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,900
Guess he was old.

630
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,460
People

631
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,900
just aren't

632
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,380
what they used to be

633
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,300
once they age, right?

634
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,100
Look.

635
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,620
These youngsters

636
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,980
are just so arrogant.

637
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,700
Come on.

638
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,740
Let's eat.

639
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,380
Long,

640
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,220
your move was brilliant.

641
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,660
Using the phone number as bait

642
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,140
and the cops actually took it.

643
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,100
Now we're set.

644
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,660
With the warehouse blown,

645
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,660
we can smooth things over with Mr. Sun.

646
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,940
Blowing the warehouse is like
drinking poison to quench our thirst.

647
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,260
Such a big scene.

648
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,860
The cops will be
watching even closer now.

649
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,620
But right now,

650
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,620
the real problem isn't the cops.

651
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,100
It's still Mr. Sun.

652
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,500
This is all my fault.

653
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,500
Here's the plan.

654
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,620
I'll go reason with Mr. Sun.

655
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
If that doesn't work, I'll take him on

656
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,540
and finish him off.

657
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,620
We know the ropes now.

658
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,580
We can move to another city,

659
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,820
find a new supplier,

660
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,940
and we'll still be living good.

661
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,220
Take him om, huh?

662
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,580
Hey, Long!

663
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,180
Take him om, huh?

664
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:01,660
Long! Long!

665
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,900
What are you doing?

666
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,540
Long, I was wrong.

667
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
I was wrong.

668
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,900
Come on, I was wrong.

669
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,620
Don't you know what Mr. Sun is like?

670
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,700
And you're taking him on?

671
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,900
If you kill him,

672
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
you think his men

673
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,860
will let us go?

674
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,500
You think they'll let your mother go?

675
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,700
Why has Mr. Sun always been the boss?

676
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,660
Because people
whose minds are like yours

677
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
are already dead!

678
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,820
Long.

679
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,500
I was wrong, Long.

680
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,460
So... What do we do now?

681
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,260
We gamble.

682
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,100
Just gotta see if luck's on our side.

683
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,260
Headaches are no small matter.

684
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,620
Your liver fire is too strong.

685
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,260
If you drag it out,

686
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,740
it'll only get worse.

687
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,220
Still the same old style.

688
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,620
So, Changfeng,

689
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,860
That's why I need your help.

690
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,900
You've seen Dou.

691
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,780
He's no hopeless case.

692
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,380
Let me tell you,

693
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,420
when Ba was around,

694
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,780
the two kept each other in check.

695
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,380
Now that Ba's gone,

696
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,700
that guy

697
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,420
is running wild.

698
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,780
He's even trying to overstep.

699
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Everything

700
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,900
needs a beginning and an end.

701
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,100
Now,

702
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,660
I understand

703
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,300
how it started.

704
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,100
But you

705
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,980
have to show me how it ends.

706
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,580
I'll be straight with you.

707
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,100
I'm

708
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,420
not just doing the old trades anymore.

709
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,940
I've got some other business.

710
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,780
It is

711
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,060
risky,

712
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,900
but the returns are huge.

713
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,620
You don't need to
worry about the details.

714
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,260
Just help me

715
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,140
set up lookouts

716
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,180
along the railways

717
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,420
out of Xiatong.

718
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,980
That way,

719
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,980
whoever we want coming in

720
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,660
can come.

721
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,980
Once I've got my footing,

722
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,060
you can go back to your clinic.

723
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,980
I know.

724
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,980
It was easier being the boss back then.

725
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,980
The underlings

726
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,260
wouldn't dare scheme against you.

727
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,780
But business is tough now.

728
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,900
Every employee

729
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,660
wants to be the boss.

730
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,340
That's about it.

731
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,540
Master said

732
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,500
we must never use our skills

733
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,660
