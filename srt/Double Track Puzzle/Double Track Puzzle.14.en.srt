00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,590
[In 1983]

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,420
Both of you were transferred
out of the military.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,260
There are rules for soldiers

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,660
and regulations for the police.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,780
According to the investigation report,

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,220
you two

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,340
made a shoot in sequence.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,220
The first one

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,500
hit Wang Jiangshun's left upper arm.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,140
The second one

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,580
hit the gasoline drum

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,540
behind him,

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,300
which led to a violent explosion.

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,020
The second shooter

15
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,380
should bear full responsibility

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,940
in this case.

17
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,260
Mr. Tai,

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,260
has the Bureau informed you

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,060
about the punishment?

20
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,620
You are the second shooter.

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,420
The Bureau will handle this
in a low profile

22
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,500
in one condition.

23
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,380
You have to leave the police force.

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,060
No.

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,100
Mr. Tai,

26
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,140
may I have one more chance?

27
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,380
My elder brother is ill.

28
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,100
My whole family is counting on me.

29
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,980
I can't lose this job.

30
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,180
I'm the second shooter.

31
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,980
Tu Hongjiang.

32
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,860
This is the Police Department.

33
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,620
The firing position of you two

34
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,380
and the ballistic evidence.

35
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,500
Could it be more obvious?

36
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,780
Do you want to leave the force as well?

37
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,980
Enough with the nonsense.

38
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,300
Do you think you're Robin Hood?

39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,700
Sign it.

[Adapted from Zhao Junkai's novel,
Double Track Puzzle]

[Episode 14]

42
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,300
Lu.

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,500
Hu.

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,140
Save your breath.

45
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,180
Why are you here alone?

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,020
Where are they?

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,260
They're running some errands for me.

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,780
Come on.

49
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,700
Have some tea.

50
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,060
Thanks.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,540
Do you need them for anything?

52
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,500
I assumed you were out of the medicine,

53
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,580
and I had been very busy,

54
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,380
so I thought maybe they could fetch it.

55
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,820
Well, you're always

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,300
looking out for me.

57
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,340
Happy to.

58
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,700
You know what?

59
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,060
The medicine

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,420
is indeed effective.

61
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,740
Effective how?

62
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,700
Well, I feel

63
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,340
better physically.

64
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,100
But mentally,

65
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,740
I feel a bit awkward.

66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,980
Why?

67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,340
Something came up again?

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,780
Is it big?

69
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,500
I didn't expect it to happen

70
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,860
but it's kind of a good thing.

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,340
What does it mean?

72
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,620
Good or bad, it's only trivial.

73
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,260
The meeting tomorrow

74
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,500
is what matters now.

75
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,340
You and I should take on
two different tasks.

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,780
You and Crewcut

77
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,580
go and meet Qi Lianshan.

78
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,060
Remember,

79
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,460
Qi Lianshan

80
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,860
is the key figure in my next move.

81
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,620
If this works,

82
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,820
you

83
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,220
can return to your clinic.

84
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,420
Promise?

85
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,860
I'll take a good rest then.

86
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,260
Get ready for the big day.

87
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,460
Crewcut said that you

88
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,420
constantly changed the ingredients
in my prescription.

89
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,300
That's sure.

90
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,540
Small adjustments are a must.

91
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,460
Trust me.

92
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,620
Give me the prescription.

93
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,700
They are all common.

94
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,580
You can find them in any pharmacy.

95
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,900
Boss,

96
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,860
shall I

97
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,060
deliver it?

98
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,940
The big day is around the corner.

99
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,020
From now on,

100
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,340
no one leaves

101
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,460
until we all set off tomorrow.

102
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,860
Understood.

103
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,580
Do you know why he's called Sickly Dou?

104
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,620
This lad

105
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,580
is a psycho.

106
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,540
He couldn't maintain his foothold

107
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,940
after having a grudge with me,

108
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,100
so he went to the northwestern area.

109
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,220
He got himself a handgun

110
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,700
and a shotgun there.

111
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,380
After he came back,
he found shelter under a drug lord

112
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,420
called Boss Tan.

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,820
You probably have never heard of him.

114
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,820
He's one of the Tan family
from the south.

115
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,740
Sickly Dou

116
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,380
should have remained loyal,

117
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,300
but on the contrary,
he banged Tan's wife.

118
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,300
Tan was outrageous

119
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,500
and wanted Dou dead.

120
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,820
That's how

121
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,180
Sanmahu saved Dou.

122
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,580
Sanmahu is literally Dou's savior.

123
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,220
Why did Bai Taohua do that?

124
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,900
It's not like Sickly Dou
is hot or something.

125
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,020
For love, maybe?

126
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,740
Love?

127
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,380
That's the least possible reason.

128
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
I heard

129
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,460
Qi Lianshan killed Boss Tan

130
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,580
because of her.

131
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,420
I'll tell you what.

132
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,220
This woman

133
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,420
had an uncle

134
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,980
called Bai.

135
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,900
He used to work

136
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,020
for Boss Tan,

137
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,260
his right-hand man.

138
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,740
But they fell out with each other.
Nobody knows why.

139
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,100
And he never came back.

140
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,460
Bai Taohua, in a crucial moment,

141
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,820
backstabbed Boss Tan.

142
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,820
Later, she found shelter
under Qi Lianshan

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,420
and now, Sanmahu.

144
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,380
So tell me,

145
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,820
is this love?

146
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,580
An unruly

147
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,300
psycho

148
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,860
and a ruthless betrayer.

149
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,460
They make a good match.

150
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,940
This man,

151
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,140
Sanmahu, has always been cautious.

152
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,260
This is so not like him.

153
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,780
This is what I admire the most
about Sanmahu.

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,500
He thinks, in this whole world,

155
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,940
he's the most capable man.

156
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,620
Other people played dumb
to take advantage of him,

157
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,500
and he actually thought they were dumb.

158
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,100
This is who he is.

159
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,580
Drink up.

160
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,860
Master,

161
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
we heard from the pharmacy.

162
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,340
Sanmahu and Hua Long

163
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,940
will meet the mastermind tomorrow.

164
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,740
In person.

165
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,980
Got it.

166
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,140
Where are you going?

167
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,580
We're in the middle of a feast.

168
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,340
I owe you one.

169
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,300
Keep an eye out around here.

170
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,700
After we arrest Sanmahu,

171
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,980
I'll treat you to another feast.

172
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,820
OK.

173
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,620
Come again.

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,340
Hua Long,

175
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,660
whose real name is Gao Yunlong,

176
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
graduated
from a technical secondary school.

177
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,420
His parents used to work
in the Textile No.2 Mill

178
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,820
but passed away long ago.

179
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
He and Maozi,

180
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,580
Mao Zhenfeng,

181
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
were childhood friends.

182
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
They were very close.

183
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,900
Maozi's mother

184
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,220
is Hua Long's godmother.

185
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,100
According to
some former employees of the Mill,

186
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,700
Hua Long

187
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,820
is quite ambitious

188
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,180
and bold.

189
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
He craves

190
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,820
money desperately.

191
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,260
In the 1990s,

192
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,860
he talked Maozi into quitting
the job in the Mill.

193
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,660
The two of them

194
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,540
worked side by side,

195
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,340
and they invested in stock

196
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,740
with money collected
from illegal fundraising.

197
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,460
They lent loans with the profit,

198
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,660
and continued
to dive into the stock market

199
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,780
after collecting the debts.

200
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,140
Their assets accumulated quickly.

201
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,180
But the stock market

202
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
had always been unpredictable.

203
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,580
In 1998,

204
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,700
[Hua Long]
he became heavily in debt and vanished.

205
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,140
He never showed his face

206
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,460
until 2001,

207
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,820
and he got rich.

208
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,780
He not only paid off all his debts

209
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,500
but also

210
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,700
gave Maozi's mother

211
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,700
a life of ease and comfort.

212
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,220
Drugs have flooded Xiatong

213
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,020
since that year.

214
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,700
Before that,

215
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,740
drug was rarely seen there.

216
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,820
Dagou and Ergou have been arrested,

217
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,300
and Maozi is dead.

218
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,260
Not to mention, Sanmahu

219
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,780
is trying to take over the market.

220
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,460
Hua Long is too proud.

221
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,780
He won't accept the current situation.

222
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,700
The person behind him

223
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,820
won't bear

224
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,220
with such a worthless man either.

225
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,860
Now that he's crippled,

226
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,820
this is a good chance for us

227
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,060
to stab him in the heart.

228
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,980
Mr. Zhan,

229
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,580
we haven't got him yet.

230
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,380
How are we going to stab him?

231
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,260
The Cyber Unit and Han Xin

232
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,380
sorted out a list

233
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,460
of the drug dealers under Hua Long.

234
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,260
We've got the real identities

235
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,220
of some of them.

236
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,780
What we need to do now

237
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,540
is work with the local police station

238
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,100
and the local TV station

239
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,140
to spread the news

240
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,780
that we have destroyed
their sales channels

241
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,060
and arrested the people involved,

242
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,260
besides issuing
the wanted notice for Hua Long.

243
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,940
To tell the world about it?

244
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,500
What if he manages to flee?

245
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,300
Given Hua Long's situation,

246
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,780
he can only try
to solve it by all means.

247
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,020
Once he tries anything in desperation,

248
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,220
he'll make a mistake.

249
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,660
And his mistake

250
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,660
is what can lead us

251
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,460
to the person behind him.

Don't do anything without my consent.

Sure.

260
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,380
I asked you for something,

261
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
and this mess is what you give me?

262
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,980
Don't blame me for this.

263

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,900
I didn't give you the order,

269
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,260
but this is urgent.

Hua Long and his boss?

Yes.

and verify it with the informer.

284
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,860

No more suggestions.

You assist.

288
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,700
You're too gentle

289
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,980
for people as brutal

290
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,460
as Sanmahu.

291
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,500
You should just focus

292
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,180
on Hua Long.

293
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,700
Do you know

294
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,220
you also look quite brutal now?

295
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,180
How can I let you lead?

296
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,060

297
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,380
I agree.

Mr. Tu is a senior policeman.

His speech may sound intimidating

300
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,660
but he knows
what he can do and what can't.

301
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,980
Moreover,

302
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,180
I don't believe he'll do anything

You're right.

But it has nothing to do
with our reputation.

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,900
Mr. Sanmahu,

386
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,020
thank you.

387
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
Glad to help.

388
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
You had no idea Hua Long tried

389
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,620
to have a meeting with me.

390
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,500
Mr. Jiang

391
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,140
arranged everything tactfully

392
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,940
to avoid the conflicts
between you and me.

393
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,660
Honestly,

394
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,540
even if I hadn't jumped in,

395
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,420
Mr. Jiang

396
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,620
would have taken care

397
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,100
of everything.

398
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,220
I said you were allowed
to make mistakes.

399
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,100
However, correction comes with a cost.

400
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,820
I heard that, to work with us,
Mr. Sanmahu

401
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,380
contacted a big buyer
from the northern frontier.

402
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,540
To express your gratitude
to Mr. Sanmahu,

403
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,100
you should give 30%
of every batch to trade to Mr. Sanmahu.

404
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,940
How's that?

405
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Alright.

406
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
30% that is.

407
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,380
Mr. Jiang,

408
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,860
the buyer at the northern frontier
is a big dealer.

409
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,100
I'm afraid

410
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,020
30% can't meet the demand.

411
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,460
That's all that can be served.

412
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
If they want more,

413
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,420
they can dine in another restaurant.

414
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,580
That's a large group,

415
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,140
and everyone wants a share.

416
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,300
More importantly,

417
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,500
the profit is considerable.

418
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,460
Hello. Please tell.

419
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,980
OK.

420
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,460
Keep watching them.

421
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,100
Mr. Sanmahu,

422
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,740
I assumed your team was tough.

423
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,900
Turns out I thought too highly of them.

424
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,900
They failed to get rid of Hua Long.

425
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,540
What's worse, they got caught

426
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,260
by the police together with Hua Long.

427
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
When did that happen?

428
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,900
Since you've gotten on my boat,

429
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,740
you have to follow my rules.

430
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,420
I don't care
how you work with that buyer.

431
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,420
30% is all you can get

432
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,020
before the problem is solved.

433
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,180
I got it.

434
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,060
Sun,

435
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,780
your man is arrested as well.

436
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,860
Shut him up by all means.

437
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,780
And

438
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,780
the local market
has been sabotaged by the police.

439
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,980
Find a way to restore it.

440
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,420
Or you'll be replaced.

441
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,420
Both of you

442
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,860
only have one chance
to prove yourselves.

443
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,340
Once I decide

444
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,540
that any one of you is failing,

445
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,100
I'll kick you out without hesitation.

446
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,940
This is something

447
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,660
beyond your capability.

448
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,900
Everyone knows the demand is huge
in the north.

449
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,220
Do you know
why no one has ever reached out?

450
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,420
Because they're too hard to deal with.

451
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,860
I'll wait and see how you satisfy them.

452
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,420
It doesn't matter if I can't.

453
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,020
Now, I have you.

454
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,980
OK.

455
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,740
Let's see how this goes.

456
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,380
30%.

457
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,020
Five kilos.

458
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,980
Send your men

459
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,700
to Liangsheng Pharmacy,

460
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,620
which is west of the Ciyin Ally,

461
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,140
at four this afternoon

462
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,980
to fetch the goods.

463
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,260
That's the deal.

464
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,260
I must take care of this mess

465
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,020
right away.

466
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,660
I will

467
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,180
see you soon.

468
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Be safe.

469
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,740
Happy to work with you.

470
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,980
Gao Yunlong, we finally meet.

471
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,740
Let's talk about
what happened in the warehouse.

472
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,500
You lured us over on purpose

473
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,740
for more than just bombing us, right?

474
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,620
Wouldn't tell?

475
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,260
Let's change the subject.

476
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,300
How did Maozi die?

477
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,620
I heard

478
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,660
Maozi's mother is your godmother,

479
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,780
isn't she?

480
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,060
Don't waste your time.

481
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,260
I don't know anything.

482
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,220
I have nothing to tell.

483
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,300
You want nothing but death.

484
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,500
I can understand that.

485
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,860
Any of the crimes you've committed

486
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,180
is serious enough to send you

487
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,340
to the guillotine.

488
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,300
If I were you,

489
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
I'd be so aggrieved.

490
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,060
You were determined to kill Sanmahu,

491
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,180
but you were fooled.

492
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,980
Be it Zheng Xiaoshan or Gao Si,

493
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,780
you never showed mercy
towards any of them.

494
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,780
But you took your godmother with you

495
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,700
when you tried to escape.

496
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
That shows you're not totally rotten.

497
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,060
You took the risk today

498
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,940
to earn yourself a chance to live,
right?

499
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,940
And to avenge Maozi.

500
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,820
But look around you.

501
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,020
Now everyone knows you're caught.

502
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,860
Do you think

503
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,500
she can live?

504
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,180
I wanted you to take the blame

505
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,540
for what happened in the warehouse.

506
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,620
Maozi

507
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,500
was killed by me.

508
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
The person who gave me the order

509
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,700
is Sun.

510
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,380
He's in charge

511
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,580
of all the goods in Xiatong.

512
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,660
Give me the address.

513
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,840
[Prescription]

514
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,180
The prescription had been crinkled
when it reached you?

515
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,060
Yes.

516
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,220
I was wondering.

517
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,580
The prescription

518
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,260
sent to me by him

519
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,460
had always been tidy.

520
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,220
Why was this one

521
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,940
as crinkled as a piece of garbage?

522
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,700
However,

523
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,500
given the handwriting and the code,

524
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,100
I'm sure this was written by my master.

525
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,500
Was the prescription

526
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,700
delivered by one of the two men
we already know?

527
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,500
No,

528
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,020
a middle-aged man

529
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,980
whom I've never met.

530
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,700
When did he deliver it to you?

531
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,140
Around

532
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,220
9:20 last night.

533
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,900
I was about to close the clinic then.

534
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,180
My master said

535
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,300
nights are dense with Yin,

536
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,340
so we don't take patients after nine.

537
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,940
Are you sure
this is written by your master,

538
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,500
but it isn't delivered
by whom your master assigned?

539
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,220
Do you have an informer there as well?

540
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,020
Dou,

541
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,540
install a camera here.

542
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,460
Keep it as invisible as possible.

543
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,540
If anyone suspicious

544
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,660
comes and deliver the prescription,

545
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,420
call me immediately.

546
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:41,940
OK.

547
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,580
Pay him for the camera.

548
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,060
Here.

549
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,260
It's empty.

550
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,700
It mustn't be long.

551
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,580
She must be taken away

552
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,580
by a car

553
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,740
or people would have noticed it easily

554
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,820
in broad daylight.

555
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,060
Nanyi,

556
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,180
ask around in the east
of the neighborhood.

557
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,540
Focus on the suspicious cars

558
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,620
coming or going in the last two hours.

559
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,300
Gao Buyi,

560
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,980
you cover the west.

561
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,620
Han Xin,

562
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,260
go to the nearest
traffic management department

563
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,460
and request for their assistance.

564
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,660
All of you

565
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,380
pay attention to the details.

566
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,700
Find her.

567
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,180
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,620
How is it going?

569
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,100
Mrs. Mao has been located

570
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,380
and taken in.

571
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,820
But I doubt

572
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,540
that Hua Long
can withstand the interrogation

573
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,140
even if we have his soft spot.

574
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,900
You have no idea. No police

575
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,900
can crack a person

576
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,660
who's sure to be sentenced to death
in a short time.

577
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,060
Not to mention

578
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,260
that Mr. Jiang hopes for more

579
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,980
than just temporarily shutting him up.

580
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,340
It won't be a problem
if he's not taken in.

581
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,780
But now he is in the...

582
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,220
He doesn't have to be killed, does he?

583
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,540
Send him a word.

584
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,980
We promise Mrs. Mao

585
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,140
can live a peaceful life

586
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,380
if he commits suicide in there.

587
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,220
And Mrs. Mao will know

588
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,780
he loves her very much.

589
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,060
But if he

590
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,660
refuses to do so,

591
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,220
Mrs. Mao

592
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,740
will definitely die before him,

593
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,700
and before she dies,

594
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,140
she will be told,

595
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,060
in detail,

596
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,820
who he really is.

597
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,540
Sun,

598
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,460
to me,

599
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,820
if he's one of us,

600
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,460
I will do anything

601
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,420
to get him out.

602
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,340
I swear.

603
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,940
But you know,

604
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,820
Hua Long has betrayed us long ago,

605
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,380
and he's beyond saving,

606
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,380
you understand me?

607
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,260
Yeah.

608
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,260
Well, I

609
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,820
will send someone reliable

610
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,660
to tell Hua Long that.

611
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,820
Send Sheng.

612
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,380
That lad

613
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,860
is smart

614
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,660
and ambitious.

615
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,220
The point is

616
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,060
that he has many more soft spots

617
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,420
than Hua Long.

618
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,940
He doesn't dare to defy us.

619
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,500
OK.

620
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,940
I'll send him.

621
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,020
Oh, right, Mr. Han.

622
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,140
Are we really giving our goods
to Sanmahu?

623
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,100
Since he wants it,

624
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,060
just give it to him.

625
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,580
The hard part is not getting the goods,

626
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,460
but trading them for money.

627
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,020
Now that

628
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,940
he's busy handling his own business,

629
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,820
we'll be able to pull some strings.

630
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,620
At your service.

631
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,660
Well,

632
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,580
ask our friends at the northern frontier

633
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,420
to find out
who's buying this batch of goods

634
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,260
and where they are.

635
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,340
Address. Not location.

636
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,780
Got it.

637
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,500
Off you go then.

638
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,420
OK.

639
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm on it.

640
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,740
I don't care

641
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,660
how you got away with the police.

642
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,100
You standing in front of me

643
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,740
is the big problem here.

644
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,620
How can you be sure

645
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,300
that no police were following you?

646
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,420
Boss, I jumped into the river

647
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,340
and took a detour.

648
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,580
No one was tailing me.

649
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,380
Don't worry.

650
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,060
With the last lesson learned,

651
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,900
today's plan

652
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,460
was planned and implemented

653
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,060
with great caution.

654
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,300
Only four people know about it.

655
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,060
No one could send out the news

656
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,620
except you and Dou.

657
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,380
What do you mean?

658
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,340
I'm badly hurt and almost died there.

659
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,740
And Dou

660
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,740
went all out to fight the police

661
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,180
to get me out.

662
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,820
I don't even know
if he can make it alive.

663
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,780
We're not stupid enough

664
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,380
to risk our lives for it.

665
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,820
You're suspecting us.

666
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,180
Last time, the Farm Stay was surrounded.

667
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,500
This time, Dou is caught.

668
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,180
How could the police know everything?

669
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,620
How did they find out?

670
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,300
There must be a mole inside us

671
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,700
working with the police

672
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,540
and targeting us.

673
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,260
I have to find the mole.

674
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,140
Is he targeting me, huh?

675
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,580
They'll have to pay with death.

676
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,300
This is tricky indeed.

677
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Normally,

678
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,620
since we knew Hua Long was coming at us,

679
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,940
we weren't supposed to go there.

680
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,220
Why did we take a huge risk
to kill Hua Long?

681
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,260
This was a suicidal action.

682
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,460
Mr. Jiang demanded.

683
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,540
Just see it as a proof of loyalty.

684
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,180
A proof of loyalty?

685
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,700
Are we going to work with someone else

686
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,820
besides Qi Lianshan?

687
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,060
They are not the same.

688
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,660
In this line of work,

689
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,340
there are many people

690
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,660
like Qi Lianshan.

691
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,420
But there's no one else

692
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,260
like Mr. Jiang.

693
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,000
[JIANG]

694
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,360
[Just found proof about your mole.
Key word, prescription.]

695
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,700
I knew something was wrong
with that old man.

696
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,340
Since the first day I met him.

697
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,020
You're like Sanmahu.

698
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,660
Both of you
think too highly of yourselves.

699
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,020
You thought you knew everything.

700
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,860
It wasn't him who tipped us.

701
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,540
Only a handful of people knew about it.

702
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,860
If it wasn't him,

703
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,180
who else could it be?

704
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,180
What's so funny?

705
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,660
Did it ever cross your mind

706
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,340
that the woman you trusted so much

707
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,700
would backstab you?

708
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,860
What are you trying to say?

709
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,940
When we got you in just now,

710
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,700
we especially showed you around.

711
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,460
Among all those people outside,

712
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,900
was she there?

713
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,660
Back in the warehouse,

714
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,660
if we didn't let her go on purpose,

715
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,700
do you think she could escape?

716
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,740
Tu Hongjiang,

717
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,580
listen to your own nonsense.

718
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,300
Do you think I'll buy it?

719
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,460
If you think I'm making this all up,

720
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,220
just treat it as a funny story then.

721
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,220
You and she are so close.

722
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,620
You must know

723
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,900
how she worked

724
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,340
with Qi Lianshan

725
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,700
to take Boss Tan down.

726
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,180
Qi Lianshan,

727
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,260
what are you trying to say?

728
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,980
She just wanted to be with you.

729
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,740
Disregard the cost,

730
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,580
from the northern frontier to here,

731
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,340
she was doing this
all because she was attracted to you.

732
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,460
If you think so,

733
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,900
that's not bad.

734
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,740
But do you think so?

735
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
What are you implying?

736
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,940
Stop beating around the bush.

737
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,620
Given your reaction,

738
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,300
what I said isn't a story.

739
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,620
If you want the truth,

740
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,300
just show us your card.

741
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,700
You know well

742
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,260
what I want to hear.

743
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,620
Keep dreaming.

744
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,780
No rush.

745
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,020
Taohua is out there enjoying herself.

746
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,380
You just stay here

747
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,260
and suffer.

748
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,140
Where was I?

749
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,780
The proof of loyalty.

750
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,220
Man, what you just said

751
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,180
makes sense.

752
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,420
Since Mr. Jiang

753
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,220
wanted to work with us,

754
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,060
I understand
why he carried out such a plan

755
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,940
that could kill
two birds with one stone.

756
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,020
For one thing,

757
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,100
it could silence Hua Long.

758
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,180
For the other,

759
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,220
this could be our proof of loyalty.

760
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,420
What makes me worried

761
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,100
is that he's aiming for something else.

762
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,220
We might be

763
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,780
his bargaining chip
in his negotiation with others.

764
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,660
If that's the case,

765
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,980
the police's appearance will make sense.

766
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,100
Boss,

767
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,300
if everyone in our team is clean,

768
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,740
the mole can only be Mr. Jiang.

769
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,980
We must stay alert,

770
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,540
right?

771
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,180
Our priority

772
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,940
is establishing cooperation
with Qi Lianshan,

773
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,980
so when anything happens,

774
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,820
we'll have the chance

775
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,500
to turn the tables.

776
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,540
However,

777
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,020
Qi Lianshan

778
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,980
is asking for too much.

779
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,860
In today's negotiation,

780
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,300
he insisted on ten kilograms.

781
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,700
Now we only have five.

782
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,860
I'm afraid

783
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,380
he won't be satisfied.

784
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,380
I'll make it up to him with money.

785
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,540
A ten percent discount.

786
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,540
Tell him,

787
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,780
this is a trial trade.

788
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,380
If we make a successful first trade,

789
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,940
I'll give him 15 kg.

790
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,860
OK.

791
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,540
I'll talk to him with Crewcut tomorrow.

792
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,460
Hua,

793
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,860
be patient.

794
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,620
Go back and rest.

795
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,180
Dou...

796
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,140
I'll find a way to save him.

797
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,180
There is something

798
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
I'd like to verify

799
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,540
in the coming several days.

800
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,980
Stay indoors

801
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,140
until I tell you otherwise.
