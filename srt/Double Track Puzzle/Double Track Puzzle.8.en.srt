00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,580
Master.

2
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,740
Time for your medicine.

3
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,260
Alright.

4
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,100
I know

5
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,820
my time is up.

6
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,700
Don't trouble yourself.

7
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,900
Master,

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,340
please don't say that.

9
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,940
The medicine will fix you up.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,180
Here.

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,740
Everyone

12
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,020
meets this day eventually.

13
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,620
It's no big deal.

14
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,300
But

15
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,780
there's one thing

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,100
I just can't let go of.

17
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,860
Master.

18
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,220
It was

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,380
not your fault.

20
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,220
It was Sanmahu's.

21
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,260
He was born defiant

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,220
and crooked.

23
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,300
That's why he caused such a disaster.

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,540
It was my fault too.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,660
I wasn't capable enough

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,340
to stop him.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,300
No.

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,140
I was the fool.

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,580
Back then,

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,060
I only saw his talent,

31
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,860
but overlooked his character.

32
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,060
I took in that wretch.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,980
And

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,780
it led to disaster.

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,500
Now,

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,140
I want to make amends,

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,380
but it's too late.

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,860
Among

39
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,060
my disciples,

40
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,740
only you

41
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,420
can handle Sanmahu.

42
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,100
So I can only

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,300
entrust this to you.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,140
I know

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,940
you've walked away from the line.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,700
And I

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,740
shouldn't ask this of you.

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,420
Master,

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,180
don't say that.

50
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,940
A master

51
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,180
is like a father for life.

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,500
This is

53
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,380
my duty.

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,260
That was close.

58
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,700
Really, just by a hair.

59
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,060
Good thing I spotted that wire in time.

60
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,020
Don't move!

61
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,180
Since you knew it was a trap,

62
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,580
why detonate it?

63
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,220
Since they set it up,

64
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,820
it can't just be about luring us here.

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,660
They wouldn't take such a big risk

66
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,860
without a reason.

67
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,460
Until we figure it out,

68
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
we play along with their game.

69
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,580
Everyone, attention.

70
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,860
Prepare to detonate.

71
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,020
Take cover.

72
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,660
Having quite the thrill, huh?

73
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,140
Like you're 007 or something.

74
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,860
What if something went wrong

75
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,660
and you all died in there?

76
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,020
How would you explain?

77
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,340
Tu is right.

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,220
You're gambling with lives.

79
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,180
Why did you have to detonate it?

80
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,620
Mr. Xiong.

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,100
First,

82
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,420
I could guarantee our people's safety.

83
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,780
Second, I checked the site.

84
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,740
No civilians around.

85
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,580
But then again,

86
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,340
why would they take such a risk?

87
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,780
They even used bombs.

88
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,540
And they stacked all that flour inside.

89
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,180
What are they so desperate about?

90
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,860
I'd say some kind of pressure

91
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,420
forced them into this.

92
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,100
My conclusion is,

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,620
they urgently need this explosion

94
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,780
to relieve that pressure.

95
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,140
So how do we turn this around?

96
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,540
We play along.

97
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,660
Throw up a smokescreen

98
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,940
and let their guard down.

99
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,380
And

100
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,900
it's a perfect plan.

101
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,740
They don't even know
Dagou's been caught.

102
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,260
No.

103
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,860
Absolutely not.

104
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,900
Are you addicted to taking risks?

105
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,700
You think you'll always be this lucky?

106
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,780
Using Dagou as bait?

107
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,660
Don't forget what happened with Gao Si!

108
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,860
I think it's solid.

109
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,500
None of your business.

110
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,300
This case has nothing to do with you.

111
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,780
Of course it is.

112
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,900
That Long guy

113
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,100
sent Mao

114
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,180
to take on Sickly Dou.

115
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,380
Sickly Dou is Sanmahu's lackey.

116
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,900
If it's tied to Sanmahu,
it is my case.

117
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,860
Am I persuasive?

118
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,580
I'll say it again.

119
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,500
No way!

120
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,260
Don't forget.

121
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,460
We're still carrying
that ticking time bomb of Gao Si.

122
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,980
If we throw Dagou
into another risky play

123
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,180
and something goes wrong,

124
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,220
we'll have two bombs blowing up at once!

125
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,220
You don't even have stars
on your uniform.

126
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,380
Why are you...

127
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,780
Why are you so timid?

128
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,020
If they blow, I'll take responsibility.

129
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,460
You take responsibility?

130
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,140
With what?
How many stars do you have?

131
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,100
We can't be sure if Dagou

132
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,060
is telling the truth.

133
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,580
And we don't even know

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,540
if Dragon Unleashed knows

135
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,580
he's been caught.

136
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,140
If we risk Dagou now

137
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,260
and something goes wrong,

138
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,780
it could trigger a chain reaction
beyond control.

139
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,620
If the bomb goes off,

140
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,060
no one can handle it.

141
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,980
Hello? Mr. Sun.

142
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm really sorry.

143
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,900
The cops have been
watching us too closely lately.

144
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,580
I had no idea the warehouse
would get blown up.

145
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,340
If I'd known,

146
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,780
even if I were inside,

147
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,540
I wouldn't have leave our goods there.

148
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,140
You've been too careless.

149
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,220
Mr. Sun,

150
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,900
but there's good news.

151
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,780
We've set up

152
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,180
all the drop chats.

153
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,220
From now on,
moving goods will be smooth.

154
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Then I'll give you one last chance.

155
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,540
But this time,  we do it by the rules.

156
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,260
You two cover

157
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,060
half the losses for this batch.

158
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,380
Understood.

159
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,460
I know the rules.

160
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,540
Since the drop chats are ready,

161
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,980
put them to work right away.

162
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,700
There's a batch coming tomorrow.

163
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,700
You'll pick it up.

164
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,020
After you get the goods,

165
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,220
keep your cut for distribution,

166
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,860
and bring me the rest

167
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,740
along with your share

168
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,660
of the compensation.

169
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,460
Understood.

170
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,620
Please rest assured.

171
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,420
Long, you just

172
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,620
agreed to that?

173
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,060
Half the payment.

174
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
Where are we supposed to get that?

175
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,820
We've got to find Sickly Dou.

176
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,460
Only then

177
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,340
can we fix this.

178
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,020
Understand?

179
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,940
Yes, yes.

180
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,980
Well, I'll go now.

181
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
I'll turn Xiatong upside down

182
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,140
to find those two!

183
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,100
Wait!

184
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,180
Always rushing in.

185
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,660
What's the hurry?

186
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,820
What's wrong?

187
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,140
First, we pick up Mr. Sun's goods.

188
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,780
Only with the goods in hand

189
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,260
do we have leverage to buy time

190
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,380
to find Sickly Dou.

191
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,580
Right.

192
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,660
Then here's the plan.

193
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,700

on the train again.

Of course I'm eager.

217
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,220
It's because you can't handle it.

these two uncertainties,

394

395

398

399
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,060
Make sure you're well prepared

400
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,580
and go all in.

401
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Wasn't this already discussed?

402
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,220
Mr. Xiong,

403
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,260
the fact that they're openly
assigning tasks

404
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,180
means

405
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,580
Dagou hasn't been exposed.

406
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,700
Well.

407
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,020
Even if, in worst-case scenario,

408
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,820
they did start to doubt Dagou,

409
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,260
they're still giving him the task.

410
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,380
What does that mean?

411
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,340
They're in a rush.

412
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,740
No time to find new people.

413
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,940
So they're taking a risk.

414
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,140
Under that kind of pressure,

415
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,620
they're likely to slip up.

416
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,140
And

417
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,820
that makes it easier for us.

418
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,700
Mr. Xiong,

419
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,860
after what happened yesterday,

420
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,700
they're still choosing to
make the handoff on the train.

421
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,860
What does that tell us?

422
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,340
Do they not know it's a risk?

423
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,740
What's drawing them in?

424
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,620
Or

425
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,900
what's forcing them?

426
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,260
Outlaws can take those risks.

427
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,020
We can't.

428
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,140
Like I said,

429
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,020
we've got too many
ticking bombs already.

430
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,380
We can't handle that.

431
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,340
We all want to crack the case.

432
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,500
But only if we're still alive,

433
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,540
can we keep investigating.

434
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,100
If the bomb goes off and we're gone,

435
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,340
how do we investigate then?

436
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,340
It's not that I don't support your idea.

437
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,580
I just can't.

438
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,740
If something else goes wrong,

439
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,460
I won't be able to handle it,

440
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,380
and I won't be able to protect you guys.

441
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,100
Mr. Xiong,

442
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,180
I understand your point.

443
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,060
But we've done all the groundwork.

444
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,460
This is the final push.

445
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,700
As long as we get something out of it,

446
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,020
we'll defuse

447
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
both the Zheng Xiaoshan

448
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,220
and Gao Si bombs.

449
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,620
Personally, I think

450
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,260
defusing bombs is more meaningful
than avoiding an explosion.

451
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,540
Mr. Xiong,

452
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,220
before I came here,

453
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,260
I reported to Mr. Sun.

454
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,300
He also thinks it's risky,

455
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,540
but he said

456
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,460
this is a whole

458
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,380
If we can find a breakthrough
to uproot it entirely,

459
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,780
then it's worth the risk.

460
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,820
Since Mr. Sun sees it that way,

461
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,780
then fine.

462
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,140

463
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,180

464
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,540
But

465
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,500
Dagou's safety must be guaranteed.

466
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,820

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:18,900
Alright then.

572
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,500
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

573
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,180
Don't mention it.

574
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,700
No big deal.

575
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,340
I'm leaving.

576
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,940
Want a tangerine?

577
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,380
Nah.

578
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,140
Those things cause heat.

579
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,540
You have it.

580
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,460
Alright. Go ahead.

581
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,620
Take care.

582
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,700
We'll be in touch.

583
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
The fish is here.

584
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,220
I'll make the first move.

585
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,020
You find the right moment to strike.

586
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,500
Pretty sure that's my job.

587
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,300
You burned me!

588
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,420
You scalded me!

589
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,100
- Who burned you?
- Trying to run?

590
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,060
Get your eyes focused

591
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,940
before you start talking, alright?

592
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,060
Who burned you?

593
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,420
She did!

594
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,740
Why you being so rough with a woman?

595
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,740
I pushed you?

596
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,860
I'm a victim here too!

597
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,260
What are you yelling for?

598
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,220
You punk!

599
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,260
Hey, both of you.

600
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,780
It's not easy being out here.

601
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,940
Cool off.

602
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,300
Are you blind?

603
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,780
What do you mean?

604
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,580
Sir, don't leave.

605
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,500
She's a woman.

606
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,380
What's your deal with her?

607
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,860
If you've got guts, come at me.

608
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,380
My bad.

609
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm sorry. Alright?

610
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,540
Didn't know you two were together.

611
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,100
Here, take some tissues.

612
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,260
Sorry about that. Bye.

613
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,100
What a mess.

614
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,220
Hey, Mao.

615
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,660
What's going on?

616
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,220
Nothing.

617
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,900
Just ran into some lunatic.

618
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,820
It's fine now.

619
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,020
Do you still have the goods?

620
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,340
The stuff is here.

621
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,740
You sure?

622
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,260
Oh no.

623
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,300
It's been swapped.

624
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,900
There's a straw inside.

625
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,340
Those from the northern frontier again.

626
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,300
What do we do now?

627
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,420
Mao,

628
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,540
where are you?

629
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,700
I can't see you.

630
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,620
It's not easy being out here.

631
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,780
Cool off.

632
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,540
You...

633
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
You burned me!

634
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,860
You scalded me!

635
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,220
Excuse me.

636
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:22,860
Gao Buyi.

637
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,100
Take Team One

638
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,620
and keep close watch
on that deaf-mute girl.

639
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,660
Team Two,

640
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,820
tail the bald guy.

641
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,500
Speak.

642
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,380
My side's confirmed clear.

643
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,020
Excuse me.

644
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:17,980
Hello?

645
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,340
Spotted a big guy.

646
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,380
He's tailing the girl too.

647
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
But I can't see his face.

648
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Could be Mao.

649
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,700
Find a chance to catch him.

650
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,220
Got it.

651
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,060
Beer, soft drinks, and mineral water.

652
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,300
Excuse me. Let me through.

653
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,780
Move aside.

654
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,660
What are you doing here?

655
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,060
And what are you doing here?

656
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,060
You tell me.

657
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,940
I've got business.

658
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,860
Hello?

659
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,780
Lost the target.

660
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,580
Block both ends. Find her!

661
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,580
Make way.

662
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,580
Beer, soft drinks, and mineral water.

663
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,620
Peanuts, sunflower seeds,
and eight-treasure porridge.

664
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,300
[Restroom]

665
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,820
The stuff is here.

666
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,260
My job's done, right?

667
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,660
Target's in sight.

668
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,860
Wait until Mr. Qian and Sickly Dou

669
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,820
split up before moving in.

670
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,860
Keep an eye on them for now.

671
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,580
Check if there are
other accomplices around.

672
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,180
Remember,

673
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,300
we need to

674
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,980
make Sanmahu doubt Mr. Qian less.

675
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,500
Alright. Got it.

676
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,220
The platform's already secured.

677
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,140
Try to do it after they get off.

678
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,220
Do not lose sight of them.

679
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,180
You old fool.

680
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,420
Do you even know what you stole?

681
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,860
Heroin.

682
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
A full kilo of it.

683
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,060
You're involved with drugs now.

684
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,460
There's no walking away from this.

685
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,940
Attention all passengers.

686
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,740
The train is now
approaching the station.

687
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,540
Please take your belongings

688
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,020
and get off in an orderly manner.

689
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,260
It's on fire!

690
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,700
Fire!

691
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,420
Let's go!

692
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,460
Move!

693
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,580
Stay calm, everyone!

694
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,540
We're police!

695
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Cover your nose and mouth
with your clothes!

696
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,540
Bend down and follow the people
in front of you!

697
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,780
Move!

698
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,820
What are you doing?

699
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,460
Go!

700
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,740
Run!

701
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,420
No pushing! Evacuate in order!

702
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,820
Go!

703
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,740
Hurry!

704
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,620
Run!

705
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,180
Out of my way!

706
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,220
Wu!

707
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,500
Are you okay?

708
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,300
I'm fine.

709
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,300
He went that way. Go after him!

710
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,060
Hang in there.

711
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,300
Don't move.

712
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,780
Mr. Tu, Wu's hurt.

713
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,380
Go check on him.

714
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,980
I'll go after that guy.

715
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,340
He jumped off at the freight area.

716
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,020
Go after him!

717
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,460
Yes, sir!

718
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:30,980
Wu,

719
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,980
stay in the hospital for a while.

720
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,140
Mr. Tu, I'm fine.

721
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Don't let all this blood fool you.

722
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,460
I got checked.

723
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,380
The cut's not deep.

724
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,260
By the way,

725
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,700
don't tell anyone about Mr. Qian.

726
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,340
Don't worry, Mr. Tu.

727
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,700
I know the drill.

728
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,500
Well,

729
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,180
I won't even answer

730
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:46,940
if my mom calls these days.

731
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,780
You should still check in
to reassure her.

732
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,940
Don't make your family worry.

733
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
I'll put in for leave from the team.

734
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,500
I'll say you're recovering.

735
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,300
Oh, meanwhile,

736
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,860
you can keep an eye on the clinic.

737
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,660
Report anything unusual.

738
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,340
Got it.

739
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,460
I'm leaving, Mr. Tu.

740
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,140
Take it easy.

741
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,900
Mr. Tu, hold up.

742
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,700
Is he okay?

743
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,780
Nothing serious.

744
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:09,980
And you?

745
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,980
Did you catch the guy?

746
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,140
Yeah, we caught the guy.

747
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,180
The goods were on the thief.

748
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,540
But he got away.

749
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,900
The stuff stayed behind.

750
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,620
Here, you take it.

751
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,820
No use to me anyway.

752
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,940
With this,

753
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,340
you've got

754
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,740
both the thief and the evidence.

755
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,260
Mr. Tu,

756
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,940
how did this end up on some thief?

757
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,140
How should I know?

758
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,620
Seriously?

759
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,780
Aren't you gonna say thanks?

760
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Thanks, Mr. Tu.

761
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,580
You're finally back.

762
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,740
What do you mean?

763
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,860
I'm asking you?

764
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,260
Hands off him.

765
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,100
Back off!

766
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,220
Why did you set me up?

767
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,180
Why?

768
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,700
What are you really after?

769
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,220
Just baiting the hook

770
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,500
to catch a bigger fish.

771
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,860
Changfeng,

772
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,260
this is what Master taught us back then.

773
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,940
We've been apart for so many years.

774
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,340
Asking you to buy a ticket

775
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,500
isn't too much, is it?

776
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,100
Nonsense!

777
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,620
Master never taught us

778
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,100
to blindfold others to do the job!

779
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,860
Times have changed.

780
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,180
Things

781
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,180
aren't like they were before.

782
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,180
You've got to understand me.

783
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,540
Relax.

784
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,300
The cops didn't see you.

785
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,780
And my guys

786
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,980
won't be talking.

787
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,740
You won't have any trouble.

788
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,660
What do you mean?

789
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,460
You're threatening me?

790
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,700
Changfeng,

791
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,660
you've got to help me.

792
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,900
Don't worry.

793
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,940
Just help me put down roots in Xiatong

794
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,740
and open up that route
to the northern frontier.

795
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,500
After that, you can
go wherever you want.

796
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,660
Stay or leave, it's up to you.

797
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,580
You have my word.

798
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,140
Have a drink.

799
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,700
Calm your nerves.

800
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,500
Come on.

801
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,260
Hope you keep your word.

802
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,060
Deal.

803
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,620
You're always looking down on everyone,

804
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,420
acting all high and mighty.

805
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,940
Mr. Qian trusted you with the stuff.

806
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,620
So where is it?

807
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,620
Where?

808
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,460
Sir.

809
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,020
This is on me.

810
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,860
But I had no idea the cops
would suddenly...

811
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,100
Save your excuses!

812
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,220
I know exactly

813
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,060
what happened!

814
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,860
If the cops just turn a blind eye,

815
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,740
what do I need you for?

816
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,500
Anyone could do your job!

817
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,060
Everyone!

818
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,980
Aren't you supposed to be capable?

819
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,820
Don't make me doubt

820
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,860
my judgment of you.

821
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,300
Sir, don't worry.

822
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,100
This will never happen again.

823
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,780
Sir,

824
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,620
you've got my respect.

825
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,380
You've got his respect.

826
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,340
You've got the respect!

827
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,620
Changfeng,

828
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,700
let me be honest.

829
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,500
Here,

830
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,580
every one of us

831
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,300
truly respects you.

832
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,460
We're just thankful

833
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,860
you came back safe.

834
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,100
Building something

835
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,220
isn't easy.

836
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,780
Li Daming,

837
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,300
how long have you been with Mao?

838
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,540
Over eight years.

839
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,660
Why?

840
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,220
Aside from that bunch
from the northern frontier,

841
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,860
do you have any other enemies?

842
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,220
The kind with the guts

843
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,380
and the means to snatch your goods?

844
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:15,980
No.

845
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,460
There used to be.

846
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,980
But they've all been taken care of.

847
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,540
Now, except for a few

848
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,220
petty dealers sneaking around,

849
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,820
nobody dares touch this business.

850
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,340
As long as it's Mr. Mao...

851
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,740
As long as it's Mao

852
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,580
handling the pickup,

853
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,220
nothing ever goes wrong.

854
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,380
What's wrong?

855
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,140
Did you not catch him?

856
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,780
Do you know how much risk I took

857
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,220
to work with you guys?

858
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,940
I don't care about myself!

859
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,980
But I care about my brother!

860
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,620
Those people

861
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,420
will do anything!

862
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,620
Nowhere is safe for him.

863
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,620
You get that?

864
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,580
Now I've crossed them.

865
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,340
They'll never let my brother go!

866
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,260
Li Daming,

867
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,140
without what happened today,

868
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,260
they would find out

869
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,220
you were caught eventually.

870
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,700
You think they'd believe
you stayed quiet

871
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,780
after being caught?

872
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,500
Once they know,

873
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,020
do you think your brother
will ever be safe again?

874
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,820
When you took that first step,

875
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,140
you should've prepared for the worst.

876
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,060
I promise you, before Mao's gang

877
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,300
is brought down,

878
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,340
we'll do everything we can

879
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,020
to keep your brother safe.

880
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,580
Long.

881
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,220
Where have you been?

882
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,820
You didn't answer the phone

883
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,460
or messages.

884
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,380
What happened?

885
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,060
Long,

886
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,860
I didn't get the goods back.

887
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,380
Well,

888
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,820
Dagou got caught by the cops.

889
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,820
Now I'm on their radar too.

890
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,740
I barely made it back.

891
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,020
And the goods?

892
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,380
Where are the goods?

893
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,900
The goods...

894
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:34,740
I...

895
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,700
I figure

896
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,340
the guys from the northern frontier
must've taken them.

897
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,900
After Dagou got the goods,

898
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,420
he ran into a bunch of guys
making trouble.

899
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,420
He checked

900
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,580
and found out the goods were fake.

901
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,940
There was a straw inside.

902
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,860
That was definitely a provocation.

903
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,900
What about Dagou?

904
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,220
What happened to him?

905
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,860
I saw him get caught by the cops

906
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,140
at the station.

907
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,340
He's done for.

908
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,140
Wait,

909
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,260
are you okay, Long?

910
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:02,620
Here's the plan.

911
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,340
Go home

912
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,380
and get your mother.

913
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
Get as far away as you can.

914
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,380
You hear me?

915
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:07,980
What about you?

916
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,820
I'll buy some time here.

917
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,300
If things go south,

918
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,700
I'll have to run.

919
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,700
Don't worry about me.

920
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,780
Just go!

921
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,260
But Long,

922
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,460
you're the smart one.

923
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,140
Think of something else.

924
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,780
There's gotta be another way.

925
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,300
What way?

926
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,420
Wait around here to die?

927
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,100
Go! Just go!

928
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,220
Wait, Long.

929
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,820
You're gonna take this all
on yourself, aren't you?

930
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,100
I'm telling you,

931
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,060
if we run, we run together.

932
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,820
If we die, we die together.

933
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,940
What is there to be afraid of?

934
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,420
I...

935
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,460
Hello, Mr. Sun.

936
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,700
Something happened?

937
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,700
Something happened?

938
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,700
On the train?

939
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,660
Nah.

940
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,260
Mao's not back yet.

941
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,460
I'll call him right now.

942
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,100
The supplier's courier got caught.

943
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,020
What happened?

944
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,060
Wait.

945
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,300
Does that mean Mao's in trouble too?

946
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,460
Mr. Sun,

947
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,620
this has nothing to do with me.

948
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,020
I wouldn't dare collude with the cops

949
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,460
even if you gave me a hundred chances.

950
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,220
Could it be the supplier

951
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,700
that's

952
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,860
the problem?

953
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,220
Maybe they set us up?

954
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,820
The supplier set us up?

955
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,860
They move huge volumes.

956
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,900
Why would they bother
with our small batch?

957
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,820
Are you brain-dead?

958
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,500
Mr. Sun,

959
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,140
I really don't know what's going on.

960
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:23,740
Look,

961
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,140
I'll look into it right now

962
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,380
and report back to you, alright?

963
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,620
This thing's blown wide open.

964
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,060
What do we do now?

965
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,660
I bought us some time with Mr. Sun.

966
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,260
He won't come after us right away.

967
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Let's use this window

968
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,340
to get out of here together.

969
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,340
Stop standing there!

970
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,300
Go pack our stuff now!

971
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,660
Okay, okay!

972
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,220
Long, all packed.

973
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,260
Hurry.

974
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,180
Move.

975
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,380
Long!

976
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,180
Mr. Sun, I'm sorry.

977
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,540
This is all on me.

978
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,940
I wasn't honest with you.

979
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,220
Please let him go.

980
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,620
Whatever you've got, take it out on me.

981
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,820
Bring him.

982
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,380
