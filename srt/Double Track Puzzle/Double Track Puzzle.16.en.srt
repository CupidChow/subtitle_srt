Hello?

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,620
Xingfa Company.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,100
Hello, Mr. Han.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,980
I have a business deal
to discuss with you.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,100
Hello.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,460
What are you shipping?

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,460
What's the quantity?

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,260
From where to where?

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,620
I guarantee you,

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,580
Xingfa Company offers

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,860
the lowest rates in Xiatong.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,860
The price isn't my concern.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,980
Just worried you won't dare to take it.

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,500
Of course I will.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,380
Xingfa Company handles all kinds

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,220
of shipments.

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,900
Just tell me

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,820
what kind of goods these are.

20
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,300
Heroin.

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,900
Sir,

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,140
I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.

23
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,540
If there's nothing else,

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,300
I'm hanging up.

25
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,820
You're no stranger to heroin, right?

26
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,700
I called you for a reason.

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,580
That stuff's off limits.

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,020
I don't want to lose my head.

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,300
I'll take it as a joke.

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,500
I never joke.

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,660
Mr. Han,

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,820
you're the one moving all the goods
into Xiatong, right?

34
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,060
Your first run was

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,140
December 11th, 1988.

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,740
The second run was

37
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,780
March 2nd, 1989.

38
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,860
Am I right?

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,140
Who are you?

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,500
What do you mean?

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,380
Relax. I'm not a cop.

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,060
I just want to work with you.

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,900
You can call your friend

44
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,700
and check.

45
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,260
Ask him if his goods

46
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,620
came from Mr. Jiang.

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,860
Who are you, really?

48
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,660
I am Mr. Jiang.

49
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,500
Remember when your friend
first reached out

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,140
and asked you to move some goods?

51
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,700
You earned 8,000 yuan on that shipment.

52
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,020
You used that money
to buy your first truck.

53
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,300
Easy money, right?

54
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,620
Don't you owe me thanks?

55
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,140
Have we met?

56
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,900
Why did you set it up like that?

57
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,140
Don't remember if we have.

58
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,540
I just wanted to give you
a chance to make some money.

59
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,300
You used to be a cop.

60
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,860
All that easy money.

61
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,860
Weren't you suspicious?

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,700
But you kept doing it again and again.

63
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,940
You chose this path.

64
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,100
Turns out, you're good at it.

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,380
Now

66
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,820
I'm giving you a chance

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,700
to make even more.

68
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,460
I wonder if you're interested.

69
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,700
If

70
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,580
you're really Mr. Jiang,

71
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,100
we can discuss everything.

72
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,180
If you're not,

73
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,620
I swear

74
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,380
I will find you.

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,940
Good.

76
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,580
I like your answer.

77
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,660
You can ask your friend

78
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,900
to find out more about me.

79
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,060
But you don't have much time.

80
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,620
In three days,

81
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,620
I'll call this number again.

82
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,660
If you agree,

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,620
I'll give you the Xiatong market.

84
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,900
That way, you won't have to

85
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,660
source from your friend anymore.

86
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,060
If you refuse,

87
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,540
you'll lose your current market.

88
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,340
I'll find another agent.

89
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,220
Alright.

Mr. Sun.

95
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,340
I found the files on those three people

96
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,260
you were looking into.

97
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,380
I'm sending them over now.

98
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,140
Receive them.

99
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,260
Okay, hold on.

100

Zhang.

101
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,060
Fax.

102
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,580
Got it.

103
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,260
Go ahead.

104
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,500
Okay.

105
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,300
Sent them.

106
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,980
Receive them now.

107
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,660
Alright.

108
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,620
Regarding Qi Lianshan,
all we could find is the portrait.

109
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,700
As for the other two,

110
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,620
one of them

111
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,580
is a drug ring leader
who recently emerged

112
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,020
in the northern frontier.

113
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,500
He's Qi Lianshan's personal bodyguard.

114
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,740
His status within the gang
is extremely high.

115
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,580
Qi Lianshan's gang

116
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,100
is notoriously brazen

117
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
and brutal.

118
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,300
They've just been added
to the most-wanted list.

119
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,460
But who would've thought

120
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,060
they'd show up in Xiatong.

121
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,540
Based on the intel you provided,

122
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,380
we believe

123
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,540
Qi Lianshan

124
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,980
might also be in Xiatong.

125
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,980
Since Qi Lianshan

126
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,260
has shown up in Xiatong,

127
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,820
we'll catch him right here.

128
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,780
Alright.

129
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,460
Let me know if you need anything.

130
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
Try to take them down

131
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,660
right in Xiatong.

132
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,340
Understood.

133
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,740
Mr. Zhan.

134
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,260
The files.

135
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,900
Get ready.

136
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,940
We're interrogating Langbu.

137
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,580
Okay.

138
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,180
Cut the act.

139
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,060
You're not like Yiman.

140
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
The mute is him,

141
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,140
not you.

142
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,580
Right, Langbu?

143
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,580
Tell you what.

144
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,460
Let me tell you a story.

145
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,340
A real case

146
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,940
documented in our files.

147
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,860
After you hear it,

148
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,660
you can decide
whether to answer my questions or not.

149
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,540
Twenty years ago,

150
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,220
an entire family was killed

151
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,980
in Kebu Town, Daha'er.

152
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,060
The victims were Du Kan's family.

153
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,860
The police found out

154
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,100
there were five members in their family.

155
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,980
But only four bodies

156
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,620
were found at the scene.

157
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,020
These

158
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,340
are crime scene photos from back then.

159
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,380
This is Du Kan and his wife.

160
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
And these are his parents.

161
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,300
Du kan's son was never found.

162
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,940
The last one

163
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,780
shows fabric remnants found

164
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
in the haystack

165
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,220
during the police search.

166
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,140
I think

167
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,900
it's likely from when Du Kan's son

168
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,540
was hiding there.

169
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,380
The boy went missing.

170
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Never been found.

171
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,580
A year later,

172
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,780
a gang of criminal drifters
was busted in Tongfang.

173
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
According to their confessions,

174
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,060
they were the ones

175
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,060
responsible for the mass murder
in Kebu Town.

176
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,780
The prime culprit was quickly executed.

177
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,060
But unfortunately,

178
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,700
one member of the gang
managed to escape.

179
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,660
His whereabouts

180
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,820
remain unknown to this day.

181
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,060
That same winter,

182
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,700
Qi Lianshan was

183
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,820
wandering the streets of Da'an League
with a young boy

184
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,460
who was the same age as Dun Kan's son.

185
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,740
Fourteen years passed
in the blink of an eye.

186
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,540
That boy grew up.

187
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,740
Coincidentally,

188
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,820
he's the same age as you.

189
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,620
Five years ago,

190
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
he followed Qi Lianshan to Shangguan,

191
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,300

Also,

197

Qi Lianshan was sent
to clean up the scene.

200
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,220
There are some things you should know.

201
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,580
Qi Lianshan's gang was involved
in child trafficking using drugs.

202
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,940
They'd either sell the kids

203
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,700
or drug and disable them.

It wasn't congenital.

Guess

208

who made him that way.

I have to tell you the truth.

You have the right to know.

212

you're siding with your enemy.

If it's a misunderstanding,

216
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,700
that's understandable.

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,260
an explanation.

382
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,220
Understood?

383
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,460
I'll wait to hear from you.

384
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,780
I...

385
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,340
Mr. Han.

386
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,180
I heard.

387
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,060
Yeah, I heard.

388
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,620
And now he wants an explanation from me?

389
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,100
Sanmahu's a real deal gang boss.

390
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,100
But Qi Lianshan still works with him!

391
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,500
Now he's claiming he's sucking it up?

392
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,540
Mr. Han,

393
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,220
if we keep doing business like this,

394
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,220
it won't last!

395
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,660
Can't you keep your voice down?

396
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,460
Huh?

397
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,820
I'm trying to sleep.

398
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,020
Can't you see that?

399
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,380
Sorry.

400
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,980
Sun,

401
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,860
we can't afford to cross him yet.

402
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,820
Xiatong

403
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,460
has been raided multiple times.

404
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,500
Mr. Jiang is already unhappy.

405
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,340
We can't afford any more slip-ups.

406
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,220
Understood?

407
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,620
We've taken losses too.

408
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,780
Hua Long and Mao are both gone.

409
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,660
Hua Long was nothing

410
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,540
in our eyes.

411
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,420
Just a lackey.

412
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,180
Then in Mr. Jiang's eyes,

413
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,100
are we just insignificant lackeys too,

414
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,420
like Hua Long?

415
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,380
Mr. Jiang doesn't trust us.

416
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,180
I'm not sure if he trusts us now

417
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,260
or not.

418
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,100
But one thing's for sure.

419
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,340
If we mess this up,

420
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,660
we're in deep trouble.

421
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,860
Sanmahu's quite something.

422
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,660
He actually managed to deliver the goods

423
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,100
and hand them over to Qi Lianshan.

424
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,180
Mr. Han,

425
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,060
what do you think he's up to?

426
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,940
He's clever.

427
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,620
He sacrificed the lesser for the greater

428
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,540
and put us in a tough spot.

429
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,660
It's all Qi Lianshan's fault.

430
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,580
He was doing fine
in the northern frontier.

431
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,940
Why did he have to come to Xiatong
and stir up trouble?

432
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,060
Made a complete mess!

433
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,020
Enough.

434
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,420
Why blame him?

435
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,460
We should blame ourselves

436
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,020
for not keeping Sanmahu.

437
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,540
Now that Sanmahu's back,

438
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,900
he won't let this slide.

439
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,380
If Qi Lianshan teams up with him,

440
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,140
it'll be hard for us to handle them.

441
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,180
I think it's a good thing.

442
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,620
Mr. Han.

443
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,100
Are you still half-asleep?

444
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,940
How is this a good thing?

445
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,500
Think about it.

446
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,500
It's easy for Sanmahu

447
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,300
to leave,

448
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,660
but coming back is the hard part.

449
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,500
Have him killed on the way back?

450
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Exactly.

451
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,740
He's probably on the train back now.

452
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
T631.

453
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,500
This train runs
from Shangguan to Xiatong.

454
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,260
It stops at Wulian along the way.

455
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,660
Should arrive around 5 AM.

456
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,660
The train stops at Wulian Station
for half an hour.

457
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,340
That's when everyone's asleep.

458
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,660
Perfect time.

459
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,460
Right.

460
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,740
Alright.

461
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,580
I've got a contact in Wulian.

462
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,780
A guy with some influence in this line.

463
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,940
I'll reach out to him right now.

464
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,860
We can't

465
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,020
let outsiders do this.

466
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,420
This isn't like buying groceries.

467
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,540
Killing someone

468
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,380
comes with consequences.

469
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,180
Alright then.

470
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,540
I'll go myself with some men.

471
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,820
We can make it in time.

472
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,740
No need.

473
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,860
Sheng can handle it.

474
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,540
Sheng?

475
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,740
That kid's all talk.

476
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,380
He may be good at fooling people.

477
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,860
But you're sending him
to take down Sanmahu?

478
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,340
Since when did I say

479
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,300
Sheng is going to take down Sanmahu?

480
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,460
Lots of people
are looking for Sanmahu now.

481
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,700
We're looking for him.

482
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,060
The cops are looking
for him too, aren't they?

483
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,340
Have him keep up the act?

484
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,220
Just have your contact in Wulian

485
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,580
keep an eye

486
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,380
on how this turns out.

487
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,140
Understood.

488
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
I'll get on it now.

489
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,180
Go ahead.

490
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,580
Zhong!

491
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,260
Did you fall into the toilet or what?

492
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,780
What's your problem?

493
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,780
You're this close.
Just yell instead of calling!

494
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,460
Who are you talking to?

495
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,260
Mr. Sun.

496
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,380
No, it's just...

497
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,940
Open the door.

498
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,540
Alright.

499
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,220
Right away.

500
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,020
Just give me a sec.

501
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,780
Mr. Sun,

502
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,900
what brings you here?

503
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,780
[Authorized Personnel Only]

504
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,460
Mr. Sun, have a seat.

505
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,180
Have a seat.

506
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,940
What would you like to drink?

507
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,580
Mr. Sheng, your business
must be booming.

508
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,740
Too busy to see me now?

509
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,900
Of course not.

510
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,180
Mr. Sun.

511
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,100
No way,

512
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,700
Mr. Sun.

513
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,020
I've been hoping you'd come by
to give some guidance.

514
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,220
Are there any orders today?

515
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Have you been in touch
with that cop lately?

516
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,460
No.

517
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,540
Why would I deal with that grim reaper?

518
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,220
It's nerve-wracking.

519
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
You need to reach out.

520
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,340
We need him for something right now.

521
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,340
Well...

522
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,620
I can't contact him

523
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,020
without a reason, right?

524
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,340
I'm here to give you a reason.

525
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,100
Mr. Sun,

526
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,780
you're not asking me
to tip off the cops again, are you?

527
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,860
You don't want to?

528
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,540
No, it's not that.

529
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,940
It's just...

530
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,820
It's just...

531
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,740
Every time you guys have me do this,

532
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,700
it's...

533
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,540
Dealing with the cops is tough

534
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,180
and dangerous.

535
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,700
I'm always on edge.

536
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,980
I just...

537
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,860
Guess

538
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,700
if the cops know what you're up to?

539
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,580
Why aren't they coming after you?

540
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,380
Guess

541
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,500
if we know what you're up to.

542
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,180
Why aren't we coming after you?

543
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,540
Understood.

544
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,940
Mr. Sun,

545
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,300
just forget everything I just said.

546
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,100
I'll handle

547
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,740
whatever you need.

548
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,580
Sanmahu is on Train T631,

549
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,700
heading back to Xiatong.

550
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,220
You know what to do.

551
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,260
Got it.

552
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
I'll get on it right away.

553
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,740
Sheng.

554
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,660
Sheng!

555
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,500
How could you agree to this?

556
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,660
What choice did I have?

557
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,380
Come on.

558
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,500
You know what kind of person he is.

559
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,020
Getting involved
with people like that...

560
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,460
They're...

561
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,420
How are you...

562
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,740
How are you gonna get out of this?

563
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,540
You know exactly
what these guys are like.

564
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,580
No.

565
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,380
This might not be a bad thing.

566
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,140
I've got a record with the cops.

567
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,540
Red marks and black marks.

568
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,500
Lately, I've piled up
too many black marks.

569
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,260
Now's a good time to balance it out

570
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,380
with some red ones.

571
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
T63... What was that again?

572
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
- T631.
- T631.

573
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Hello, Mr. Sanmahu.

574
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,900
How's the old guy doing?

575
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,980
He's doing just fine.

576
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,540
Eating well, sleeping soundly.

577
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,020
No need to worry.

578
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,380
By the way, Mr. Sanmahu,

579
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,980
should I come pick you up today?

580
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,120
Don't bother.

581
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,780
Taohua's with me.

582
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,940
Keep an eye on him.

583
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,020
Okay.

584
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,900
Mr. Qi,

585
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,060
should we make a move or not?

586
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,620
Not yet.

587
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,300
I haven't decided how to handle this.

588
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,180
Just keep a close watch on him for now.

589
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,820
Is the car arranged at Wulian?

590
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,260
Yes.

591
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,420
Hei is there personally with some men.

592
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,740
Wait for my call.

593
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,820
If we're going to take him out,

594
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,820
we'll do it at Wulian.

595
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,340
You guys,

596
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,620
get back to the northern frontier now.

597
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,260
Understood?

598
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,660
Understood.

599
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,770
[Criminal Police Unit]

600
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,540
Keep taking detours.

601
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,940
Mr. Zhan,

602
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
these two are cautious.

603
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,060
They've been leading us in circles.
What's the plan?

604
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,100
I see it.

605
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,900
Pull back for now.

606
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,340
Copy that.

607
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,420
We're pulling pack.

608
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,300
Let's go.

609
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,340
No one's tailing us now.

610
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,500
Head back the way we came.

611
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,740
Follow them.

612
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,940
Watch out!

613
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,580
Lucky charm.

614
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,380
You really are my lucky charm.

615
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,900
He didn't take it?

616
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,620
Didn't touch it.

617
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,900
The cops here are something else.

618
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,180
Pull over.

619
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,500
Turn around.

620
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,860
Follow that van.

621
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,740
How long until we reach the station?

622
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,860
Half an hour.

623
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,540
We're heading back already?

624
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,380
Just taking care of something
on the way.

625
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,220
Mr. Sanmahu.

626
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,220
I've wrapped things up in Xiatong.

627
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,820
I'm on my way out now.

628
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,620
Let's meet up in Wulian.

629
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,500
Any new arrangements?

630
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
Nothing much.

631
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,420
Once we pass Wulian,
we'll be on my turf.

632
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,940
I have to play the host,

633
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,460
right?

634
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,820
There's one more thing.

635
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,580
Mr. Sun made me a new offer.

636
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,020
Shouldn't we

637
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,740
discuss it in person?

638
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,260
Alright.

639
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,740
Then let's meet

640
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,660
in Wulian.

641
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,500
Fine.

642
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,620
Mr. Qi,

643
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,620
have you thought

644
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,700
about the consequences of letting
the tiger return to the mountains?

645
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,740
I grew up at the foot
of Changbai Mountain.

646
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,980
I've been hunting tigers, bears,

647
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,940
and all kinds of beasts
with rifles since I was a kid.

648
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,620
Understand?

649
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,260
Just say what you mean, alright?

650
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,500
I know you and Sanmahu have a deal.

651
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,180
I don't want to ask.

652
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,500
And I'm not interested.

653
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,780
But I'll remind you,

654
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,820
Sanmahu

655
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,460
also gets his supply from me, right?

656
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,300
Will he give you all of it?

657
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,740
Not necessarily.

658
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,420
But I can.

659
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,660
I can give you everything
that was meant for him.

660
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,860
And I can give you even more.

661
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
How much more?

662
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,780
Without Sanmahu,

663
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,300
you can have as much as you want.

664
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,620
The thing is,

665
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,980
can you handle it?

666
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,100
Mr. Han, here's the thing.

667
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,140
I'm a businessman.

668
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,380
How about this?

669
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,980
You two settle it between yourselves.

670
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,860
And when I get back,

671
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
I'll do business
with whoever comes out on top.

672
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,700
Why keep beating around the bush?

673
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,540
I really don't want to
get involved in your affairs.

674
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,140
Understand?

675
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,540
Mr. Qi,

676
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,140
everyone

677
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,980
is scrambling around

678
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,060
for profit and gain.

679
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,420
We're businessmen.

680
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,780
Why all the violence?

681
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,820
In business,

682
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,740
it's all about the spirit of contract.

683
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,300
Enough.

684
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,860
I'll say it again.

685
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,060
I'm not getting involved
in your affairs.

686
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
I'll work

687
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,260
with whoever offers the lower price.

688
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,060
Let me put it simply.

689
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,620
Without Sanmahu as a middleman,

690
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,940
our relationship becomes more direct.

691
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,940
And our profits

692
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,820
can be maximized.

693
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,220
Right?

694
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,980

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,820
the winds in the northern frontier
are treacherous,

696
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,980
but people here are even more so.

697
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,540
That's so true.

698
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,820
Mr. Han,

699
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,020
what do you mean?

700
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,420
Explain it.

701
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,220
Let me think it over.

702
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,940
The northern frontier is your turf.

703
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,260
Sanmahu's left.

704
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Don't let him come back.

705
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,940

to meet me at Wulian.

708
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,860
If it's convenient for you, you do it.

709
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,340
If not, bring him over

710
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
and say I want to see him.

711
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,660
There are plenty of mountains.

712
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,060
I'll find him a nice spot.

713
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,140
Understood.

714

pick up our guys first.

It seemed

724
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,620
a bit off.

Hey, Mr. Zhan.

Here's the thing.

738
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,620
I risked my life

739
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,100
to dig up some major intel.

740
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,060

named Sanmahu, right?

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,860
I need to investigate

757
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,940
and verify things.

758
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,980
It costs money and energy.

759
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,100
I... Right?

760
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,180
Enough. You talk too much.

761
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,740
It'll be approved in a few days.

762
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,900
Sheng,

763
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,220
if you're just using this
to pressure me,

764
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,740
can we talk tomorrow?

765
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,900
I'm really busy right now.

766
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,460
No, no, Mr. Zhan.

767
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,860
Hear me out.

768
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,580
Here's the thing.

769
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,220
Train T631.

770
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,980
Sanmahu is on that train.

771
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,820
Alright, I got it.

772
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,220
If we catch him,

773
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,020
you'll get credit.

774
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,700
Alright.

775
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,980
Hello?

776
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:31,900
Hello?

777
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,140
Hey, Mr. Tu.

778
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,020
I just got some intel.

779
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,060
Sanmahu is on Train T631

780
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,020
heading to Xiatong.

781
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,700
I'm already on a train
to the northern frontier.

782
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,220
My mission is to intercept Sanmahu.

783
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,940
The intel matches yours.

784
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,620
Look into its source.

785
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,580
I think

786
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,500
there's more to this.

787
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,500
Discuss with Xiong

788
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,300
about setting up defenses in Xiatong.

789
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,220
If I fail,

790
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
you take over.

791
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,340
Let's have a backup plan.

792
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,300
Got it.

793
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,340
Hello?

794
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,820
My keys aren't in my bag.

795
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,260
Are you sure?

796
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,740
I've looked several times.

797
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,980
Turned my bag inside out.

798
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,100
They're just not there.

799
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,980
So what do we do now?

800
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,140
Are you gonna pick me up
or should I just take a cab?

801
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,380
Take a cab.

802
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,140
Fine.

803
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,540
Again, you're not picking me up.

804
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,460
I'm on the train now.

805
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,140
I'll call you when I reach Wulian.

806
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,100
Understood.

807
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,780
Is it hot?

808
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,140
Yes.

809
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:20,860
Hot?

810
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,340
Then put it down.

811
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,900
Here.

812
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,140
Shan.

813
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,400
[On the train. Disguised.]

814
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,700
Nanyi,

815
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,620
keep

816
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,660
tailing Langbu.

817
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,900
If you spot the target, do not engage.

818
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,820
The target is on the train.

819
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,100
Understood.

820
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,220
Stay safe.

821
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,220
Later,

822
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,100
you two,

823
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:38,940
go sit over there.

824
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,900
I'll be over there.

825
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,980
Remember,

826
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
if you spot the target,

827
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,180
do not engage.

828
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,340
Call me immediately.

829
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,900
Understood.

830
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,380
Go ahead.

831
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,260
The train has arrived at the station.

832
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,220
Please get off in an orderly manner.

833
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,680
[Wulian]

834
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,580
Split up.

835
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,540
Prepare to move.

836
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,780
Hello?

837
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
They're leaving. Should we follow?

838
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,700
Yes.

839
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,260
Notify Zhang and the others.

840
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,300
Make way.

841
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,700
What are you doing here
instead of staying in Xiatong?

842
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,340
Mr. Tu?

843
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,380
I'm tracking someone.

844
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,260
Stop him at the exit.

845
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,900
Liu Liu, Wu,

846
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,100
intercept someone at the exit.

847
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,100
Khaki hat.

848
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,820
Gray jacket.

849
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,620
Stay safe!

850
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,280
[Wulian Station]

851
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,420
Freeze!

852
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,300
Make way.

853
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,620
Move aside.

854
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,980
Hang in there.

855
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,620
Didn't see anyone.

856
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,340
Who did it?

857
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,220
So ruthless.

858
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,780
An officer is injured
in the exit passageway.

859
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,980
Call an ambulance now.

860
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,980
Probably Qi Lianshan.

861
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,700
Dafei!

862
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,980
Something happened at Wulian Station.

863
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,860
The cops are after me.

864
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,860
Probably followed from Xiatong.

865
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,380
Are you alright?

866
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,700
I'm fine. Hei already picked me up.

867
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,580
How long until you reach Wulian?

868
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,140
About

869
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,100
forty minutes.

870
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,980
Take him out before you get to Wulian.

871
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,500
We'll meet at the usual spot.

872
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,020
Understood.

873
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,460
Hey, Hua.

874
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,300
Sir.

875
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,580
Something's off.

876
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,220
The station
is full of plainclothes cops.

877
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,300
They must be staking out someone.

878
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,300
You need to get off early.

879
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,940
Okay, got it.

880
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,260
Qi Lianshan must have caught on.

881
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,180
Right now, Langbu

882
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,740
is our only lead.

883
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,860
We can't afford any mistakes.

884
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:37,740
Understood.

885
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,900
Three people entered the station hotel.

886
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,700
Haven't moved since.

887
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,140
Just had a staff member
deliver hot water.

888
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,220
They're all inside.

889
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:45,940
Alright.

890
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,660
Keep a close watch.

891
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,020
If anything goes wrong,

892
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,700
catch Langbu first.

893
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,020
Mr. Tu.

894
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,740
How did Qi Lianshan know

895
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,900
you were intercepting Sanmahu at Wulian?

896
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,820
Qi Lianshan couldn't have known.

897
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,060
He's probably

898
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,780
at Wulian for Sanmahu.

899
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,300
He has guys on the train

900
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,820
watching Sanmahu.

901
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,140
I'm worried things will blow up
before the train even

902
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,340
reaches Wulian.

903
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,660
Qi Lianshan wants to take Sanmahu down?

904
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,820
Why?

905
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,140
None of these people are any good.

906
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,860
They're all backstabbers.

907
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,140
Turning on each other.

908
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,700
For what?

909
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,220
Money.

910
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,340
Where is he?

911
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,340
Not sure.

912
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,700
A staff member just went by.

913
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,980
Split up and search.

914
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,860
Be careful.

915
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,180
Engage on sight.

916
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,220
You search over there.

917
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,580
Mr. Tu.

918
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,500
Qi Lianshan's men

919
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,700
are searching the train car by car.

920
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:14,900
Sanmahu

921
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,180
might have escaped.

922
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,940
That cunning fox

923
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,620
wouldn't just wait to be caught.

924
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,860
Just keep watching.

925
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,860
No matter what happens,

926
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,540
even if heads roll,

927
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,700
just observe.

928
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,700
Wait until the train

929
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,060
arrives to Wulian.

930
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,140
Fine.

931
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,300
We're short-handed.

932
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,540
If we engage,

933
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,980
we might not catch them.

934
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,940
We'll arrive in twenty minutes.

935
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,060
I'll keep watching.

936
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:55,380
Hello?

937
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
I still think there's something
in that bag.

938
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:58,820
Here's what we'll do.

939
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,100
Check if there's anything in the bag.

940
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:21,780
Mr. Qi,

941
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,420
I checked.

942
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,340
There's nothing inside.

943
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,380
Whether there is or not, ditch the bag.

944
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,580
Listen to me.

945
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,620
Have Yiman wrap the money
in his clothes.

946
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,460
Throw the bag away.

947
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,620
In half an hour,

948
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,060
climb out the window.

949
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,020
A truck will be there to pick you up.

950
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,060
Understood?

951
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,660
Got it.

952
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,420
Yiman.

953
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,740
Spread your clothes out.

954
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,180
What's your game, Mr. Sanmahu?

955
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,220
Running off without even saying a word?

956
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,820
You're showing no respect for Mr. Qi.

957
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,020
Just want to use the restroom.

958
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,820
How is that disrespectful?

959
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,340
I've got a weak bladder.
Frequent, urgent,

960
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,820
and it takes forever.

961
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,740
You won't even let me piss!

962
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,700
I...

963
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,380
Mr. Qi,

964
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,020
I didn't get him.

965
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,300
The old fossil jumped off the train.

966
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,260
At the unloading yard
on the west side of the station.

967
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,340
Hello?

968
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:20,820
Hua,

969
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,420
I'm off the train.

970
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,780
Are you alright?

971
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,500
That scumbag Qi Lianshan

972
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,380
made a move out of nowhere.

973
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,140
Almost got me killed.

974
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,940
Did you pick up the guys?

975
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,820
Yeah.

976
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:32,980
Where should I pick you up?

977
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,140
I'm west of the station now.

978
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,420
An...

979
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,500
An unloading yard.

980
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,140
Tell Mabao and the others

981
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,620
to get ready to move.

982
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,780
Is something wrong?

983
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,820
I've got a bad feeling about this.

984
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,620
Get over here fast.

985
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,860
Alright.

986
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,480
[Wulian]

987
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,820
Mr. Tu.

988
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,500
Mr. Tu.

989
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,060
They've started fighting each other.

990
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,980
Sanmahu got away.

991
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,540
Only these small fries were left.

992
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,180
Take them back.

993
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,700
Yes, sir.

994
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,100
Take them away.

995
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,900
Mr. Zhan, something's up.

996
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,140
The tracker moved,

997
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,020
but no one came out.

998
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,140
We went in to check.

999
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,220
They jumped out the window and ran.

1000
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,660
We're tracking the signal now.

1001
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,660
Headed toward the east side of the city.

1002
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,180
Must be Langbu.

1003
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,780
Keep a close watch.

1004
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,580
I'm on my way.

1005
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,780
Mr. Tu.

1006
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,420
There's news about Qi Lianshan.

1007
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,660
I'll go check it out.

1008
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,140
Alright.

1009
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,180
I'll keep an eye on Sanmahu.

1010
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,380
Let's stay in touch.

1011
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,140
Well, look who it is.

1012
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,700
In the pitch dark like this,

1013
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,420
I never thought we'd
run into each other here.

1014
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,060
Mr. Sanmahu.

1015
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,700
You're not playing fair.

1016
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,940
You wanted to catch the mole yourself,

1017
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,140
and now the cops are on me too.

1018
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,940
I slipped up.

1019
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,660
Here's the deal, Mr. Qi.

1020
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,380
I don't want

1021
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,700
the payment.

1022
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,500
And I'll pay you double.

1023
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,900
In your eyes, all I care about

1024
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,700
is profit,

1025
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,580
is that it?

1026
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,620
What I care about more
is whether a person is decent.

1027
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,540
If anyone tries to screw me over,

1028
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,380
I won't rest

1029
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,780
until they are dead.

1030
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,820
Understand?

1031
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,860
So you're saying

1032
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,580
I won't

1033
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,100
make it through today?

1034
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:43,980
You'll make it.

1035
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,420
You're an old man.

1036
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,980
I'll let you die with some dignity.

1037
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,220
Shan!

1038
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,020
Shan.

1039
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,180
It's been ages.

1040
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,860
"Shan, it's been ages."

1041
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,580
What are you doing here?

1042
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,780
Mr. Sanmahu asked me to drive him back.

1043
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,180
I can see what's going on here now.

1044
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,060
Shan,

1045
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,500
if I want to come back,

1046
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,220
do I still have a chance?

1047
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,860
I love it when people ask me,

1048
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,980
"Do I still have a chance?"

1049
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,340
You do.

1050
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,780
There's a chance.

1051
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,380
I need someone

1052
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,940
to handle things for me in Xiatong.

1053
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,300
Don't worry.

1054
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,580
I know the rules.

1055
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,820
I'll clean this up.
