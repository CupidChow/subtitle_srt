Come any closer

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,500
and I'll kill him!

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,820
Don't move!

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
Take him back.

Got it.

Please, stop hitting me.

00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,180
To... Tomorrow.

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,180
I'll pay you back tomorrow, I promise.

28

Tomorrow?

29

I... I heard her on the phone.

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,140
That money
was for her daughter's surgery.

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,940
A life's on the line, Mr. Mao.

38
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,300
We couldn't steal that money.

39
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,980
That'd be heartless.

41
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,780

No, no.

44
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,780
Then I'll help you out.

I've heard of you for a long time.

65
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,940
Thank you, Mr. Tu.

66
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,020
How long you been at this?

67
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,340
Uh, less than

so I just did this.

just say the word.

this isn't a hotel.

It's just a guesthouse.

Listen to me.

You made the call.

You went upstairs first.

101
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,020
You found the body.

102
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,060
Now he's dead.

103
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,860

Doesn't that look like a footprint?

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,260
Someone else

119
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,540
was in this room

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,060

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,140

more important than a dead body?

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,980

autopsy report is in.

Go on.

127
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,860
The time of death was

128
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,980
between 1:00 PM and 1:30 PM today.

129
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,620
His carotid artery
was slashed by a sharp object.

130
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,180
The wound was 5.3 centimeters long.

131
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,380
No signs of a struggle on the body.

132
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,220
No fingerprints.

133
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,340
Was the cut made

134
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,140
left to right, or right to left?

135
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,060
Right to left.

136
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:42,980
Alright.

137
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,820
Good work.

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,420
No problem.

139
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,980
When did Tu Hongjiang go upstairs?

140
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,820
Based on the timestamp from the message

141
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,660
Zhang Nanyi sent me,

142
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,900
I'd say around 1:30 PM.

143
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,820
I asked the guesthouse boss.

144
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,940
There's only one entrance.

145
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,460
She didn't see anyone else go in

146
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,060
before Zheng Xiaoshan checked in.

147
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,220
A clean slash to the carotid.

148
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,500
That's not some petty thief's work.

150
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,740
Go on.

151
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,420
I think

152
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,820
Tu Hongjiang

153
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,780
is involved in this.

154
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,580
He has to cooperate
with our investigation.

155
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,940
The only reason
Zheng Xiaoshan was silenced

156
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,020
is that he had two kilos of drugs.

157
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,380
Who was after him?

158
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,300
And who lured him to that guesthouse?

159
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,900
Now he's dead,

160
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,940
and the lead is gone.

161
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,100
So what's our next move?

162
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,700
We have less than a day left

163
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,860
from the deadline Mr. Sun got us.

164
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,420
What's going on with you?

165
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,100
You didn't answered calls

166
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,900
or messages.

167
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,380
This is...

168
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,260
Where was it found?

169
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,620
Is the autopsy report in?

170
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,500
Tu Hongjiang!

171
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,020
Mr. Tu.

172
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,980
Don't you think
you should say something?

173
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,660
Say what?

174
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,300
Say my foot.

175
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,500
Everyone knows Zheng Xiaoshan
was your informant!

176
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,620
Now he's dead without any reason,

177
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,220
and the goods are mysteriously back.

178
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,620
You have nothing to say?

179
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,900
Think you're so capable?

180
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,380
Do you not trust us,

181
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,740
or do you think we're fools?

182
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,540
Stop yelling!

183
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,140
Zheng Xiaoshan was a thief.

184
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,300
Thieves and drug dealers don't mix.

185
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,020
I've caught more thieves
than you've ever seen.

186
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,620
Some are reckless,

187
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,540
some are desperate,

188
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,940
but few dare to mess with drugs.

189
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,740
He was set up.

190
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,460
Then...

191
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,460
That drugs cost a life.

192
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,500
