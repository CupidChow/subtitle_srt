[Chinese New Year's Eve, 1998]

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,940
Long?

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,100
Long?

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,380
Long?

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,420
It's me.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,580
It's Mao.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,060
Long, it's Mao.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,780
Where are you?

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,060
Mao.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,660
Stop shouting. Come here.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,700
Long,

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,260
you've been through heck.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,460
It's fine.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,180
Does anyone give you trouble?

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,940
Two groups came by.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,540
They saw you weren't around

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,380
and left.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,660
Remember,

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,580
swear

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,860
you had nothing to do with this.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,220
Tell them

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,220
I took twenty thousand from you,

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,420
and that you're looking for me as well.

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,260
Got it?

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,500
Can't do that.

26
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,420
We went

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,180
into stock investment together.

28
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,740
I can't let you take the fall alone
when we lose money.

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,860
Well,

30
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,380
how about

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,260
I go to the south with you?

32
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,700
If anything happens,
we can watch each other's backs.

33
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,860
If we both leave,

34
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,060
what about your Mother?

35
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,420
Alright, Mao.

36
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,380
Don't worry about me.

37
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,980
I know how to handle myself.

38
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,740
But you,

39
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,380
while I'm gone,

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,980
keep a low profile

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,580
and stay out of trouble.

42
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,020
Do you hear me?

43
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,620
Got it, Long.

44
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,740
I'll do what you say.

45
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,300
Packed all your clothes?

46
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,300
Yeah. Here.

47
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,940
I'm off.

48
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,780
Hey, Long.

49
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,580
Wait.

50
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,860
What?

51
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,140
Take this money.

52
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,700
Keep it for yourself.

53
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,420
No, no.

54
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,820
Long,

55
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,300
listen.

56
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,460
Always have enough for the road.

57
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,060
You know,

58
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,380
I can get by here.

59
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,820
But you're different.

60
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,140
But you're out there on your own.

61
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,540
Take it.

62
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,500
Alright, I'll take it.

63
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,780
Mao,

64
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,660
take care of yourself

65
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,260
and my godmother.

[Episode 12]

69
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,340
Mr. Sun.

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,740
Five kilos is too much.

71
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,260
I don't have that much stock.

72
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,740
I already

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,740
called in

74
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,980
an emergency shipment.

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,700
Go pick them up tomorrow.

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,020
Tomorrow?

77
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,060
Mao can't show his face right now.

78
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,740
He always handled
the goods pickup on the train.

79
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,500
If we're getting the goods tomorrow,

80
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,820
I'm worried...

81
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,860
So you're saying

82
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,380
that without Mao,

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,340
you're useless?

84
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,700
No, Mr. Sun.

85
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,140
Alright.

86
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,260
I'll board

87
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,060
and get the goods tomorrow.

88
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,940
I'll send you the pickup info later.

89
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,660
Hope you can really

90
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,340
handle things on your own.

91
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,500
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

92
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,180
Long, you're back.

93
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,260
All packed?

94
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,460
Not much to pack.

95
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,940
Take it.

96
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,020
I have money.

97
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
Just take it.

98
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,140
From those guys
from the northern frontier.

99
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,300
You've got a share of it.

100
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,220
Long,

101
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,540
how did the talk go today?

102
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,100
Not bad.

103
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,980
I'll get the goods
on the train tomorrow.

104
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,940
Then I'm clear.

105
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,460
Get the goods on the train?

106
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,980
No.

107
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,300
You've never handled that.

108
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,260
Let me do it.

109
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,540
I'll settle this before I leave.

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,700
No.

111
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,700
Wait.

112
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,460
Long.

113
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,420
These guys are tough to deal with.

114
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,980
If something goes wrong,

115
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm worried you can't handle it alone.

116
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,460
A powerful outsider
cannot defeat a local villain.

117
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,300
No matter how they make trouble,

118
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,540
we still need to cooperate.

119
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,060
Relax. I know what I'm doing.

120
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,060
Not necessarily.

121
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,100
These guys

122
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,380
will stab you in the back if you blink.

123
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,420
Too risky.

124
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,260
Since when

125
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,620
is our line of work ever safe?

126
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,460
No, Long...

127
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,060
Enough.

128
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,260
This is non-negotiable.

129
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,460
You are

130
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,220
leaving tonight.

131
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,140
Understood?

132
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,100
Specs isn't smart enough.

133
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,660
And he doesn't have the guts.

134
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,980
He doesn't.

135
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,060
But you all

136
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,060
do.

137
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,100
What do you think Tu Hongjiang

138
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,780
will reward me if I cripple you?

139
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,220
What do you think?

140
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,980
Maybe he'd give me
a "Good Citizen" award.

141
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,780
Or

142
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,740
another informant fee.

143
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,660
That's so you.

144
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,700
When it's about profit,

145
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,900
you talk about loyalty.

146
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,620
When it's about loyalty,

147
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,780
you chase profit.

148
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,540
You want it all.

149
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,100
You don't just value your life.

150
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,020
You've got luck too.

151
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,500
You walked away from the life

152
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,540
after losing just one finger.

153
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,140
I did your work.

154
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,660
I took your money.

155
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,460
I didn't run when your place got raided.

156
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,300
I had to treat you

157
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,620
while you suspected me.

158
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,540
It's been hard on me.

159
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,060
If you were me,

160
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,620
would you be suspicious?

161
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,220
I would.

162
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
But can you really trust them?

163
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,740
Then

164
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,340
it has to be Specs.

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,980
Speak.

166
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,820
Hua Long agreed.

167
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,980
But he needs two days
to prepare the goods.

168
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,060
He didn't say anything else?

169
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,580
Seemed hesitant.

170
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,460
But I told him

171
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,700
it's a test of his supply capacity.

172
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,900
We need such a huge quantity of goods.

173
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,140
Xiatong alone can't cover it.

174
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,060
He'll have to source from other places.

175
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,100
Mao

176
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,620
used to handle

177
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,900
the goods pickup.

178
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,140
Now Mao's gone.

179
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,380
I doubt Hua Long

180
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,940
can pull it off.

181
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,340
You and Taohua

182
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,380
have people secretly keep an eye
on things at the railway station.

183
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,620
If new faces show up,

184
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,620
take them down immediately.

185
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,460
If not,

186
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,820
let Hua Long

187
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,380
know his limits and back off.

188
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,540
Do we still take his goods?

189
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,020
The goods aren't important.

190
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,380
Even if you get them,

191
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,500
just give them back to him.

192
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,420
Why?

193
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,340
Break his spirit.

194
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,340
This time

195
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,060

Thanks, guys.

199
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,100
Once things settle down,

200
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,140
let's have a proper get-together.

201
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,060
Alright.

202
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,180
Alright then.

203

204

Alright, okay.

205
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,380
What am I gonna do with you?

206
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,020
You refused
to pull back the checkpoints.

207
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,340
It made me and Mr. Tai

208
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,980
stick our necks out to support you.

209
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,020
And what do you do?

210
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,660
You suddenly
pulled them back this morning

211
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
without even a heads-up.

212
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,860
You're really something.

213
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,380
We set up the checkpoints
to catch them.

214
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,020
If they're already gone,

215
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,300
what's the point of that?

216
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,820
What do you mean?

218
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,860
When?

219
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,780
During the checkpoint operation?

220
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,620
No, no. I said "if".

221
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,540
It's hypothetical. Don't get worked up.

222
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,460
Whether he made it out
of the mountains or not,

223
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,060
we definitely

224
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,060
hit him hard.

225
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,620
To recover,

226
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,740
he'll make a big move.

227
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,700
I pulled back the checkpoints

228
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,340
to play along with Sanmahu.

229
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,780
Letting the enemy off
to catch them later.

230
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,780
You're using fancy phrases now.

231

"Letting the enemy off

232
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,860

Come in.

234
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,020
Mr. Tu, you're here too.

235

Mr. Xiong.

237
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,180
Just got word from the bureau.

This afternoon,

239

someone's moving goods from Kunyang.

240
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,660
No small quantity.

241
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,460
The deal is happening in Xiatong.

242
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,900
They want us

243
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,100
to work with Kunyang on a sting?

244
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,900
They have the connections
to Kunyang in Xiatong.

245
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,220
And such a large quantity.

246
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,100
Except Dragon Unleashed,

247
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,420
it's Sanmahu.

248
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,460
But one of them faked the death,

249
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,140
the other got raided.

250
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,380
You think they're still active?

251
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,620
Mr. Xiong,

252

I checked.

253
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,060
There are eight trains
passing through Xiatong

254
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,780
from Kunyang this afternoon.

255

Just get them from my clinic.

268

It'll be faster.

Hard for me to stay on her tail.

387
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Might risk exposure.

388
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,660
See which train she boards.

389
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,940
We'll ambush her
after boarding at Jiagou.

390
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,540
Next one is Train T766.

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,620
Hey, Long.

393
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,780
Something's off.

394
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,680
I just saw that woman
from the northern frontier

395
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,400
board the train.

396
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,860
The guy must be here too.

397
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,780
How do you know?

398
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,260
Are you on the train too?

399
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,980
Yeah, I...

400
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,900
I was worried
you couldn't handle it alone,

401
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,700
so I followed.

402
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,620
I'm behind you.

403
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,420
Don't worry.

404
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,060
I've got more experience
with pickups than you.

405
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,460
Alright then.

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,700
enters the tunnel at the next stop,

408
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,100
use the restroom
between Carriage 9 and 10.

409
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,100
Grab the goods and get off fast.

410
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,660
Got it.

411
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,420

Speak.

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,180
Target spotted in Carriage 12.

416
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,300
Only the woman. No sign of the man.

417
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,220
What about Dragon Unleashed?

418
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,380
Haven't seen him.

419
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,620
Based on past patterns,

420
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,780
there's a culvert up ahead.

421
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,740
They'll definitely use that opportunity.

422
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,180
Focus on Carriage 12

423
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,180
and sweep the four cars
ahead and behind.

424
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,380
If you spot the target,

425
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,020
do not engage.

426
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,260

Keep a close watch after coming out.

could it be?

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,500
Then kill me.

making more money than you.

There were cops on several trains.

556

00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,180
I thought I was hot stuff.

How hard could it be
to be a criminal police officer?

566
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,100
Then I tangled with that ringleader.

567
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,500
I didn't catch him.

568
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,220
Ended up with egg on my face.

569
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,300
So embarrassing.

570
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,780

Speaking of Master,

00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,340
You're the deterrent of Xiatong.

577
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,460
The troublemakers scatter

578
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,380
when they see you.

579
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,860
But it wasn't always like that.

580
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,740
Back when we both met Master,

581
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,980
he insisted

582
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,660
you were cut out to be a cop.

583
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,780
Why?

584
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,180
Why not me?

585
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,500
Xiatong's been peaceful
these past few years.

586
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,220
But the troublemakers
never really settled down.

587
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,420
Now that Sanmahu's back
stirring trouble,

588
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,020
all the scoundrels

589
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,460
are crawling out.

590
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,020
I know my health

591
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,740
and age mean this is my last fight.

592
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,660
Really.

593
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,140
I just want to clean up Xiatong

594
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,780
a bit more and buy a few more years
of peace

595
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,540
before I retire.

596
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,900
Sounds like

597
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,220
you're ready to quit.

598
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,780
I'm quitting.

599
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,700
Seriously?

600
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,820
For real.

601
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,580
I don't buy it.

602
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,420
You've had a long day.

603
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,300
Here.

604
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,140
Take a seat.

605
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,660
So you're Mr. Sanmahu?

606
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,860
I've heard a lot about you.

607
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,420
It's an honor

608
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,140
to finally meet you.

609
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,100
Come on.

610
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,940
Have a seat.

611
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,620
There are only four hours left

612
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,100
till the day's over.

613
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,380
I expect you to be here

614
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,180
at nine sharp tomorrow with the goods

615
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,140
and let our friends
from the northern frontier

616
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,780
see what you've got.

617
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,500
Mr. Sanmahu.

618
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,020
You're the senior here.

619
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,900
There's something

620
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,980
I'd like to ask you.

621
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,660
No need to stand on ceremony.

622
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,580
Just say it.

623
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
Why

624
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,220
did Dou

625
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,540
show up uninvited on the train today?

626
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,580
How did he end up

627
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,500
at our drop site?

628
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,260
I know

629
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,740
he's done this before,

630
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,060
but we're partners now.

631
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,900
This batch of goods

632
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,620
represents our shared interests.

633
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,700
Of course.

634
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,420
His reckless move

635
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,620
brought the cops down on us

636
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,820
and got the goods seized.

637
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,660
How do I explain that?

638
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,180
How do we

639
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,860
settle this?

640
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,180
I sent them.

641
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,300
Today's pickup was too important.

642
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,460
It's the foundation of our partnership.

643
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,860
I had them there

644
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,660
as backup.

645
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,260
They weren't supposed to
intervene unless necessary.

646
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,460
Did you

647
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,220
see something?

648
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,740
We didn't see Hua Long

649
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,180
at the drop site.

650
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,300
But there was some hick

651
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,980
with a birthmark on his face.

652
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
We were worried

653
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,860
things might go wrong,

654
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,660
so...

655
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,580
You sent that hick to pick up the goods?

656
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,220
Don't tell me it was Mao.

657
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,580
Man,

658
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,660
trust is the foundation of cooperation.

659
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,340
Mutual support is how we both win.

660
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,700
I had

661
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,820
a key man.

662
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,900
He handled

663
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,940
the operations we took over from you.

664
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,420
He got arrested.

665
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,940
My people started saying

666
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,420
it was you.

667
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,540
That you set us up.

668
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,180
Then came the word

669
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,180
that Mao got blown away.

670
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,500
You called me demanding answers.

671
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,260
And my people were at it again,

672
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,500
saying you

673
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,740
framed us.

674
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,620
I said no way.

675
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,180
I chose to trust you.

676
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,900
I believed in you.

677
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,340
But now,

678
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,500
Mao's not dead.

679
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,780
He even picked up the goods.

680
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,660
Man,

681
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,900
I've survived

682
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,940
half a lifetime in this world

683
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,740
not by being ruthless,

684
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,700
but by keeping my word.

685
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,580
But you've slapped me in the face.

686
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,900
Awkward, isn't it?

687
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,780
Mr. Sanmahu,

688
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
we're the ones in the wrong this time.

689
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,700
Please give us another chance.

690
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,340
Now that's what I like to hear.

691
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,180
But

692
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,860
you'll have to earn it.

693
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,380
Think about it.

694
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,460
The fact that I chose to meet you

695
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
means

696
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,300
I still got faith in you.

697
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,300
I propose

698
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,700
we keep

699
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,060
our original arrangement.

700
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,940
You don't need to
scramble for more goods.

701
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,700
But Mao

702
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,220
can't be part of this.

703
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,300
I think that guy is bad luck.

704
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,180
I don't like him.

705
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,420
Talk to your boss.

706
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,900
If you insist on keeping him,

707
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,420
then hand over all your

708
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,540
drop chats.

709
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,500
Of course you're still in charge.

710
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,740
But I need full transparency.

711
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,940
Profits split

712
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,580
sixty-forty.

713
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,420
I take sixty,

714
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,860
you take forty.

715
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,140
You've seen

716
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,020
what I bring to the table.

717
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,260
You have four hours

718
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,260
to give me an answer.

719
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,660
I came here tonight

720
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,020
out of respect for our hood.

721
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,500
We've already talked

722
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,940
about Mao.

723
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,580
You insisted on keeping him,

724
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,820
and said you could handle it.

725
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,940
I agreed.

726
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,220
But look how it turned out.

727
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,700
Why did he have to show up

728
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,420
in front of Sanmahu of all people?

729
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,780
You know

730
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,860
what Sanmahu is like.

731
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,660
We've lost three batches in a row.

732
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,180
You think that's a coincidence?

733
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,540
If you're

734
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,660
planning to

735
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,020
pull the same old tricks

736
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,260
and play games,

737
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,460
you know better than I do

738
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,660
how that will end.

739
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,780
Time is running out.

740
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,780
I'm not pushing you.

741
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,380
Mr. Sun.

742
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,620
Let me do it.

743
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,780
Long! Long!

744
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,860
It's me. It's me!

745
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,900
It's Mao!

746
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,340
It's me. It's Mao!

747
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,500
Long.

748
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,980
Why are the lights off?

749
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,060
Forgot to pay the bill.

750
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,180
Long,

751
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,660
you scared me to death.

752
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,580
Long.

753
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,180
Why did you come back so late?

754
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,700
I called and you didn't answer.

755
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,340
I was worried sick.

756
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,540
I thought something happened to you.

757
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,900
I'm sorry.

758
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,300
It's okay.

759
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,420
Even if you'd really killed me earlier,

760
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,180
it would've been fine.

761
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,020
As long as you're not angry anymore.

762
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,420
You shouldn't have come back.

763
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,780
I was afraid they'd pull something.

764
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,980
And I was right.

765
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,540
If I hadn't reacted fast,

766
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,780
I'd be waiting to die right now.

767
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,620
So you took it upon yourself
to board the train?

768
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,860
I just...

769
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:11,900
Forget it.

770
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,140
Long.

771
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,860
We lost the goods again.

772
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,260
Is Mr. Sun going to be furious?

773
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
You want to drink?

774
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,300
There's still half a bottle of this.

775
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,140
I was

776
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,540
saving it for when you got back.

777
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,900
No point now.

778
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:03,980
Here.

779
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,700
Long,

780
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,380
is something on your mind?

781
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,700
Come on, talk to me.

782
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
It's going to rain again.

783
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:36,780
Well...

784
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,900
This awful weather.

785
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,620
Always changing.

786
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,380
Mao!

787
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm sorry!

788
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,700
Mao!
