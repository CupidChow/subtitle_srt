00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,010
[Episode 22]

28
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,900
If I knew this would happen,
I wouldn't have gone near to you.

29
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,790
You didn't expect this to happen too.

30
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,470
I thought that

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,950
if that thing of ours

32
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,110
were not swapped,

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,790
our bodies wouldn't switch anymore.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,350
That was just your prediction.

35
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,940
It's Tong Tong's prediction.

36
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,430
What did you say?

37
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,750
Nothing.

38
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,950
I'm thirsty.

39
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,670
I'm Sheng Sheng.

40
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,910
I know.

41
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,460
But I still can't completely

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,630
see you as Sheng Sheng now.

43
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,710
Go get your own cup.

44
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,750
I think I'd better

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,070
keep my distance with the both of you.

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,260
Something feels off.

47
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,510
Although

48
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,460
I knew that

49
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,510
your bodies switched previously,

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,310
but witnessing it

51
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,980
still shocks me greatly.

52
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,750
It's understandable.

53
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,630
Now what?

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,510
We can only try our best to figure out
a way to return to our own bodies.

55
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,150
Sheng Sheng told me that

56
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,590
the body switching will happen

57
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,670
due to physical contact

58
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,110
and something about magnetic resonance?

59
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,150
That's our conclusion for now.

60
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,390
But we have

61
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,550
tried every single way

62
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,190
we can think of.

63
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,150
We can only conclude this in two words.

64
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,150
It's fated.

65
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,750
Since you can't switch back to
your own bodies anytime soon,

66
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,590
what should we do?

67
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,390
I can only stay as Jiang Yi for now

68
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,110
while he as Yu Sheng Sheng.

69
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,470
Wait.
Is he going to

70
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,470
stay here tonight?

71
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,070
He's stayed here before.

72
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,430
He already got used to it.

73
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,590
But I had no idea that
it was him previously.

74
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,070
But it'd be even more inappropriate

75
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,270
for me to stay here.

76
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,470
I'm sorry

77
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,190
for troubling you.

78
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,230
It's okay.

79
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,750
My trouble

80
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,510
is nothing compared to

81
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,550
what you're going through now.

82
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,350
I only wish you switch back to
your own bodies as soon as possible.

83
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,110
Who is that?

84
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,030
Hello. I'm from the property management.

85
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,470
I'm here to check your meter box.

86
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,190
Hold on.

87
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,590
You're right.
We should stay in contact physically.

88
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,220
Just till we get switched back
into our own bodies.

89
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,510
This is just an accident.

90
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,750
Don't think too much.

91
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,270
Do you think it is because of

92
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,710
the joke we made this morning?

93
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,110
Since we fooled the heavens,

94
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,470
so it's now

95
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,590
fooling us in return?

96
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,430
Your explanation

97
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,150
sounds scientifically convincing.

98
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,510
Thank goodness

99
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,870
you don't have work this whole week.

100
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,030
So don't worry.

101
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,350
We have time

102
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,470
to fix this.

103
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,350
We're back to our own bodies now?

104
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,870
It seems to be so.

105
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,070
You should do it.

106
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,310
The property management
has done their routine check.

107
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,630
Everything is fine so they left.

108
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,790
Tong Tong.
We're back to our own bodies!

109
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,870
What's going on?

110
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,910
We switched back into our own bodies.

111
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,230
She's back as Yu Sheng Sheng now.

112
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,110
We really did switch back
to our own bodies.

113
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,790
Are you trying to fool me?

114
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,110
We're not.

115
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,190
We got switched back to our own bodies

116
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,380
out of the blue just now.

117
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,550
This time, fate seems to be

118
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,710
on your good side.

119
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,590
You're right.

120
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,430
The last two times we switched,

121
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,150
it took us a few days to
return to our own bodies.

122
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,740
It was nerve-wracking.

123
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,350
Thank heavens you're back.

124
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,950
I'll go now.

125
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,430
Today's magnetic field seems to be odd.

126
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,350
To be safe,

127
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,990
you should go back first.

128
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,230
Okay.

129
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,030
I'll leave now.

130
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:47,990
Goodbye.

131
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,270
Goodbye.

132
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,350
You came.

133
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,230
You didn't get a good sleep last night?

134
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,350
We don't even dare

135
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,460
meet each other now.

136
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,790
We're afraid that accidents
might happen again.

137
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,630
Meeting each other should be fine,
shouldn't it?

138
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,670
As long as you don't make
any physical contact,

139
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,940
all will be fine, won't it?

140
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,470
But when we meet,

141
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,430
we can't help having physical contact.

142
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,790
The problem is

143
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,790
this is a bomb that can blow up anytime.

144
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,910
Right now, I have no idea
what will come first.

145
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,950
Will it be the accident or tomorrow?

146
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,550
Don't think too much.

147
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,510
Perhaps yesterday's switch

148
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,750
was the last time.

149
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,110
Get on Weibo to relax yourself.

150
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,790
Xu Shu Yi is trending on the hot searches.

151
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,390
I have no interest in that.

152
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,790
It's related to Pei Jia Shu.

153
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,430
What's the gossip now?

154
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,670
It's not gossip.

155
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,750
Xu Shu Yi

156
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,150
took a photo of
a bowl of bird's nest soup

157
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,870
and posted it on her Weibo.

158
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,910
But Pei Jia Shu's fans

159
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,990
saw that it was the same bowl

160
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,790
Jia Shu posted on his Weibo before.

161
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,910
The texture of her table top

162
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,590
is same as the coffee table in his villa.

163
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,310
As for the bird's nest soup,

164
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,710
it's Pei Jia Shu's favourite.

165
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,260
That's why they guessed that

166
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,910
Pei Jia Shu is the one
who made the bird's nest.

167
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,340
They even found that out?

168
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,670
Are they magnifiers?

169
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,390
They're microscopes.

170
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,030
Because of this,

171
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,750
they dug up an old post

172
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,750
on Pei Jia Shu's Weibo

173
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,390
when he promoted Xu Shu Yi's drama.

174
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,540
The fans even looked into
small details of their interactions

175
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,670
in variety shows that
they appeared in together.

176
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,230
They even took screenshots

177
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,070
of Xu Shu Yi's interactions

178
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,110
with other celebrities.

179
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,110
Hence, they concluded that

180
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,150
Xu Shu Yi is trying to develop

181
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,710
a situationship with Pei Jia Shu,

182
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,990
and that she's riding the wave
of his popularity.

183
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,550
So they blast her
to the top of search trends.

184
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,070
Let me take a look.

185
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,030
[I can't take it anymore.]

186
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,260
[Xu Shu Yi, please let Pei Jia Shu go.]

187
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,270
[There's a limit in]

188
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,190
[acting nonchalant.]

189
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,030
[The Little Seedlings are not blind.]

190
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,270
[Let's chew her out.]

191
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,420
[Wench Xu,]

192
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,590
[did you break you arm?]

193
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,870
[Do you have to wrap
your arms around Jia Shu?]

194
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,550
[How dare you share the same towel]

195
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,260
[with Jia Shu in the variety show?]

196
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,230
[You don't deserve it.]

197
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,510
[Xu Shu Yi is cunning and
plays hard to get.]

198
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,510
[Poor Jia Shu.]

199
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,790
[He treated her as his good friend.]

200
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,950
[He even made bird's nest soup for her.]

201
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,790
[I've never met]

202
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,510
[such a disgusting show host before.]

203
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,750
[She's an opportunist]

204
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,910
[who takes advantages of famous people.]

205
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,190
[She's shameless.]

206
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,950
[Xu Shu Yi, get lost from the
entertainment industry!]

207
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,710
[Your outlook on life is a wreck.
You're a shame!]

208
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,030
Isn't this too much?

209
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,590
Are you referring to Xu Shu Yi

210
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,940
or Pei Jia Shu's fans?

211
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,030
Of course I'm referring to

212
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,470
the fans with evil tongues.

213
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,550
Although

214
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,670
I don't really like her

215
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,620
and I even

216
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,750
spoke ill of her

217
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,910
in front of my boyfriend,

218
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,310
but those were just

219
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,470
our private conversation during free time.

220
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,230
These people are openly
criticising her in public.

221
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,470
It's making me

222
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,470
feel uncomfortable.

223
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,110
You're right.

224
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,670
Everytime I read comments like this,

225
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,950
I tend to have a misconception.

226
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,350
These people act like

227
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,310
they have extremely high morals.

228
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,470
It's as if they were never selfish,
never told lies,

229
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,350
and never made mistakes

230
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,500
in their lives.

231
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,630
They always make

232
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,310
the precise judgement of

233
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,910
the rights and wrongs in every situation.

234
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,590
As long as your opinion
is different from theirs,

235
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,150
your outlooks on life is wrong.

236
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,860
I agree with you.

237
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,470
The problem is

238
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,940
they're probably clueless about the idea

239
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,790
of outlooks on life.

240
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,710
Unlike us.

241
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,340
We clearly know that

242
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,070
we are

243
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,990
not saints.

244
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,670
In work,

245
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,510
women have always been at a disadvantage.

246
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,550
Moreover, the entertainment industry
is most competitive

247
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,110
and complicated.

248
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,390
If we switch the genders,

249
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,510
a good-looking younger man

250
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,630
tries to get close to an older woman

251
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,820
by acting cute.

252
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,990
What will you think?

253
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,430
I think that the younger man is adorable.

254
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,430
Exactly.

255
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,740
Women will be accused of
gaining benefits from popularity

256
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,670
and being an opportunist.

257
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,510
While men are seemed adorable.

258
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,790
The mentality in this environment

259
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,350
is harsh on women.

260
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,070
Why don't we

261
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,070
write an article about this?

262
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,710
We'll most probably get chewed out.

263
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,510
It'll still boost our web flow, won't it?

264
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,550
Alright.

265
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,950
I like this righteousness
although we're not saints.

266
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,910
I'll start gathering informations.
Let's go.

267
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,870
Let's go.

268
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,270
What happened to the management
of our fan club?

269
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,670
This topic was not created

270
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,550
by the fan club.

271
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,150
It was an individual doing of a huge fan.

272
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,790
In the end, a huge number of your fans

273
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,230
started to respond to it.

274
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,950
As for this huge fan,

275
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,750
I've arranged a representative
from the publicity team

276
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,750
to communicate with him in private.

277
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,870
As for the fan club,

278
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,550
we'll figure out a way

279
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,270
to convince the inner circle

280
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:34,870
by emphasizing that

281
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,070
you won't gain any benefits
if this situation continues.

282
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,590
Will they listen to you?

283
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,790
It's impossible to convince them all,

284
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,630
but it will help
calm things down at least.

285
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,830
This incident will then naturally
die down soon.

286
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,100
Are you okay?

287
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,350
You sneezed

288
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,310
twice in a shot just now.

289
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,630
Is someone speaking ill of you?

290
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,430
Does your ear itch?

291
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,940
I think I caught a flu.

292
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,510
You can't catch a flu at times like this.

293
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,790
I'll make you some medicine.

294
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,870
Drink it while it's hot.

295
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,870
I just finished talking to

296
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,790
Xu Shu Yi on the phone.

297
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,150
She told me that she's fine.

298
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,540
She's not much affected.

299
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,070
I've also told her that

300
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,110
you're trying to handle the situation now.

301
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,150
She wants me to thank you

302
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,070
on her behalf.

303
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,190
For now,

304
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,310
this matter is still under control.

305
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,110
You can tell her that in private

306
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,990
to make her feel better.

307
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,230
But don't make any response

308
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,910
on your Weibo.

309
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,150
It's inappropriate

310
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,070
to say anything now.

311
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,790
Since Le Yi is not around now,

312
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,350
I'll explain to him personally

313
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,260
when he's back.

314
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,630
Right now, the best way to

315
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,430
handle this matter is

316
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,310
to be slow and careful.

317
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,310
We'll wait for the heat to die down.

318
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,310
I need to return to the office now.

319
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,710
Wait.

320
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,190
I have something to tell you.

321
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:14,990
Sure.

322
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,070
Meet up?

323
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,100
I don't think it's a good idea.

324
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,860
Is dating through our phones

325
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,030
the only solution now?

326
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,990
I don't mean that.

327
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm just worried.

328
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,310
Avoiding each other
doesn't solve the problem.

329
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,590
It might even become

330
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,590
a psychological obstacle.

331
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,350
Have you found a solution?

332
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,830
We'll talk when you come over.

333
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,870
Don't worry if we get switched again.

334
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,630
I've found an excuse.

335
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,070
I've told Jiang Da Chuan

336
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,990
to cancel

337
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,070
as many gigs as he can this week.

338
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,390
If worse comes to worst,

339
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,750
we'll just play each other's role.

340
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,510
Are you scared?

341
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,510
Who is scared?

342
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,070
Bring it on.

343
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,110
I'll get off work an hour earlier today.

344
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,020
I'll go to you.

345
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,750
Let's break through this together.

346
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,430
We'll take every challenge as it comes.

347
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,910
I'll be waiting for you.

348
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:33,990
Mo Mo.

349
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,390
Make me look handsome.

350
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,830
My teacher told us to draw the features.

351
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,550
Listen to your teacher then.

352
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,390
Mo Mo. Continue drawing.

353
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,430
I need to answer a call.

354
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,910
Hello, Mo Mo.

355
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,630
Who are you?

356
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,150
I don't know you.

357
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,190
I...

358
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,630
I'm her friend.

359
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,070
You're Miss Sheng Sheng's friend?

360
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,230
She told me she misses you.

361
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,710
But she has

362
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,670
my phone number.

363
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,990
Why didn't she tell me that herself?

364
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,190
Sure.

365
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,670
I'll contact you tomorrow.

366
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,870
I'm leaving now, Mo Mo.

367
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,620
Goodbye.

368
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,540
What are you looking at?

369
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,590
Let's continue.

370
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,910
It's nothing.

371
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,870
I'm back now.

372
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,190
Alright. Stay still.

373
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,910
What a coincidence.

374
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,550
Luck is on my side today.

375
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,750
Why didn't they come together?

376
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,670
Didn't you say you're not scared?

377
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,430
You're annoying.

378
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,150
Do you remember

379
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,590
what we said when we first

380
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,590
got together?

381
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,230
What is it?

382
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,150
We said that if the body switch
ever happens again,

383
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,660
as long as we find a way
to switch it back,

384
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,310
everything will be fine.

385
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,030
I remember that.

386
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,110
But when it really happened,

387
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,630
it's hard to not feel defeated.

388
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,230
To be honest,

389
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,110
I feel the same.

390
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,190
But we have faced this crisis

391
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,470
together

392
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,350
for many times,

393
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,990
so I believe this time

394
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,510
we can

395
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,390
overcome it too.

396
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,670
Believe in ourselves.

397
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,830
Go ahead and tell me

398
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,990
your thoughts about it.

399
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,230
I'll fully cooperate.

400
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:03,510
I think

401
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,590
instead of

402
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,710
living in constant fear,

403
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,790
afraid of physical contact

404
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,550
and even afraid of meeting each other,

405
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,670
why don't we face it upfront?

406
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,510
We'll figure out the conditions

407
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,230
for our body switch to happen.

408
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,060
I agree.

409
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,150
The anxiety of waiting

410
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,310
is a torture.

411
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,990
I have a feeling that

412
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,470
the body switch that
happened twice last night

413
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,630
is different from

414
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,630
the ones that happened last few times.

415
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,750
How are they different?

416
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,270
Other than being unconscious

417
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,070
during our first body switch

418
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,140
that happened in the elevator,

419
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,110
the three other body
switches that happened

420
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,710
were followed by

421
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,350
long hours of dizziness and discomfort.

422
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,300
However, these symptoms

423
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,830
were not as strong as before.

424
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,470
Moreover, they only lasted for a while.

425
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,790
You have a point.

426
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,630
I experienced the same too.

427
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,110
After combining the body switch

428
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,470
that happened twice last night,

429
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,830
I'm guessing that

430
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,990
perhaps the conditions of
getting our bodies switched

431
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,270
have been simplified.

432
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,630
You're saying that

433
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,350
our bodies have already

434
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,910
got used to the switch?

435
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,350
I'm not sure.

436
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,230
My guess

437
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,110
could be wrong too.

438
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,070
So you called me over

439
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,150
to verify your guess?

440
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,750
However,

441
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,940
there is a risk of doing this.

442
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,190
If the first body switch is successful

443
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,190
but the second fails,

444
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,750
we'll be in a big trouble.

445
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,230
I'm not afraid.

446
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,390
It's still better than

447
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,390
living in constant fear.

448
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,820
In that case, let's start.

449
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,270
Brother, the body switch is successful.

450
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,550
It's magical!

451
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,350
Let's try again.

452
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,190
Let's see if we can switch
our bodies back the same way.

453
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,950
No.

454
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,270
Let's change another way.

455
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,150
What is it?

456
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,860
Hooray!

457
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,550
We did it again.

458
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,390
It seems that

459
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,710
we're going in the right direction.

460
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,790
Let's try other ways.

461
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,110
Okay.

462
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,910
It seems like

463
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,670
this also works.

464
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,430
Brother.

465
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,060
Let's try

466
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,310
the one I suggested.

467
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,470
You can do it.

468
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,740
We did it!

469
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,430
Quick! Drink some water.

470
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,750
Drink some water.

471
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,500
Based on today's verification,

472
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,030
it's proven that as long as

473
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,430
our emotions change at the same time,

474
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,910
the probability of body switch

475
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,710
is quite high.

476
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,830
You're right.

477
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,550
It turned out to be a success today
when we thought that we'll fail.

478
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,950
It felt like we've evolved.

479
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,430
It's so magical.

480
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,030
Brother.

481
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,590
Is it safe to say that

482
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,830
we have superpowers now?

483
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,310
What superpowers?

484
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,750
We can switch our bodies

485
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,550
and exchange our lives anytime.

486
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,230
Think about it.

487
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,910
When I'm too lazy to work,

488
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,950
we can switch our bodies.

489
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,310
You can go to work on my behalf.

490
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,270
When you don't feel like resting,

491
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,190
we can switch our bodies.

492
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,670
I'll lie down on your behalf.

493
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,820
You seem to be enjoying it.

494
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,990
Since things have come to this,

495
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,470
we have to stay optimistic.

496
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,190
Life goes on and our love life continues.

497
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,310
What do you say?

498
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,030
I should be the one cheering you up.

499
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,070
It's the same.

500
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,750
You come up with strategies

501
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,350
while I provide moral support.

502
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,390
We'll work in cooperation.

503
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,710
Moreover, we've verified that

504
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,430
the condition of getting our body switched

505
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,550
constantly changes.

506
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,950
Perhaps the conditions will become better.

507
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,990
It will become better in future.

508
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,060
That's right.

509
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,350
Since you say our love life continues,

510
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,390
why don't we go for a movie later?

511
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,990
A movie?

512
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,310
Is it a good idea?

513
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,670
I'll reserve the entire movie hall

514
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,990
for just the both of us.

515
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,750
That will solve all concerns.

516
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,270
Okay.

517
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,870
Hello?

518
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,780
Hello?

519
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,350
Can you hear me?

520
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,870
[Hello? Is this Yi?]

521
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,190
[What is up?]

522
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,990
You're the one who called me first.

523
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,780
Are you drunk?

524
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,230
[I drank a little at home.]

525
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,110
[Don't call me anymore.]

526
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,230
[I'll get scolded again
if anyone found out.]

527
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,190
Shu Yi. Stop reading the
comments on the internet.

528
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,390
[Leave me alone.]

529
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,300
[Enjoy your love life]

530
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,430
[with Reporter Yu.]

531
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,310
Don't drink too much.

532
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,590
[This is giving me a hard time.]

533
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,350
[Living in this world]

534
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,430
[is giving me a hard time.]

535
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,140
[The number you dialled
cannot be reached now.]

536
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,310
She switched off her phone.

537
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,590
Do you know where she lives?

538
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,670
Let's go check on her.

539
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,630
I'm worried.

540
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,990
Sure.

541
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,110
Let's go.

542
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,270
[Wench Xu]

543
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,550
[is indeed a playgirl.]

544
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,310
[She's trying to seduce
every member in Little Galaxy.]

545
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,470
[Is she acting like the
fandom doesn't exist?]

546
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,510
[If you dare go near Jiang Yi again,]

547
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,140
[prepare to get washed up.]

548
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,830
[Xu Shu Yi seduces everyone she meets.]

549
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,910
[She's always close with]

550
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,670
[all male celebrities in the industry.]

551
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,270
[Her plots are not working now.]

552
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,110
[Get lost, as far as you can.]

553
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,390
Only Jia Shu's fans

554
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,910
were attacking her earlier today.

555
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,860
Now, even your fans,

556
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,270
including Little Galaxy's fandom

557
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,940
and the fans of other celebrities

558
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,350
are looking for excuses to scold her.

559
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,310
They're just jumping on the bandwagon
and creating something out of nothing.

560
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,870
No wonder Xu Shu Yi

561
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,830
feels miserable.

562
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,990
I don't hear anything.

563
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,710
Did something really go wrong?

564
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,430
I've saved

565
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,550
her manager's phone number before.

566
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,270
I'll try asking her.

567
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,430
Why did you come?

568
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,430
We came to see you.

569
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,750
Don't touch me.

570
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,070
You have a girlfriend now.

571
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,750
We have to keep our distance.

572
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,990
Make her a drink to sober up.

573
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,190
I'll take care of her.

574
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,430
You...

575
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,670
Stop drinking.

576
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,710
You've drunk a lot.

577
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,270
Don't worry. I didn't.

578
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,510
Look.

579
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,420
I recognise you.

580
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,500
You're Yu Sheng Sheng, aren't you?

581
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,030
Yes.

582
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,870
You are Yi's girlfriend.

583
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,150
You're right. Stop drinking anymore.

584
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,150
You'll get drunk if you continue.

585
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,190
I swear to the heavens

586
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,350
that I'll keep this

587
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,830
a secret for you.

588
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,190
I know.

589
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,630
Jiang Yi believes in you.

590
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,030
I believe in you too.

591
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:16,980
Also,

592
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,710
don't bother about the comments
on the internet.

593
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,030
Jiang Yi doesn't agree with them.

594
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,630
He sincerely treats you
as a good friend.

595
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,830
You know what?

596
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,630
I treated them sincerely

597
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,790
as my friends too.

598
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,830
But their fans

599
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,670
accused me of riding a wave
of their popularity.

600
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,390
Yes, it is true.

601
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,900
But they're already so popular,

602
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,230
it won't do them any harm even if
I took advantage of their popularity.

603
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,830
You're right.

604
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,150
It won't do them any harm.

605
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,910
Even if they become less popular,

606
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,470
it's none of your doings.

607
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,950
Why are you crying again?

608
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,510
Put it down first.

609
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,750
She is feeling wronged.

610
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,380
I feel very wronged.

611
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,630
Their fans scolded me

612
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,230
for seducing anyone I meet.

613
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,670
But I have a bottom line too,

614
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,550
you know?

615
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,350
I won't go near people like him

616
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,700
who already has a girlfriend.

617
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,510
I won't go near people who are ugly too.

618
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,590
I like good looking guys too.

619
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,390
Alright. Cheer up now.

620
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,030
Sheng Sheng.

621
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,550
I owe you an apology.

622
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,110
Before this, I...

623
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,630
Before this...

624
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,070
It's my fault.

625
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,710
I was mainly afraid that

626
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,990
you will take Yi away from me.

627
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,830
I want to apologise to you too

628
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,350
for my bad attitude.

629
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,590
I even spoke ill of you.

630
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,070
The both of you must be careful.

631
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,270
Don't get caught by the paparazzi.

632
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,700
I got it.

633
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,990
Don't worry.

634
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,150
You must take good care of Yi.

635
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,900
We suffered the same fate.

636
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,510
We feel bitter inside.

637
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,590
Okay.

638
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,230
Don't worry.

639
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,230
I'll take good care of him.

640
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,030
You know what?

641
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,270
I feel very bitter inside.

642
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,070
That's why I envy you.

643
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,230
You envy me?

644
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,550
I mean your friend.

645
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,310
I heard that

646
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,110
she comes from a wealthy family.

647
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,270
So she is free to do anything
that she desires

648
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,950
since young.

649
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,230
Unlike me.

650
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,670
I came from a poor family.

651
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,350
So I had to work very hard.

652
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,710
It wasn't easy for me
to reach this status.

653
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,350
I did it all by myself.

654
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,380
I've never...

655
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,110
I've never

656
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,030
hurt anyone else.

657
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,150
I know.

658
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,950
But they're attacking me with their words.

659
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,710
They're attacking me.

660
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,310
Where is my wine?

661
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,270
It's here.

662
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,590
Here you go. Drink this.

663
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,830
Has Xu Shu Yi ever

664
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,270
got drunk in front of you?

665
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,470
This is my first time seeing her drunk.

666
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:42,910
In that case,

667
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,830
she must have buried her unhappiness

668
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,870
in her heart all this time.

669
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,670
This incident

670
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,270
became the trigger to her meltdown.

671
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,950
Just as you said,

672
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,110
when humans

673
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,350
suppress their emotions for a long time,

674
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,190
they must have a cathartic release
of stress too.

675
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,590
Hopefully she'll feel better

676
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,100
when she wakes up tomorrow.

677
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,070
Hello?

678
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,110
Listen up.

679
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,230
For those who are standing by
at the main gate,

680
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,310
you better get your act together.

681
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,270
Stay focused

682
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,110
and don't let the target slip away.

683
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,470
If that happens,

684
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,390
all the waiting tonight
will go to waste.

685
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,470
If the target doesn't show up

686
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,390
by 12 o'clock tonight,

687
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,340
we'll retreat.

688
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,810
[Wonderful Media]

689
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,310
The chief editor has matters to deal now.

690
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,750
Our meeting will be postponed
to ten minutes later.

691
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,230
Did you see

692
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,940
what Pei Jia Shu's fans

693
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,750
commented at Xu Shu Yi's Weibo?

694
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,430
The way they attack her

695
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,590
is omnifarious.

696
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,830
It's a real eye opener for me.

697
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,590
I couldn't bear reading these comments

698
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,860
after just a glance at it.

699
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,070
Pei Jia Shu's fans

700
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,390
have gone too far this time.

701
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,910
Don't discriminate against all his fans.

702
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,340
Those were just the individual behaviours

703
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,510
of some of his fans.

704
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,350
You're right. Individual behaviours.

705
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,670
It doesn't represent the whole fandom.

706
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:45,990
Sheng Sheng is also

707
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,990
one of Pei Jia Shu's fans.

708
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,830
They're planning to write an article

709
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,190
to defend Xu Shu Yi.

710
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,230
We're not trying to defend anyone.

711
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,830
We're just discussing about facts.

712
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,070
That's right.

713
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,750
In conclusion,

714
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,070
their courage is commendable.

715
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,870
I remember that Xu Shu Yi

716
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,750
was quite a people person back then
in the entertainment industry.

717
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,150
Why aren't there any celebrities

718
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,230
who are willing to speak for her?

719
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,550
Pei Jia Shu's fans

720
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,230
are the ones who

721
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,150
started this commotion in the first place.

722
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,940
If Pei Jia Shu doesn't speak up,

723
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,750
the other celebrities

724
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,870
won't either.

725
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,470
Isn't that a bitter pill

726
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,110
for him to swallow?

727
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,750
That can't be helped.

728
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,790
Pei Jia Shu

729
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,300
will never speak up.

730
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,430
His public persona is known to be
overly protective towards his fans.

731
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,190
Moreover, this is a sensitive issue.

732
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,750
If he chooses to speak up,

733
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,390
things will get ugly for his fans.

734
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,100
Sheng Sheng, what do you think?

735
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,510
I have no opinion on this.

736
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,470
It's understandable
if he chooses not to speak up.

737
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,390
After all, every move

738
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:33,990
the celebrities take

739
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,110
involves the interests of others.

740
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,270
Moreover, even if he wishes to speak up,

741
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,230
his company will definitely stop him.

742
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,830
Celebrities nowadays

743
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,470
are like dummies.

744
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,750
You expect them to speak up?

745
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,110
It's already a miracle

746
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,070
if they typed the words on Weibo

747
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,910
on their own.

753
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,630
Alright, we're done for today.

754
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,390
I've some matters to attend to.

755
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,710
Okay. We'll get going.

756
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,750
Goodbye.

757
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,750
Thank you for your hard work.

758
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,270
We'll get going first.

759
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,790
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

760
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,510
Former classmate.

761
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,430
Do you want to take a seat here?

762
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,270
How is it?

763
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,270
Do I look extra handsome

764
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,470
when I dance today?

765
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,710
Yes. You looked very
handsome and attractive.

766
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,420
I'm not used

767
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,550
to your upfront compliments.

768
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,910
After the last few days,

769
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,070
did you rediscover

770
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,990
a new person in me?

771
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,630
I did learn about a different part of you.

772
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,790
Which part of me?

773
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,270
After watching you dance just now,

774
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,110
I noticed that every dance move
is delicate and cool,

775
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,710
but they were pre-choreographed by you.

776
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,150
You only show the audiences
what you want them to see.

777
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,310
The same thing applies to the both of us.

778
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,470
During our last few meet-ups,

779
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,630
I only saw the side of you

780
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,910
that you wish to show.

781
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,350
So you think

782
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,140
I'm just acting in front of you?

783
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,340
You misunderstood me.

784
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,750
I'm saying that

785
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,420
humans have different sides.

786
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,030
Although you're expressing
your whole self genuinely,

787
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,030
but I only saw a particular side of you.

788
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:57,990
Very well then.

789
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,470
You told me this afternoon that

790
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,190
you're still thinking about the ending?

791
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,070
Do you still need me

792
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,180
to provide you any information?

793
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,150
It's fine. You've helped me
more than enough.

794
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,390
I'll think about it on my own.

795
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,390
It's no big deal.

796
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,350
I thought

797
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,030
you'd send me

798
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,980
the first draft yesterday.

799
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,230
I had to make some last minute changes

800
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,270
to Xu Shu Yi's article yesterday.

801
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,900
It will be sent out later.

802
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,630
Following up with the hot topic.
That's understandable.

803
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,910
Sheng Sheng and Jiang Yi

804
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,380
went to meet Xu Shu Yi last night.

805
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,470
She was drunk.

806
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,190
Jiang Yi already told me about it.

807
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,540
Sheng Sheng came up with
a few new perspectives

808
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,510
that she wishes to add in the article.

809
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,590
She's making some amendments now.

810
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,430
Is it convenient for you
to tell me about it?

811
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,910
We're worried about

812
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,790
Xu Shu Yi's life in the future.

813
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,860
Her reputation will be damaged for sure.

814
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,710
To prevent fans from making a scene,

815
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,070
many celebrity agencies

816
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,910
will avoid hiring her

817
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,270
to host events.

818
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,430
Also,

819
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,950
how is she supposed to interact

820
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,270
with other male celebrities in future?

821
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,830
Will she be traumatized

822
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,710
for having to worry if any of her words

823
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,990
or actions

824
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,140
get misinterpreted?

825
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,150
People will then rake up the past

826
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,070
and attack her again.

827
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,030
She'll be surrounded by fear

828
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,390
and eventually lose her ability to work.

829
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,350
Yu Sheng Sheng and you are kind souls.

830
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,430
I admire the both of you.

831
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,790
I mean it.

832
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,790
I just realised that

833
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,470
you don't seem to care

834
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,630
about this matter.

835
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,430
Your mood is not affected at all.

836
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,430
Isn't Xu Shu Yi your friend?

837
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,870
Are you thinking that

838
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,470
I'm not being a man now?

839
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,660
No.

840
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,390
What do you suggest I should do?

841
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,830
I'm sorry. I've overstepped the boundary.

842
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,510
I know the entertainment industry

843
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,790
is complicated

844
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,310
and there's a set of rules
in how things work.

845
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,310
As a celebrity, you're placed
at a tight spot

846
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,670
and restrained by many factors.

847
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,870
So, that makes it hard for you
to be your true self

848
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,820
and express your real thoughts.

849
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,390
I can understand you

850
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,590
and your industry.

851
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,510
It's just that I don't like it.

852
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,190
If there's nothing else, I have to go.

853
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,100
♫ The night is used to
the pitch-black darkness ♫

854
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,540
♫ It never thought that it'd someday ♫

855
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,060
♫ Cross paths with brightness ♫

856
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,810
♫ The shooting star
must be missing someone ♫

857
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,170
♫ To be diving hard without hesitation ♫

858
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:46,150
♫ Towards a better tomorrow
in brave pursuit ♫

859
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,370
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

860
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,180
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

861
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,830
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

862
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,780
♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

863
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,990
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

864
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,310
♫ Time is the best testament ♫

865
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,460
♫ To this journey ♫

866
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,630
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

867
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,740
♫ My soul ♫

868
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,560
♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

869
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,950
♫ I get used to ♫

870
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:24,430
♫ Having you by my side ♫

871
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,670
♫ Understanding each other's
heart is just so precious ♫

872
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,630
♫ Don't need to speak or
beat around the bush ♫

873
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:39,570
♫ I always get a glimpse of your world ♫

874
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,740
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

875
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,300
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

876

♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

882
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,980
♫ My soul ♫

883
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,660
♫ When you left, I realized ♫

884
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,820
♫ Being in love brings two ♫

885
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,080
♫ Souls together ♫

886
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,240
♫ Baby, loving you is... ♫

887

♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

893
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,200
♫ Gradually I mature ♫

894
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,690
♫ With you by my side ♫
