00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,110
What happened?

177
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,190
This...

178
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,390
This scale must be broken.

179
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,510
That day

180
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,790
it read 49.5 kg.

181
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,470
No problem.

182
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,380
You guys eat.

183
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,710
Could it be broken?

184
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,670
Ah!

185
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,220
Curse you, Jiang Yi!

186
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,460
Morning!

187
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,070
Good morning.

188
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,390
[Yu Sheng Sheng, good morning.]

189
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,230
You've given up the sporty look!

190
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,630
Can't I?

191
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,470
You can.

192
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,510
Most people have to dress up.

193
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,950
They are not natural beauty.

194
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,590
Really?

195
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,380
You're knowledgeable on this.

196
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,830
Good morning, Ms. Tong.

197
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,420
Morning!

198
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,830
Your latte.

199
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,910
Thank you.

200
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,310
I got you potato chips.

201
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,950
Why?

202
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,150
They're your favourite.

203
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,870
You dressed up today.

204
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,790
What's the use?

205
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,030
I gain five catties in five days.

206
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,310
Should've swapped with a pig,

207
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,430
and made a farmer super happy.

208
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,630
Nothing.

209
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,310
You're staring.

210
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,390
Did I gain that much weight?

211
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,710
Look.

212
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,190
Is it obvious when I am wearing a skirt?

213
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,390
That's odd.

214
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,180
In comparison,

215
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,910
you were different

216
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,110
two days ago.

217
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,870
Do you want to hear the truth?

218
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,190
Because of the elevator accident,

219
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,390
Jiang Yi and I swapped bodies.

220
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,710
What you saw before

221
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,190
was actually Jiang Yi

222
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,110
living in my body.

223
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,980
Now, you've swapped back?

224
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,270
Strictly speaking,

225
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,670
we swapped back yesterday.

226
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,390
I'll tell you this. Don't get angry.

227
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,590
We kissed

228
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,510
and swapped back.

229
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,270
Kissed?

230
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,830
Kissed.

231
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,660
Was that what happened?

232
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,790
Do you believe me?

233
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,830
Of course,

234
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,230
you look so serious.

235
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,910
Continue the story.

236
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,310
Okay.

237
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,820
It was actually the elevator accident.

238
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,510
Didn't Dr. Shen say

239
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,790
post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD?

240
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,150
Life is unpredictable.

241
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,270
I don't want to

242
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,940
waste my time on dressing up.

243
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,790
So, do you feel

244
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,150
better now?

245
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,950
A bit better.

246
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,710
We have scores of years to live.

247
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,190
We should live a more refined life.

248
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,830
We should live life healthily

249
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,430
and cheerfully everyday.

250
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,510
It's great that you think like this,

251
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,550
or I have to escort you

252
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,830
to a psychiatrist.

253
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,110
I knew no one would believe me.

254
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,070
You helped me clean up my desk.

255
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,910
Didn't you do it yourself?

256
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,350
Just kidding.

257
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,550
Ms. Yu Sheng Sheng.

258
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,310
Here!

259
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,460
Your fruit bouquet.

260
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,190
Here.

261
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,390
Thank you, mother earth,

262
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,110
for the delicious strawberries,

263
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,750
but thank you even more

264
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,150
for falling from the sky.

265
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,590
You are sweeter than strawberries. Shen.

266
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,910
Wow, so sweet.

267
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,140
It is too sweet.

268
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,510
Wash and eat them.

269
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,550
Are you willing to let us eat them?

270
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,710
Take them and eat.

271
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,670
Sister Sheng Sheng, you're blushing!

272
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,030
You are sweeter than strawberries.

273
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,830
Thanks.

274
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,470
Did you accept Dr. Shen again?

275
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,030
What do you mean again?

276
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,950
You

277
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,070
liked him in high school.

278
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,470
How should I say it?

279
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,070
It was complicated.

280
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,500
Don't explain.

281
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,630
Best wishes.

282
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,110
Actually,

283
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,150
we are just friends.

284
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,430
I know.

285
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,150
Your mother likes him very much.

286
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,510
He has good qualifications.

287
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,790
You could try dating him.

288
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,150
That'll be very good.

289
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,790
How should I put it?

290
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,270
I don't have that kind of feeling for him.

291
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,190
Anyway, it just feels complicated.

292
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,260
Decisions

293
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,430
are always complicated.

294
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,870
Just try dating,

295
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,590
and give each other a chance.

296
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,390
You don't have to marry him right away.

297
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,950
Okay.

298
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,830

I give you two more days.

301
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,590
You write it slowly.

302

303
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,750
Write about what?

304
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,790
I suggest one of the angles is a secret

Not like you.

436
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,790
You earn so much money

437
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,670
but have very few skin products.

438
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,870

Haven't you touched me before?

440
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,230
Touching myself and touching others

441
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,230

442
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,990
Really?

443
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,230
What's the difference?

444
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,630

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,310
What are you cooking?

447
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,070
Fried rice.

448
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,270
Fried rice?

449
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,590
I can only cook fried rice and noodles.

450
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,670
Didn't your dad teach you other dishes?

451
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,030
He said

452
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,310
these two are enough.

453
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,830
Delicious and filling.

454
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,510
If I want something more,

455
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,910
he'll cook for me.

456
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,110
Your dad loves you very much.

457
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,990
Parents always think of ways

458
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,390
to pamper their children.

459
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,270
My mum loves me too,

460
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,590
but sometimes

461
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,940
she nags too much.

462
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,830
I'll wash the rice.

463
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,990
Okay.

464
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,350
Mo Mo.

465
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,350

Welcome.

470
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,390
Why is this different?

471
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,750
What?

472
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,750
You want red flowers as rewards?

473
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,950
No.

474
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,790
I've never

475
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,870
taken care of children.

476
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,260
But I know

477
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,710
feeding them is definitely a headache.

478
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,830
When I was little,
if I didn't eat properly,

479
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,830
my dad would think of different ways

480
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,790
and tricks

481
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,380
to attract me to the table.

482
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,070
Eat quickly, Mo Mo.

483
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,590
Isn't it delicious?

484
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,180
I think

485
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,670
your dad cooked better.

486
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,990
Thanks for reminding me.

487
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,750
I forgot I have to settle

488
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,830
a score with you.

489
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,270
To help you stay in shape,

490
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,150
I literally ate grass everyday.

491
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,580
I starved nightly

492
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,790
till I couldn't sleep.

493
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,950
As for you,

494
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,310
you didn't skip any meal.

495
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,150
You had supper at night

496
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,510
and braised pork in the morning.

497
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,190
It was only for a while,

498
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,110
and you helped me gain five catties.

499
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,390
Why don't you eat?

500
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,790
Don't dodge the issue.

501
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,830
I gained weight,

502
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,150
and you don't care.

503
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,430
Tell me.

504
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,390
For my five catties of meat,

505
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,110
how would you compensate?

506
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,550
Let's settle our scores

507
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,990
clearly.

508
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,390
I cradled the walnuts for seven years,

509
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,190
averaging half an hour daily,

510
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,750
which amounted to 1,200 hours,

511
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,030
or at least 50 days.

512
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,100
Time is precious.

513
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,830
How do you compensate for the 50 days?

514
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,190
Mo Mo,

515
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,670
is my rice tasty?

516
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,150
You don't like peas?

517
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,230
What kind of brother are you?

518
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,030
Why didn't you tell me?

519
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,430
I didn't know.

520
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,270
Hadn't your family eaten peas?

521
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,190
Why didn't you know?

522
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,950
Why should I know?

523
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,550
So, you didn't know.

524
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,510
Don't be so fierce.

525
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,310
It's okay, Mo Mo.

526
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,390
You don't have to eat.

527
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,750
Later, I'll make noodles.

528
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,030
Don't be picky.

529
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,790
Fold out the right wing.

530
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,470
Fold the other one also.

531
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,190
Origami paper crane flies to you.

532
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,110
Sister, you're awesome.

533
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,830
I want one more.

534
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,830
Sure.

535
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,550
Correct?

536
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,630
I'll catch up.

537
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,390
Okay.

538
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,750
I'll catch up.

539
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,470
I'm overtaking you!

540
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,430
What should I do? What?

541
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,870
I overtake you!

542
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,790
I bathed Jiang Mo,

543
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,110
and got my clothes wet.

544
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,580
May I borrow yours?

545
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,670
Yes.

546
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,510
Don't move.

547
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,470
I can get it myself.

548
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,190
Although you

549
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,070
know this room,

550
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,070
I am

551
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,350
still the owner.

552
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,950
Okay, I overstepped the bounds.

553
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,670
Thank you.

554
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,740
Go out.

555
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,270
Me?

556
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,150
I thought

557
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,510
you want to watch me change.

558
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,310
Not interested in your body.

559
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,430
After all,

560
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,580
I've seen every part

561
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,710
of it.

562
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,110
Me too.

563
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,820
Even if you stand

564
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,990
naked in front of me,

565
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,510
I will treat you like air.

566
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,150
Really?

567
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,670
Then,

568
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,830
I stand in front of you,

569
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,430
and you change.

570
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,180
Okay.

571
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,710
Is this

572
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,980
a classic Korean drama plot?

573
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,670
The heroine

574
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,270
got wet at the house of the host,

575
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,030
and put on the male lead's clothes.

576
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,950
She charmed the male lead at once.

577
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,430
Watch less idol dramas.

578
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,030
I'm an entertainment reporter.

579
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,710
That's my job.

580
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,030
Is it your job to watch

581
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,110
a CEO

582
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,230
kiss a poor girl?

583
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,950
How do you know?

584
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,950
That was my mum's line.

585
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:12,830
Mrs. Cai

586
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,390
told everyone.

587
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,110
I'm out of here.

588
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,180
Wait.

589
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,950
Thanks for helping.

590
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,950
You're welcome.

591
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,470
Jiang Mo is nice.

592
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,950
Nicer than her brother.

593
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,310
Actually, that day,

594
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,230
I wasn't angry at you.

595
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,870
But I had a bad attitude.

596
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,990
Sorry.

597
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,910
I've thought about it.

598
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,350
You're a big star.

599
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,830
You work non-stop

600
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,110
and can't spend time with your family.

601
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,070
Your parents are divorced.

602
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,310
So, you have two families.

603
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,630
You don't have enough time.

604
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,150
It's normal not to know everything.

605
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,270
It's okay.

606
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,990
I'll go out.

607
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,590
Time flies.

608
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,350
One day,

609
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,310
a prince on a white horse

610
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,390
passed here,

611
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,350
and saw

612
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,150
Snow White lying in the coffin.

613
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,230
Sister,

614
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,590
why did the prince

615
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,110
ride a white horse?

616
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,340
I like pink.

617
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,510
Okay, pink then.

618
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,510
Time flies.

619
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,500
One day,

620
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,750
a prince on a pink horse

621
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,230
passed here.

622
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,590
The prince is riding

623
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,860
a pink horse.

624
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,270
Mo Mo, be a good girl.

625
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,990
You agreed

626
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,630
to close your eyes while listening.

627
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,390
The prince walked in big strides

628
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,180
to Snow White's coffin

629
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,380
and was deeply captivated

630
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,110
by her beauty.

631
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,670
He fell in love with her right away.

632
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,910
What's wrong?

633
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,710
What is it, Mo Mo?

634
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,380
I want to go home.

635
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,190
I want mum.

636
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,190
Alright, alright, alright.

637
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,030
Mo Mo.

638
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,270
We can't go home now.

639
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,710
It's late.

640
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,310
There is an evil queen outside.

641
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,270
If you go out now,

642
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,830
she'll catch you.

643
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,350
I want to call mum,

644
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,950
and ask her to pick me up.

645
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,510
Good girl, go to sleep.

646
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,870
We go and find mum tomorrow.

647
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,750
Okay?

648
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,110
No.

649
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,550
I want mum now.

650
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,620
Okay, okay.

651
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,390
I want to go home.

652
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,030
I want to go home.

653
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,870
I want mum.

654
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,270
Help!

655
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,950
Help!

656
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,910
Help!

657
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,870
What's going on?

658
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,670
She is crying about going home.

659
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,830
She keeps crying.

660
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,110
Didn't you say she is a good girl?

661
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,030
You can hold grudges.

662
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,150
What should we do now?

663
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,150
Mo Mo, what's wrong?

664
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,340
Sister, I'm tired.

665
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,670
I want to sleep.

666
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,670
Are you the queen

667
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,790
in Snow White?

668
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,270
Why is she so afraid of you?

669
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,710
Nothing else? I'd like to sleep.

670
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,470
I want to go home.

671
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,510
I want mum.

672
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,270
I want to go home.

673
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,710
I want mum.

674
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,270
You really know who to bully.

675
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,150
Sister,

676
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,950
can I borrow your phone?

677
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,070
I want to call mum.

678
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,390
No way.

679
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,190
I'm providing customer service

680
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,070
for my mistake.

681
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,270
If you

682
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,390
want to call your mother,

683
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,230
you must

684
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,070
get your brother's permission.

685
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,670
Mo Mo, be a good girl and sleep.

686
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,350
I'll take you out tomorrow.

687
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,150
Okay?

688
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,750
I want to have a picnic.

689
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,310
Picnic?

690
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,150
Well...

691
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,630
Okay.

692
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,710
We'll have a picnic.

693
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,950
Sleep,

694
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,550
or no picnic

695
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,590
because I'm tired.

696
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,230
Help me apply for a leave.

697
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,670
I can't go to the company today.

698
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,430
[Another leave?]

699
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,030
[Are you sick?]

700
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,350
Not me.

701
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,310
It's my friend's family.

702
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,950
He needs me to babysit.

703
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,670
[What friend?]

704
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,750
Well,

705
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,070
a friend you don't know.

706
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,950
Help me apply for it.

707
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,790
[Okay.]

708
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,430
Okay, that's all.

709
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,070
Thank you, dear.

710
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,710
Bye.

711
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,470
Let me do it.

712
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,550
Don't cut your hand.

713
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,790
I'm not that stupid.

714
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,910
After breakfast,

715
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,630
your sister will have a picnic.

716
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,310
You want to take her out?

717
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,510
Don't mention it.

718
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,510
She cried as soon as you left,

719
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,710
and bargained with me.

720
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,190
She is an observant girl.

721
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,430
Exactly like someone.

722
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,550
I must find a way to get

723
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,950
my girlfriends to unfollow.

724
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,150
Blame me for this also.

725
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,660
Should I

726
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,030
be blamed instead?

727
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,790
I didn't mean that.

728
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,590
What do you mean?

729
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,230
My assistant brought breakfasts.

730
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,630
Sister, look!

731
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,230
It's so pretty.

732
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,550
If you don't want to come, don't come.

733
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,350
As if

734
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,190
I'll sell your sister.

735
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,310
I don't want but

736
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,230
I fear you can't handle her alone.

737
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,630
Not just your sister.

738
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,310
I can't handle any

739
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,630
one of you two.

740
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,190
Sister, I want to eat ice cream.

741
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,230
Ask your brother.

742
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,550
Don't you have enough to eat?

743
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,190
Why are you so fierce?

744
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,670
She's a kid.

745
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,710
She wants

746
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,630
what she sees.

747
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,910
Don't pamper her.

748
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,420
I bought wings

749
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,110
and burgers on the way.

750
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,390
She rarely gets out to play.

751
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,990
Just make her happy.

752
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,550
Mo Mo, do you

753
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,270
especially want to eat ice cream?

754
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,670
Sheng Sheng wants to eat too.

755
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,580
Yi, do you want to eat?

756
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,350
Whatever.

757
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,950
Mo Mo, your brother pushed me.

758
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:23,750
Let's go.

759
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,550
We'll buy ice cream.

760
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,590
We don't give him any.

761
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,430
Let's go.

762
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,630
Let's go and have ice cream.

763
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,430
Let's go.

764
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,550
Catch the bubbles.

765
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:38,910
Try!

766
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,630
Xiao Bo, take a photo.

767
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,140
Take one with dad.

768
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,710
Come, Jiang Yi,

769
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,430
eat something.

770
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,830
Fireflies! Fireflies!

771
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,710
Fireflies!

772
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,270
Fireflies!

773
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,510
I said

774
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,670
don't spoil the kid.

775
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:12,910
Forget

776
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,910
his birthday!

777
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,030
You agreed

778
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,950
to leave work early,

779
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,550
and get the cake at four

780
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,950
in the afternoon and meet here,

781
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:23,830
hike the mountain,

782
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,110
camp, and catch fireflies.

783
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,430
So, now you can't come.

784
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,750
I...

785
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,710
I take him up the mountain alone?

786
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,270
Are you coming?

787
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,390
You insist on camping!

788
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,790
Happy now?

789
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,150
We can't go back.

790
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,150
What's on your mind?

791
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,790
An ice cream for you.

792
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,220
