At such times,

93

96

97
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,990
It's a nice thought.

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,470
But these immature fans

99
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,030

Are you fine with that?

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,670
Never mind.

102
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,510
I'm better off without a fan like this.

reposted Jia Shu's post on Weibo.

109
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,590
Did you coordinate with each other?

110
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,830
Of course we did.

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,350
This morning,

112

about his idea.

114

We figured it's a good idea

115
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,790

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,310
You're cooler than him.

124

on the articles already?

It's not like you're meeting my parent.

Why are you nervous?

142

Just tell her you're my friend.

143
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,830
I'll play it by ear then.

144

you're indeed a man of your word.

I'm not meeting your parent,

Why would you switch bodies with me?

But it turned out badly last time.

You two are too similar to each other.

let the conversation die.

I figured if you were me,

172
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,510
it might be different this time.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,070
I'd love to let go of the past,

174
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,030
relax and move forward.

175
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,870
Besides, didn't you say

176
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,990
switching bodies is a superpower?

177
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,030
It'd be such a waste not to use it.

178
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,110
Fair point.

179
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,950
Don't worry, I'll help you.

180
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,030
I'm very good at pleasing elders.

181
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,070
I'll use your body

182
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,150
to approach Aunty.

183
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,860
I'll surely

184
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,310
bring you two closer together.

185
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,590
Pleasing?

186
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,380
Of course.

187
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,790
If you want to

188
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,910
improve your relationship with her,

189
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,710
one of you has to

190
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,590
take the first step.

191
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,150
I changed my mind.

192
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,550
We should

193
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,390
switch back later.

194
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,750
It's too late,

195
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,310
that ship has sailed.

196
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,870
Coming!

197
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,990
Xiao Yi, you're back.

198
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,430
She's my girlfriend, Yu Sheng Sheng.

199
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,830
Sheng Sheng, this is my mum.

200
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,710
I remember you.

201
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,390
We met before.

202
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,710
Hi, Aunty.

203
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,270
Hi.

204
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,630
Come on in.

205
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,390
Here you go, Ms. Yu.

206
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,630
Thank you.

207
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,830
Have some tea first.

208
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,030
I'll be in the kitchen.

209
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,020
What's the smell?

210
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,900
It smells good.

211
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,910
This is chicken soup.

212
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,420
It's going to take a while.

213
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,110
I can tell it's delicious from the smell.

214
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,670
Sheng Sheng likes chicken soup too.

215
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,150
Really?

216
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,070
That's great.

217
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,550
Ms. Yu,

218
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,500
is there anything

219
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,230
you'd like to eat?

220
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,910
I'm fine with anything.

221
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,150
I didn't know you were
coming with Xiao Yi.

222
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,100
I've only prepared the food

223
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,910
he loved when he was young.

224
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,510
It's okay,

225
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,870
we share the same taste in food.

226
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,230
That's good.

227
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,710
Excuse me,

228
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,710
I need to take this call.

229
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,910
Take good care of Ms. Yu.

230
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,110
Have some fruits.

231
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:17,990
Sure.

232
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,750
Watch your expression.

233
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,590
The same to you.

234
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,190
Stop pulling a long face.

235
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,230
I thought we agreed to
introduce you as my friend?

236
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,230
Why the change of mind?

237
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,670
I'll look around.

238
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,270
Even when you were little,

239
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,350
you had thick brows.

240
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,830
You had a big head.

241
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,710
You looked cute

242
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,710
when you were young.

243
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,910
How old were you?

244
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,510
Probably five years old.

245
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,740
Happy birthday?

246
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,990
Why would you cry

247
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,070
on your birthday?

248
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,990
[Mummy is coming back soon.]

249
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,190
[My mum was very busy.]

250
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,630
[She always worked overtime.]

251
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,510
[That day, I waited a long time for her.]

252
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,070
[A really long time.]

253
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,910
[Bottles fell and broke on the floor]

254
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,430
[and I was weeping bitterly.]

255
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,870
It's been too long.

256
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,390
I only had some flashes of memory.

257
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,150
After all, they fought every day.

258
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,790
It wasn't uncommon for me to cry.

259
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,950
This home

260
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,630
is full of my unpleasant memories.

261
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,990
Perhaps I shouldn't be here.

262
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,260
Alright.

263
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,110
You're

264
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,670
in Yu Sheng Sheng's body now.

265
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,310
Don't be too engaged in Jiang Yi's memory.

266
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,870
Think about this.

267
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,190
Yu Sheng Sheng has
such a good personality.

268
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,310
She's very pretty

269
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,430
and adorable as well.

270
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,870
Now that you're inside her body,

271
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,870
you can get off on the right foot

272
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,750
with your mother.

273
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,230
Are you trying to make me feel better

274
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,750
or complimenting yourself?

275
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,990
I'm complimenting myself.

276
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,310
Take it

277
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,660
as an effort to build a bond

278
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,540
with my future mother-in-law.

279
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,870
Sit here for a while.

280
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,310
I need to buy a bottle of soy sauce.

281
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,790
I've prepared the ingredients.

282
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,950
It won't take long.

283
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,830
I'll buy it for you.

284
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,790
Take a break first.

285
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,910
Never mind.

286
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,430
I'll go.

287
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,990
It's inconvenient for you.

288
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,990
It's okay, I'm wearing a mask.

289
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,470
Have a little chat with my mum.

290
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,910
Take a seat, Ms. Yu.

291
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,670
Take a seat.

292
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,790
Ms. Yu,

293
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,950
can I call you Sheng Sheng?

294
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,470
Sure.

295
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,150
How long have you been together

296
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,110
with Xiao Yi?

297
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,430
Half a month.

298
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,550
But we've known
each other for a long time.

299
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,870
I know everything about him.

300
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,420
We like each other very much.

301
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,990
I can tell.

302
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,150
Xiao Yi likes you very much,

303
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,670
or else he wouldn't

304
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,910
have brought you here.

305
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,350
At that time, I fought

306
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,860
with his dad at the villa.

307
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,230
It must have given you

308
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,550
a bad impression.

309
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,470
I hope you don't mind that.

310
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,470
It's okay.

311
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,110
Jiang Yi told me

312
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,510
the two of you fought a lot

313
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,470
before the divorce.

314
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,070
We did.

315
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,190
We aren't

316
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,430
good parents

317
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,390
and it's left a detrimental impact

318
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,350
on Xiao Yi.

319
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,150
Why did you even get married?

320
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,750
Sheng Sheng,

321
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,230
I don't mind telling you this.

322
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,110
When I was young,

323
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,590
I didn't know anything

324
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,030
other than my studies.

325
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,430
I was in a state of confusion.

326
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,060
At that time,

327
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,790
Xiao Yi's dad

328
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,110
was good looking

329
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,550
and well-spoken.

330
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,190
I really liked him

331
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,270
and so we got together.

332
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,070
But many conflicts emerged

333
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,830
after our marriage.

334
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,350
Hence, fighting

335
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,510
became a part of our routine.

336
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,510
No wonder.

337
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,910
Jiang Yi said that he remembered

338
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,550
you two arguing constantly.

339
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,390
He even spent his birthday

340
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,430
crying.

341
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,310
This photo was taken

342
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,950
on his fifth birthday.

343
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,220
It wasn't because

344
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,870
we were fighting.

345
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,830
Really?

346
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,150
But I remember

347
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,190
Jiang Yi telling me that.

348
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,790
Xiao Yi was wrong.

349
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,990
Let me show you a video

350
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,070
and you'll understand.

351
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,510
[Xiao Yi,]

352
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,750
[we'll record a video]

353
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,910
[of you blowing the candles]

354
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,860
[and eating the cake.]

355
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,870
Dad?

356
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,990
Why isn't Mum back yet?

357
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,710
She should be here any minute.

358
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,910
What took you so long?

359
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,470
Xiao Yi is getting impatient.

360
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,190
I took a day off

361
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,710
but

362
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,150
my colleague had something else to do.

363
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,390
Xiao Yi, I'm sorry

364
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm late.

365
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,430
My little prince looks so handsome today!

366
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,150
Happy birthday!

367
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,500
Why did you prepare beers?

368
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,070
It's our son's birthday.

369
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,870
I'm happy.

370
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,910
Don't drink too much.

371
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,990
Did you get hurt?

372
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,990
Are you okay?

373
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,430
Be careful.

374
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,230
Clean it up quickly.

375
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,950
You're bleeding!

376
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,390
Get up.

377
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,470
Go treat your wound.

378
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,030
I'll take care of the rest.

379
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,750
Go.

380
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,750
Xiao Yi, stay still.

381
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,350
Stay still.

382
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,430
Let's keep going.

383
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,140
Try the meat.

384
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,150
You're growing.

385
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,990
Mummy is hurt.

386
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,030
It's okay, it doesn't hurt.

387
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,110
Why don't you

388
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,390
play the harmonica for me?

389
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,430
It'll make the pain go away.

390
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,750
Really?

391
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,630
Yes.

392
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,870
Why are you crying?

393
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,430
Let me take a picture of you crying.

394
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,060
All right.

395
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,150
I'll stop the recording.

396
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,390
Xiao Yi's been very sweet
since he was young.

397
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,710
The netizens said

398
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,150
he always pulled a long face
and didn't smile.

399
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,150
It's all

400
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,190
because I'm such a failure

401
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,030
as a parent.

402
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,390
You use the harmonica song

403
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,820
as your ringtone.

404
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,270
You noticed that?

405
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,150
I created it myself.

406
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,830
I've been using it

407
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,070
as my ringtone

408
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,110
for many years.

409
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,300
And I keep this video

410
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,990
on my phone all the time.

411
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,590
I'll watch it whenever I feel tired

412
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,270
as it gives me strength.

413
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,710
You loved him so much

414
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,870
and yet you chose to leave him.

415
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,630
Have you ever regretted that?

416
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,630
No.

417
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,350
We all

418
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,030
have multiple identities

419
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,510
and missions in this world.

420
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,030
But we only have

421
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,830
limited energy and capability.

422
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,470
It's hard enough

423
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,870
to be good at one thing.

424
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,710
My career

425
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,990
is what I've been dreaming about.

426
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,310
I want to make some contribution

427
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,470
to

428
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,630
the development of science.

429
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,750
And I happened

430
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,670
to have the talent and capability.

431
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,820
If I have to do it over again,

432
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,580
I still won't give up.

433
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,830
So Jiang Yi

434
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,310
deserved to be abandoned, is it?

435
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,750
I'm sorry.

436
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,950
It's okay.

437
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,510
Xiao Yi must have

438
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,190
told you about

439
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,630
his grievances, right?

440
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,670
I know you feel sorry for him.

441
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,030
Even though I don't regret it,

442
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,150
I regret that

443
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,110
I couldn't be around him

444
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,350
when he grew up.

445
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,220
It weighs heavily on my mind like a stone.

446
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,150
No matter how successful my career is,

447
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,070
I'll always be a failure as a parent.

448
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,910
No matter how much Xiao Yi

449
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,150
blames and hates me,

450
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,310
I can take it.

451
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,590
Sorry,

452
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,030
I got a bit carried away there.

453
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,390
It's your first time here

454
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,390
and yet I kept talking about

455
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,390
sad stuff.

456
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,710
Stay here for a while,

457
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,110
I'll go check if the soup is ready.

458
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,110
Why are you out here?

459
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,550
To pick you up.

460
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,390
You're afraid I'd get lost?

461
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,380
What's wrong?

462
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,710
Did you fight with her?

463
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,990
Right,

464
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,990
you're Yu Sheng Sheng.

465
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,310
I shouldn't have left you

466
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,310
alone in the house.

467
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,460
We didn't fight.

468
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,350
It's just that

469
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,510
I heard

470
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,670
and learnt a couple of things

471
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,140
that are different from

472
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,830
what I remembered.

473
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,270
Turns out

474
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,270
I used to be surrounded by love too.

475
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,750
But it was

476
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,110
hidden behind my sad memories.

477
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,190
Perhaps

478
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,470
your past injury is real,

479
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,910
but their love for you is real as well.

480
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,270
Do you feel better now?

481
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,270
I'm not as sad as before.

482
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,550
At least,

483
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,830
I wasn't always

484
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,590
an extra person.

485
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,230
But as I looked at my mum...

486
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:15,950
When I was young,

487
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,830
I had to keep my head up to look at her.

488
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,630
I thought she'd forever be young,

489
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,550
full of strength

490
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,550
and impenetrable.

491
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,670
But as I looked at her just now,

492
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,190
I suddenly realized that

493
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,270
she's just an ordinary person

494
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,750
who will feel sad,

495
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,870
get old and make mistakes.

496
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,790
Alright,

497
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,630
don't think too much.

498
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,230
Let's go inside.

499
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:14,950
Sheng Sheng,

500
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,830
let's switch back now.

501
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,430
There's something I need to
settle for myself.

502
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,590
Let's switch back then.

503
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,350
Dinner is ready!

504
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,870
Mum, let me do it.

505
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,030
Okay.

506
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,020
I'm not very particular
about the food's appearance.

507
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,590
It doesn't look nice in the photo, right?

508
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,590
It looks good, Aunty.

509
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,750
They look delicious.

510
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,790
I'll forget

511
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,350
about dieting tonight.

512
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,700
Her dad is a chef.

513
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,460
Really?

514
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,390
Please don't laugh at my food.

515
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,590
My dad is a chef

516
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,510
but I'm not.

517
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,590
The only thing I can make
is omelette rice.

518
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,350
Her dad said

519
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,670
she can go home

520
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,270
anytime she wants to eat something good.

521
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,750
It smells so good.

522
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,550
I'll try the soup.

523
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,630
It's hot.

524
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,230
I'll try the vegetables then.

525
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,470
Dig in.

526
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,550
Suit yourself.

527
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,620
Here you go.

528
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,990
Thanks, Aunty.

529
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,190
It's delicious!

530
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,070
It tastes better than my dad's food.

531
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,470
You are so sweet.

532
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,270
I mean it!

533
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,150
This was Xiao Yi's

534
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,230
favourite dish when he was little.

535
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,870
Here.

536
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,660
Help yourself

537
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,390
to the food.

538
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,750
Give me that.

539
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,110
I want more.

540
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,700
How is it?

541
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,950
It still tastes the same.

542
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,510
It's delicious.

543
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,550
Eat more if you like it.

544
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,830
So are you.

545
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,950
Make yourself at home.

546
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,790
Have some more.

547
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,230
Aunty, you should dig in too.

548
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,070
Sure.

549
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,540
Mum, eat some vegetables.

550
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,510
Aunty, try the prawn.

551
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,470
You should try the prawn too.

552
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,910
Do you want me to peel the prawn?

553
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,590
You want to peel?

554
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,990
Sure.

555
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,070
I'll peel the prawn for Aunty too.

556
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,870
You don't have to.

557
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,190
I'll do it then.

558
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,830
Who do you think

559
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,350
can peel faster?

560
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,550
I'm done.

561
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,350
You're fast.

562
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,550
Can you please take

563
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,910
responsibility for your family?

564
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,910
Can you behave like a man?

565
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,430
I don't behave like a man?

566
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,310
You think you're behaving like a woman?

567
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,470
Xiao Yi is still young,

568
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,350
yet you want to go overseas

569
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,270
and leave Xiao Yi here.

570
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,670
You're so heartless.

571
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,030
How many times do I need to tell you?

572
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,870
This is a rare opportunity.

573
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,110
Don't even give me that.

574
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,150
The fact lies before you.

575
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,910
You don't want to
take care of Xiao Yi too.

576
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,950
All these years,

577
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,230
Xiao Yi has been

578
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,590
raising your family for nothing.

579
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,710
Don't you feel ashamed at all?

580
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,150
What do you mean by that?

581
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,670
Xiao Yi doesn't want us

582
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,510
to work

583
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,470
because he's a filial son.

584
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,750
So many years have passed

585
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,950
but you're still

586
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,190
so shameless.

587
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,470
The same to you.

588
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,390
Why did you come back?

589
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,830
You're old now

590
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,110
and you want your son to attend to you,

591
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,550
right?

592
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,070
Back then, you tried

593
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,270
getting rid of us for your dream,

594
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,070
didn't you?

595
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,550
I know I owe

596
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,910
Xiao Yi a lot.

597
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,550
But I'm not like you.

598
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,950
You're insatiable!

599
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:00,750
Did you get hurt?

600
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,830
Be careful.

601
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,870
It's okay.

602
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,550
Clean it up quickly.

603
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,110
You're bleeding.

604
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,670
Alright,

605
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,550
go treat your wound.

606
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,310
I'll take care of the rest.

607
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,310
Aunty,

608
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,750
let me do the dishes.

609
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,310
I need to do some exercise.

610
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,550
Go have a chat over tea.

611
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:23,990
Well...

612
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,540
Go.

613
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,550
Well...

614
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,710
Sheng Sheng

615
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,270
is such a nice girl.

616
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,790
I noticed

617
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,110
you seem more cheerful

618
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,550
after you got together with her.

619
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,790
I'll take you to the airport tomorrow.

620
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,700
Can you do that?

621
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,900
Sure.

622
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,390
Okay.

623
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,780
Xiao Yi.

624
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,030
It's been so long

625
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,350
since we

626
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,430
had a proper meal

627
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,510
together like this.

628
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,870
I'm really happy.

629
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,550
All this while,

630
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,190
I'm not

631
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,590
very good with words.

632
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,470
And you

633
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,150
like to keep things

634
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,070
to yourself.

635
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,670
Actually, I know

636
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,950
you have resentment towards me.

637
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,150
I'm also aware

638
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,990
of everything

639
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,910
I had put you through.

640
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,870
I want to say that

641
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,350
I'm sorry.

642
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,870
Though it might be too late

643
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,860
for me to apologize.

644
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,670
Indeed, it's too late.

645
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,710
We missed the best time

646
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,390
to care for each other.

647
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,070
I know.

648
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,350
That's why I

649
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,910
never expect you to forgive me.

650
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,430
Mum.

651
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,190
Actually,

652
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,780
not every mistake needs to be forgiven.

653
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,550
Although we'd missed

654
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,470
the best time,

655
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,750
it's not the end of our relationship.

656
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,390
Besides, it's not like our relationship

657
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,870
could get any worse than this.

658
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,270
Mum.

659
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,270
Since you'd made

660
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,310
your choice back then,

661
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,310
you should move forward with ease.

662
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,030
I'm doing well.

663
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,110
I hope you can be happy too.

664
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,550
Thank you, Xiao Yi.

665
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,190
Thank you.

666
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,950
You look

667
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,030
a lot like your mum.

668
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,070
Isn't that normal?

669
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,310
How do you feel today?

670
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,510
It feels good

671
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,110
to let yourself go.

672
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,030
Thank you.

673
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:21,870
Right,

674
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,030
what did my mum tell you

675
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,670
in the room?

676
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,550
She said she's grateful to me

677
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,870
and she hopes we'd stay together.

678
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,710
I thought

679
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,950
she wanted to give me an heirloom.

680
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,270
You're so eager to become
her daughter-in-law.

681
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,150
I just wanted to

682
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,310
take some advantage.

683
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,110
I have something to tell you.

684
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,390
Go on.

685
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,790
I received a call from my dad.

686
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,350
Jiang Mo said that

687
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,950
a stranger showed up

688
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,590
with your photo

689
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,150
and talked to her.

690
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,790
My photo?

691
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,510
Why?

692
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,630
I guess he's targeted you.

693
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,540
Is that why

694
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,350
you didn't pick me up

695
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,150
at the company today?

696
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,140
You shouldn't send me home then.

697
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,460
It's dangerous.

698
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,710
I'm sorry.

699
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,830
Why would you apologize to me?

700
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,820
This isn't your fault.

701
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,750
Why would he target me?

702
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,750
Right,

703
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,310
why would he target you?

704
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,510
Jiang Yi and I analysed the situation.

705
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,350
It must be

706
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,870
the paparazzi who sold his photos

707
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,790
to Zhang Zhi Xiao.

708
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,710
I was there when he took photos

709
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,390
of Jiang Mo.

710
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,550
That's why he tried to get something

711
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,390
out of Jiang Mo.

712
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,430
Weren't you

713
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,430
wearing a mask?

714
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,830
Yes.

715
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,470
I don't get it either.

716
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,110
Is there any chance that

717
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,830
he knew it from someone around Jiang Yi?

718
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,950
No.

719
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,750
I guess he isn't sure whether

720
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,190
Jiang Yi and I are
in a relationship either.

721
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,060
He didn't want to waste his time on me,

722
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,870
that's why he went to Jiang Mo.

723
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,190
That makes sense.

724
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,430
The paparazzi usually go to the places

725
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,630
that are popular among the celebrities.

726
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,270
You weren't their target

727
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,310
and so Jiang Yi was less careful

728
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,830
when he came over.

729
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,790
Yes.

730
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,230
That's why I feel even worse.

731
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,390
What should we do now?

732
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,990
Jiang Yi went to
Jiang Da Chuan for advice.

733
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,710
And we decided not to see
each other too often.

734
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,550
We'll wait and see how it goes.

735
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,510
It's better to be safe.

736
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,710
I'm in a relationship but I have to

737
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,710
keep worrying about paparazzi

738
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,470
and switching bodies.

739
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,190
This is so annoying.

740
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:16,910
[Wonderful Media]

741
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,510
Sister Zhi Xiao,

742
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,990
I bought coffee for you.

743
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,150
Spit it out, what do you want?

744
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,750
Little Galaxy's manager, Jiang Da Chuan,

745
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,630
you know him, right?

746
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,270
I do, why?

747
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,510
Someone sold Jiang Yi's photos

748
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,710
to you before, right?

749
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,390
He wants to meet that person.

750
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,910
Why? He wants to take revenge on him?

751
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,190
What are you thinking?

752
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,630
We live in a lawful society.

753
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,830
I guess the agency

754
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,230
wants to build a good relationship

755
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,110
with the paparazzi.

756
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,750
Are you very familiar with Jiang Da Chuan?

757
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,350
I met him several times.

758
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,830
He approached me

759
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,310
and so I had to pass his message.

760
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,910
If he wants to return the favour,

761
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,390
I'll share it with you.

762
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,430
You posted the article about Xu Shu Yi

763
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,670
with perfect timing.

764
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,350
Is it because you had

765
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,470
the inside scoop beforehand?

766
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,830
How could we possibly get

767
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,300
any information of an unexpected event?

768
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,150
You knew we were

769
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,310
working on the article.

770
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,230
All we needed to do
was to add some content.

771
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,830
It's easy.

772
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,950
That's all I needed to tell you.

773
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,110
Just ask him when you have time.

774
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,710
It doesn't matter if he says no.

775
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,060
I'll get back to work now.

776
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,750
Thanks for your help.

777
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,670
Jiang Da Chuan.

778
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,950
That's what I told

779
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,750
Zhang Zhi Xiao.

780
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,990
But I don't know

781
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,870
whether that person

782
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,630
is willing to show up.

783
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,070
It's okay,

784
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,140
Jiang Da Chuan is just

785
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,460
trying to see if there's

786
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,470
another way to settle this.

787
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,540
I know.

788
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,910
I guess that person

789
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,060
has got nothing,

790
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,550
or he would've posted it already.

791
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,510
[He wouldn't have gone to Jiang Mo.]

792
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,670
[Don't worry too much.]

793
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,590
You stole my line again.

794
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,470
Fine, I'll act gentle next time

795
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,590
and let you comfort me.

796
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,670
What are you doing now?

797
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,910
I'm on the way home

798
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,790
to tell my parents about us.

799
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:29,950
Now?

800
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,990
[Yes.]

801
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,630
Just in case...

802
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,310
Just in case

803
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,750
he has our photos

804
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,110
and my parents find out that

805
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,230
we're dating from the news,

806
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,590
I'll be doomed.

807
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,750
You're right.

808
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,190
I'm sorry,

809
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,510
I can't go back with you

810
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,270
this time.

811
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,820
It's okay.

812
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,110
I have a helper.

813
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,220
[Is it Tong Hua?]

814
00:38:59,470 --> 00:38:59,830
Yes.

815
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,190
[I'll talk to you later.]

816
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,350
Bye.

817
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,830
Bye.

818
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,590
If your parents were to disapprove of you

819
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,950
dating a celebrity,

820
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,590
what would you do?

821
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,230
I'll tell them

822
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,020
I'm pregnant then.

823
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,310
When did this happen?

824
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,230
How far along are you?

825
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,990
Stop it!

826
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,550
I'm so nervous right now.

827
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,750
I need to figure out

828
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,030
a way to tell them.

829
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,910
Jiang Da Chuan wants to meet me?

830
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,150
And he asked Yu Sheng Sheng
to pass the message?

831
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,710
It's nearly a month

832
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,030
since the incident.

833
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,070
It seems strange for him

834
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,390
to meet you now, doesn't it?

835
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,550
I made a mistake.

836
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,740
What?

837
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,500
Nothing.

838
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,550
Curly,

839
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,590
is it because you've

840
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,030
captured something

841
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,870
but it was leaked out by someone?

842
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,630
And Jiang Da Chuan wants to
suppress it now?

843
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,750
You know

844
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,190
I always

845
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,950
work alone.

846
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,870
I'd never work

847
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,190
with any talent agency.

848
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,830
They have too many tricks.

849
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:21,830
If I'm not careful enough,

850
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,110
it might turn into blackmail.

851
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,430
I just want to earn money the safest way.

852
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,350
You really have evidence

853
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,710
that Jiang Yi has a girlfriend?

854
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,470
Zhi Xiao,

855
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,230
stop asking about this.

856
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,070
This story is not for you.

857
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,790
We'll work together

858
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,550
if there's a new story next time.

859
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,470
Fine,

860
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,510
I'll get going now.

861
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,870
Stop following him.

862
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,310
It's over.

863
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,270
I spooked them.

864
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,270
That's all we can get from them.

865
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,150
We'll just make up

866
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,380
the rest of the story.

867
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:26,870
Aunty,

868
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,350
go watch TV with Uncle.

869
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,230
Sheng Sheng and I will

870
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,740
take care of this.

871
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,430
Sure.

872
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,950
Here you go.

873
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,790
Tong Hua,

874
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,630
you never eat much

875
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,710
when you're here.

876
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,710
Are you eating enough?

877
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,150
I'm full already.

878
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,590
Don't tell me you're hungry later.

879
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,030
Why aren't you telling them?

880
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,110
There was no right time.

881
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,310
I didn't want to spoil their appetite.

882
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,260
It'll be dawn by the time you find

883
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,350
the right timing.

884
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,270
You're exaggerating.

885
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,030
Let's wait a little longer.

886
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,420
Just act accordingly later.

887
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,620
♫ The night is used to
the pitch-black darkness ♫

888
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,060
♫ It never thought that it'd someday ♫

889
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,580
♫ Cross paths with brightness ♫

890
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,340
♫ The shooting star
must be missing someone ♫

891
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,690
♫ To be diving hard without hesitation ♫

892
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,680
♫ Towards a better tomorrow
in brave pursuit ♫

893
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,890
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

894
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,700
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

895
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,360
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

896
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,300
♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

897
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,520
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

898
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,830
♫ Time is the best testament ♫

899
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,980
♫ To this journey ♫

900
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,150
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

901
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,260
♫ My soul ♫

902
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,080
♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

903
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,470
♫ I get used to ♫

904
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,950
♫ Having you by my side ♫

905
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,190
♫ Understanding each other's
heart is just so precious ♫

906
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,150
♫ Don't need to speak or
beat around the bush ♫

907
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:29,090
♫ I always get a glimpse of your world ♫

908
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,260
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

909

♫ My soul ♫

917
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,180
♫ When you left, I realized ♫

918
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,350
♫ Being in love brings two ♫

919
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,600
♫ Souls together ♫

920
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,760
♫ Baby, loving you is... ♫
