My legs are sore.

Why are you so weak?

33
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,430
This is your body.

34
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,550
You are the weak one.

35
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,830
Is there other move?

Why is your body's core

so weak?

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,590
Brother.

47
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,030
I think your body

48
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,990
can still continue with this.

49
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,670
Continue with it then.

50
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,590

Take a rest then.

53
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,990
It's too exhausting.

54

I can't do it anymore.

Why aren't you using your internal force?

62
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,390
I'm using it.

Don't you think we look like

71
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,390
we are learning some evil martial arts?

72
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,470
After our training is done,

73
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,110
we can control the martial arts world

74
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,990
and rule over the world.

75
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,350
You still have the energy to joke around.

76
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,220
Looks like you are not tired.

77
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,190
I'm tired.

78
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,350
Besides,

79
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,590
I smell so bad.

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,430

81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,500
we take a shower first?

00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,830
Okay.

83
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,830
And then, let's go out and take a walk.

84
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,950
I think there must be something wrong

85
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,230
with the magnetic field inside here.

86
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,590
Okay.

87
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,710
Keep an eye out for me.

88
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,190
Usually, there aren't

89
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,510
many people around at this time.

90
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,830
Okay.

91
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,670
That's right.

92
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,270
We should touch each other more.

93
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,710
It'll be better if we can

94
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,510
switch back to our own body.

95
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,390
If Shen Bo Qing's

96
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,310
speculation is right

97
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,430
and this is related to
the magnetic field resonance,

98
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,150
we won't know

99
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,470
when we'll switch back.

100
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,630
Yes.

101
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,630
Magnetic field

102
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,830
is something that we can't see or touch.

103
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,310
How can we make it resonate again?

104
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,750
Maybe it's because

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,910
we were in the same mood

106
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,550
or we had the same mindset?

107
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,540
Do you have any solution then?

108
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,030
I've thought about some methods.

109
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,750
But those methods
don't sound too promising.

110
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,670
Tell me.

111
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,630
For example,

112
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,270
we can hit each other.

113
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,870
When the fight gets wild,

114
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,950
maybe we'll switch back to our body.

115
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,030
You are the one who asked me to tell you.

116
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,110
Now, you are laughing at me.

117
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,910
I'll stop then.

118
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,430
What else?

119
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,950
Another method is,

120
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,630
we can eat something spicy together.

121
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,590
It'll be so spicy until

122
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,910
we'll cry together.

123
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,510
Very creative.

124
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,990
What else?

125
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,710
Another method is,

126
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,950
we'll hold hand

127
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,830
and touch an electric switch together.

128
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,590
How does your mind work?

129
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,630
Have you realised that

130
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,790
compared to being
the famous artist, Jiang Yi,

131
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,870

Yu Sheng Sheng, a normal citizen,

133
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,990

134
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,750
and you smile more?

135
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,110
Are you saying that

136
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,390
I was keeping the appearance of an idol?

137
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,750
That's not what I meant.

138
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,350
I just want to say that

139
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,990
you seemed to be hiding your emotions.

140
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,340
Why?

141
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,630
I don't know.

142
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,500
I've never thought about that question.

143
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,710
You better smile more.

144
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,670
After we switch back,

145
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,660
continue to keep your smile.

146

You have such a handsome face.

147
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,430
It'll be such a pity if you don't smile.

148

Your mother is so cold.

164
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,950
She just hung up.

165
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,790
That's because we have nothing to say.

166
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,390
You promised

167

to meet her.

168

can't switch back within these two days?

You can meet her then.

171

This is just a routine visit.

172

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,190
you don't want to meet her?

175
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,310
I don't.

176
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,390
Why did you agree then?

177
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,060
Because she is my mother.

178
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,950
My dad always tells me that

179
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,150
when you put everything inside
for too long,

180
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,220
your memory will decline.

181
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,390
You'll have slower reaction time

182
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,980
and it'll be easier to
get into depression.

183
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:14,830
If you are

184
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,830
in a bad mood,

185
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,110
you can talk to me.

186
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,110
Just think of me as a tree hole.

187
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,550
Since young,
your parents have been divorced.

188
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,750
And they sent you to your grandfather.

189
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,390
Do you hate them?

190
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,910
I'm just tired of them.

191
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,430
I don't want to meet them.

192
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,870
Because I've

193
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,350
pushed those memories into a corner.

194
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,030
Whenever I see them,

195
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,230
those memories

196
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,470
will come rushing back.

197
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,830
I'm a child who was abandoned
by my parents.

198
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,910
I'm not worthy of other's love.

199
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,470
My grandfather got
his son late in his life.

200
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,790
He was already quite old back then.

201
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,430
His health was failing and
he was often at the hospital.

202
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,310
So, I had to

203
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,910
move from home to home among my relatives.

204
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,590
What makes you so busy

205
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,910
that you have to send your child here?

206
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,150
Sister, I'm handling a major business.

207
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,310
I have to work too.

208
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,630
And I have to take care of
our father in the hospital.

209
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,270
Sister, help me.

210
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,030
I'll just put him here for three months.

211
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,830
And then,

212
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,310
I'll send him to our uncle.

213
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,590
He's not just my son,

214
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,110
right?

215
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,550
If you are going to be like this,

216
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,780
why did you want a child
in the first place?

217
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,270
Jiang Yi, listen to your aunt.

218
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,110
Don't make her angry.

219
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,190
Or else, no one will take care of you.

220
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,870
What nonsense are you talking about?
Leave now.

221
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,510
Say goodbye to me.

222
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,070
Leave now.

223
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,830
Bye.

224
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,220
You are so full of nonsense.

225
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,180
Mum, I miss you.

226
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,790
When will you visit me?

227
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,310
[Be good, Xiao Yi.]

228
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,750
[I'm busy now.]

229
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,340
[I'll call you later.]

230
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,950
Eat some vegetables.

231
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,510
I don't like to eat these.

232
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,550
I want to eat ham.

233
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,310
You are so picky.

234
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,510
Take it for yourself.

235
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,820
What are you doing?

236
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,580
Leave some for Xiao Yi.

237
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,230
Why are you so childish?

238
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,910
I don't want to share.

239
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,950
This is my home.

240
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,750
He can go back to his own house.

241
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,670
Listen to yourself.

242
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,750
Xiao Yi.

243
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,990
I'll cook it again for you tomorrow.

244
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,190
You can eat other dishes for now.

245
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,110
It's okay, aunty.

246
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,510
I don't like to eat ham.

247
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,940
Come. Let's eat some vegetables.

248
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,310
Good boy. Be careful.

249
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,350
I'll cook you something nice
when we go back.

250
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,830
You are his uncle.

251
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,990
Why didn't you bring him back?

252
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,550
I had to get Meng Meng first.

253
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,670
How would I know that
he'd just walk home?

254
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,910
Hurry up and cook a bowl of

255
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,150
ginger soup for Jiang Yi now.

256
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,310
You can do it.

257
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,270
I have to help Meng Meng
with her homework.

258
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,390
By the way,

259
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,390
ask his aunt

260
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,420
to take him back next week.

261
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,470
[Xiao Yi.]

262
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,790
[I'm going to go back next month]

263
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,950
[and stay for a few days.]

264
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,910
[Do you want to go to the theme park?]

265
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,830
[No.]

266
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,430
[Do you want to eat anything?]

267
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,470
[No.]

268
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,750
[Go and do your homework then.]

269
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,830
[Be good in your aunt's home.]

270
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,710
[Okay?]

271
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,150
Okay.

272
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,350
In their mindset,

273
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,470
after they gave birth to me,

274
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,470
they just needed to give me money

275
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,310
and I'll have to

276
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,110
grow up like a crop.

277
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,350
They can come and go

278
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,630
as they please.

279
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,550
And I'm their son.

280
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,030
So, I have to stay and wait for them.

281
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,310
Have you talked to your parents

282
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,590
about this?

283
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,270
Do you think it's necessary?

284
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,750
I can lend you my shoulder.

285
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,630
That is my shoulder.

286
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,110
Do you want to sleep together tonight?

287
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:11,950
What?

288
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,550
We have no other choice.

289
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,950
We can only spend as much time
as possible with each other.

290
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,630
Yes.

291
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,270
If Tong Hua suddenly comes back

292
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,710
and sees us like this,

293
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,150
will she believe us

294
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,790
if we tell him that we are trying to

295
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,670
switch back our body?

296
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,710
I think she'll go mad.

297
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,590
Wait.

298
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,590
This feels so fascinating.

299
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,910
It's like I'm dreaming.

300
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,670
I've never thought that

301
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,470
my consciousness

302
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,910
will be in someone else's body.

303
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,630
And holding your own hand

304
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,060
while you sleep.

305
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:34,950
Do you think that

306
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,150
this is a good dream

307
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,230
or a nightmare?

308
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,590
If I can go back into my body

309
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,430
without any severe effect

310
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,700
and

311
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,590
I get to experience other's life,

312
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,030
I think this will be a good dream.

313
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,470
What do you think?

314
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,150
When you wake up from a good dream,

315
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,070
you'll feel a sense of loss.

316
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,590
So, you'd prefer to

317
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,070
wake up from a nightmare?

318
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,470
I hope that I won't wake up
from a good dream.

319
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,550
Brother.

320
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,350
Don't be too greedy.

321
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,260
Okay.

322
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,950
I won't be greedy.

323
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,350
Let's live happily then

324
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,670
before we wake up from our dream.

325
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,790
Don't feel a sense of loss
after you wake up.

326
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,750
After all,

327
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,460
that happiness is real.

328
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,430
Okay.

329
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,070
Good night.

330
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,310
Good night.

331
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,390
Okay. Let me take a look.

332
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,110
Later, edit this

333
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,340
and this

334
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,270
for me.

335
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,030
I want to post them on Weibo.

336
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,710
Okay, brother.

337
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,710
Hello, Sister Shu Yi.

338
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,590
Xiao Qing.

339
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,430
Shu Yi, why are you here?

340
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,910
I heard that you are here for a show.

341
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,230
So, I came to greet you.

342
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,510
Xiao Qing.

343
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,310
Buy two cups of coffee for me.

344
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,030
Okay, brother.

345
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,110
How's your schedule for
today and tomorrow?

346
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,870
I think the show today
will continue until night.

347
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,790
And I have to fly to Changsha

348
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,870
tomorrow morning.

349
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,870
So busy?

350
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,830
Do you want to

351
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,830
eat dinner together tonight?

352
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,270
Yi must be free too.

353
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,430
Not only he's free,

354
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,550
his schedule is empty lately.

355
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,750
He didn't even come back
to sleep last night.

356
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,390
Ever since he

357
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,870
met Reporter Yu,

358
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,910
I realised that

359
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,390
he has changed.

360
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,710
Right?

361
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,620
I think so too.

362
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,750
He's acting strange lately.

363
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,350
Is he in

364
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,950
a relationship with Reporter Yu?

365
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,510
I think

366
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,350
for now, they are not
in a relationship yet.

367
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,390
But if you have time,

368
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,430
talk to him more.

369
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,430
He listens to you.

370
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,870
See you tonight?

371
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,390
I can't do it tonight.

372
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,540
My high school friend
is getting married tonight,

373
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,790
I have to go and congratulate him.

374
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,230
Okay.

375
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,190
Next time then.

376
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,470
By the way,

377
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,260
a web series that I've taken part in

378
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,990
has been uploaded.

379
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,910
I just posted on Weibo.

380
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,070
Help me share it out.

381
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,110
Really?

382
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,230
Let me see

383
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,350
the acting skill of

384
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,230
the ex-hostess.

385
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,990
It's already ten.

386
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,350
Why didn't you wake me up?

387
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,230
You were sleeping so soundly.

388
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,550
So, I didn't wake you up.

389
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,150
In order to make more time,

390
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,590
I've been writing until morning
in the past two days.

391
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,710
And yesterday was so hardcore.

392
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,030
I'm too tired.

393
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,830
After you wash your face
and eat breakfast,

394
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,750
we have to continue to try.

395
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,310
Okay.

396
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,350
What is it?

397
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,190
You are so good at make-up.

398
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,310
After we switch back,

399
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,590
teach me how to do my make-up.

400
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,270
After we switch back?

401
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,590
We promised not to meet each other

402
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,550
in case it happens again.

403
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,100
Later after

404
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,190
I cradle those walnuts,

405
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,270
I can deliver them to you, right?

406
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,630
Yes.

407
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,070
Okay.

408
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,670
I'll go and wash my face now.

409
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,870
[Yi.]

410
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,670
[Please share my post on Weibo.]

411
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,590
[Help me promote]

412
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,710
[my new web series.]

413
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,110
Who is it?

414
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,150
Xu Shu Yi asked you to

415
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,310
share her post on Weibo

416
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,670
to promote her web series.

417
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,870
Share it for her then.

418
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,870
You can share it yourself.

419
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,470
Put more effort into it.

420
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,430
I saw

421
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,510
Jia Shu sharing it for her too.

422
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,990
He even wrote a caption for it.

423
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:07,790
Okay.

424
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,430
I think

425
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,710
you are now

426
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,910
at the critical moment of
your career transformation.

427
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,310
You should focus on your career.

428
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,430
You've switched body with Jiang Da Chuan.

429
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,070
Can't I become

430
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,740
your career fan?

431
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,190
A few days ago,

432
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,700
Zhang Shi Xiao treated you nicely

433
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,790
to make you gossip about me.

434
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,340
What gossip?

435
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,750
There's a rumour

436
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,270
saying that Jiang Yi is in a relationship.

437
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,300
You are in a relationship?

438
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,270
I don't even know that.

439
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,910
She gossiped

440
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,830
about you with you.

441
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,150
It's okay.

442
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,110
After we switch back after this,

443
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,110
I'll go and meet her.

444
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,670
Let's see what she wants this time.

445
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,670
But,

446
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,990
if you are really in a relationship,

447
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,830
be careful.

448
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,710
Don't let yourself get photographed.

449
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,500
Didn't you ask me to

450
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,910
focus on my career just now?

451
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,710
Maybe you'll meet someone who suits you...

452
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,070
I think that

453
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,550
Xu Shu Yi really doesn't suit you.

454
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,550
Let it be my farewell advice for you.

455
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,550
Thank you for your sincere advice.

456
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,270
I'll give you one too.

457
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,740
After we switch back,

458
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,710
sort yourself out.

459
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,750
Don't always think that life
is an idol drama.

460
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,870
Find a boyfriend who suits you.

461
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,590
Stop making your parents worry.

462
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,700
Thank you.

463
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,070
That's my plan anyway.

464
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,700
Okay.

465
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,510
Don't worry. I'll go there tonight.

466
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,550
I've seen the photo that you sent.

467
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,430
I never thought that

468
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,820
Tong Hua is one of the bridesmaids.

469
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,430
I haven't seen her for a long time.

470
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,030
Usually, I'll remember the girls who have

471
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,950
liked me before.

472
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,990
Brother Jia Shu.

473
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,070
It's time for the next session.

474
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,190
I can't talk anymore.

475
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,990
See you tonight.

476
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,060
If this continues,

477
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:43,630
I think

478
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,950
we'll be able to have magic power.

479
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,790
How about

480
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,150
we do something hardcore again?

481
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,190
I can't do it.

482
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,430
How about

483
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,550
we try kissing again?

484
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,070
I'll just be kissing myself.

485
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,630
I won't feel anything.

486
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,190
How did you feel

487
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,750
the last time I kissed you?

488
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,110
Of course I was shocked.

489
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,750
I was taken by surprise.

490
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,470
I have an idea.

491
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,550
What are you doing?

492
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,230
Brother.

493
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,870
Let's embark on

494
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,310
a heart-thumping journey.

495
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,190
He shouldn't be so afraid.

496
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,270
It's almost like he knows
the corpse will rise.

497
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,230
Don't be afraid.

498
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,790
The blood

499
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,150
is made from

500
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,190
sugar syrup and dye.

501
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,390
Oh my goodness!

502
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,470
I don't dare to watch it!

503
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,430
She's not floating.

504
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,670
I think she's

505
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,190
standing on a hoverboard.

506
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,790
Brother.

507
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,430
I know that you've acted in movies before.

508
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,070
But can you

509
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,950
pay attention to the movie?

510
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,270
Or else, how can we switch back?

511
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,990
I'm sorry.

512
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,390
When I watch the movie,

513
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,830
I'll think about the movie set.

514
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,790
I'm easily distracted.

515
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,940
How about this?

516
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,470
You can tell me the story.

517
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,430
And I'll imagine it with my eyes closed.

518
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,670
Maybe that way,

519
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,870
I'll feel afraid.

520
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,420
Okay.

521
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,950
Let's change the movie then.

522
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,150
We can mute it.

523
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:44,940
Okay.

524
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,790
It's starting now.

525
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,430
The owner of the house

526
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,870
is a skeletal old woman.

527
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,350
She's home.

528
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,230
She's walking in a dark

529
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,310
and empty corridor all by herself.

530
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,950
Her heels are clicking
on the floor and making

531
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:19,950
click,

532
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:20,950
click,

533
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,350
click

534
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,110
sound.

535
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,950
She's at her front door now.

536
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,790
She extends

537
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,510
her skinny hand

538
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,310
and gently touches the combination lock.

539
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,910
She doesn't know that

540
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,110
the thing behind her

541
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,990
is a vengeful spirit.

542
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,830
She reaches out her trembling hand

543
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,630
and keys in her password.

544
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,030
You know how to do oral stunts?

545
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,390
No.

546
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,590
Why do you ask?

547
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,750
Why is the house so dark?

548
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,350
Sheng Sheng.

549
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,310
Open the curtains.

550
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,870
Okay.

551
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,190
We are watching horror movie.

552
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,470
Let me introduce you to him.

553
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,190
No need.

554
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,430
[Calm down.]

555
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,700
[You are Jiang Yi now.]

556
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,790
[Don't simply act.]

557
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,030
Hello, Jiang Yi.

558
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,830
I am Yu Sheng Sheng's best friend.

559
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,790
I am Tong Hua.

560
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,950
[She's so calm.]

561
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,990
Hello, Tong Hua.

562
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,670
Take a seat.

563
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,220
I need to talk to Sheng Sheng.

564
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,030
Okay.

565
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,390
Sheng Sheng.

566
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,310
Come to my room.

567
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,820
I have something to discuss with you.

568
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,110
Where's the toilet?

569
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,150
Over there.

570
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,140
Sheng Sheng.

571
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,950
Jiang Yi.

572
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,550
Have you seen Jiang Yi?

573
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,190
Yes, I have.

574
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,870
Slap me.

575
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,710
Slap me.

576
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,750
Am I dreaming?

577
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,870
No, you are not.

578
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,550
Jiang Yi.

579
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,830
I've liked Jiang Yi for seven years.

580
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,350
I bought his album, his merchandise,

581
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,380
the products he endorsed and magazines.

582
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,830
I went to his concerts

583
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,510
and I've watched

584
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,070
his movies on repeat.

585
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,910
In order to support him,

586
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,310
I joined his fan club

587
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,550
and learnt how to edit video
and use Photoshop.

588
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,350
I did everything I can to promote him.

589
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,230
I never thought that

590
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:33,910
he'll one day

591
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,470
appear in my home.

592
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,630
He is so near to me.

593
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,910
But I...

594
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,460
But I...

595
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,710
But what?

596
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,830
But I don't have a full make-up on.

597
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,060
Do I look pale?

598
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,380
How do I look?

599
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,190
You look quite nice.

600
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,550
If I had known,

601
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,230
I wouldn't have taken off
my bridesmaid make-up.

602
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,190
Just now, I didn't

603
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,950
embarrass myself

604
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,030
by being too excited, right?

605
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:04,940
No.

606
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,470
You hid your feelings very well.

607
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,110
I almost believed you.

608
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,910
Let me fix my make-up.

609
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,180
Aren't you curious about

610
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,550
why Jiang Yi is here?

611
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,950
Of course I am.

612
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,430
But the important thing is, he's here.

613
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,070
Now, tell me.

614
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,110
What happened?

615
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,870
After the lift incident

616
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,670
last time,

617
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,270
he went to visit me

618
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,670
and we clicked.

619
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,420
And eventually, we became friends.

620
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,670
You've been talking to
each other for so long?

621
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,310
Why didn't you tell me about it?

622
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,140
He wouldn't let me tell you.

623
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,670
Especially after he found out that

624
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,150
you are his fan.

625
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,860
He warned me not to tell you about him.

626
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,950
Understandable.

627
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,270
That's his personality.

628
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,790
He doesn't like to be
too intimate with his fans.

629
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,990
Why is he here then?

630
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,030
We've become great friends

631
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,590
and he trusts me now.

632
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,820
So, after pestering him and coaxing him

633
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,190
to visit our house because of

634
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,710
how much you like him, he agreed.

635
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,110
I wanted to surprise you.

636
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,590
So, I took a leave today.

637
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,990
Sheng Sheng.

638
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,430
You are really my angel.

639
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,390
I love you.

640
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,550
Calm down.

641
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,350
Fix your make-up.

642
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,030
Luckily, I came back earlier today.

643
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,990
Or else, I would've made

644
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,190
Jiang Yi waited for me.

645
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,990
It's fine.

646
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,390
He can spend his time

647
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,550
watching horror movies.

648
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,550
I don't recall him

649
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,990
being interested in horror movie.

650
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,510
It's just a spur of a moment thing.

651
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:37,750
Didn't you say that

652
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,910
you'll be back at night?

653
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,430
Don't mention it.

654
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,790
Someone I hate

655
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,750
suddenly want to attend it.

656
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,110
So, I came back because
I don't want to see him.

657
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,790
How do I look?

658
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,390
Very good.

659
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,420
Let me change.

660
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,060
Go ahead.

661
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,510
I'll go and keep him company.

662
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,910
I'll ask him to give you something good.

663
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,460
Okay.

664
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,590
How much have you heard?

665
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,790
I think

666
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,910
I've heard just about everything.

667
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,100
Brother.

668
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,910
You are really quick-witted.

669
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,710
I told her that

670
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,430
you'll give her something good later.

671
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,820
Any problem?

672
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,830
Of course not.

673
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,110
As a fan,

674
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,070
I know what a fan wants.

675
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,990
Today,

676
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,710
let me show you

677
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,710
how to repay

678
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,550
your fan's loving support

679
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,670
as an idol.

680
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,830
Don't overdo it.

681
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,420
Let's take another one.

682
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,550
Lean back later so that

683
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,350
you'll look slimmer.

684
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,030
Okay.

685
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,790
Sheng Sheng.

686
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,630
Take a photo for us.

687
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,510
Hurry up.

688
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,870
Take a photo for us.

689
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,630
Done.

690
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,270
I haven't even posed yet.

691
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,740
Take another one. Hurry up.

692
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,710
Take another photo for us.

693
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,470
Done.

694
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,190
By the way,

695
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,620
do you want me to do

696
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,710
a voice record as your alarm?

697
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,750
You'll do that?

698
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,630
Of course.

699
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,550
Here.

700
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,670
Let me do it.

701
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,590
Tong Tong, I'm your Yi.

702
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,910
Time to wake up.

703
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,950
Continue to work hard today.

704
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,270
You acted recklessly.

705
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,630
It wasn't like me at all.

706
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,590
You said that I'm here to meet her.

707
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,030
Of course I can't just sign for her.

708
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,590
Besides, this might be my last time

709
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,990
as Jiang Yi.

710
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,710
It's only normal for me
to give my best friend

711
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,870
a special treatment.

712
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,590
It's not.

713
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,830
So petty.

714
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,150
What should we do now?

715
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,950
When Tong Hua opened the door,

716
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,310
did you feel anything?

717
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,390
The feeling of switching back
to our own body?

718
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,830
Yes.

719
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,350
If you didn't release my hand just now,

720
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,590
we might have switched back already.

721
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,870
What are you thinking?

722
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,390
If Tong Hua saw us

723
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,350
holding hands,

724
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,540
how could I explain it to her?

725
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,390
Besides, I didn't feel anything.

726
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,310
You were scared just now, right?

727
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,150
What I mean is,

728
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,510
it's better for us to

729
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,550
strike while the iron is hot.

730
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,910
But the thing is, we have no anvil.

731
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,190
I have an idea.

732
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,230
Mo Mo.

733
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,830
I told you that your brother likes you.

734
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,110
He called and invited you to
come here and play.

735
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,270
Have fun.

736
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,750
He said that

737
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,470
Sister Sheng Sheng will play with us too.

738
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,270
Sister Sheng Sheng?

739
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,820
Sister Sheng Sheng

740
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,990
is my good friend.

741
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,670
Okay.

742
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,470
Have a good time.

743
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,710
I'll go back first.

744
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,110
Call me if you need me.

745
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,150
Mo Mo.

746
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,110
Dad, bye.

747
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,070
Bye.

748
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,270
Come.

749
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,550
Here's a yellow one.

750
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,150
What else do you want?

751
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,950
Car.

752
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,790
Car?

753
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,750
There's a traffic light ahead.

754
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,630
Red light.

755
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,110
I think she is here.

756
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,590
[The door is opened.]

757
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,710
Sister!

758
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,390
Sister, I miss you.

759
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,230
I miss you too.

760
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,950
Stop hugging her.

761
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,910
Let her change her shoes.

762
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,790
Go and play.

763
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,910
I think I can

764
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,750
see a word

765
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,870
carved on Mo Mo's head.

766
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,950
Handyman.

767
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,190
I think my idea is not bad.

768
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,350
It's not bad.

769
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,510
After all,

770
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,510
this is not my first.

771
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,630
I hope that this will be the last time.

772
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,750
I did explain for your sake every time.

773
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,110
I believe you.

774
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,390
But our situation

775
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,230
is too complicated

776
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,310
to explain.

777
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,030
It's already good enough

778
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,390
if we can keep this a secret.

779
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,550
Brother.

780
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,470
We have to work hard today.

781
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,630
All the best.

782
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,270
Doctor Shen.

783
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,910
Are you free later?

784
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,910
Our director has an operation later

785
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,190
but his assistant has a home emergency.

786
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,220
He hopes that you can be his replacement.

787
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,310
Sure.

788
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,070
Thank you.

789
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,430
You like this band too?

790
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,390
No.

791
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,870
I plan to give it to my niece.

792
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,750
A signed gift box.

793
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,830
I had to get hit

794
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,630
to get this.

795
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,630
What do you mean?

796
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,390
That day, Jiang Yi

797
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,470
from this band

798
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,550
was injured in an elevator

799
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,710
and was sent to our hospital.

800
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,270
And he hit me without reason.

801
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,390
This is from his agent

802
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,670
as a way of apology.

803
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,510
Why did he hit you without reason?

804
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,670
Well...

805
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,340
Isn't there a female doctor?

806
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,510
What's wrong?

807
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,750
I'm sorry.

808
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,830
You said it just now.

809
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,630
He's in shock.

810
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,060
He can't control his emotions.

811
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,070
I think he was temporarily confused

812
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,710
because he was in shock.

813
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,590
Or maybe an artist doesn't like it

814
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,070
when someone touch his body.

815
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,350
Okay. I have to get back to work now.

816
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,390
