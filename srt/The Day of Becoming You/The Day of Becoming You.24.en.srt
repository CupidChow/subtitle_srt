[Episode 24]

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,910
Goodness!

29
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,310
One against many.

30
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,950
Must be painful.

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,540
Stop worrying!

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,270
He is the lead actor.

33
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,230
He won't die.

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,910
Yes.

35
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,030
He vomited blood.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,550
It's an internal injury.

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,750
Why are you still here?

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,590
We've been sitting here.

39
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,900
Am I really your daughter?

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,350
No. You're adopted.

41
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,300
Stay here for the night,

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,110
and leave after breakfast.

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,350
No way.

44
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,950
Traffic jam to our company.

45
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,350
Then leave soon.

46
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,390
It'll be safer.

47
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,270
We'll wait as you watch TV.

48
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,310
Why switch it off?

49
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,740
Look at your daughter.

50
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,870
What is it?

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,750
Tell us.

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,950
You've been holding it in since arrival.

53
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,910
I know you.

54
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,860
You're really my mum.

55
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,500
I have something to say.

56
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,790
What? Tell us.

57
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,310
I'm in love.

58
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,660
That's good!

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,350
Is that hard to say?

60
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,990
It's a bit complicated.

61
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,710
I know.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,190
You and Bo Qing are together again.

63
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:48,980
No.

64
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,550
You've fallen for

65
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,990
a married man.

66
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,990
Dad, what are you talking about?

67
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,270
Then tell us.

68
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,230
Auntie, it's not what you think.

69
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,310
I prefer men.

70
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,830
Tell them quickly.

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,830
I'm dating Jiang Yi .

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,620
Huh?

73
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,870
Yi, as in the word for sparkling?

74
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,310
That big star Jiang Yi

75
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,270
who likes my cooking?

76
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,870
That kid is pretty good looking.

77
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,630
His personality is not bad.

78
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,630
I think they can try.

79
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,310
As long as she likes him.

80
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,470
About this matter,

81
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,150
we have no objections.

82
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,830
Don't you

83
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,790
have any questions?

84
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,550
Questions?

85
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,470
Why does Jiang Yi

86
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,390
like you?

87
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,110
Our daughter

88
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,030
is outstanding.

89
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,310
Yes, outstanding.

90
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,590
Tong Tong,

91
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,390
explain.

92
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,070
Uncle and auntie,

93
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,910
it's like this.

94
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,510
Dating a big star is different from

95
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,470
dating an ordinary guy.

96
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,510
It must be strictly confidential

97
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,660
because Jiang Yi

98
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,350
has many fans.

99
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,630
They mustn't know.

100
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,510
Otherwise it'll affect Jiang Yi

101
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,910
and Sheng Sheng.

102
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,750
How do we keep it secret?

103
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,790
For example,

104
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,230
if Jiang Yi wants to visit you,

105
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,870
he can't just come.

106
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,380
He must find the right time.

107
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,830
Today is inconvenient

108
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,550
because he has something on.

109
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,950
For example,

110
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,070
you know this,

111
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,590
but you can't tell

112
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,830
your neighbours

113
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,870
and relatives.

114
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,710
Not even relatives?

115
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,630
Yes, they might not be very alert

116
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,790
and blurt things out.

117
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,510
How long will this

118
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,390
take?

119
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,990
Until Jiang Yi's career

120
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,990
stabilises.

121
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,950
Soon.

122
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,540
About one or two years.

123
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,230
It's really a bit complicated.

124
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,390
Yes, a bit complicated.

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,790
We don't know

126
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,660
about such things.

127
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,310
Yes.

128
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,790
Mum and Dad, I'm sorry.

129
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,630
Why are you being sorry?

130
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,670
It's okay to

131
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,510
like someone.

132
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,670
Yes.

133
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,270
Your mum always says

134
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,180
live and learn.

135
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,750
We have

136
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,820
no experience in this,

137
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,990
but we can learn.

138
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,340
If Sheng Sheng likes him,

139
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,830
mum and I will cooperate fully.

140
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,510
It'll be a bit inconvenient for a while.

141
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,710
He'll visit in a few days.

142
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,190
Okay. Bring him here.

143
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,030
Dad will cook something nice for him.

144
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,350
Thanks, mum and dad.

145
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,790
Switch on the TV for me,

146
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,390
Switch it on.

147
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,310
They're open-minded.

148
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,230
You're lucky.

149
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,350
[As long as we are together,]

150
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,830
my parents are your parents.

151
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,910
You're lucky too.

152
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,230
Oh, I accepted Stephen's movie.

153
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,750
Going abroad next month.

154
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,990
Really?

155
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,870
That's great.

156
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,590
Congratulations.

157
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,380
How long will it take?

158
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,830
The training and filming

159
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,390
take six months plus.

160
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,910
Six months.

161
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,110
That long?

162
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,070
I'll be back on and off.

163
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,150
If you have time,

164
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,190
visit me.

165
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,630
Okay.

166
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,310
Focus on your career.

167
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,430
Fighting!

168
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,230
I'm free this month.

169
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,910
Can you take annual leave for

170
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,710
an island trip?

171
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,590
Island?

172
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,470
Okay.

173
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,620
I'll ask editor-in-chief these two days.

174
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,950
Fix the date.

175
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,390
Leave the rest to me.

176
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,750
You just bring yourself.

177
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,030
I'll bring some things too.

178
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,310
I'll make a list.

179
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,990
Bring

180
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,150
a beautiful skirt and

181
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,060
sun lotion.

182
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,230
The sun is fierce there.

183
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,950
I'm afraid of the sun.

184
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,550
Diving equipment.

185
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,110
But I don't dive.

186
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,030
And slippers.

187
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,310
I heard slippers on islands

188
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,310
are very expensive.

189
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,070
Tong Tong.

190
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,590
Got your leave?

191
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,230
Tomorrow is the weekend.

192
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,470
Let's go shopping.

193
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,940
Okay.

194
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,110
How are

195
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,870
our backup?

196
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,140
If not enough,

197
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,630
I'll rush next week.

198
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,990
Don't worry, I'll handle the manuscripts.

199
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,830
You relax

200
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,030
and have fun with him.

201
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,270
Love you.

202
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,750
Sister Zhi Xiao, look at this!

203
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,390
So, that's what happened.

204
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,870
Sister Sheng Sheng,

205
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,430
is this you in the photo?

206
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,390
Sheng Sheng, you're awesome!

207
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,190
Is this you?

208
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,510
Of course, it's her.

209
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,630
It's our colleague!

210
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,590
Sister,

211
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,830
you're so lucky.

212
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,350
Your boyfriend is a huge star!

213
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,190
How did you two meet?

214
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,820
She

215
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,870
interviewed Jiang Yi.

216
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,830
It must be that time

217
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,390
they met.

218
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:00,900
Wow!

219
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,110
She's attractive.

220
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,630
Remember?

221
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,590
Someone sent her

222
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,910
a bouquet earlier?

223
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,510
Yes.

224
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,430
I remember.

225
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,230
And strawberries.

226
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,190
Jiang Yi looks cold

227
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,310
on camera but

228
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,230
is considerate and romantic in private.

229
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,470
Wow!

230
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,270
My goodness!

231
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,310
Alright, alright.

232
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,430
Go back to work.

233
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,430
She knows Jiang Yi.

234
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,150
Don't believe

235
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,030
the photos.

236
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,540
Is it real or fake?

237
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,980
Real.

238
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,350
Real.

239
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,030
They won't admit it.

240
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,870
Jiang Yi's fans are going to explode.

241
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,510
Can I have a signature?

242
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:33,990
Me too.

243
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,150
Me too.

244
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,980
Why standing around here?

245
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,350
What about your work?

246
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,190
Tong Hua, send her back.

247
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,500
Okay.

248
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,150
[Hot gossip!]

249
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,150
[Jiang Yi is in love!]

250
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,270
[Gone case!]

251
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,990
[To his fans, he looks cold,]

252
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,270
[but he smiles for her.]

253
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,750
[He has fallen for her.]

254
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,100
[Marketing account,]

255
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,910
[stay away]

256
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,990
[from my brother.]

257
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,030
[You saw the intimacy]

258
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,030
[with which eye?]

259
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,990
[And this woman]

260
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,270
Don't read.

261
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,110
[looks like a worker.]

262
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,820
[I have to say it.]

263
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,790
[Jiang Yi is blind.]

264
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,950
[So many beauties in]

[the industry]

266
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,470
[but he chose an ugly one.]

267
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,630
[Sheng Sheng,]

268
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,460
[call me back when you can.]

269
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,510
Hello.

270
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,700
[Where are you?]

271
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,630
[You okay?]

272
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,590
Yes.

273
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,430
[Tong Tong's taking me home.]

274
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,150
[Don't go home.]

275
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,230
[Come to my house.]

276
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,350
Right now?

277
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,070
Bad idea.

278
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,790
[My childhood home.]

279
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,900
[No one knows.]

280

[Jiang Da Chuan is coming.]

281
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,510
Okay.

282
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,310
Talk later.

283
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,830
Tong Tong, let's not go home.

284
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,030
Go somewhere else.

285
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,750
What now?

286
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,910
Will it affect

287
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,870
your filming abroad?

288
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,430
Will you have anti-fans?

289
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,150
Will Jia Shu and Le Yi

290
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,710
be affected?

291
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,670
Don't worry.

292
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,950
Don't touch me.

293
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,950
Right now,

294
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,110
we can't swap and mess up.

295
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,550
Come and sit down,

296
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,470
and talk.

297
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,430
Don't worry.

298
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,990
A photo like this

299
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,190
can't tell anything.

300
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,790
It won't affect me.

301
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,070
What if he has other photos?

302
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,550
I've thought about this.

303
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,780
After the paparazzi visited

304
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,310
Jiang Mo, we hardly met.

305
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,860
Worried

306
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,180
that we'll swap bodies

307
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,310
when we went out,

308
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,310
we didn't

309
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,430
have physical contact.

310
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,270
Yes.

311
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,510
I was confused.

312
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,190
Thank goodness we swapped bodies.

313
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,110
Da Chuan

314
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,070
comes prepared.

315
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,150
He's doing damage control

316
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,870
to cool things down.

317
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,350
It'll be over in two days.

318
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,190
Don’t read online comments.

319
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,510
It's okay.

320
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,150
I'm

321
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,150
an entertainment reporter.

322
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,190
I read

323
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,470
comments every day.

324
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,550
Acting tough?

325
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,670
It's different when it's

326
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,110
yourself.

327
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,950
I'm more experienced.

328
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,030
No matter

329
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,870
how many times you read,

330
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,670
every time you read,

331
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,670
you still feel lousy

332
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,470
and emotional.

333
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,750
What do you usually do?

334
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,150
Don't know about others,

335
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,510
but I listen to music,

336
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,670
watch movies,

337
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,110
meditate, and sleep

338
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,470
to get out of it fast.

339
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,070
But I can't help

340
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,830
browsing Weibo.

341
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,830
Then uninstall

342
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,510
and reload it after two days.

343
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,630
Good idea.

344
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,710
Help me uninstall.

345
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,670
I can't stop.

346
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,790
Did

347
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,790
Tong Hua come?

348
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,870
She went to

349
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,270
the company to tell colleagues

350
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,670
not to talk crap online.

351
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,550
She's right

352
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,350
to keep you hidden.

353
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,110
Get small, black ones.

354
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,030
Chef Yu, Chef Yu,

355
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,590
is this

356
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,510
Sister Sheng Sheng?

357
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,670
Is she in love

358
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,510
with Jiang Yi?

359
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,020
It's Sheng Sheng,

360
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,990
but

361
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,790
they're ordinary friends.

362
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,670
Not lovers.

363
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,750
Okay, get busy.

364
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,390
Song Song,

365
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,030
tonight,

366
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,510
can you take over my shift?

367
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,270
Why?

368
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,630
Jiang Yi is in love.

369
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,670
I'm heart broken.

370
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,830
Really?

371
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,830
Didn't you check Weibo?

372
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,540
This one.

373
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,550
Yes, this woman.

374
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,270
I've never seen her.

375
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,430
Correct.

376
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,820
She is

377
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,230
quite pretty.

378
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,710
This?

379
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,110
Lots of hearsay

380
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,830
nowadays.

381
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,540
It's his personal life.

382
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,350
No comment.

383
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,500
Okay.

384
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,630
Meet up soon, reporter Li.

385
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,830
Thank you.

386
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,900
Bye bye.

387
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,230
Yi,

388
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,670
are you sure they didn't take

389
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,550
intimate photos?

390
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,550
Yes.

391
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,230
Okay.

392
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,550
Without

393
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,390
real proof,

394
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,590
the gossip will stop.

395
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,990
Sorry for the trouble.

396
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,030
Why are you so polite to me?

397
00:16:59,390 --> 00:16:59,910
It's

398
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,190
only a small matter.

399
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,030
Even if it's true,

400
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,230
and you're caught hugging,

401
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,230
I'd say

402
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,150
the weather was cold,

403
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,670
and you were keeping warm.

404
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,150
Sheng Sheng,

405
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,150
let me explain

406
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,030
for Yi.

407
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,950
Yi

408
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,110
is not irresponsible

409
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,790
or cowardly.

410
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,310
We'll admit it

411
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,070
if you're from our circle.

412
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,430
We'll

413
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,350
get over it together.

414
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,750
But

415
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,100
you're an outsider.

416
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,590
If at this time

417
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,310
Yi recklessly admits it,

418
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,310
it'll cause

419
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,230
malice and jealousy

420
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,230
in irrational fans.

421
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,900
Our current strategy

422
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,110
is to try to

423
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,230
reduce your presence.

424
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,710
I know.

425
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,310
That's good.

426
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,540
Irrelevant.

427
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,350
Yes, irrelevant.

428
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,630
When I'm with you,

429
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm irrelevant.

430
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,580
Only Xiao Bai saw it.

431
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,950
I told her

432
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,350
you two are just ordinary friends.

433
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,710
Am I quick-witted?

434
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,870
Hey,

435
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,990
Mum and I

436
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,150
are mentally prepared.

437
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,950
Relax.

438
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,710
Okay. Go ahead.

439
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:39,910
Bye bye.

440
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,390
She has to be sneaky

441
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,100
with the love affair.

442
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,270
Really.

443
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,500
Okay,

444
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,070
don't worry too much.

445
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,670
Go take a bath.

446
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,390
Sleep early.

447
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:56,790
Go.

448
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,670
My mother hates lies.

449
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,030
My dad is old

450
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,070
and has to lie along.

451
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,980
They have no choice.

452
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,550
They will understand.

453
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,910
Hello, senior.

454
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:23,990
Sheng Sheng,

455
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,260
I saw the news about Jiang Yi.

456
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,550
I...

457
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,990
[No need to say it.]

458
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,110
[Actually,]

459
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,540
I already guessed that

460
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,630
you're dating him.

461
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,070
[Also,]

462
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,630
I knew about the body

463
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,990
swap.

464
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,030
I didn't want to lie to you.

465
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,710
It's just...

466
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,470
[It's okay.]

467
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,030
I'll say it again.

468
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,670
If you need my help,

469
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,950
come to me.

470
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,190
Thank you.

471
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,670
[Bye for now.]

472
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,110
Okay.

473
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:55,860
Bye bye.

474
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,710
[Bye bye.]

475
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,020
Sure enough, he already knew.

476
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,910
How are my colleagues?

477
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,150
When I went back,

478
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,790
The editor-in-chief

479
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,750
called a meeting.

480
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,430
I'll send a message soon

481
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,310
to thank her.

482
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,350
Okay.

483
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,630
Outside the airport today,

484
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,190
reporters surrounded me.

485
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,830
They asked me about his affair.

486
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,590
I was confused.

487
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,710
I reminded him long ago

488
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,990
not to fall in love now.

489
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,230
He can do that

490
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,590
after we disband.

491
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,950
Brother Da Chuan said

492
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,910
you're close to Sister Sheng Sheng's

493
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,990
bestie.

494
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,710
What's up?

495
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,310
She is my ex-classmate.

496
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,430
Brother Jia Shu, let me remind you.

497
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,380
Ex-classmates are dangerous.

498
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,260
Brother Yi,

499
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,470
is she okay?

500
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,310
No.

501
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,750
Right.

502
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,590
It's no fun to be a hot search

503
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,750
for the first time.

504
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,670
You play.

505
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,550
I'm going up.

506
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,270
Jiang Yi,

507
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,590
we'll help anytime.

508
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,580
Don't suffer alone.

509
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,630
Thank you.

510
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,270
He is a quiet guy.

511
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,750
How did they fall in love?

512
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,710
When he is with her,

513
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,430
he isn't bored,

514
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,140
he'll smile for no reason.

515
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,150
You saw it?

516
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,670
Yes.

517
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,270
I wasn't home a while ago.

518
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,190
I'll observe next time.

519
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,590
Idiot!

520
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,310
She won't come here again.

521
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,470
Yes.

522
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,710
That's why Brother Yi is sad.

523
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,230
Never mind.

524
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,870
If we can't go now,

525
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,350
we'll go next time.

526
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,110
The island won't disappear.

527
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,100
[I owe you.]

528
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,310
Okay.

529
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,830
Anyway, I still owe you

530
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,470
two walnuts.

531
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,230
None of us have to worry

532
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,260
the other will run away.

533
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,070
[Oh yes,]

534
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,150
walnuts are covered in patina.

535
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,590
I'll show you.

536
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,950
See!

537
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,190
Can you see clearly?

538
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,990
Now it's just a little bit.

539
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,510
[I cradled them,]

540
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,470
[but didn't notice.]

541
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,470
[One day I noticed]

542
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,190
[the patina.]

543
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,870
[Just persevere.]

544
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,190
[Time will tell.]

545
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,070
You are right.

546
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,430
Persevere.

547
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,950
Time will tell.

548
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,790
Is it late?

549
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,870
It's

550
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,190
time for your nurturing sleep.

551
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,830
Can you sleep?

552
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,310
Not now.

553
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,950
I'm used to

554
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,270
checking my phone at bedtime.

555
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,470
I have to get used to this.

556
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,510
I'll chat with you

557
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,910
until you're asleep.

558
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,350
Okay.

559
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,190
Let's lie down and chat.

560
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,460
Maybe I'll sleep

561
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,340
soon.

562
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,620
I'll put you here.

563
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,140
Brother,

564
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,340
right now,

565
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,100
we're like a pair of platonic lovers.

566
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,950
Brother,

567
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,070
do you love me?

568
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,870
Don't rush your answer.

569
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,700
Do you remember

570
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,590
that I told you before

571
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,590
the difference between fondness,

572
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,390
like, and love?

573
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,510
You didn't finish it.

574
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,990
I know you like me.

575
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,470
I like you too.

576
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,910
But love is different.

577
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,630
Love is not general liking.

578
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,030
Love is infinite liking.

579
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,550
Love is infinite liking.

580
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,350
So, none of us should speak of love

581
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,550
lightly.

582
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,550
We should wait until

583
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,550
our hearts

584
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,070
are 100% sure.

585
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,630
Okay?

586
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,550
Okay.

587
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,750
Need my help?

588
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,030
No.

589
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,750
Housework

590
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,150
is a good distraction.

591
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,510
Check your Weibo.

592
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,350
Did Xu Shu Yi make new comments

593
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,350
after her Weibo post?

594
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,870
You aren't distracted.

595
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,830
Uninstalling was useless.

596
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,430
I'm both distracted and concerned.

597
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,990
Check it.

598
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,110
Xu Shu Yi said you're her friend.

599
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,790
You visited her because
she was feeling low,

600
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,710
and Jiang Yi sent you back.

601
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,470
It's true.

602
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,230
Jiang Da Chuan said,

603
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,550
no comment.

604
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,550
Divert the attention.

605
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,510
Don't let irrational fans

606
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,470
get hold of me.

607
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,950
The truth is out.

608
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,110
She is Sister Shu Yi's friend.

609
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,710
Does your face feel hurt?

610

00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,470
Post your photos and show us.

622

623

625

Was the last sentence yours?

627
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,150
You can read.

628

Yes.

631
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,110
I am a smart comment filter.

632
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,390
Overall,

633
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,990
the positive comments prevail.

634
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,710
Don't pay attention.

635
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,590
Mop the floor.

636
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,230
The kitchen

637

and counter top

638
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,470
must be cleaned carefully.

639
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,990
Don't worry, leave it to me.

640
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,150

641

where did you buy this?

642
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,510
Sister Sheng Sheng sent it.

643
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,870
She said it's a surprise.

644
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,670
Let me do it.

645
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,870

649
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,710
to come and eat.

650
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,460

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,630
You should be home.

656

Editor-in-chief,

660
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,550
there are many online gossips.

661
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,030
Even real news dies down.

662
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,150
This is just photo storytelling.

663

It seems

751

the last exposure is

752

a warm-up.

753
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,790
This article is the key point.

754
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,670
It's a new public account

755
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,950
posting its first article,

756

759
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,950
This kind of story

760
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,270

769

782
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,710

Don't go home either.

786
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,180
Get her to her parents' house.

787

Okay, that's the best.

788
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,270
In the career of a star,

789
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,550
it's normal to be scolded.

790
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,820

792
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,070
I don't like Yu Sheng Sheng,

794

I dislike what you did.

795
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,230
Fine, stop cooperating.

796
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,590
I don't want you either.

797
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,020

798
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:31,990

getting bad reviews?

802
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,110
They're scolding

803
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,230
Chef Yu and his daughter.

804
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,700

806
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,550
Wait a minute.

807
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,230
The trend has changed on Weibo.

808
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,190
The scolding is fiercer.

809
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,470
Chef Yu.

810
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,390
Chef Yu, don't read.

811
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,110
Why do they scold Sheng Sheng?

812
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,310
My daughter isn't like that.

813
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,190
These people...

814
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,590
Chef Yu! Chef Yu!

815
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,630
Chef Yu, are you okay?

816
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,590
Chef Yu!

817
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,910
Call an ambulance!

818
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,390
Chef Yu.

819
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,500
Okay.

820
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,110
Okay.

821

Alright, bye.

823

826
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,750

contact directly.

828
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,270

Hello.

831
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,830
Mum, what's wrong?

832
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,030
Relax, talk slowly.

833
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,550
Slow down.

834
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,110
Yi, don't go.

835
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,030
Let go of my hand.

836

Cool it.

837
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,630
I'll go

838

839
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,070

Yi, calm down.

843
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,710
You've

844
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,750
caused enough trouble.

845
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,310
Don't worry. I'll go.

846
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,430
Wait for my call.

847
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,620
Sheng Sheng.

848
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,310
How is dad?

849
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,630
Don't worry.

850
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,790
He is awake.

851
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,990
We'll do one more check.

852
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,270
Mrs. Cai asked me to be here.

853
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,070
Don't worry.

854
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,270
Sheng Sheng.

855
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,710
[Uncle Yu is okay.]

856
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,750
[Don't worry.]

857
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,550
Dad.

858
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,030
If anything happens to you,

859
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,750
what will mum and I do?

860
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,430
Silly Girl.

861
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,430
I'm okay.

862
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,390
Don't cry.

863
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,660
It was my fault.

864
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,740
No, it wasn't.

865
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,820
Blame it

866
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,790
on clueless people

867
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,870
who scolded you online.

868
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,750
Dad read it,

869
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,790
and got anxious and angry.

870
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,150
Okay, stop crying.

871
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,110
Your mum lectured me.

872
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,950
She said that in society,

873
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,830
some people

874
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,630
are unhappy

875
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,110
in real life,

876
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,750
and scolded others so they

877
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,190
can become moral pacesetters and so on.

878
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,750
Next time I read,

879
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,430
I won't get angry anymore.

880
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,620
It'll be weird if you don't get angry.

881
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,790
In the past, if I talked too much,

882
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,870
you would protest.

883
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,630
In the future,

884
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,870
don't even read.

885
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,510
I don't read?

886
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,110
You were secretly checking

887
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,150
on your phone just now.

888
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,870
I...

889
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,060
It's hot!

890
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,380
Unlike you,

891
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,550
I have positive thinking.

892
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,990
Uncle Yu,

893
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,350
Mrs. Cai,

894
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,910
I got medicine for your headache

895
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,870
and stuffy nose.

896
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,940
Thank you.

897
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,670
Mum, are you unwell?

898
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,670
I

899
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,230
didn't rest well last night.

900
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,230
I don't think so.

901
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,830
You

902
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,070
read those online things.

903
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,550
I said that I didn't rest well.

904
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,630
I'll prepare your medicine.

905
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,150
Bo Qing,

906
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,830
can I leave the hospital tomorrow?

907
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,350
Uncle Yu, not tomorrow.

908
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,510
You're under observation.

909
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,150
Out of breath and fainting

910
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,110
are quite dangerous.

911
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,030
I talked to Sheng Sheng.

912
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,590
Let's do a checkup

913
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,630
to be sure.

914
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,030
No need.

915
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,070
It's not that serious.

916
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,430
I am in good shape now.

917
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,150
Uncle,

918
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,510
listen to the doctor.

919
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,750
Dad,

920
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,420
listen to him.

921
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,550
Thanks, girl.

922
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,070
Listen to the doctor.

923
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,750
[Can I]

924
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,790
[visit uncle?]

925
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,550
[Relax.]

926
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,510
[I'll]

927
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,630
[keep it secret.]

928
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,070
[Better not come.]

929
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,390
[Wait until my dad is discharged.]

930
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,910
[Sorry.]

931
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,430
[Take good care of him]

932
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,350
[and yourself.]

933
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,830
Okay. We're all here.

934
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,270
Should I

935
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,150
or you say it?

936
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,390
Let me.

937
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,830
I agree.

938
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,430
Me too.

939
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,030
Nothing's said.

940
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,030
What do you agree on?

941
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,830
Yes. What is it?

942
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,550
Isn't it clear?

943
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:01,750
How

944
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,700
long haven't

945
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,110
we had a formal internal meeting?

946
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,790
It's important.

947
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,790
What do you think

948
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,390
is important for us?

949
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,670
Unity.

950
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,270
