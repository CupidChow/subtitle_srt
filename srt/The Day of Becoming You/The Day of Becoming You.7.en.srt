28
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,430
Hey.

29
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,790
Hey.

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,710
What's bothering you?

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,310
Have an ice cream.

32
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,790
Thanks.

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,790
Look.

34
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,990
It is easy to satisfy a child.

35
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,430
What was on your mind?

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,750
My childhood memory.

37
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,550
I went camping on my birthday.

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,260
Me too.

39
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,670
I wanted my parents

40
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,830
to let me stay in a tent.

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,390
Mum and I were on summer vacation.

42
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,230
My dad resigned

43
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,950
and brought us to the mountains.

44
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,550
Did you live in the mountains?

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,070
My dad said

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,900
he grew up in the mountains.

47
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,870
I grew up in the city.

48
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,230
I missed a lot of fun.

49
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,950
It's a pity.

50
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,550
That's good.

51
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,460
What about you?

52
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,780
What did you do?

53
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:03,950
Nothing much.

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,710
Because it rained.

55
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,470
I want to go to the toilet.

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,350
Okay.

57
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,950
Jiang Yi.

58
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,470
I'm going to the toilet.

59
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,350
Be right back.

60
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,710
Wait for us here.

61
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,790
We will be right back.

62
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,750
Okay.

63
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,270
Wait for us, don't go away.

64
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,430
Let's go.

65
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,030
Let's go.

66
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,550
Mo Mo.

67
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,420
You don't have to be afraid.

68
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,750
He only looks fierce on the surface.

69
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,700
My brother hates me.

70
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,150
Why do you think like that?

71
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,910
Why would he hate you?

72
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,420
He never smiled at me.

73
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,510
He never spoke to me

74
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,190
nor go home.

75
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,070
Doesn't he go home?

76
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,950
Will he go to his mum's place?

77
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,150
You don't know?

78
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,470
His mum is abroad.

79
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,950
He told you so?

80
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,630
My dad told me.

81
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,830
He said

82
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,550
his mum abandoned him.

83
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,670
[What about you?]

84
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,590
[What did you do?]

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,870
[Nothing.]

86
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,670
[Because it rained.]

87
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,310
What? Moon Island?

88
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,060
Sister.

89
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,510
I am working on my script here.

90
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,270
You take the kid

91
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,110
to the campsite.

92
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,390
Aren't you too relaxed?

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,190
[It's an emergency, I have no choice.]

94
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,750
Okay, just to let you know,

95
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,140
your boyfriend sent flowers.

96
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,470
[Okay, I'm hanging up now.]

97
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,190

98

Tong Tong.

99
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,030
I heard

100
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,830
Zhang Zhi Xiao called

101
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,790
her reporter friends.

102
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,030
Saying that

103
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,270
someone spotted Jiang Yi

104
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,100
at Moon Island Campsite.

105
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,230
A campsite?

106
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,390
I think it must be a mistake.

107
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,390
Jiang Yi has stopped working.

108
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,550
He's recovering.

109
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,030
There's no way he goes camping.

110
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,790
Xiao Xiao, is my picture ready?

111
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,710

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,470

119
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,990
instead of texting?

Bye.

went to the toilet,

147

I drove.

148

You slept all the way.

149

Get some paper.

Slowly.

158

Okay.

00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,950
Flowers?

Yes, received.

Besides that,

listen to me first.

My friend and I

167

took her sister to a picnic.

168
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,510
She's throwing up at home now.

169
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,510
She's in the toilet.

170
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,350
Six years old.

171
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,750
He's asking what's her condition now?

172
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,070
Vomit and diarrhoea.

173
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,870
She's having fever.

174
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,670
Vomit, diarrhoea, fever.

175
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,350
Okay, understood.

176
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,710
On our way now.

177
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,350
See you later.

178
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,790
What did he say?

179
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,220
She needs to go to the hospital

180
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,030
for a check-up.

181
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,150
You can't go.

182
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,390
I can take her.

183
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,750
What if she vomits in the car?

184
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,910
It's okay, don't worry.

185
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,220
Be careful then.

186
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,150
Thank you.

187
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,590
Here's an additional RMB100

188
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:56,860
for a car wash.

189
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,630
It's not a problem.

190
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,310
Go in.

191
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,830
Thank you.

192
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,310
It's okay.

193
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,790
Did she vomit again?

194
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:01,990
Yes.

195
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,390
Slowly.

196
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,070
I'll throw this away.

197
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,910
Let's register first.

198
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,870
Tell me

199
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,870
what she ate today?

200
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,710
We went for a picnic.

201
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,630
We ate a lot.

202
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,630
Her record and lab test.

203
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,710
It's acute gastroenteritis.

204
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,590
But it's not serious.

205
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,150
After the medication,

206
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,270
her symptoms stop.

207
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,710
No more fever.

208
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,630
But she's under observation.

209
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,190
Is your friend

210
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,150
coming today?

211
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,870
He can't make it.

212
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,260
You must be

213
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,110
very tired.

214
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,350
Get some rest.

215
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,590
I changed my shift.

216
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,390
I'm on duty today.

217
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,790
If there's anything

218
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,990
the nurse will call me.

219
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,070
Dr Shen.

220
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,710
Your coffee is here.

221
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,430
Thank you.

222
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,190
You're welcome.

223
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,830
Your girlfriend is pretty.

224
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,390
Let's sit out here.

225
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,790
Okay.

226
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,190
You don't like me

227
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,350
sending flowers to your office?

228
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,590
The female colleagues suggested it.

229
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,870
They said girls like it.

230
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,630
I am okay with the flowers.

231
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,270
It withers within a few days.

232
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,990
It's a waste.

233
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,910
It's not your problem.

234
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,750
What about plants,

235
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,550
cactus, or succulents?

236
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,510
There's no need.

237
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,630
I don't have the time.

238
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,470
Senior Shen.

239
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,350
It's totally up to us

240
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,710
to be together.

241
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,950
There's no need to make it public.

242
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,510
My colleagues are

243
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,350
busybodies.

244
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,070
We've known each other for so long.

245
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,100
I'm used to being a friend.

246
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,790
Let's not rush into

247
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,870
a relationship.

248
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,660
We...

249
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,030
Let's give it a try.

250
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,230
I thought

251
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,470
you'll let me wait.

252
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,030
Wait for what?

253
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,270
It's my friend.

254
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,990
I'll take this call.

255
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,510
Go ahead.

256
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,950
I'll get something.

257
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,740
Thanks.

258
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,910
You are now my girlfriend, I must

259
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,910
take care of you.

260
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,910
Wait for me.

261
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,550
Hello.

262
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,780
[How's it?]

263
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,540
No big deal.

264
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,270
Acute gastroenteritis.

265
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,390
She's on drip now.

266
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,910
It's my fault.

267
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,870
I shouldn't let her

268
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,190
eat all the junk food.

269
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,990
[Yes.]

270
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,990
[I don't blame you.]

271
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,910
[It's not your fault, it's mine.]

272
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,510
It's my fault.

273
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,230
We are even now.

274
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,270
You are troublesome.

275
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,110
[Thanks for tonight.]

276
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,510
It's all right.

277
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,910
Celebrities like to wake up at night

278
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,230
and simply post something.

279
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,430
But we have to wake up

280
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,750
and work overnight.

281
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,310
I'm used to it.

282
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,430
[I can stop]

283
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,710
[posting at night.]

284
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,750
You'll do it for me?

285
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,030
[Yes.]

286
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,870
Okay, get some rest.

287
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,830
I'll take care of her.

288
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,540
Don't worry.

289
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,990
[I plan to sleep.]

290
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,430
[Don't disturb me.]

291
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,550
Goodbye.

292
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,750
What?

293
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,630
Can you still sleep?

294
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,220
I brought you water.

295
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,910
You can drink at night.

296
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:28,980
Thanks.

297
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,910
This is for you.

298
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,470
You'll sleep

299
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,190
more comfortably.

300
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,270
Move your head.

301
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:37,950
Is it comfortable?

302
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,030
Yes, it is.

303
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,270
What are you looking at?

304
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,870
Nothing.

305
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,310
I can carry her.

306
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,550
Go home and rest.

307
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,950
I'll send you to the car.

308
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,150
What's the matter?

309
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,140
Nothing.

310
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,710
[My senior is coming.]

311
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,180
Which car is it?

312
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,110
That one.

313
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,190
You ordered an MPV?

314
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,870
What a coincidence.

315
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,180
Here.

316
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,310
Slowly.

317
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,900
Okay.

318
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,910
Get some rest.

319
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,350
You've been on duty.

320
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,910
Thanks.

321
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,310
Let's have dinner tonight.

322
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,710
I can't tonight.

323
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,550
I'm busy.

324
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,660
Brother!

325
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,300
Saturday then.

326
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,500
There's a movie I want to watch.

327
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,190
Keep in touch.

328
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,030
Okay.

329
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,390
Mo Mo.

330
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,750
Say goodbye to Dr Shen.

331
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,670
Goodbye.

332
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,510
Bye.

333
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,630
Let's go, driver.

334
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,590
Brother?

335
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,390
You didn't change your clothes?

336
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,830
You didn't go home?

337
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,670
I bought two sets of the same design.

338
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,700
You and Shen Bo Qing

339
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,350
are getting along well.

340
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,030
I should thank you

341
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,870
for helping me to get him.

342
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,030
You're welcome.

343
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,270
Looks like

344
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,670
love needs some stimulation.

345
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,030
If we didn't change,

346
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,870
Shen Bo Qing

347
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,030
is your boyfriend now.

348
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,230
Are you sleepy, Mo Mo?

349
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,150
You didn't sleep well last night.

350
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,870
Poor girl.

351
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,630
Go home and sleep.

352
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,830
Brother Yi loves you very much.

353
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,470
Doesn't he?

354
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,270
Here.

355
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,910
I can walk faster than you drive.

356
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,270
You drive like

357
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,510
a donkey pulling a cart.

358
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,630
You took up

359
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,550
two parking lots.

360
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,430
I own them.

361
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,750
Is it?

362
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,710
Yes.

363
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,390
Is that a parking lot issue?

364
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,670
It's a technical issue.

365
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,630
What is it?

366
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,030
Jiang Yi.

367
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,380
What's the matter?

368
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,510
Someone's here.

369
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,060
I saw it.

370
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,270
It's been a long time, Mr Jiang.

371
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,550
Miss Yu, this is...

372
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,350
I'm...

373
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,710
I can click very well with

374
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,870
Yu Sheng Sheng.

375
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,390
So, we became friends.

376
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,870
I invited her

377
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,950
to take care of Jiang Mo.

378
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,590
Yes.

379
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,140
Come here.

380
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,590
Let's go.

381
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,230
A friend.

382
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,420
Very well.

383
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,950
When did

384
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,110
you become friends?

385
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,470
We...

386
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,150
We had a good time

387
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,030
during the interview.

388
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:00,710
Yes.

389
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,790
And then there's the elevator incident.

390
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,670
All of you even went to

391
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,710
my house.

392
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,390
We got close after that.

393
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:09,950
Yes.

394
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,670
You got close.

395
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,910
Since you've become friends,

396
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,910
why didn't you inform me?

397
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,510
We didn't tell

398
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,540
because we're afraid

399
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,510
you'll misunderstand.

400
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,510
Yu Sheng Sheng is special.

401
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,510
She's a reporter.

402
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,870
Isn't she?

403
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,590
Jia Shu and Le Yi.

404
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,630
Are they applying facial masks?

405
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,910
Isn't that obvious?

406
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,950
Are you the reporter who disguised

407
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,790
as a fan at the birthday party?

408
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,580
I...

409
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,990
You are clever.

410
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,550
I go wash my face.

411
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,470
Jiang Yi

412
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,590
should have told us.

413
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,590
You suddenly show up.

414
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,110
We thought

415
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,790
you sneaked in

416
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,830
to get news.

417
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,990
That's impossible.

418
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:21,870
Oh.

419
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,630
I thought you're coming back tonight?

420
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,550
We changed our plan.

421
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,190
Mo Mo.

422
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,670
Don't you recognise me?

423
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:32,950
Why don't

424
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,190
we bring Jiang Mo

425
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,990
to bed?

426
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,070
Let's go to the room.

427
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,550
Okay.

428
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,630
Let's go, Mo Mo.

429
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,710
Jiang Yi.

430
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,070
I've something to tell you.

431
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,270
Go ahead then.

432
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,550
I can manage.

433
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,430
Okay.

434
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,580
Take

435
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,460
the medicine first.

436
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,550
Right, we are friends.

437
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,390
Goodbye.

438
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:52,830
Thanks.

439
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,870
Not at all.

440
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,190
Why did you bring her home?

441
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,590
To solve an issue.

442
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,150
She has a bad record.

443
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,110
You forgot the birthday party?

444
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:09,950
She played tricks

445
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,950
to get the news.

446
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,790
Don't worry.

447
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,590
She did wrong that time.

448
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,790
But she is not like that.

449
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,470
You are too naive.

450
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,750
You trust everyone.

451
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,870
She put up a performance

452
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,580
during your birthday.

453
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,950
She was good.

454
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,750
That wasn't a compliment.

455
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,710
Jiang Yi.

456
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,070
Entertainment reporters are heartless.

457
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,950
You could be friends with anyone.

458
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,310
But why Yu Sheng Sheng?

459
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,470
Do you need friends?

460
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,390
Yes.

461
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,150
Okay.

462
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,910
If you trust her,

463
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,270
please keep an eye on her.

464
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,110
Don't let her run around in here.

465
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,590
Don't let her talk to Le Yi and Jia Shu.

466
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,670
That'll be hard.

467
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,910
She's Jia Shu's fan.

468
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,870
What?

469
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,910
She wants to

470
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,390
get near to Jia Shu?

471
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,030
I'll go check on her.

472
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,070
What are you doing?

473
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,990
They are back.

474
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,390
I should go.

475
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,270
What about her?

476
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,590
Jiang Da Chuan

477
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,830
thinks I am a threat.

478
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,300
I'm making

479
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,620
everyone uneasy.

480
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,260
Get him to find a nanny.

481
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,190
No.

482
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,870
I don't trust strangers.

483
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,990
Your idol is here.

484
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,630
Don't leave.

485
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,390
Is he your true love?

486
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,430
He is.

487
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,670
My love for Jia Shu is unquestionable.

488
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,670
Lower your voice.

489
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,070
Don't wake up Jiang Mo.

490
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,110
Oh.

491
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,230
Give me your autographed photo.

492
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,390
You can get it from

493
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,950
Jia Shu.

494
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,110
It's for Tong Hua.

495
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,390
Can you get me an autographed photo

496
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,900
from Jia Shu?

497
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,790
Please.

498
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,510
You're the second most
handsome in the world.

499
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,220
Finish your work.

500
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,030
Stingy man.

501
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,910
You are done?

502
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,670
I'm off to the office.

503
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,870
Go ahead.

504
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,430
Don't ignore

505
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,550
what I told you.

506
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,350
All right.

507
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,550
And

508
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,310
don't let Miss Yu go home

509
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,110
alone.

510
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,950
Let Fatty sends her.

511
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,550
Okay.

512
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,150
Get going.

513
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,030
Okay.

514
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,190
Goodbye.

515
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:34,630
Goodbye.

516
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,110
Look at him.

517
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,950
He treats me like a thief.

518
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,900
He is handsome.

519
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,310
He looks like a deity.

520
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,350
Wow.

521
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,390
[Jia Shu]

522
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,670
[changed his style because of me.]

523
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,870
Quick, introduce us.

524
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,590
Let me introduce you.

525
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,870
Yu Sheng Sheng.

526
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,110
That's all?

527
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,710
Hi, Jia Shu.

528
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,430
I'm Yu Sheng Sheng.

529
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,950
I'm a reporter from

530
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,230
Culture and Entertainment Detective.

531
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,950
Hi, Reporter Yu.

532
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,790
Hi.

533
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,350
I love

534
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,190
Little Galaxy.

535
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,790
I know all your songs.

536
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,430
Really.

537
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,510
Thanks.

538
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,470
Please feel at ease.

539
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,430
Okay.

540
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,270
Please feel at ease, Jia Shu.

541
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,710
Pretend I'm not here.

542
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,630
I always feel at ease at home.

543
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,340
No.

544
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,390
You shine

545
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,710
when you are on stage.

546
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,630
When I see you,

547
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,620
I realise

548
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,470
you are a true prince.

549
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,020
You are polite and elegant.

550
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,830
You have

551
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,870
a nice complexion.

552
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,470
Thanks.

553
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,110
Are you a fan of Jiang Yi?

554
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,190
No.

555
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,110
I am your fan.

556
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,390
Don't look at me.

557
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,030
I am.

558
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,270
Reporter Yu.

559
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,630
Are you close to

560
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,510
Brother Yi?

561
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,990
I've never seen him

562
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,350
spoke to girls.

563
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,070
I thought

564
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,750
he doesn't like girls.

565
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:16,780
Le Yi.

566
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,390
I am curious.

567
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,710
How do you

568
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,950
get your news usually?

569
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,470
I'm not a paparazzi.

570
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,990
I'm an entertainer reporter.

571
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,590
Any differences?

572
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,270
You look for news too.

573
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,470
The difference is we don't report

574
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,790
based on rumours.

575
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,990
We usually conduct interviews

576
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,270
with celebrities.

577
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,740
And we discuss hot topics,

578
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,830
analyse the phenomenon in
the entertainment industry.

579
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,990
It's so complicated.

580
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,190
Don't you usually write

581
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,390
gossips?

582
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,140
Yes and no.

583
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,070
I don't mean to accuse you.

584
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:01,950
I only

585
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,150
like to read the comments.

586
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,860
Can you tell me

587
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,430
where do you usually hide

588
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,150
to snap your photos in secret?

589
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,310
I can never

590
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,270
see where you are.

591
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,150
I told you I'm not a paparazzi.

592
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,590
Understood.

593
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,790
Do you chase after cars?

594
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,870
Get the door, Le Yi.

595
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,910
So fast?

596
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,430
Who could it be?

597
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,150
Shu Yi.

598
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,150
She's here to play.

599
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,430
I bumped into

600
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,310
Da Chuan outside.

601
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,070
All of you are here.

602
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,990
I'm seeing Jiang Yi.

603
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,950
See.

604
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:46,830
Told you so.

605
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,990
He's alive.

606
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,910
The ex-host is here.

607
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,150
Yes.

608
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,510
Do you miss me?

609
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,430
There's someone here.

610
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,710
She looks familiar.

611
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,590
Have we met?

612
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,630
Yes.

613
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,300
During Jiang Yi's birthday.

614
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,390
The fan who shares

615
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,270
the same birthday.

616
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,790
This is...

617
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,590
After the elevator incident,

618
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,470
I visited her.

619
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,510
We became friends.

620
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,990
My dad sent Jiang Mo to me.

621
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,590
She helps to take care of her.

622
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,190
So,

623
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,580
you are the paparazzi.

624
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,470
I'm sorry.

625
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,670
I shouldn't say that.

626
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,870
She's an entertainment reporter.

627
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,220
[Don't make me angry.]

628
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,630
It's okay.

629
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,590
Netizens get confused.

630
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,070
But

631
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,950
you don't know this as a TV host?

632
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,910
That's quite unexpected.

633
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,550
Entertainment reporter.

634
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,870
How stupid I am.

635
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,430
Is Jiang Yi giving trouble?

636
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,270
Yes.

637
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,590
He is a trouble himself.

638
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,990
But

639
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,670
I can't do anything.

640
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,270
[Interesting.]

641
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,190
Hi.

642
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,230
I am Xu Shu Yi.

643
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,390
You can call me Shu Yi.

644
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,350
What's your name?

645
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,470
Yu Sheng Sheng.

646
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,110
Senior Sheng Sheng.

647
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,870
[You call me a senior?]

648
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,390
Oh,

649
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,590
why didn't you tell me

650
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,510
before you came?

651
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,190
It's a surprise.

652
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:33,830
You said

653
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,830
you're bringing food.

654
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,830
Yes, I made it myself.

655
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,580
You know

656
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,710
I don't usually cook.

657
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,750
I can't guarantee

658
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,430
the taste.

659
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,190
Are you going to poison us?

660
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,390
What's that?

661
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,470
Kimchi.

662
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,510
Do you know how to make kimchi?

663
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,470
I learned from my dad.

664
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,710
I only dare

665
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,190
to let

666
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,190
a few of you try.

667
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,660
I don't dare to give to others.

668
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,630
Impossible.

669
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,230
You made this.

670
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,510
You made it with love.

671
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,390
Who says

672
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,150
Jiang Yi

673
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,830
isn't good at words?

674
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,510
He's so sweet.

675
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,190
How is it?

676
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,550
It's good.

677
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,590
Unexpectedly good.

678
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,030
It is good.

679
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,790
Don't lie to me.

680
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,470
Let me try.

681
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,870
It's good.

682
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,910
Try it, Jiang Yi.

683
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,950
Here.

684
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,390
I can do it myself.

685
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,670
Shu Yi.

686
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,510
Your hat...

687
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,510
Jiang Yi has one also.

688
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,110
I took his.

689
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,590
That's too much.

690
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,510
He won't give me.

691
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,990
We are very close.

692
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,510
Aren't we?

693
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,670
Eat more, here.

694
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,230
What's wrong with him?

695
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,910
He's a friend

696
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,950
of the reporter now?

697
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,190
Who knows?

698
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,150
You know

699
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,270
we don't talk much.

700
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,110
She has a hidden agenda.

701
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,630
She pretended to be a fan.

702
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,270
Don't be so close to her.

703
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,710
She'll stick to you.

704
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,230
Tell him then.

705
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,390
He won't listen to me.

706
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,870
Is it appropriate for me to tell him?

707
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,430
Seems like

708
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,510
I'm interfering.

709
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,190
Jiang Yi doesn't have friends.

710
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,190
It's okay.

711
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,150
Don't you think

712
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,470
a reporter in the house

713
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,270
is a problem?

714
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,270
I'm worried for Le Yi.

715
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,190
He's naive.

716
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,110
He'll say anything.

717
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,070
She keeps

718
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,150
holding her phone.

719
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,390
Do you think she's recording?

720
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,190
I'm not.

721
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,830
You can check.

722
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:01,670
How could you

723
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,670
eavesdrop on us?

724
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,230
I need some food.

725
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,310
I didn't say anything, did I?

726
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,680
[1992-12-25 Capricorn]

727
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,710
[She's younger than me.]

728
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,710
Want to play cards?

729
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,350
No.

730
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,990
Go ahead.

731
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:48,990
I need to write.

732
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,390
Didn't you see they isolate me?

733
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,070
Why ask me to play?

734
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,630
Do you want this?

735
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,350
No?

736
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,990
Really?

737
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,380
Why don't you play?

738
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,590
They're playing dou dizhu.

739
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,790
I came to check on you.

740
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:28,550
Are you angry?

741
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,670
No.

742
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,670
Let me see.

743
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,270
I've never seen you

744
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,550
resisting the temptation of

745
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,310
crispy jujube.

746
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,550
Congratulations.

747
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,590
You've seen a miracle.

748
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,300
You haven't written anything.

749
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,710
I've no inspiration.

750
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,510
Don't overthink.

751
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,910
When we stay long enough

752
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,470
in the industry,

753
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,390
gossips and rumours

754
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,190
made us

755
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,590
be wary of reporters.

756
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,590
Just like when you eat this crispy jujube.

757
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,150
It's natural.

758
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,710
It's not the same.

759
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,390
Crispy jujube is crispy and sweet.

760
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,910
It's likeable.

761
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,020
I know.

762
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,220
A lot of people

763
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,590
misunderstood us.

764
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,790
Not like celebrities.

765
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,500
You're forced to undergo cosmetic surgery.

766
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,190
Cheating is an art and

767
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,390
to experience life.

768
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,590
Sharing a cup of milk tea

769
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,390
because

770
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,710
there's no extra straw.

771
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,390
You have nothing to hide.

772
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,630
Why be wary of reporters?

773
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,150
Quiet.

774
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,270
Forget it.

775
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,390
I have a bad record.

776
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,430
It's not their fault.

777
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,590
Xu Shu Yi

778
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,310
is not stupid.

779
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,350
She is always on her toe.

780
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,430
She tricked

781
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,110
the three of you.

782
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,990
She seems fair.

783
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,190
You are over exaggerating.

784
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,990
She is casual.

785
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,710
We've known her for years.

786
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,620
You're right.

787
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,380
Ignore me.

788
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,310
I'm jealous she's pretty.

789
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:19,870
Okay?

790
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,790
I think

791
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,740
you're pretty too.

792
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,990
Even if you praise me,

793
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,950
I won't become your fan.

794
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:30,950
Why not?

795
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,470
Because you're not my type.

796
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,950
What are you doing?

797
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,870
Do you have cataracts?

798
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,790
Why are you blind?

799
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,390
These are cleaned.

800
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,630
Thanks.

801
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,470
You look happy.

802
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,070
Of course.

803
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,510
One after-sales task is complete.

804
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,550
Sister.

805
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,230
This is my phone number.

806
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,030
You can call me

807
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,870
next time.

808
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,510
I want to go out and play

809
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,670
with both of you.

810
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,900
I am willing to.

811
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,350
You'll need to ask your brother.

812
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,510
That depends.

813
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,870
Same here.

814
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,110
Get going.

815
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,710
I've packed

816
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,630
Jiang Mo's things.

817
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,270
It's in the guest room.

818
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,110
Do you want to see it?

819
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,030
No.

820
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,870
Thanks.

821
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,950
If you don't say it,

822
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,030
it's not a big deal.

823
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,550
You mention it first.

824
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,150
I need to rush.

825
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,070
Happy birthday, mum.

826
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,470
Sister.

827
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,710
Why so many presents

828
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,470
unopened?

829
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,710
Jiang Mo.

830
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,470
These are Jiang Yi's.

831
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,150
Don't touch.

832
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,950
Go downstairs.

833
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,750
We're going home.

834
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:57,110
I didn't mean to do it.

835
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,190
Don't be angry, Brother Yi.

836
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,790
I'm not angry.

837
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,260
Really?

838
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,310
Really.

839
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,190
Great.

840
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,470
Let's go.

841
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,230
[Please open the door.]

842
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,910
My phone.

843
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,630
Dad.

844
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,100
How are you?

845
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,590
Are you happy?

846
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,790
I'm happy.

847
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,110
They took good care of me.

848
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,790
She has gastroenteritis.

849
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,990
This is her medicine.

850
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:52,870
Bring it home.

851
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,110
Are you sick?

852
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,790
Let me see.

853
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,590
Oh.

854
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,630
You don't look good.

855
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,310
Does your tummy hurt?

856
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,270
When you're home,

857
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,950
let mum cook you some porridge.

858
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,030
What do you want to eat?

859
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,670
I'll buy it for you.

860
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,870
I want strawberries.

861
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,150
Okay.

862
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,180
When we get back,

863
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,430
I'll get you strawberries.

864
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,190
Okay?

865
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,230
Did you buy the piano?

866
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,670
What piano?

867
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:18,830
It's nothing.

868
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,270
We'll come again.

869
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,470
Get in the car.

870
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,100
There's no next time.

871
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,270
No more excuses

872
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,380
to leave Jiang Mo

873
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,550
with me.

874
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,190
An unsupervised kid.

875
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,630
One is enough.

876
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,390
Jiang Yi.

877
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,190
Don't always talk about

878
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,270
things in the past.

879
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,470
You knew very well.

880
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,430
Your mum's busy.

881
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,060
I was busy too.

882
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,070
It's direct selling.

883
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,470
Sigh.

884
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,580
We did it for you.

885
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,350
Did you use the money
for piano to buy shares?

886
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,430
No.

887
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,110
Your aunt's relative

888
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,820
lends out money.

889
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,110
The interest rate is 12%.

890
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,910
I'm not lying to you about the piano.

891
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,790
I plan to let her learn piano

892
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,430
next year.

893
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,990
Don't worry.

894
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,070
Assume I've bought it.

895
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:11,910
Go back now.

896
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,510
I'm leaving.

897
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,670
Goodbye.

898
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,390
Goodbye, Brother Yi.

899
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,350
Ah!

900
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,390
♫ The night is used to
the pitch-black darkness ♫

901
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,830
♫ It never thought that it'd someday ♫

902
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,350
♫ Cross paths with brightness ♫

903
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:01,100
♫ The shooting star
must be missing someone ♫

904
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,460
♫ To be diving hard without hesitation ♫

905
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,440
♫ Towards a better tomorrow
in brave pursuit ♫

906
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,660
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

907
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,470
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

908
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,120
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

909
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,070
♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

910
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,280
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

911
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:31,600
♫ Time is the best testament ♫

912
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,750
♫ To this journey ♫

913
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,920
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

914
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,030
♫ My soul ♫

915
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,850
♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

916
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,240
♫ I get used to ♫

917
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,720
♫ Having you by my side ♫

918
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,960
♫ Understanding each other's
heart is just so precious ♫

919
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,920
♫ Don't need to speak or
beat around the bush ♫

920
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,860
♫ I always get a glimpse of your world ♫

921
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,030
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

922
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,590
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

923
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,760
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

924
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,880
♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

925
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,010
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

926
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,920
♫ Time is the best testament ♫

927
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,080
♫ To this journey ♫

928
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,160
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

929
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,270
♫ My soul ♫

930
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,950
♫ When you left, I realized ♫

931
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,110
♫ Being in love brings two ♫

932
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,370
♫ Souls together ♫

933
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,530
♫ Baby, loving you is... ♫

934
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,300
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

935
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,380
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

936
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,940
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

937
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,020
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

938
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,130
♫ My soul ♫

939
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,100
♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

940
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,490
♫ Gradually I mature ♫

941
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,980
♫ With you by my side ♫
