Hello, here you go.

29
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,550
Why do you eat so little?

30
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,380
You don't like the food?

31
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,830
Or do you feel ill?

32
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,580
I'm not really hungry.

33
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,430
When you bathe at night,

34
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,230

from contact with water.

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,470
Don't you know I'm a doctor?

37
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,150
Later,

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,470

You must be tired.

42
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,590
Go back early and rest.

Why don't you wear a mask

91

and come to my room?

92
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,350
What if someone

93
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,950
saw it?

94
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,590
I don't want to be

95
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,630
on the hot topic with you

96
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,950
and be cyberbullied by your fans.

Don't worry.

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,750
I'm living opposite you.

99
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,940
Did you learn this from irrational fans?

100
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,910
It's near

101
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,870
for me to observe.

102
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,670
Ask

103
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,950
Jiang Da Chuan to contact me.

104
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,790
We need to talk about

105
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,980
the payment for sample.

106
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,390
Friends

107
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,950
don't discuss much about money.

108
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,790
But you can observe me as well.

109
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,950
I'm not interested.

110
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,270
What's the matter?

111
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,270
When will you break up with Shen Bo Qing?

112
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,070
Who told you so?

113
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,910
You told Tong Hua that

114
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,270
you have no feelings for Shen Bo Qing.

115
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,550
And you can't

116
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,470
fall for someone

117
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,350
in just a short period.

118
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,150
Why do you care about this?

119
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,630
I made

120
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,590
you and Shen Bo Qing

121
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,310
become so.

122
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,030
As the first person responsible,

123
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,430
I can help you deliver

124
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,670
if you find it hard to say.

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,910
No, thanks.

126
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,190
I'll figure a way out.

127
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,470
As your close friend,

128
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,670
I think you should take
the action as soon as possible.

129
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,100
You don't fall for Shen Bo Qing.

130
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,950
He should've noticed it.

131
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,910
Based on my observation today,

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,030
that's the truth.

133
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,830
Shen Bo Qing becomes anxious.

134
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,750
He tried hard to

135
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,830
show off

136
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,910
so that you'd fall for him.

137
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,670
The longer you don't say,

138
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,590
the longer he'll be waiting.

139
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,550
He'll become more anxious

140
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,590
and put in more effort.

141
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,630
In the end,

142
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,630
he'll suffer a lot.

143
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,710
If it's for his sake,

144
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,070
break up with him

145
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,750
to make him suffer less.

146
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,540
Shen Bo Qing.

147
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,710
Get up quickly!

148
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,070
Hide yourself, quick!

149
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,190
Why do I need to hide?

150
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,510
You're a superstar.

151
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,310
Special treatment for you.

152
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,070
Go in.

153
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,950
Close the door.

154
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,830
I was in the bathroom.

155
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,430
I thought you were not here.

156
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,350
I called you.

157
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,630
What's wrong?

158
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,630
Chief called me

159
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,750
and said there's

160
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,710
a rare case.

161
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,350
There'll be an emergency surgery
tomorrow morning.

162
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,150
He wants me to go back
to be the assistant.

163
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,430
To watch and learn.

164
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,870
All of a sudden?

165
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,070
Yes.

166
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,310
It's a rare chance.

167
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,350
So

168
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,470
I have to go back tonight.

169
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,990
It's okay. Just go back.

170
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,150
Job is the priority.

171
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,790
I'll be on my own tomorrow.

172
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,430
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,470
We haven't been

174
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,590
travelled together.

175
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,990
I ruined the plan.

176
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,270
Well, enjoy yourself.

177
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,540
I'll pick you up

178
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,750
when it's over early tomorrow.

179
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,590
Oh, right.

180
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,390
Open it.

181
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,750
I wanted to

182
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,310
give it to you

183
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:35,870
during dinner time.

184
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,780
Now let's regard it as a token of apology.

185
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,030
It's a couple set.

186
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,300
I hope you'll like it.

187
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,390
Are you angry?

188
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,790
Or I ask them to change shift.

189
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,710
I have a girlfriend,

190
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,590
after all.

191
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,270
Job can't be

192
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,470
my priority.

193
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,510
I'm not angry.

194
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,350
I really don't.

195
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,070
Alright then.

196
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,470
My girlfriend is very sensible.

197
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,550
I hope my girlfriend

198
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,990
can be happy all the time.

199
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,110
Bo Qing!

200
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,950
Let's break up.

201
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,590
Sheng Sheng, I know

202
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,510
it makes you upset.

203
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,230
The nature of doctors' work is special.

204
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,150
You always need to

205
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,990
match my time.

206
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,030
I promise I'll try my best to...

207
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,670
No.

208
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,980
It's not your problem.

209
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,350
It's mine.

210
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,790
You're good.

211
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,230
But I don't want you

212
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,150
to put in the effort

213
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,950
but get no response.

214
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,070
It would hurt you.

215
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,870
I won't feel hurt.

216
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,310
I'm willing to

217
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,070
put in more effort.

218
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,110
But I don't want it.

219
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,350
We used to be friends.

220
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,940
I think we got along well.

221
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,110
But for our relationship now,

222
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,190
I always feel like I owe you.

223
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,750
I know

224
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,830
we've been friends

225
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,580
for years.

226
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,510
You don't get used to

227
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,590
the new identity.

228
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,030
I'm too impatient.

229
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,430
Let's take it slowly.

230
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,790
I'm really sorry.

231
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,510
I agreed to be your girlfriend.

232
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,270
But I want to break up

233
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,190
in such a short period.

234
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,750
But I've tried it.

235
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,270
I don't fall for you.

236
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,310
Bo Qing.

237
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,270
Let's be friends again.

238
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,460
Are you okay?

239
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,510
I want to stay alone.

240
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,670
You may leave first.

241
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,310
[Senior]

242
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,670
Bo Qing.

243
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,390
Have you reached home yet?

244
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,830
I almost reach the town.

245
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,470
Drive carefully.

246
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,270
Sheng Sheng.

247
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,950
Do I really

248
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,030
have no chance?

249
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,270
You'll definitely

250
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,190
meet someone

251
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,310
who likes you back.

252
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,910
You're the one I like now.

253
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,550
I don't

254
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,950
mean to pressure you.

255
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,310
I want to say

256
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,230
since you don't have a crush,

257
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,030
don't turn down

258
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,310
your admirer.

259
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,950
I have a crush.

260
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,070
You don't have to say so to reject me.

261
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,150
It's true.

262
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,390
I just realised it

263
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,670
these few days.

264
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,630
Does he like you?

265
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,830
I don't know.

266
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,950
More precisely,

267
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,710
he may not like me.

268
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,030
We're from two different worlds.

269
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,190
Many people like him.

270
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,630
As if he's a not-for-sale item
in the shop window.

271
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,030
For him,

272
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,190
I have

273
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,270
no chance as well.

274
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,150
Then why do you..

275
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,550
You can't

276
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,670
control your feelings.

277
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,950
Maybe

278
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,590
I'm waiting for a miracle.

279
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,710
Although there's no miracle,

280
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,150
I'm happy enough

281
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,110
with the current state.

282
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,750
[Here you go, the sticker.]

283
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,550
[It'll boost your mood.]

284
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,190
[It works, I've tried.]

285
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,790
[Let me know when you get up.]

286
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,390
[There's breakfast in my room.]

287
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,590
Why are you here so early?

288
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,550
I haven't washed up yet.

289
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,550
Come in quickly.

290
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,830
I can tell it.

291
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,860
There're eye boogers
in the corner of your eyes.

292
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,910
Have a seat first.

293
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,670
I'll go wash up.

294
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,670
Why do you care about

295
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,350
your looks in front of me?

296
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,750
I'm a girl. Okay?

297
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,990
Why do you stare at me?

298
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,710
Is there anything on my face?

299
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,750
No.

300
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,350
I'm thinking why

301
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,230
you apply lipstick

302
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,910
before eating breakfast.

303
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,310
It makes me look much better. Can't I?

304
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,030
Why do you

305
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,630
offer me breakfast today?

306
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,270
If you don't eat breakfast,
you'll become fat,

307
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,430
stupid and even have gallstones.

308
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,430
But it's almost afternoon now.

309
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,830
Eat quickly then.

310
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,190
I think you just want to observe me.

311
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,230
A girl who just broke up

312
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,430
doesn't tidy herself up

313
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,660
and eats nothing.

314
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,430
Can't you think

315
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,510
from a better view?

316
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,380
Someone consoles

317
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,990
a friend

318
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,270
who's in a bad mood.

319
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,710
Do you really regard me as your friend?

320
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,940
Don't you regard me as your friend?

321
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,430
Of course, you're my friend.

322
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,510
I have a friend

323
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,470
who's a superstar.

324
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,910
I'm overjoyed.

325
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,780
So you'll fulfill

326
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,310
any of my requests

327
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,030
to make me feel better.

328
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,310
Right?

329
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,150
Yes.

330
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,350
After I finish breakfast,

331
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,390
let's watch a show.

332
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,470

Well.

would be the second male lead.

499

After the female lead broke up with

500

the second male lead,

501
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,550
she'd then start a relationship

he'd be more disappointed

521
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,030
as time goes by.

522
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,430
I think

523
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,470
I did something wrong.

524
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,070
Although

525
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,990
I don't fall for him,

526
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,590
we've been

527
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,830
friends for decades.

528
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,750
I always regard him as a brother.

529
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,750
My parents named me Sheng Sheng.

530
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,790
They hope I'm pleasant to hear.

531
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,390
They showed me a lot of love.

532
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,830
I hope I can

533
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,980
show love to

534
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,990
those I care about too.

535
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,670
I don't want them to be sad.

536
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,630
I hope they're all happy.

537
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,990
What are you doing?

538
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,470
Don't come so near to me.

539
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,950
What if we switch bodies again?

540
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,820
Let's try then.

541
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,070
Jiang Yi, we...

542
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,630
Yes.

543
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,500
What did you mean just now?

544
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,070
It's not time

545
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,990
to hold me accountable.

546
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,390
I still have to go back
for live stream tonight.

547
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,630
We have to switch back.

548
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,910
Live stream?

549
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,270
Gosh.

550
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,510
How annoying!

551
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,950
Calm down first.

552
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,230
Take a deep breath.

553
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:50,950
You're right.

554
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,750
We have to switch back first.

555
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,470
Do you have any idea?

556
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:56,710
I...

557
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,430
Just say it if you have one!

558
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,550
It's been late.

559
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,110
I think for now,

560
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,390
kissing is the most successful way.

561
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,350
Let's try.

562
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,470
Okay.

563
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,220
Hold on.

564
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,460
Let's do it.

565
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,110
Okay.

566
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,110
Why is there no response?

567
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,190
It worked for the last two times.

568
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,550
Do we have to move a bit?

569
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:11,990
Right.

570
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,390
Let's try.

571
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,110
Okay.

572
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,070
Why is there no response again?

573
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,490
[Fatty]

574
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,710
Answer it.

575
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,310
I...

576
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:37,910
Hello.

577
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,070
Brother Yi, we're departing.

578
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,950
Alright, wait for me awhile.

579
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:42,750
Okay.

580
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,230
I'm at the parking lot
in front of the hotel.

581
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,670
Okay, I got it.

582
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,150
What should we do?

583
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,630
What should we do?

584
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,470
I think it doesn't matter if we move.

585
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,870
We didn't move just now either.

586
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,020
Is it because of the posture?

587
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,070
Posture?

588
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,430
I mean,

589
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,670
we were sitting just now.

590
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,470
Let's try. Hurry up.

591
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,910
We've to make every possible effort.

592
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,870
Let's make it work with the first try.

593
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,390
Imitate my feelings just now.

594
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,590
Make it as nearly as possible.

595
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,350
Okay.

596
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,470
Come closer.

597
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,340
All right.

598
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,350
Was I so pretentious?

599
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,590
Am I pretentious?

600
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,310
I think it's quite pretentious.

601
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,150
I don't think so.

602
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:48,950
Oh.

603
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:52,910
Let's do it.

604
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,510
How did you

605
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,740
think of me back then?

606
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,990
How should

607
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,030
I feel

608
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,630
to kiss myself?

609
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,030
There's no time.

610
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,870
Do it quickly.

611
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,550
Say what

612
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,150
we used to say.

613
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,470
Don't come so near to me.

614
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,030
What if we switch bodies again?

615
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,230
Let's try then.

616
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,670
It doesn't work at all!

617
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,590
[Shen Bo Qing wanted to fetch you.]

618
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,430
[I rejected him.]

619
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,390
[And]

620
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,750
[please help with the live stream.]

621
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,630
[Talk less]

622
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,590
[if you're afraid you'll go wrong.]

623
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,070
[You're smart.]

624
00:33:59,270 --> 00:33:59,910
[It should be fine.]

625
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,510
[I'll try my best.]

626
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,150
[Don't interact much]

627
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,110
[with Tong Hua.]

628
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,510
[Don't say and see whatever.]

629
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,350
[Help me to go to work tomorrow.]

630
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,190
[I got this.]

631
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,790
[Don't worry much.]

632
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,150
[We'll find a way]

633
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,870
[to switch back.]

634
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,390
[I'm not worried at all.]

635
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,070
[Maybe your face]

636
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,110
[will be kissed until swollen.]

637
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,100
Don't come so near to me.

638
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,750
What if we switch bodies again?

639
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,350
Let's try then.

640
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,990
[What a mess.]

641
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,070
[Can kissing be so random?]

642
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,390
Hello, everyone.

643
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,670
Welcome to the live stream
of Little Galaxy.

644
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,100
Our live stream

645
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,030
starts now.

646
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,830
I'm Cheng Le Yi from Little Galaxy.

647
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,790
The host...

648
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,310
Brother Da Chuan.

649
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,230
Where's Jia Shu?

650
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,430
He's not satisfied with

651
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,070
the sponsored outfit.

652
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,390
He went to the room to pick for himself.

653
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,270
Didn't we show him the pictures?

654
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,430
How about Yi?

655
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,950
He's been upstairs all the time.

656
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,710
Maybe he's trying to get some rest.

657
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,510
These two dudes...

658
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,030
[It's your fault.]

659
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,590
[I could've enjoyed]

660
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,870
[watching the live stream.]

661
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,070
[But I have to go live now.]

662
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,230
Yi, I'm coming in.

663
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,950
Why are you squatting here?

664
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,710
Looking at the mirror.

665
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,950
What's inside the mirror?

666
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,230
A man who

667
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,710
makes you love and hate him.

668
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,790
Are you confessing to me?

669
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,430
I mean Jiang Yi.

670
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,660
Myself.

671
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,190
All right.

672
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,860
Get dressed up.

673
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,710
Don't touch me!

674
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,710
I mean

675
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,260
I can get up

676
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,430
quickly by myself.

677
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,830
Why do his legs feel numb easily?

678
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,910
Da Chuan, are you there?

679
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,910
I'm here.

680
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,350
Can you come out, please?
There's something to tell you.

681
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,510
Alright, wait a second.

682
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,580
Get changed, quick.

683
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,670
Jia Shu, I'm coming.

684
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,030
Finally you're home.

685
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:53,790
Yes.

686
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,670
The live stream starts soon.

687
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,110
I'm going to unpack my things.

688
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,750
Wait a second.

689
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,630
You told me

690
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,630
you'd tell me more.

691
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,550
Tell me now.

692
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,070
How did you break up with Doctor Shen?

693
