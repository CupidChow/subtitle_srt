[The Day of Becoming You]

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,020
[Episode 21]

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,260
You know,

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,310
the first time Jiang Yi

30
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,830
and I switched bodies,

31
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,710
he was staying at my house,

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,910
enjoying my dad's cooking.

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,670
He had no self-restraint.

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,710
I gained

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,950
a few pounds in only a few days.

36
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,790
Aren't you mad at him?

37
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,830
Of course I am.

38
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,070
Meanwhile,

39
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,630
I was on the veggie meal
for the sake of him.

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,710
I was too hungry to think straight

41
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,350
and I cracked his walnuts.

42
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,230
What a terrible destiny.

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,910
If it wasn't because of you,

44
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,190
I would never believe in

45
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,270
switching bodies.

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,390
Exactly, it's unbelievable.

47
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,110
Don't you worry that

48
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,110
it might happen again?

49
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,310
We were a little worried at first

50
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,910
but we're fine now.

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,420
We held hands and kissed several times

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,670
but nothing happened.

53
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,830
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:57,990
I would never

55
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,230
talk about this again.

56
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,510
Did you do it?

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,430
What?

58
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,390
Did you go beyond

59
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,390
kissing?

60
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,470
Why would you ask about that?

61
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,270
I remember you saying that

62
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,510
you guys switched bodies twice

63
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,670
because of kissing.

64
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,030
If you can go beyond that

65
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,870
without switching bodies,

66
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,070
then only you can rest assured of that.

67
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,910
Doesn't it bother you?

68
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,630
I'm used to it already, okay?

69
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,070
Tell me everything.

70
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,630
We didn't.

71
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,270
I seem to recall

72
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,310
you were out all night quite many times.

73
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,910
I was taking care of Jiang Mo.

74
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,820
What are you thinking?

75
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,310
You two went to the mountain once.

76
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,390
Jiang Yi had a fever at that time.

77
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,630
What if he didn't have a fever?

78
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,270
We hadn't had feelings

79
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,270
for each other back then.

80
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,350
And you brought Jiang Yi

81
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,350
home once.

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,870
That was even more unlikely than ever.

83
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,790
We weren't

84
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,070
inside our own bodies.

85
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,430
How could we possibly do that

86
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,910
to our bodies?

87
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,670
Okay, the interrogation is over.

88
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,270
Still,

89
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,100
did it ever occur to you that

90
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,790
since you're so familiar

91
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,030
with each other's bodies,

92
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,830
you might

93
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,190
lose interest in that stuff?

94
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,190
No, we won't.

95
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,060
[Brother,]

96
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,790
[which tea do you usually drink?]

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,390
[There are so many of them,]

98
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,510
[but it depends on
the quality of the tea.]

99
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,940
[You can tell the difference?]

100
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,590
[Of course.]

101
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,470
[Can't you tell the difference between]

102
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,430
[the tea you drank at my place]

103
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,830
[and the tea you usually drank?]

104
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,380
[No, I can't.]

105
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,670
[I'll just order whatever I like then.]

106
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,590
[This seems like]

107
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,870
[a place Jiang Yi would come to.]

108
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:57,870
Xiao Qing.

109
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,630
Alright, let's keep going.

110
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,470
I thought you left because you were bored.

111
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,230
I went to the washroom.

112
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,670
I'm here for work.

113
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,910
I didn't come here to play house.

114
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,430
Xiao Qing.

115
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,670
I saw you pounding your waist just now.

116
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,750
This cushion will
make you more comfortable.

117
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,590
Here,

118
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,700
have some water.

119
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,020
Thank you.

120
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,190
You didn't reply to me for days.

121
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,190
Why did you suddenly agree

122
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,230
to do this feature article?

123
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,630
You want the truth?

124
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,190
Of course.

125
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,870
Because you have many fans.

126
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,790
That's the truth indeed.

127
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,430
How much longer will this take?

128
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,270
About three to four hours.

129
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,310
You wouldn't think

130
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,070
I asked you here

131
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,990
just to waste your time, right?

132
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,950
I won't.

133
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,660
Watching you up close

134
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,710
when you're working

135
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,950
is very helpful for me.

136
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,510
Really?

137
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,270
Yes.

138
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,070
Alright, I believe that.

139
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,660
From now on,

140
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,230
let's be honest with each other, okay?

141
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,030
I'm fine with that.

142
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,470
But aren't you afraid that your truth

143
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,630
will come out in my article?

144
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,830
Not at all.

145
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,310
You won't harm me.

146
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,550
Brother Shu,

147
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,740
we're ready.

148
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,500
I have to get back to my work.

149
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,110
Talk to you later.

150
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:37,950
Sure.

151
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,910
Thank you for today.

152
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,510
You let me interview you
even though you're sick.

153
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,790
Since your public account

154
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,070
took an interest in the stunt actors,

155
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,900
I'm more than willing

156
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,670
to express my thoughts.

157
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,070
Stay in touch.

158
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,110
Sure, goodbye.

159
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:06,710
Bye.

160
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,350
Come and eat your food.

161
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,590
We'll go to the recording studio
half an hour later.

162
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,670
Still looking at that?

163
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,580
For the second time.

164
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,030
You like it?

165
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,070
What do you think?

166
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,950
Although this is a melodrama,

167
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,310
it has a novel plot structure.

168
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,430
I think it's good.

169
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,510
But there's

170
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,710
an intense bed scene.

171
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,670
You mind it?

172
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,510
My only worry is Yu Sheng Sheng.

173
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,630
She won't mind it.

174
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,710
You sure about that?

175
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,790
Jia Shu promised his old friend

176
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,670
to write an exclusive interview on him.

177
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,910
And this old friend of his

178
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,310
is Yu Sheng Sheng's colleague.

179
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,470
What are the odds?

180
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,630
Indeed, what are the odds?

181
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,070
And they live together too.

182
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,190
They are best friends.

183
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,710
Does Yu Sheng Sheng

184
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,750
have any other best friends?

185
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,590
For all I know, that's it.

186
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,590
Our Le Yi is safe then.

187
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,030
Brother Jia Shu, good job.

188
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,830
We're done for today.

189
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,270
Okay, great job.

190
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,990
Thank you.

191
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,510
Nice working with you. Well done.

192
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,070
Good job.

193
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,830
Good job.

194
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,100
Brother Jia Shu, are we leaving now?

195
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,860
Let me catch my breath first.

196
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,390
Okay.

197
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,990
Jia Shu, we really like you.

198
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,230
Can we get a picture with you?

199
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:17,990
Sure.

200
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,470
Thank you.

201
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,670
One more.

202
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,630
Okay, thanks.

203
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,670
Thank you.

204
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,310
Thanks, Jia Shu.

205
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,950
Thanks, Jia Shu.

206
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,670
You seemed so happy

207
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,150
when you took pictures with your fans

208
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,910
even though you're exhausted.

209
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,830
What makes you

210
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,910
keep the spirits up?

211
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,230
I'm tired,

212
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,070
but it's just temporary.

213
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,790
If I put on a smile

214
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,990
every time I take pictures

215
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,110
with them,

216
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,140
wouldn't they

217
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,020
feel happier?

218
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,670
Do you like people saying
that you dote on your fans?

219
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,180
How do I put this?

220
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,500
I don't really care about

221
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,190
others' opinions.

222
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,030
I'm willing to dote on

223
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,390
those who like me and

224
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,590
those who'd helped me before.

225
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,190
For instance, you.

226
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,230
Me?

227
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,070
Yes, I'm willing to dote on you.

228
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,030
I told you, I've never liked you.

229
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,390
But you helped me before.

230
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,390
Did I?

231
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:13,990
You did.

232
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,550
We were deskmates at that time.

233
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,910
You'd been so helpful.

234
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,270
I don't remember that.

235
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,190
Probably because you had no common sense

236
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,830
and were so stupid

237
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,990
that I couldn't bear to watch.

238
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,990
I'm sorry,

239
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,230
I shouldn't have said that.

240
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,470
This one.

241
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,710
The shoelaces.

242
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,830
You taught me how to

243
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,620
tie the shoelaces.

244
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,510
I've been doing it this way ever since.

245
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:45,670
Sometimes,

246
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,830
it made me think of you.

247
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,150
You remember such a trivial thing?

248
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,590
Put your foot out.

249
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,790
Come on.

250
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,870
Anyway,

251
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,860
as I recall,

252
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,070
you'd really helped me a lot.

253
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,590
Which is why I'm willing

254
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,710
to give you a chance.

255
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,110
So that's the reason.

256
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,150
I thought...

257
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,750
What?

258
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,950
You thought I like you?

259
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,590
I'm not a narcissist like you.

260
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,110
Tell me,

261
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,630
should I dote on you?

262
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,550
If it's because

263
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,830
I'd helped you before,

264
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,470
you should've used words like thank you,

265
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,950
gratitude or repay,

266
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,230
instead of doting on me.

267
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,030
I don't want to.

268
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,390
I think that's the best word

269
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,780
that can represent my feelings.

270
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,310
How was your interview

271
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,270
with Jia Shu?

272
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,710
It was fine.

273
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,550
I'm glad you're not against it.

274
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,390
I was so worried today,

275
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,420
that you'd get into a fight with Jia Shu

276
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,830
and

277
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,950
I'd be caught in the middle.

278
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,110
Of course I'll take your side.

279
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,030
That's more like it.

280
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,830
If you dare

281
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,790
to take their side,

282
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,310
you would never

283
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,470
get any snacks from Bestore.

284
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,270
Roger that, Ms. Tong Hua.

285
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,670
My heart is always with you.

286
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,230
When is the next interview?

287
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,510
Wait until he notifies me.

288
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,750
I see, good luck!

289
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,220
[Girlfriend,]

290
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,420
[would you mind if I'm in a sex scene?]

291
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,030
Tell me more.

292
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,590
Whom are you going to do it with?

293
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,310
[Is that the point?]

294
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,830
I'm curious.

295
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,470
And I'm very interested.

296
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,380
Very interested?

297
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,110
Why?

298
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,630
You've seen every part of my body.

299
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,310
[That's different.]

300
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,910
[Are you not interested in me?]

301
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,590
What aspect are you talking about?

302
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,070
Nothing.

303
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,750
Have you done this before?

304
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,910
[The light was off and
we were under a cover.]

305
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,710
[That doesn't count.]

306
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,790
If you need to do a bed scene,

307
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,670
will you get nervous?

308
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,270
[I suppose I will.]

309
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,830
You'd be nervous?

310
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,470
Then, do you want me to

311
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,310
[rehearse the scene with you first?]

312
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,780
Sure.

313
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,430
I'm kidding.

314
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,950
I'm not.

315
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,110
Besides, I've just figured out

316
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,510
where to go tomorrow.

317
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,790
Let's go to the mountain.

318
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,030
Why the mountain?

319
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,150
Because the night view
is really beautiful.

320
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,390
I see.

321
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,630
Are you okay with that?

322
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,870
I think we can go.

323
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,670
Okay,

324
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,550
I'll ask Fatty to book a hotel tomorrow.

325
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,380
I'll come back tomorrow afternoon.

326
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,190
I'll pick you up.

327
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,550
It's okay.

328
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,710
Just to be safe,

329
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,270
let's meet up

330
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,270
at the mountain.

331
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,470
Sure, whatever you say.

332
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,390
See you there.

333
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,230
Okay, good night.

334
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,990
Bye.

335
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,830
Good night.

336
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,190
[Did I get it wrong?]

337
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,620
[She was the one
who interviewed Jiang Yi?]

338
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,910
[Yes.]

339
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,670
[He stood her up the first time.]

340
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,230
[And she was also involved in]

341
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,750
[the elevator incident with Jiang Yi.]

342
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,310
[She's quite unlucky.]

343
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,990
He stood her up?

344
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,030
Hello, it's me.

345
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,550
Could you help me gather

346
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,870
Yu Sheng Sheng's personal information?

347
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,670
Not private information,
just the information

348
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,870
that everyone knows.

349
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,350
Don't ask.

350
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,030
I'll let you know when I find something.

351
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,670
Okay, see you on Monday.

352
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,990
Hello, Xiao Li.

353
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,190
I need you to find out which school

354
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,300
Jiang Yi's sister is in.

355
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,030
Okay, make it fast.

356
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,430
Miss me?

357
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,710
I missed you so much.

358
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,750
Let me take a good look at you.

359
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,190
Let me look at you too.

360
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,110
Put your bag down.

361
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,190
Come.

362
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,510
New dress?

363
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,350
Yes.

364
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,870
Is it nice?

365
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,230
It looks good.

366
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,030
This room is quite comfy.

367
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,110
I'll check it out.

368
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,630
Sure.

369
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,950
The room is huge.

370
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,710
Fatty said

371
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,910
there's a yard here.

372
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,750
We can enjoy the view
without leaving the room.

373
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,070
What do you think?

374
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,870
It has a great view.

375
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,630
Fatty has ordered dinner.

376
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,150
Go pick it up later.

377
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,510
Sure.

378
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,990
You know me well.

379
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,270
Compared to foie gras and red wine,

380
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,750
steamboats suit me better.

381
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,630
Try the spam.

382
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,310
Thank you.

383
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,550
When's your

384
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,510
next business trip?

385
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,310
The recording went well.

386
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,740
I don't have to travel next week.

387
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,590
Why didn't you tell me

388
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,380
over the phone?

389
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,070
You want to give me a surprise?

390
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,350
Does this count as a surprise?

391
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,390
Of course.

392
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,590
We can go on

393
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,470
more dates now.

394
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,230
You're

395
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,310
so easily pleased.

396
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,190
If we're

397
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,190
a normal couple,

398
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,230
it'd be perfectly normal

399
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,580
for us to do that.

400
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,190
But I find myself

401
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,390
a celebrity boyfriend.

402
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,550
I need to bear the cost

403
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,910
to be with a handsome guy.

404
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,820
Right,

405
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,590
I need to

406
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,830
talk to you about something.

407
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,550
What's that?

408
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,390
Some time later,

409
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,180
I'd like to tell my parents

410
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,190
about us.

411
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,510
It's just a suggestion.

412
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,710
Forget it if you're not okay with it.

413
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,150
Of course you can.

414
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,390
No pressure.

415
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,270
I was waiting for you

416
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,220
to bring it up.

417
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,980
I thought you wanted to hide me from them.

418
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,870
I'm not hiding you from them,

419
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,310
I'm protecting you.

420
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,590
Your parents aren't just anyone.

421
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,350
I think it's necessary

422
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,190
for us to tell them

423
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,150
before they find out.

424
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,470
Okay.

425
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,300
I'll talk to them

426
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,230
at the right time.

427
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,510
Back then,

428
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,390
you told me

429
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,270
your parents are my parents.

430
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,030
Never had we expected that the joke

431
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,070
would come true.

432
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,110
It's still uncertain

433
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,910
whether you can get that far.

434
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,430
You better do a good job.

435
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,070
Sure, I'll start now.

436
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,430
Come, have a mushroom.

437
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,390
Thank you.

438
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,870
It's cold.

439
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,830
Put on the jacket.

440
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,830
Thank you.

441
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,190
What's that?

442
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:39,980
This?

443
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,510
A star laser pointer.

444
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,310
You brought equipment.

445
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,550
Let's see.

446
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,430
Look at this.

447
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:49,660
This is

448
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,910
Perseus.

449
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,300
And this is Andromeda.

450
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,620
In Greek mythology,

451
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,630
one of them is a hero

452
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,870
while the other one is a princess.

453
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,350
Both of them

454
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,390
had suffered a lot.

455
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,790
They ascended to heaven after death

456
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,550
and became two constellations.

457
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,550
They are each other's guardian angel.

458
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,830
Now is the season

459
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,550
where you can see

460
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,590
the Perseids meteor shower easily.

461
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,550
The Perseids meteor shower

462
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,750
is also known as
the tears of St. Lawrence.

463
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,750
According to the myth,

464
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,790
if a person makes a wish

465
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,750
while watching the Perseids,

466
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,510
the wish will come true.

467
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,150
Especially if it's related to love.

468
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,110
It sounded more like

469
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,580
what my senior would say.

470
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,990
You're not an amateur astronomer.

471
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,270
How do you know all this?

472
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,990
I did my homework.

473
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,870
Besides, I'd thought about it.

474
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,870
Since you had a huge crush

475
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,910
on Shen Bo Qing in high school,

476
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,350
he must have had

477
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,990
some charm for you.

478
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,870
I should improve myself,

479
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,710
shouldn't I?

480
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,310
Do you like me so much?

481
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,150
Yes.

482
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,550
You're very outstanding already.

483
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,590
If you were to improve yourself,

484
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,270
I'd be worried that

485
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,390
I wouldn't be good enough for you.

486
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,870
You've done so much for me.

487
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,790
Although there's no meteor shower,

488
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,310
I still want to make wishes.

489
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,270
Go ahead.

490
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,590
I wish Jiang Yi well
in his future endeavours.

491
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,350
I want him to be safe

492
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,710
and surrounded by love
for the rest of his life.

493
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,990
He'll never feel that

494
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,270
he's not wanted.

495
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,110
Don't make it all about me.

496
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,590
Say something for yourself.

497
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,670
I hope we can

498
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,830
be together forever.

499
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,430
We'll stick together

500
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,030
in times of joy and sorrow.

501
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,270
I'm done.

502
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,750
It's so windy.

503
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:56,740
Indeed,

504
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,830
it's very windy at night.

505
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,070
And it's cold.

506
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,190
Let's go back to the room

507
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,340
to avoid catching cold.

508
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,660
Sure.

509
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,790
What was Fatty thinking?

510
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,670
There's only one mattress.

511
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,150
How are we going to sleep?

512
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,990
It's not the first time

513
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,230
we've had to share a bed.

514
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,550
It's not the same thing.

515
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,550
Fine.

516
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,750
If you're not okay with this,

517
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,750
the room on this side

518
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,430
and the other side

519
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,470
belong to us too.

520
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,420
You booked three rooms?

521
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,070
Yes.

522
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,590
Both the rooms have a garden view.

523
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,710
I want to play it safe.

524
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,430
What a waste.

525
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,100
I'm tired.

526
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,790
Let's get some rest now.

527
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,070
I'll go next door.

528
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,030
I'll go.

529
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,910
It's inconvenient for you to go.

530
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,910
You want to go next door?

531
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,590
I'll walk you to the door.

532
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,590
Okay.

533
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,830
[He's really here for the night view.]

534
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,070
What should I do

535
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,710
if snakes or spiders

536
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,670
come into my room at night?

537
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,460
You're afraid of them?

538
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,110
A little.

539
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,390
Why don't you just...

540
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,910
Keep the balcony doors tightly closed?

541
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,870
That ought to do it.

542
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:06,870
You're right.

543
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,590
Then, I'll leave now.

544
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,110
You really want to go?

545
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,790
You said you're tired.

546
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,990
Didn't you say you want to

547
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,430
rehearse the scene with me?

548
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,110
I was joking.

549
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,910
If the snakes or spiders

550
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,750
come into my room

551
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,030
at night,

552
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,270
what should I do then?

553
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,790
Just keep the balcony doors
tightly closed.

554
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,310
Hello, I'm here to deliver
the mosquito repellents.

555
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,670
Thank you.

556
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,550
Do Not Disturb sign.

557
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,510
Do not disturb.

558
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,860
[This is the latest news
from the observatory.]

559
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,510
[Asteroid B56743]

560
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:48,820
[Asteroid B56743 misses the Earth]

561
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,190
[will soon cross paths with the Earth.]

562
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,190
[In the coming week,]

563
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,830
[it will reach the critical point]

564
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,150
[and miss the Earth]

[According to the expert,]

567
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,750
[the asteroid will have no impact]

568
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,510
[on the Earth's orbit.]

569
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,710
Good morning, Yu Sheng Sheng.

570
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,580
Did we switch bodies again?

571
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,710
We shouldn't have

572
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,670
acted rashly last night.

573
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,550
Calm down.

574
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,710
Let's figure out what to do.

575
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,590
Luckily, you

576
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,710
don't have to work next week.

577
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,430
I have a commercial
performance in two days.

578
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,230
Can you do it?

579
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,670
Commercial performance?

580
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,270
Are you kidding me?

581
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,390
Help me post on Weibo and say

582
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,060
I quit then.

583
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,260
We'll become a normal couple.

584
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,110
I don't mind

585
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,150
living in your body.

586
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,030
That's great.

587
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,150
It'll spare me from

588
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,470
living in fear every day.

589
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,190
Should we try doing something to see

590
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,470
if we can switch back?

591
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,630
Like what?

592
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,350
We can start from

593
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,510
the physical contact we had last night.

594
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,990
Stop!

595
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,430
You're bullying me again.

596
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,110
You started it.

597
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,230
I was thinking about

598
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,350
what Tong Tong said.

599
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,300
If we didn't switch bodies

600
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,990
after doing this,

601
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,430
then we probably

602
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,870
wouldn't switch bodies again.

603
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,390
You're relieved now?

604
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,030
I'm relieved.

605
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,430
I'll order breakfast by phone now.

606
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,070
Okay.

607
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,550
[Please open the door.]

608
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,470
You don't have to work today?

609
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,900
I don't have work during the day

610
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,030
but I have an event at night.

611
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,470
You want one?

612
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,300
What?

613
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:58,990
I'm fine.

614
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,510
I thought

615
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,350
you'd be waiting for me

616
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,070
with your delicate makeup.

617
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,790
We agreed on

618
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,590
being honest with each other.

619
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,910
So, I want to show you

620
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,870
how I am in real life.

621
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,670
So, how many masks

622
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,710
do you apply every day?

623
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,390
It depends.

624
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,390
I do it whenever I have time.

625
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,870
My food is ready.

626
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,470
Take a seat first.

627
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,510
[He can cook?]

628
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,830
Old friend, come eat with me.

629
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,830
What is it?

630
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,780
Stewed bird's nest with milk.

631
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,510
It's good for your skin.

632
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,510
You take very good care of yourself.

633
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,150
Are you alright?

634
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,430
I'm fine.

635
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,470
I might have caught a cold.

636
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:03,710
Wait here,

637
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,990
we have Ganmaoling granules.

638
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,550
Thank you.

639
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,870
Have you ever thought

640
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,470
that ageing is an inevitable part of life?

641
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,390
It's inevitable,

642
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,390
but we can slow it down.

643
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,230
If nothing else works, I'll just retire.

644
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,510
After all, there'll always be new idols

645
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,190
who can love them for me.

646
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,110
You're very optimistic.

647
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,300
But your fans are always fighting with

648
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,390
Jiang Yi's fans.

649
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,350
Aren't you

650
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,190
Jiang Yi's fan?

651
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,190
I don't fight, nor do I scold people.

652
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,900
What about Yu Sheng Sheng and you?

653
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,950
We spent our days

654
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,070
recommending our idols to each other.

655
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,190
Seems like you've succeeded.

656
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,700
And I'm unmarketable.

657
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,430
Perhaps I still

658
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,870
remember you

659
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,110
as who you were before.

660
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,750
And you kept telling your assistant

661
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,750
to send me group messages.

662
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,470
That was very...

663
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:36,990
Annoying.

664
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,140
I understand.

665
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,230
As a matter of fact,

666
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,430
when you dislike someone,

667
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,870
everything they do

668
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,670
annoys you.

669
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,990
Though my intention was to

670
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,030
give you the tickets.

671
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,750
People can change.

672
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,070
I was too stubborn.

673
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,070
So now you've

674
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,990
changed the way you see me?

675
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,110
Yes.

676
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,830
Also, this is a great

677
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,510
suggestion

678
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,900
to let me observe you while chit-chatting

679
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,780
instead of making it an interview.

680
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,230
We weren't very close back then

681
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,030
and I just helped you out

682
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,750
in some small way,

683
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,510
yet you're being so accommodating for me.

684
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,870
I feel like I don't deserve it.

685
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,230
Take it as an act to win your heart.

686
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,470
I don't deserve that.

687
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,310
Right,

688
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,350
I purposely

689
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,260
called a friend over to us.

690
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,390
You can talk with her later.

691
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,460
Sure.

692
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,710
I'll definitely

693
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,190
put my best effort into this article.

694
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,230
Once your schedule is fixed,

695
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,350
I'll take leave.

696
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,590
Let's go to an island

697
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,950
that's popular among foreigners.

698
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,860
Before you become popular overseas,

699
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,710
we can still

700
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,670
travel with ease.

701
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,470
Sure, whatever you say.

702
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,710
From now on,

703
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,230
I'll skip dinner

704
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,310
and do several sets of sit ups every day.

705
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,150
I want to look skinny in a swimsuit

706
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,350
and take beautiful photos.

707
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,000
[Li Zhen]

708
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,550
Hello.

709
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,670
[Xiao Yi, are you back
from your business trip?]

710
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,670
I am.

711
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,310
I've completed

712
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,350
all my work.

713
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,390
I'll go back to my lab in two days.

714
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,750
If you have time

715
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,070
for the next two days,

716
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,140
I'm thinking we can eat together.

717
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,070
Sure, tell me what you want to eat

718
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,630
and I'll make a reservation.

719
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,790
You don't have to.

720
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,380
I want to

721
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,470
cook a meal for you.

722
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,990
Sure, I'm driving now.

723
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,590
I'll talk to you later.

724
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,710
[Okay,]

725
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,350
[be careful.]

726
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,990
Bye.

727
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,110
Your mum wants to cook
for you at the villa?

728
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,630
She was talking about

729
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,070
the house I stayed in when I was young.

730
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,350
Every time she's back,
she won't stay at the hotel.

731
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,500
She'd stay at the house.

732
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,100
Come with me.

733
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,390
That's not a good idea.

734
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,030
Why are you nervous?

735
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,550
This isn't a formal meeting.

736
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:04,910
Besides,

737
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,910
my mum doesn't even care about me.

738
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:06,900
She wouldn't care

739
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,950
if I have a girlfriend either.

740
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,510
Besides, you told me

741
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,110
that I should relax

742
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,030
and move forward.

743
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,390
Come with me, will you?

744
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,310
Okay, I'll go with you.

745
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,950
Thanks a lot for

746
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,310
answering so many questions today.

747
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,750
It's really helpful

748
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,430
for my article.

749
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,110
You should thank Jia Shu instead.

750
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,310
He values friendship a lot,

751
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,830
especially old friends like you.

752
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,070
I was going to thank him too.

753
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,470
It's the least I can do.

754
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,220
You're welcome.

755
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,420
Right, Shu Yi,

756
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,740
I have one last question for you.

757
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,550
In your opinion, does Pei Jia Shu

758
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,430
have any shortcomings?

759
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,580
Shortcomings?

760
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,350
He values friendship indiscriminately.

761
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:56,950
Does that count?

762
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,070
How so?

763
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,230
There's a guy

764
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,630
who likes to ask him for money.

765
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,550
He didn't borrow a lot each time.

766
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,830
He'd ask for 3000 to 5000

767
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,590
but he never paid him back.

768
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,030
He might really have had difficulties.

769
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,470
He knows you're a big star

770
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,630
and you'd be embarrassed

771
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,830
to ask him to pay you back.

772
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,190
This isn't a shortcoming. This is idiocy.

773
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,190
Right?

774
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,350
Now I'm not the only one

775
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,190
who said that.

776
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,390
But Jia Shu came

777
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,670
from a wealthy family,

778
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,820
I suppose he doesn't care about the money.

779
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,070
You're wrong.

780
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,950
Compared to my old friend,

781
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,910
my family background is just so-so.

782
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,030
Is that so?

783
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,430
Why do you want to be
an entertainment reporter then?

784
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,350
Or

785
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,630
does the company belong to your family?

786
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,070
No.

787
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,350
I just love it.

788
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,340
It has nothing to do with my family.

789
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,670
I don't really understand

790
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,550
wealthy people.

791
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,350
Right, let me add you on WeChat.

792
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,550
Sure.

793
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,110
I'll scan your code.

794
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:45,700
Sure.

795
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,350
Finish it quickly.

796
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,230
It's getting cold.

797
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,230
I was so engaged in the conversation

798
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,830
that I'd forgotten about this.

799
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,230
You seldom cook for me.

800
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,630
I need to post this on Weibo.

801
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,630
[I did a little favour for my friend]

802
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,030
[and I got this in return.]

803
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,350
Change your shoes.

804
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,590
Tong Tong, I'm here.

805
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,870
You're finally here.

806
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,060
This interview has been

807
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,270
a little overwhelming for me.

808
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,350
You two know each other?

809
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,860
Yes.

810
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,950
Jiang Yi and I

811
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,350
ran into each other at the gate

812
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,430
and so we came in together.

813
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,990
You're not working today?

814
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,510
I'm here to talk about Jia Shu.

815
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,270
Jiang Yi, if you have time,

816
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,070
sit down

817
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,350
and talk about Jia Shu with us.

818
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,670
Sure.

819
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,990
Let's all sit down.

820
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,430
-Why don't we...
-Well...

821
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,780
Sorry,

822
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,870
I didn't know you were coming.

823
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,110
I only brought three cups of coffee.

824
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,460
Since all of you

825
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,430
are here because of me,

826
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,510
let me go get some drinks for you.

827
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,270
Say something nice.

828
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,270
That was pretty close.

829
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,710
I thought I could

830
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,950
take you home with me

831
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,990
since your car is in the workshop.

832
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,950
It's all my fault.

833
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,630
I wanted to send you

834
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,710
a message on WeChat.

835
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,070
But Xu Shu Yi

836
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,070
was too talkative

837
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,550
and it just slipped my mind.

838
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,710
Last time, I bumped into you.

839
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,910
This time, I bumped into Xu Shu Yi.

840
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,430
If there's a next time,

841
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,340
I'll surely

842
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,830
inquire before I come.

843
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,030
What's the problem?

844
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,470
You think it's bad to bump into me?

845
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,590
That's not what I meant.

846
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,510
I mean, thank God you were there today.

847
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,670
Brother,

848
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,310
aren't you going to say anything?

849
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,310
I think Xu Shu Yi

850
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,830
has found out everything.

851
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,790
Were there

852
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,830
any flaws in our acting?

853
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,270
It was too coincidental.

854
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,870
Besides, she didn't ask anything.

855
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,070
Don't you think

856
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,830
she treated you

857
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,750
differently today?

858
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,590
How did she treat you before?

859
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,150
She used to go head to head with me.

860
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,510
She was very kind today.

861
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,510
Now that you mention it,
that may really be the case.

862
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,860
She knows everything.

863
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,270
Why is she acting like she knows nothing?

864
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,110
Because I didn't tell her about it

865
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,670
and she doesn't want to
give us a hard time.

866
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,270
She has high emotional intelligence.

867
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,070
Even if she knows everything,

868
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,270
it'll be okay, right?

869
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,190
It's fine.

870
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,630
She wouldn't tell anyone.

871
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,630
Pull the brake!

872
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,070
What's wrong?

873
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:19,910
Tong Tong.

874
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,350
Jiang Yi and I switched bodies again.

875
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,230
Sheng Sheng, stop messing with me.

876
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,030
Tong Tong, I'm Sheng Sheng.

877
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,510
How is this possible?

878
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,350
You guys are messing with me.

879
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:40,830
Tong Tong,

880
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,190
why don't you believe me?

881
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,790
Can you not make

882
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,670
such a disgusting expression

883
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,310
on my face?

884
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,270
Tong Tong doesn't trust me.

885
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,470
Stop!

886
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,110
Don't make that expression

887
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,910
with my idol's face.

888
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,750
I believe you.

889
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,430
So, you're inside

890
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,350
each other's bodies now.

891
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,550
You...

892
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,790
You're Jiang Yi.

893
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,630
You're Yu Sheng Sheng.

894
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,590
I'm getting a headache.

895
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,630
We should be the one

896
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,230
having headaches.

897
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,070
Let me park the car.

898
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,470
We'll talk later.

899
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,700
♫ The night is used to
the pitch-black darkness ♫

900
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,140
♫ It never thought that it'd someday ♫

♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

908

♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

909
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,590
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

910
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,910
♫ Time is the best testament ♫

911
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,060
♫ To this journey ♫

912
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,230
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

913

♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

915
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,550
♫ I get used to ♫

916
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:42,030
♫ Having you by my side ♫

917
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,270
♫ Understanding each other's
heart is just so precious ♫

918
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,230
♫ Don't need to speak or
beat around the bush ♫

919
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:57,170
♫ I always get a glimpse of your world ♫

920
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,340
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

930
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,420
♫ Being in love brings two ♫

931
