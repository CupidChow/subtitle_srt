[The Day of Becoming You]

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,060
[Episode 3]

28
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,790
I attended promotions

29
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,060
and magazine shoots
on behalf of you all day.

30
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,190
And you?

31
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,310
Enjoying a quiet and free life

32
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,990
at home,

33
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,470
and you're still in the mood to shower?

34
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,030
When you put on the bra, did you...

35
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,270
At least you have a heart

36
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,110
to keep your eyes shut.

37
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,750
I'm not wearing any.

38
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,030
You're not wearing a bra?

39
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,430
It's uncomfortable.

40
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,830
You still need to.

41
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,470
Why?

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,990
It makes not much difference.

43
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,670
You touched it!

44
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,950
Mine's much bigger.

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,270
Get over here.

46
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,310
These are mine.

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,630
Pick one and put it on.

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,190
Don't girls have

49
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,390
matching intimate wear?

50
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,470
Don't stereotype us girls.

51
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,110
How about this one?

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,430
Need me teach you how to wear it?

53
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,140
No need.

54
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,670
No matter what,

55
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,950
you must wear a bra.

56
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,380
Keep it tidy.

57
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,110
Put it in.

58
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,270
Bro,

59
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,230
for my sake,

60
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,390
since we've

61
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,710
switched bodies,

62
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,750
we ought to be sisters from now on.

63
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,430
I'm nobody's sister!

64
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,630
Sisters from different parents.
Will that do?

65
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,030
I only have

66
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,710
one request.

67
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,990
You need to wear a bra.

68
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,990
If you don't,

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,230
I'll use your body

70
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,830
and do a naked run outside.

71
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,750
Well, don't blame me

72
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,430
if it goes on the hot search.

73
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,110
I got it.

74
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,870
Sheng Sheng, enough talk about work.

75
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,150
Come eat some fruits.

76
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,430
Just a minute.

77
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,430
Coming.

78
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,430
What should we do from now on?

79
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,710
Think of ways to quit the job.

80
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,990
How?

81
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:18,950
Fake an illness.

82
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,590
Would that work?

83
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,830
I don't know.

84
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,950
I don't fall ill often.

85
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,140
If it doesn't work,

86
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,790
I'll continue attending promotions as you.

87
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,950
You'd go to work as me.

88
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,750
Let's add each other on WeChat

89
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,470
to stay connected.

90
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,310
The doctor said,

91
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,750
when

92
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,350
the elevator incident happened,

93
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,620
Jiang Yi was protecting Sheng Sheng.

94
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,550
Yes.

95
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,870
He's quite a gentleman.

96
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,630
It's only right for

97
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,590
boys to protect girls.

98
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:52,830
Right.

99
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,430
Yi, you're done chatting?

100
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,060
Uncle and Aunty said

101
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,070
they've known you for a long time.

102
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,510
Aunty is a teacher.

103
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,550
You are well-loved by many students

104
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,550
in the school she teaches at.

105
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,110
The hotel Uncle works in

106
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,030
also plays your music all the time.

107
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,230
Why don't we take a photo together?

108
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,110
Take a photo?

109
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,630
I'm old.

110
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,830
I don't look good in photos.

111
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,830
What are you talking about?

112
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,710
You're at the age

113
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,100
passable for a debut.

114
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,550
Yi.

115
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,230
Yeah. Uncle, Aunty,

116
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,070
let's take a photo together.

117
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,150
Come. Get over here.

118
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,630
Come.

119
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,750
Come, come, come.

120
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,070
Sheng Sheng,

121
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,070
join us.

122
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,270
It's okay. I'm fine.

123
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,910
Get over here.

124
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,030
Everyone's waiting for you.

125
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,580
Yeah.

126
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,710
Mind joining them, Reporter Yu?

127
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,430
Yeah, Reporter Yu.

128
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,150
Come on.

129
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,430
Three, two, one.

130
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,030
Cheese.

131
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,350
Thanks for your warm hospitality,
Uncle and Aunty.

132
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,350
Reporter Yu, take good care.

133
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,310
Bye, Uncle. Bye, Aunty.

134
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,950
Bye.

135
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,350
Be careful and have a safe journey.

136
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,910
Okay.

137
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,710
Yu Sheng Sheng.

138
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,830
How could you, a girl,

139
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,510
bring a guy

140
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,870
you just met into your room?

141
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,430
Are you fond of

142
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,220
that Jiang Yi?

143
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,030
Don't worry. He doesn't like me.

144
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm going to rest.

145
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,820
What? She's not making sense.

146
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,270
How are you a reporter?

147
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,020
I'm making some

148
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,190
meat wonton for supper.

149
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,950
Was that your first time visiting her?

150
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,470
Yeah...

151
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,070
Yeah, of course.

152
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,620
What's up?

153
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,470
Why do you ask?

154
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,590
How did you know where

155
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,470
to find the slippers in her house?

156
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,550
Aren't

157
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,870
slippers usually kept in shoe racks?

158
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,430
She sheepishly

159
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,150
dragged you into the room.

160
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,910
What did she tell you?

161
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,220
There were a few areas of the interview

162
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,030
that she didn't quite understand.

163
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,030
So, she wanted to clarify.

164
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,030
She dove straight into work
after being hospitalized.

165
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,790
How dedicated.

166
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:38,990
Yeah.

167
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,750
Hence, we should work with her often.

168
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,590
I'll take that into consideration.

169
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,140
Hands dry?

170
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,590
A little.

171
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,070
Apply some hand cream when we get back.

172
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,900
[That was close.]

173
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,110
[I need to be more careful next time.]

174
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,070

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,030
social media account.

344
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,350
It's garnered a huge following.

345
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,350
Morning, Sister Sheng Sheng.

346
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,030
This is Xiao Xiao,

347
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,390
our company's art editor,

348
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,150
as well as the gossiper of the company.

349
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,750
Whatever she knows,

350
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,510
the whole company knows.

351
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,470
How does it feel to have
interviewed Jiang Yi?

352
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,980
Is he handsome in person?

353
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,950
We thought that

354
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,310
you were cheated.

355
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,750
But, it seems you've gotten close to him.

356
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,670
Beware of this person,

357
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,630
Zhang Zhi Xiao.

358
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,430
She handles the public social
media accounts of celebrities,

359
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,230
Listen to Her.

360
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,750
She speaks sarcastically
and loves to ridicule others.

361
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,350
Her favourite pastime?

362
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,830
Provoking others.

363
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,350
Stay as far as you can from her.

364
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,790
I don't even try to confront her

365
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,190
because she's pea-brained.

366
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,990
[After you passed the entrance,
there'll be]

367
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,510
[a face-recognition system for punch in.]

368
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,430
[But, it's positioned]

369
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,990
[really high up.]

370
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,150
[So, you'd need to]

371
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,190
[step on the box on the side]

372
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,300
and tip-toe as hard as you can.

373
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,030
And, you'd also need to smile

374
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,590
for the system to recognise you.

375
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,870
It's designed by

376
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,460
the leader of our company.

377
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,510
She thinks that tip-toeing and smiling

378
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,310
in the morning

379
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,150
rids off the whole day's tiredness,

380
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,510
giving us the oomph

381
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,790
to start working for the day.

382
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,550
Silly, huh?

383
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,460
Tip-toe.

384
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,150
Smile.

385
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,830
Smile.

386
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,950
[Yu Sheng Sheng, good morning.]

387
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,310
Sheng Sheng, are you feeling any better?

388
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,940
This male colleague,
Peng Ke (sounds like "punk"),

389
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,230
PIC of social media account,
Wonderful Movie-Lovers' Club.

390
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,550
Unlike his name,

391
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,750
he's nowhere near a punk.

392
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,710
[He plays the nice guy card.]

393
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,990
[He's one whom I've defeated.]

394
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,550
Editor-in-Chief!

395
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,950
This, is our editor-in-chief,

396
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,750
Qiu Yu Wei.

397
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,070
She's like the dean of students
of the office,

398
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,910
and another mother to me.

399
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,270
[She's all about discipline]

400
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,430
[and work achievements.]

401
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,310
[I've been under her wing for four years.]

402
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,470
[She knows me like the back of her hand.]

403
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,350
Back to work?

404
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,270
Go about your business.

405
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,750
Don't tire yourself out.

406
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,670
Now, I'm going to brief you on

407
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,990
the cubicles and who they belong to.

408
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,990
When you walk through here,

409
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,910
[you'll pass by four seats.]

410
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,550
[This area]

411
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,750
[belongs to Listen to Her.]

[My place is on the most inward]

413
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,750

[with]

[the photo of my dear Shu Shu.]

416

[It'd be easy to spot]

417
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,030
[at one glance.]

418
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,030
[It's here.]

419
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,710
[Don't go to the wrong place.]

420
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,190
Morning. Coffee.

421
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,150
[Lastly, you've seen this person before.]

422
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,860
[She's my best friend, Tong Hua.]

423
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,470
[We've been staying under
the same roof for two years.]

424
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,870
[She's beautiful, kind and sophisticated.]

425
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,950
Compared to her,

426
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,750
I'm close to being like her.

427
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,230
She's a hardcore fan of yours.

428
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,830
She knows everything about you.

429
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,630
Sheng Sheng,

430
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,470
what's with you today?

431
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,230
You didn't even put on makeup

432
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,470
nor did you do your hair.

433
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,630
Isn't this the tracksuit

434
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,430
you bought to motivate

435
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,590
yourself to work out to lose weight

436
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,350
the year before?

437
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,470
I woke up late and didn't
manage to do all those.

438
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,190
Your house is too far

439
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,630
from our office.

440
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,150
It's better for you

441
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,230
to come back and stay with me.

442
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,590
I can drive you to work too.

443
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,470
Right. You have it?

444
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,910
What?

445
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,790
The pen recorder.

446
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,630
Don't tell me you can't find it.

447
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,110
I can't find it.

448
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,790
[So?]

[Couldn't be any smoother.]

[Keep it up!]

Yi, morning.

466
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,030
Are you alone?

467
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,350
Jia Shu's not here with you?

468
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,750
He's coming straight from the airport.

469
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,230
He's a busy, busy man.

470
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,630
That elevator incident of yours

471
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,790
scared the life out of me.

472
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,910
I hope you suffered nothing from it.

473

[Does switched bodies count?]

474

That's good to hear.

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:52,950
Right.

476
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,590
My cousin sister back in my hometown

Just sign.

Okay. Sure.

487

Yes.

I'll give it to you.

All three artistes, ready?

Okay, camera

519
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,510
Okay.

520
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,950
Ready?

521
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,950
Three, two, one. Action.

522
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,990
Okay.

523

Now,

my friends.

530
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,070
The first one,

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,510
a man who's been living
under the same roof as me.

Captain of Little Galaxy, Jiang Yi.

Hello!

And on my left,

535
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,510
is our mutual friend.

536
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,670
She calls herself an outdated host,

537
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,270
Xu Shu Yi!

538
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,590
Hello!

Next,

540
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,630
we're going to get prepared.

541
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,390
Okay.

[Gosh, he's handsome.]

548
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,070
Yi, why are your cheeks red?

549
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,830
It's a little hot in here.

550
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,990
The air-cond's almost on full blast.

551
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,710
Let... Let me drink some water

552
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,710
to cool myself down.

Jiang Yi.

554
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,740
You dropped your mic.

555
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,470
Thank you.

556

[Jia Shu is such a warm guy.]

557

What will you be bringing

00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,310
your fans next?

559
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,150
A solo album.

560
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,430
Will your solo album be the extension

561
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,710
of Little Galaxy's style

562
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,910
or will you take on a brand new style?

563
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,310
It's not set yet.

564
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,590
You seldom update your post

565
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,620
on your social media account.

566
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,350
So, what do you like to do

567
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,150
when you're not working?

568
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,790
Stay at home and sleep.

569
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,910
For the parent-child reality TV show,

570
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,790
you've invited your dad

571
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,470
several times but were rejected.

572
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,270
Would he be interested

573
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,270
to participate for the next season?

574
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,430
I won't consider.

575
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,950
Wow, your acting's just like him.

576
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,830
You look like you need a spanking,

577
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,990
just like my prince charming.

578
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,390
Okay, enough acting.

579
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,390
You remember now?

580
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,150
Gather the info and pass them to me.

581
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,830
It's okay, Yi.

582
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,590
Keep it up.

583
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,750

do you want to rest?

585

I've looked through. You did quite well.

641

I think we'd produce

an epic article.

643
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:30,830
Who knew that

644
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,030

This is pure bliss for me and his fans.

647
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,910
Since he's a taciturn person,

648
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,030
then, why do you like him?

649
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,140
Don't you think that

650
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,870
men with stories are most attractive?

651
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,790
It's not too late to give up Pei Jia Shu

652
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,830
and convert into a fan of Jiang Yi.

653
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,870
Forget it. I'm just too shallow.

654
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,270
Good that you know.

655
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,100
Right.

656
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,830
Weren't you asked to interview him

657
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,740
about his parents?

658
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,430
Why is there

659

nothing on that?

660
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,710
He didn't want to talk about it.

661
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,100
I'll go refill my cup.

662
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,350
That should be

Not at all.

Don't worry. I'm here.

00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,830
right?

685
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,990
Well, the three of you

686
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,910
are staying together after all.

687
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:55,990
Yeah.

688
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,630
It's been years. We're used to it.

689
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,590
I know that three of you

690
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,470
are really close.

691
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,510
Therefore, every time I read

692
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,260
rumours of you guys

693
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,070
having a fall out online,

694
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,230
it makes me laugh.

695
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,340
Some even say that

696
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,590
the three of you stay together

697
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,790
for publicity.

698
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,230
[It's the segment to prove our innocence.]

699
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,550
[Should I do something?]

700
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,790
You know,

701
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,110
I've heard of something
that's more exaggerated

702
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,270
about Jiang Yi and I

703
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,670
being hanky-panky backstage.

704
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,030
That's outrageous.

705
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,830
Yeah.

706
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,550
Hanky-panky

707
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,030
as in like this?

708
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,070
Yeah, we always do.

709
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,310
Hey, enough the both of you.

710
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,470
You're blinding us with

711
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,070
too much public display of affection.

712
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,910
The pot's boiling.

713
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,750
Let's add ingredients.

714
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,230
[I need to get my hands]

715
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,430
[on just this snippet]

716
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,950
[and add it to my collection.]

717
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,310
Yi,

718
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,470
I thought you don't eat mutton?

719
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,070
Yeah.

720
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,910
I was blanching it for my Jia Shu...

721
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,070
I mean for the both of you.

722
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,430
How thoughtful of you, Yi.

723
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,150
Eat up.

724
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,660
Right, Yi.

725
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,110
The demo you sent me

726
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,190
sounded terrific.

727
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,990
Every line of lyrics

728
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,990
touched my heart.

729
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,590
Thank you.

730
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,230
Demo?

731
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,950
What demo?

732
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,070
Why didn't you let me

733
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,390
listen to your new demo?

734
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,790
I...

735
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,110
I think he's not satisfied with it.

736
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,460
We talked about it the last time.

737
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,430
Yi said that

738
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,220
he wanted to hear opinions

739
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,670
from someone who's a non-professional.

740
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,750
Right?

741
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,230
Yeah.

742
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,620
I wasn't satisfied.

743
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,670
Indeed,

744
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,150
direct opinion from listeners

745
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,870
are the most useful.

746
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,950
Yeah.

747
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,110
Every word

748
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,230
reminded me of my mum.

749
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,750
Mother?

750
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,950
What’s this song about,

751
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,390
Yi?

752
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,230
You're piquing my interest.

753
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,270
[Oh please,]

754
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,550
[just let me eat in peace.]

755
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,500
I'll send it to you when I'm back.

756
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,430
Alright. I'll listen to it.

757
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,750
Don't just talk.

758
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,550
Eat up.

759
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,630
Okay.

760
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,150
He's releasing a solo album soon.

761
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,550
He's on a diet. Don't be bothered.

762
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,590
Yeah.

763
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:07,870
I'll just eat veggie.

764
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,510
Wow, your self-control

765
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,870
tops most female celebrities'.

766
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,310
Let me blanch some veggies for you.

767
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,790
Here.

768
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,510
Thank you.

769
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,020
[I won't ever]

770
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,030
[go filming on behalf of you.]

771
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,510
[I was surrounded by so many cameras.]

772
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,510
[The worry that I might
have a slip of the tongue]

773
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,150
[drains my energy and stresses me out.]

774
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,390
[Aren't you happy to see Pei Jia Shu?]

775
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,430
[Of course, I am.]

776
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,790
[If Jia Shu didn't have]

777
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,350
[appointments tonight,]

778
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,550
[I would have been happier,
as we would have]

779
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,590
[gone home together.]

780
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,500
[So?]

781
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,630
[You should have gotten
off work by now, huh?]

782
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,750
[Public transportation
should be packed by now.]

783
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,030
[Not at all. I hailed a cab.]

784
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,830
[You hailed a cab with my money?]

785
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,070
[You sure know how to enjoy.]

786
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,350
[Not wanting to experience life already?]

787
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,510
[I've experienced enough.]

788
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,830
[If you don't feel like working,]

789
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,230
[just play it real at faking ill.]

790
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,230
[Don't worry.]

791
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,430
[I'd just pretend to be dead]

792
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,820
[if pretending to be ill doesn't work.]

793
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,310
[All the best.]

794
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,830
[Can I just ask you something?]

795
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,700
[Are you and Jia Shu
actually on good terms?]

796
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,270
[Another dull day.]

797
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,470
[I'm so hungry.]

798
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,350
[I want something tasty.]

799
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,350
[How did Jiang Yi get through this?]

800
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,550
[He must have hidden]

801
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,830
[some junk food somewhere.]

802
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,670
[Why is there American ginseng here?]

803
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,550
[Russian box thorn?]

804
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,630
[Hawthorns slices?]

805
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,800
[Wolfberry, Japanese honeysuckle,
Dangshen, Female ginseng,]

806
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,260
[Vitamins, Hawthorn slices, Lecithin,
Tuber fleeceflower, American ginseng]

807
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,990
[Jiang Yi's a healthcare freak.]

808
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,070
[He and my dad]

809
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,510
[would be best of friends.]

810
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,630
[What a huge walnut.]

811
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,150
[I wonder how big is its kernel.]

812
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,350
Brother Da Chuan.

813
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,150
Le Yi, where's Yi?

814
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,260
Resting in his room.

815
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,900
What happened to him?

816
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,510
He said that he's feeling
discomfort all over,

817
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,630
every part of his body.

818
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,590
But, Fatty said

819
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,510
he looked full of energy

820
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,670
just this morning.

821
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,670
Since when did

822
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,230
this kid have the habit of

823
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,230
pretending to be sick?

824
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,670
Pretend to be sick?

825
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,190
Nothing.

826
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,910
I've bought you your crayfish.

827
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,350
Enjoy.

828
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:37,990
I'll go upstairs and check on him.

829
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,870
Thanks!

830
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,950
Brother Yi, what are you doing?

831
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,830
Cracking the walnut.

832
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,190
How does this walnut not have a kernel?

833
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,590
Could it be...

834
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,260
What in the world are you doing?

835
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,070
This one doesn't have a kernel too.

836
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,780
Help me see

837
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,540
if the kernels were catapulted away.

838
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,590
Brother Yi,

839
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,070
have you suffered emotional shock?

840
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,150
What about emotional shock?

841
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,990
RMB600,000

842
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,950
and you cracked it?

843
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,110
What RMB600,000?

844
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,910
You said that yourself.

845
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,950
You've been cradling
this walnut for seven years

846
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,510
for it to reach RMB600,000.

00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,330
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

854
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,150
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

855
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,800
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

856
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,750
♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

857
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,960
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

858
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,270
♫ Time is the best testament ♫

859
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,430
♫ To this journey ♫

860
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,590
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

861
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,710
♫ My soul ♫

862
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,520
♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

863
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,910
♫ I get used to ♫

864
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,400
♫ Having you by my side ♫

865
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,630
♫ Understanding each other's
heart is just so precious ♫

866
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,590
♫ Don't need to speak or
beat around the bush ♫

867
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:43,530
♫ I always get a glimpse of your world ♫

868
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,700
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

869
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,260
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

870
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,430
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

871
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,560
♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

872
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,680
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

873

♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

876
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,940
♫ My soul ♫

877
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,620
♫ When you left, I realized ♫

878
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,790
♫ Being in love brings two ♫

879
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,040
♫ Souls together ♫

880
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,200
♫ Baby, loving you is... ♫

881
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,970
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

882
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,050
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

883
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,620
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

884
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,700
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

885
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,810
♫ My soul ♫

886
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,780
♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

887
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,170
♫ Gradually I mature ♫

888
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:50,650
♫ With you by my side ♫
