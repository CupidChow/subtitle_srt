Don't you think

Didn't you say that we'll be
internet buddies after this?

171
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,510
Or maybe

172

you don't want to be my friend anymore?

173
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,310

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,390
But

175
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,710
usually, goodbye means that
we won't keep in touch anymore.

176
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,270
And after saying goodbye,

177
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,030
I think we'll slowly

178
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,350
disappear from each other's life.

179
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,750
We'll just become one of
the passers-by in each other's life.

180
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,750
Let's

181
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,580
keep in touch often then.

182
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,310
I'm afraid that...

183
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,950
I'm afraid that you'll want to see me.

184
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,230
Will you want to see me?

185
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,110
Yes.

186
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,420
Maybe

187
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,740
you'll even give me some tea.

188
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,630
So, you did get close to me

189
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,830
because of an ulterior motive.

190
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,660
That's not true.

191
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,830
It'll be bad if

192
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,940
someone sees us like this.

193
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,110
I think she won't understand.

194
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,990
Brother.

195
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,590
Are you in a relationship with her?

196
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,070
I'm done with the foot bath.

197
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,100
I have to use the toilet.

198
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,390
Sister.

199
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,430
Let me tell you a secret.

200
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,030
What secret?

201
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,270
My brother is acting weird today.

202
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,510
He smiled at me,

203
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,310
took the food for me

204
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,510
and played with me.

205
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,710
He used to hate me.

206
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,190
Your brother doesn't hate you.

207
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,150
You are wrong.

208
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,270
He's only treating me well

209
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,310
because you are here.

210
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,340
I like him like this.

211
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,790
How about

212
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,980
you be

213
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,790
together with him forever?

214
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,070
What should I do?

215
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,950
I'm very nervous.

216
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,390
Your mum will be here soon.

217
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,070
Is there anything that
I have to take note?

218
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,110
Don't be nervous.

219
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,500
Don't talk too much.

220
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,260
Don't act too friendly.

221
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,630
Don't ask any question.

222
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,430
Just answer her questions.

223
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,830
We rarely contact each other anyway.

224
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,590
She doesn't know me well.

225
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,710
I'll be with you.

226
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,150
If she asks you

227
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,070
any difficult questions,

228
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,630
I'll message you.

229
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,750
That simple?

230
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,100
Yes.

231
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,270
When it's time,

232
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,500
you can just say goodbye to her.

233
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,830
She's already at the gate.

234
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,910
I'll go and get her.

235
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,990
Mum.

236
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,750
She is Yu Sheng Sheng.

237
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,830
My friend.

238
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,750
Hello, Miss Yu.

239
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,150
Hello.

240
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,580
Take a seat.

241
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,790
Let me get you some water.

242
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,190
I didn't disturb you, right?

243
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,630
How about you talk to her first?

244
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:39,870
It's okay.

245
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,190
We are done talking.

246
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,790
You can talk.

247
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,670
Don't mind me.

248
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,190
Xiao Yi.

249
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,110
How are you lately?

250
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,110
I'm doing

251
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,990
quite well lately.

252
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,470
I think you've gotten slimmer.

253
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,230
Really?

254
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,270
I'm going to have a shooting soon.

255
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,180
So, I have to

256
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,670
control my diet.

257
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,470
I understand the work that you do.

258
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,780
But you can't skip your meals.

259
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,990
Don't ruin your body

260
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,230
because of your work.

261
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,350
I know.

262
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,710
I was really worried about you when

263
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,030
you were caught in that lift accident.

264
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,020
After that, the local news reported that

265
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,270
you'll take a leave and rest at home.

266
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,310
I've been wanting to find a time

267
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,230
to visit you.

268
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,230
Luckily, I got a chance to come back.

269
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,470
Are you really okay?

270
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,910
I know a lot of

271
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,230
great doctors abroad.

272
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,350
If you

273
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,350
don't feel well...

274
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,980
Auntie.

275
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,710
Now, our country has very advanced

276
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,270
medical resources too.

277
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,870
Our doctors are great too.

278
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,060
Mum.

279
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,430
Don't worry.

280
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,830
I'm fine.

281
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,630
[Door is opened.]

282
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,630
Auntie, you are back.

283
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,990
Da Chuan.

284
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,990
Long time no see.

285
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,220
Yes.

286
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,910
Long time no see.

287
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,510
I'm here to visit Xiao Yi.

288
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,430
Reporter Yu is here too?

289
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,750
Yes. I asked her

290
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,990
to come here to help me out.

291
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,660
Why are you here?

292
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,630
I have something urgent to tell you.

293
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,790
Something urgent?

294
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,950
Let's talk in your room.

295
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,310
Can you wait

296
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,230
for 15 minutes?

297
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,630
No problem.

298
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,550
Go and

299
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,070
talk to him now.

300
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,780
Okay.

301
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,190
Why do you need Reporter Yu here?

302
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,790
To take care of Jiang Mo.

303
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,270
Uncle Jiang sent Jiang Mo here again?

304
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,030
Yes.

305
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,790
Where is Jiang Mo?

306
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,670
She's watching cartoon in her room.

307
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,550
So troublesome.

308
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,470
Why are you looking for me?

309
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,420
That's right.

310
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,350
Let's get back to business.

311
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,830
Your favourite movie director,

312
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,670
Director Stephen

313
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,870
will come to Beijing tomorrow.

314
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,310
He has watched your movies.

315
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,020
He said that

316
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,190
you are very suitable for a character

317
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,150
in a new movie that he's working on.

318
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,910
He wants to talk to you.

319
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,910
Tomorrow?

320
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,590
Are you not free tomorrow?

321
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,430
No,

322
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,070
I'm not free.

323
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,870
What do you have to do?

324
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,510
I'll do it for you.

325
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,310
You have to go.

326
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,470
This is such a rare chance.

327
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,110
Director Stephen's movies

328
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,430
are both profitable and artistic.

329
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,830
They are fast-selling and
award-winning movies.

330
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,590
Besides,

331
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,910
you've been wanting to
work with him, right?

332
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:38,990
No.

333
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,110
I can handle other things.

334
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,390
But this...

335
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,270
What do you mean?

336
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,390
What I mean is,

337
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,350
I think I have to

338
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,790
think about it.

339
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,350
Think...

340
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,630
Are you okay?

341
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,860
This is a great chance.

342
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,630
Miss Yu.

343
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,070
You are Xiao Yi's friend, right?

344
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,790
Yes.

345
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,670
Are you working in
the entertainment industry too?

346
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,070
No.

347
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,470
I'll get the door.

348
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,990
[Door is opened.]

349
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,030
Where's Xiao Yi?

350
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,750
He's talking upstairs.

351
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,940
You are Sister Sheng Sheng

352
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,110
that Mo Mo talks about, right?

353
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,270
I'm here to send Mo Mo her toy.

354
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,630
She can't sleep

355
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,630
without this toy

356
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,750
at night.

357
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,180
You are such a good father.

358
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,380
Children

359
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,990
are precious to their parents.

360
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,710
Why are you here?

361
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,390
I'm here to visit Xiao Yi.

362
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,950
When did you come back?

363
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,870
This morning.

364
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,710
Sister.

365
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,910
Dad!

366
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,790
Mo Mo.

367
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,230
You are here.

368
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,430
Look what I brought you.

369
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,310
Come. I miss you.

370
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,780
Give me a kiss.

371
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,630
Do you miss me?

372
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,590
Yes.

373
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,590
Sister, I want to eat strawberries.

374
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,510
I'll go and wash them.

375
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,190
Thank you.

376
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,070
Why is your daughter

377
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,230
at Xiao Yi's house?

378
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,950
Mo Mo is Xiao Yi's sister.

379
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,390
Can't she be here?

380
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,230
Xiao Yi is very busy.

381
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,470
You shouldn't trouble Xiao Yi with her.

382
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,390
Listen to you.

383
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,750
How can it be troublesome

384
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,630
when she's his sister?

385
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,630
Why do you have to be so unpleasant?

386
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,430
I'm being unpleasant?

387
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,660
You've been

388
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,830
troubling Xiao Yi for so many years.

389
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,350
Do you want me to list them out?

390
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,950
You didn't trouble him.

391
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,950
You just ran away from him
as far as possible.

392
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,550
Isn't it your fault that

393
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,660
Xiao Yi doesn't have a mother since young?

394
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,590
Nonsense!

395
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,030
You've been asking Xiao Yi

396
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,270
to pay for your family's living expenses

397
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,390
for so many years.

398
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,670
Don't you feel ashamed?

399
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,230
What do you mean?

400
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,830
Xiao Yi doesn't

401
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,430
want us to work.

402
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,350
He's being filial.

403
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,670
After so many years,

404
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,830
you are still

405
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,150
as shameless as before.

406
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,390
If you are not shameless,

407
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,470
why are you here?

408
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,390
You are getting old.

409
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,750
So, you want your son to support you now,

410
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,190
right?

411
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,630
Back then, you abandoned us,

412
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,670
your burdens for your dream, right?

413
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,030
I know

414
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,990
how much I owe Xiao Yi.

415
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,230
But I'm not as greedy

416
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,670
as you are.

417
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,390
Li Zhen.

418
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,030
Can you stop

419
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,150
acting so noble?

420
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,550
Mo Mo said that she found

421
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,230
a lot of presents

422
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
from you in Xiao Yi's room.

423
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,070
Xiao Yi has not opened any of them.

424
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,150
What does that mean?

425
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,710
It means that

426
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,980
he doesn't need your show of affection.

427
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,950
Stop flattering yourself.

428
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,430
I don't mind

429
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,750
what Xiao Yi thinks of me.

430
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,340
But let me warn you.

431
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,350
Xiao Yi is

432
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,510
working hard for his career now.

433
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,630
I won't allow you

434
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,510
to burden him again and again.

435
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,630
One of us is burdening him

436
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,110
and one of us abandoned him.

437
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,390
Great balance, right?

438
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,150
Why are you...

439
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,830
Enough!

440
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,150
It's fine.

441
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,190
Yi, you are free now?

442
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,550
Why are you here?

443
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,310
I came here to give something to Mo Mo.

444
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,470
Where is Yu Sheng Sheng?

445
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,260
She went out just now.

446
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,670
She left in a hurry.

447
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,750
Maybe she has things to do.

448
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,590
Wait. Where are you going?

449
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,670
I have things to do.

450
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,620
Keep them company.

451
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,790
Wear your cap and mask.

452
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,630
Okay.

453
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,470
It'll fine, uncle, auntie.

454
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,230
Don't worry.

455
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,830
Take a seat.

456
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,950
I'll make some tea for you.

457
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,060
Okay.

458
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,310
Thank you.

459
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,550
Come. Let's eat.

460
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,550
[Where did he go?]

461
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,260
[Why isn't he picking up the phone?]

462
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,550
[That's right.]

463
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,630
[I have a tracking app in my phone.]

464
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,590
Why are you here?

465
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,470
Why are you here?

466
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,020
Why didn't you pick up my call?

467
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,870
I didn't hear you.

468
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,830
Can you stop

469
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,030
putting it in silent mode?

470
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,790
I was

471
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,060
looking for you urgently.

472
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,110
Jiang Da Chuan told me that

473
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,830
your favourite Director Stephen

474
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,750
wants to cast you in his movie.

475
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,950
He asked me to go to Beijing tomorrow.

476
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,150
How can I go?

477
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,550
I'll ruin it.

478
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,310
Go ahead and ruin it then.

479
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,430
What?

480
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,270
You are drinking?

481
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,110
Stop it.

482
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,670
I have a bad tolerance to alcohol.

483
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,710
Are you upset?

484
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,270
Where are we?

485
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,270
Why are you here?

486
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,110
This is my home.

487
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,310
Your home?

488
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,790
Your childhood home?

489
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,620
Are you reminded of
your unhappy childhood

490
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,230
because your dad
met your mum today?

491
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,230
Go ahead and cry.

492
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,790
You are Yu Sheng Sheng now.

493
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,830
I won't feel embarrassed.

494
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,030
I've cried enough

495
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,150
when I was young.

496
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,030
I don't want to cry for them anymore.

497
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,830
[Let's file a divorce then.]

498
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,750
[Do you think I can't live without you?]

499
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,750
If you didn't stop me

500
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,750
and always demoralise me,

501
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,100
I would've been successful.

502
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,630
Jiang Dong Hai.

503
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,230
Why can't you see that

504
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,190
your so-called business is so unreliable?

505
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,430
How would I know if
I didn't give it a try?

506
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,510
Just like your experiment.

507
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,350
Did you conduct an experiment

508
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,100
because you know that it'll be successful?

509
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,230
They are not the same!

510
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,230
What do you mean?

511
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,710
Your work is your dream

512
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,230
and my work is considered as daydreaming?

513
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,830
Can you drink less

514
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,110
and find a proper job?

515
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,070
Stop reaching for something
beyond your grasp.

516
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,580
I've said it before.

517
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,030
I don't need you to teach me.

518
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,190
I'm not trying to teach you.

519
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,790
I'm just worried that if this continues,

520
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,350
you won't be able to take care of Xiao Yi.

521
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,750
So, you've already decided

522
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,830
to leave Xiao Yi with me.

523
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,190
Li Zhen, you are amazing, right?

524
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,830
Bring Xiao Yi with you abroad.

525
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,550
I'll be very busy over there.

526
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,830
I won't have time to take care of him.

527
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,700
Besides, it'll be better to let him

528
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,020
stay here.

529
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,150
I'm busy too.

530
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,660
What about my career?

531
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,230
What career do you have?

532
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,390
Jiang Dong Hai.

533
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,590
You are so free.

534
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,140
Can you contribute to this family?

535
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,110
Can you be like a man?

536
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,870
I'm not acting like a man.

537
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,910
And you are not acting like a woman.

538
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,990
Xiao Yi is still so young.

539
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,950
And you want to abandon him

540
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,790
to go abroad.

541
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,350
You are so cruel.

542
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,550
I've told you many times.

543
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,350
This is a rare opportunity

544
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,790
for me to work abroad.

545
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,830
Say no more.

546
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,110
This is the truth.

547
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,190
You don't want to take care of Xiao Yi.

548
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:27,910
Come.

549
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,590
Be careful.

550
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,790
Walk slowly.

551
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,470
I already told you that
I have bad tolerance to alcohol.

552
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,830
Why did you have to drink so much?

553
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,710
I didn't.

554
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,030
Look. An aeroplane.

555
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,950
Yes. A huge aeroplane.

556
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,870
What's wrong?

557
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,790
It's so late already.

558
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,470
Let's take a taxi to go home, okay?

559
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,230
I don't have a home.

560
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,110
Look.

561
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,670
Look at the myriad of twinkling lights.

562
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,910
They are so bright.

563
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,460
But none of them

564
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,510
belongs to me.

565
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,830
None of them wants me.

566
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,190
No one wants me.

567
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,950
Why are you like a child

568
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,150
when you are drunk?

569
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,630
Let's get up first, okay?

570
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,870
None of them wants me.

571
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,070
No one wants me.

572
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,310
That's not true.

573
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,310
I want you.

574
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,710
You are so good.

575
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,470
I want to put you in my arms,

576
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,990
take care of you

577
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,310
and treat you like the apple of my eye.

578
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,230
Let's go home, okay?

579
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,310
How am I good?

580
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,390
Look.

581
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,070
There are so many street lights here.

582
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,310
Let's walk together.

583
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,590
When we pass a street light,

584
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,750
I'll tell you one of your good points.

585
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,390
Okay?

586
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,510
Let's stand up then.

587
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,830
Let's go.

588
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:37,790
Be careful.

589
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,790
Be careful.

590
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,390
You are good-looking.

591
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,270
Besides being good-looking,

592
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,470
you are very serious

593
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,750
in working hard to become

594
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,430
a great man.

595
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,620
You can sing very well.

596
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,350
You can sing well,

597
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,710
but you don't stop at that.

598
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,070
You work hard to

599
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,670
challenge yourself

600
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,590
and create your own songs.

601
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,150
Although you look cold,

602
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,630
you actually

603
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,700
care about others' emotions
more than anyone.

604
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,910
You have

605
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,340
a warm and gentle heart.

606
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,060
Do you want to continue?

607
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,550
Yes.

608
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,470
Are you satisfied now?

609
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,660
In this myriad of twinkling lights,

610
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,190
it's untrue that no light

611
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,150
belongs to you.

612
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,150
In this world,

613
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,350
there are many who care about you.

614
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,110
The lights on the stage

615
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,460
and the glow sticks

616
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,390
in your fans' hands

617
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,230
are for you.

618
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,110
Look. You've debuted for seven years.

619
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,670
Sometimes, it's dark and
sometimes, it's bright.

620
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,150
And from the street light,

621
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,270
you've become a star in the sky.

622
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,710
Your pain and darkness

623
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,390
in the past

624
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,630
will be a contrast to how

625
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,350
brightly you shine now.

626
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,510
You are lying.

627
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,430
If I'm so good,

628
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,750
why do you like Pei Jia Shu then?

629
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,310
The way I like him is different.

630
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,270
How is it different?

631
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,590
Let me think about it.

632
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,030
Okay.

633
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,350
Think about it then.

634
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,540
Jiang Yi.

635
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,830
Why am I so dizzy?

636
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,750
Yu Sheng Sheng.

637
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,070
We've switched back.

638
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,390
Okay.

639
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,510
Stop pestering me.

640
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,230
I'm still thinking about

641
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,710
how are you different

642
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,990
from Jia Shu.

643
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,950
Stop swaying.

644
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,190
Stop.

645
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,670
Did I drink that much?

646
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,750
Why are you so drunk?

647
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,790
Come.

648
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,110
I want to hear

649
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,270
your thoughts.

650
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,590
My liking for an artist like Jia Shu

651
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,070
is like loving the stars in the sky.

652
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,900
He's so far away from me.

653
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,150
He's shining his light on me.

654
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,870
And I'll look at him twinkling

655
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,430
from afar.

656
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,870
And that'll be enough.

657
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,750
But what I feel for you is different.

658
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,150
Although

659
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,950
you are one of the stars in the sky,

660
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,310
I can't just

661
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,070
look at you from afar.

662
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,670
I want to

663
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,230
walk towards you.

664
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,470
I want to

665
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,990
touch you.

666
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,430
I want to

667
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,100
hug you.

668
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:37,830
I'm selfish when it comes to you.

669
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,990
You are

670
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,230
a good man.

671
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,510
You should be loved by many.

672
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,510
But I just want you

673
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,630
to look at me alone.

674
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,710
Jiang Yi.

675
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,990
I like you.

676
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,270
Forget it.

677
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,710
I don't want us to switch again.

678
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,350
You don't like me anyway.

679
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,230
And we won't meet each other again.

680
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,070
I just want to tell you that

681
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,830
I like you.

682
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,750
Bye.

683
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,470
You want to run after you flirt with me?

684
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,070
No.

685
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,390
It's already embarrassing enough that

686
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,470
I failed my first confession.

687
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,310
Can't you let me hide from it?

688
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,430
You didn't fail.

689
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,940
You can come towards me.

690
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,110
You can touch me.

691
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,990
You can be selfish when it comes to me.

692
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:31,910
Why

693
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,750
did you repeat my words?

694
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,950
You told me that

695
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,430
I always smile

696
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,150
when I'm Yu Sheng Sheng.

697
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,190
And that I'm happier.

698
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,030
After thinking about it,

699
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,870
I realised that I'm happy

700
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,910
not because I'm hiding inside your body.

701
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,590
Why is it then?

702
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,190
It's because I'm happy

703
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,750
when I'm with you.

704
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,910
You are watching my idol drama?

705
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,030
I don't like to watch it.

706
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,750
But you've watched 20 episodes of it.

707
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,390
You better finish it.

708
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,710
It might be useful

709
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,100
when you have

710
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,190
a girlfriend in the future.

711
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,110
My phone is ringing.

712
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,950
Who is calling me?

713
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,600

I knew that you are together.

718
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,830
Why did you turn off your phone again?

719
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,140
My phone is out of battery.

720
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,070
When will you come back?

721
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,750
Your parents are waiting for you.

I don't want to see them today.

723

Ask them to go home.
