[Episode 1]

28
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,830
I've made you suffer with me

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,790
all this while.

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,710
I didn't protect you well.

31
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,190
As your boyfriend,

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,430
I couldn't do anything for you.

33
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,470
No need to blame yourself.

34

I know that

35

you've tried your best.

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,670
In the past, I always said that

37
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,590
everything will be fine in the future

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,830
and everything can be solved.

39
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,870
But I'm all talk

40

no action.

41
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,310
There's no need to

42
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,310
shoulder all the blame.

43
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,590
I'm at fault too.

44
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,110
I'm too confident.

45
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,910
I thought that I can overcome

46

all obstacles.

47
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,550
But when I have to face them,

48
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,150
I realised that it's not that easy.

49
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,790
Are we too confident?

50
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,750
We...

51
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,110
We better break up.

52

310
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,350
I've already washed them.

311
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,350
Have you washed your hands?

312
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,830
Yes, I have.

313
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,990

But he still prepared a gift for you.

316
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,260
He even came here to
celebrate it with you.

317
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,230
But you haven't even

318
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,020

You are welcome.

321
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,030
I happen to be free today.

322
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,390
So, I came here to visit Mrs. Cai.

323
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,670
What a sweet talker.

324
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,590
Did you drive here?

325
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,110
I came here by taxi.

326
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,790
Looks like you are not here unprepared.

327
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,340
Let me pour you some of

328
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,390
my dad's precious medicinal wine.

329
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,190
Wait.

330
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,630
This is for

Tong Hua.

337

When you go back later,

338
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,390
don't forget to bring some kimchi back.

339
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,350
I've already prepared it.

340
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,230
Thank you, uncle.

341
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,270
Do you know that

342
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,630
after living together with Sheng Sheng,

343
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,710
I've gotten

344
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,630
one size bigger.

345
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,670
Youngsters always like to say this, right?

346
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,590
How can you diet if you are hungry?

347
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,590
There's no need to diet.

348
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,750
I think chubby is good.

349
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,030
Yes.

350
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,350
Let the patrols take a leave for today

351
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,950
so that the fats can
escape from their prison.

352
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,110
Let's eat.

353
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,750
Let's eat.

354
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,510
Let me serve the soup for all of you.

355
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,190
This looks so appetising.

356
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,540
Uncle.

357
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,470
Serve the birthday girl first for today.

358
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,700
I'm the king today.

359
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,590
Be careful. It's hot.

360
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,670
You've put cartialgenous, gastrodia and

361
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,230
cordyceps into

362
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,350
this American ginseng chicken soup.

363
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,590
Dad, are you trying to

364
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,510
put all nourishing ingredients

365
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,270
inside this soup?

366
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,550
Hey.

367
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,750
Others can't even pay

368
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,100
to eat these

369
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,420
in your dad's restaurant.

370
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,910
You don't know your blessings.

371
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,030
I'm stupid.

372
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,470
So, my brain needs the nutrition.

373
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,950
Nonsense.

374
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,710
If you are stupid,

375
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,270
you wouldn't be able to

376
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,430
handle Jiang Yi

377
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,270
in his birthday party.

378
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,030
Come.

379
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,990
Here's a drumstick for you.

380
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,790
No.

381
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,630
You should have this drumstick instead.

382
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,390
You are the biggest contributor

383
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,510
who saved our public account.

384
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,710
If it wasn't because you like Jiang Yi,

385
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,870
we wouldn't be able to find out that

386
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,710
there'll be this session

387
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,830
in Jiang Yi's birthday party

388
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,710
with the help of your friend.

389
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,910
I just have a slightly

390
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,230
wider range of connection.

391
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,550
If it wasn't because you have

392
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,350
the same birthdate as Jiang Yi,

393
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,230
we wouldn't be able to

394
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,230
carry out this plan.

395
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,900
Luckily, you have good acting skills.

396
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,990
I know you like Pei Jia Shu.

397
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,750
But you managed to

398
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,190
trick Jiang Yi with your Oscar-winning

399
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,180
acting skills.

400
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,350
You are too kind.

401
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,230
Although

402
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,550
I managed to trick Jiang Yi

403
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,190
so that I can do

404
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,390
an exclusive interview with him

405
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,350
when we eat,

406
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,070
you are the one who
came up with this idea.

407
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,030
So, you are still

408
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,150
the biggest contributor.

409
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,790
You are smart and crafty.

410
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,470
Your courage is worth the compliment.

411
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,510
You are better.

412
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,270
You are better.

413
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,430
Enough, both of you.

414
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,510
It's like you are

415
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,310
doing a crosstalk now.

416
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,910
Eat now. The food is getting cold.

417
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,470
Let's eat.

418
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,060
Wait.

419
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,190
Let's cheer

420
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,390
for our birthday girl.

421
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,870
Happy birthday.

422
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,110
Okay.

423
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,390
Happy birthday.

424
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,870
Come.

425
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,750
Happy birthday.

426
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,670
Thank you, everyone.

427
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,070
Yi.

428
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,660
It's not yet 12.

429
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,630
How about

430
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,790
we celebrate your birthday for you?

431
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,620
It's okay. I'm tired.

432
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,590
Brother Yi, I understand.

433
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,350
Our birthday is usually

434
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,350
very exhausting.

435
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,910
As long as the fans are happy.

436
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,270
You are right.

437
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,270
You are so sensible.

438
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,630
We arranged for you to attend

439
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,310
this party today

440
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,790
as a way to

441
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,900
repay all of your loyal fans.

442
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,780
I promised Yi that

443
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,270
this will be his last birthday party.

444
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,750
Come to think of it,

445
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,620
it has been really long since
the last time we are on stage together.

446
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,230
After we are disbanded,

447
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,790
I think we'll have less chance to do so.

448
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,990
All of us are

449
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,590
having a career transformation now.

450
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,470
This is not that
different from disbandment.

451
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,790
It's good that we are not together often

452
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,350
so that it's easier for us to announce it

453
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,190
when it's the right time.

454
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,550
[Jiang Yi, happy birthday.]

455

[Wonderful Media]

460
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,470
Don't you think that

461
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,310
today's weather is amazing?

462
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,550
The air is filled with

463
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,790
a unique smell.

464
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,740
What unique smell is that?

465
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,030
The smell of victory.

466
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,700
Don't be too proud.
Get ready for meeting now.

467
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,670
Last month, our Listen to Her

468
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,150
has 30 articles.

469
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,310
Every article has more than 100,000 views.

470
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,430
Five articles have more than
300,000 views.

471
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,870
According to our clients' feedback,

472
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,230
our advertorial

473
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,190
has increased their product sales.

474
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,070
They are very satisfied.

475
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,430
Not bad.

476
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,470
Come.

477
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,270
Let's put our hands together for her.

478
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,190
In the past 30 days,

479
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,430
Wonderful Movie-Lovers' Club

480
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,390
has organised

481
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,900
eight offline fans meetings.

482
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,070
And we have

483
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,950
more than 80,000 online fans now.

484
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,390
Your group has improved a lot too.

485
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,430
Keep up the good work.

486
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,030
So many months have passed.

487
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,710
Your Culture and
Entertainment Detective team

488
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,270
has shown no sign of improvement.

489
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,910
Editor-in-Chief.

490
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,230
I think

491
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,030
they won't be able to improve

492
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,430
their account no matter what.

493
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,140
What a waste of Tong Hua's capability.

494
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,990
How about

495
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,430
you transfer Tong Hua to our group?

496
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,540
I think Tong Hua

497
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,670
suits our group more.

498
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,270
Our clients really love

499
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,430
her advertorial.

500
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,230
Editor-in-Chief.

501
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,020
I know that we don't have

502
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,310
a lot of views lately.

503
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,070
But we are doing our best

504
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,230
to solve the issue.

505
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,510
And we've found a solution.

506
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,950
That's right.

507
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,700
We managed to get

508
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,780
an exclusive interview from Jiang Yi.

509
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,030
It'll happen tonight.

510
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,270
Jiang Yi?

511
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,750

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,870
contacted his manager

513
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,430
last month, right?

514
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,260
Yes, I did.

515
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,630
His manager

516
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,780
said that Jiang Yi
will not accept an interview

517
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,830
from a public account yet.

518
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,510
At first,

519
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,470
Jiang Yi was reluctant to accept it.

520
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,230
But Tong Hua and I

521
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,550
had thought it through

522
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,270
and managed to convince them

523
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,660
with our professionalism.

524
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,630
So, they've decided

525
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,510
to give us a chance to interview him.

526
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,110
Good.

527
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,670
Since you can score

528
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,190
an exclusive interview with Jiang Yi,

529
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,630
today,

530
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,510
Listen to Her and
Wonderful Movie-Lovers' Club

531
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,390
should work overtime today

532
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,790
to help them get ready.

533
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,950
Help them promote it

534
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,110
and make it big.

535
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,430
Both of you

536
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,990
have to make good use of this opportunity.

537
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,310
Don't worry, Editor-in-Chief.

538
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,950
I'll complete the mission.

539
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,710
Hello.

540
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,750
Thank you.

541
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,950
This is our menu.

542
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,670
I'm waiting for someone. I'll order later.

543
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,230
Okay.

544
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,340
[Sheng Sheng,
when you see Jiang Yi later,]

545
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,510
[remember to get his signature.]

546
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,710
[Don't forget to take photo of him.]

547
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,510
[I want a clear shot of his front face]

548
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,550
[and his personal signature.]

549
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,270
Don't worry.

550
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,710
I'll get it done.

551
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,590
Brother Yi, I am Fatty.

552
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,750
We have to depart now.

553
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,870
Okay.

554
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,020
Jiang Yi.

555
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,790
I really like

556
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,990
the soft rock style of songs

557
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,510
in your last album.

558
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,150
I heard that

559
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,430
you are working on

560
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,470
the next album.

561
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,190
I really look forward to it.

562
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,990
What style will it be?

563
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,830
I've watched your role
as the general before this.

564
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,830
You had portrayed your role very well.

565
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,380
Even the director said that
you are very talented.

566
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,110
Is there

567
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,350
any character that

568
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,070
you really want to challenge next?

569
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,430
Sometimes,

570
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,180
I'll see some negative comments

571
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,940
about you online.

572
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,350
Will you feel sad

573
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,590
when you read those comments?

574
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,150
Or will you avoid them?

575
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,830
How do you

576
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,470
release your stress?

577
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,670
Good.

578
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,100
I'll have enough materials for an article.

579
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,750
Now, I just have to
wait for him to show up.

580
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,350
Why isn't he here yet?

581
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,510
My waist.

582
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,790
This is their team's project.

583
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,990
Why should we work overtime for them?

584
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,270
That's right.

585
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,230
We even have to leave a slot open

586
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,310
for their article.

587
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,490
Editor-in-Chief is really biased.

588
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,750
We have no choice.

589
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:53,910
After all, they are going to

590
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,910
interview Jiang Yi.

591
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,830
All of you have worked hard.

592
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,430
Here's some coffee for you.

593
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,870
Our life saviour.

594
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,710
Thank you.

595
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,230
Thank you.

596
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,500
Thank you.

597
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,110
Sister Zhi Xiao.

598
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,910
Your coffee.

599
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,750
You've worked hard.

600
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,950
Thank you.

601
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,220
He's still not here yet.

602
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,270
I've been waiting for him
for almost two hours.

603
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,390
Is it because there's a traffic jam?

604
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,590
[No.]

605
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,030
I just checked the traffic situation.

606
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,470
There's no traffic jam.

607
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,270
[He's an artist.]

608
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,310
[Maybe because he's]

609
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,270
[delayed by a shooting.]

610
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,070
[That's normal.]

611
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,270
I hate men who are not punctual.

612
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,670
If it was Jia Shu,

613
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,790
he wouldn't be like this.

614
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,310
Don't be so confident.

615
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,220
My friend told me that

616
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,390
when Pei Jia Shu was in school,

617
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,510
he was always late.

618
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,430
[Besides, he has bad common sense.]

619
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,940
Stop.

620
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,710
You are polluting

621
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,910
my ears.

622
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,590
I can understand that you are his fan.

623
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,990
But no matter what,

624
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,590
I'll not give up on Jia Shu

625
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,860
for Jiang Yi.

626
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,180
Moreover,

627
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,190
even if Jia Shu is late,

628
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,110
[it must be because he's busy.]

629
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,910
Double standard.

630
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,110
How's everyone at the company?

631
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,550
[Don't worry, I'm here.]

632
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,310
Good.

633
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,030
I have to hang up now.

634
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,110
Let me call

635
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,830
his manager again.

636
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,830
[Okay. Bye.]

637
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,540
Bye.

638
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,630
Yes.

639
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,270
Pei Jia Shu is going to
endorse a new brand.

640
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,590
Release this information

641
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,180
to push Jiang Yi down the hot search list.

642
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,990
It's totally not true that

643
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,190
he was being cold in his birthday party.

644
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,110
These are just rumours

645
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,830
from marketing accounts.

646
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,340
Our Fan Club

647
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,110
is doing damage control now.

648
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,950
I'll send the article to you

649
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,390
in half an hour's time.

650
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,030
This is slander.

651
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,830
We are preparing

652
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,430
our attorney's letter now.

653
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,390
Okay.

654
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,590
Yes.

655
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,590
You can use this chance

656
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,070
to stress more on

657
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,140
Jiang Yi's cold and distant persona.

658
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,870
You can put the title as this.

659
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,270
Jiang Yi stayed at
a polite distance from his fan.

660
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,870
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

661
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:00,860
Hello?

662
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,590
My phone is out of battery again.

663
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:16,910
[Hello.]

664
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,590
[I'm the lucky fan from]

665
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,590
[Jiang Yi's birthday party,
Yu Sheng Sheng.]

666
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,660
[When will]

667
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,830
[Jiang Yi be here?]

668
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,710
[I've been waiting for him
for three hours.]

669
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,190
[And you didn't pick up my call.]

670
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,390
[Is Jiang Yi going to come here or not?]

671
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,270
[The restaurant is closing soon.]

672
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,550
[I'll go back now.]

673
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,470
[Hello.]

674
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,190
[The phone of the number that
you've dialled has been turned off.]

675
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,030
[Lately, our astronomical observatory]

676
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,510
[has released the latest news]

677
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,670
[about a planet named B56743]

678
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:18,250
[A small planet is approaching earth.]

679
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,430
[with the size of pyramid]

680
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,030
[approaching the earth's orbit.]

681
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,630
[According to their observation]

682
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,550
[on its distance from our orbit,]

683
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,830
[it'll come close to the earth's orbit]

684
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,190
[within a month and a half.]

685
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,270
Where's Yi?

686
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,470
Meditating.

687
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,910
[Next,]

688
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,830
[let's proceed to sports.]

689
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,510
[Within one hour, Simpberg...]

690
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,430
Take off your shoes.

691
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,430
Your socks.

692
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,310
Can you tell me why you didn't

693
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,030
attend the dinner tonight?

694
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,700
And you wouldn't let
Fatty tell me about it.

695
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,510
Your fan

696
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,630
called me so many times.

697
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,950
I've been taking care of

698
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,630
your birthday party's issue

699
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,310
the whole night.

700
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,630
And now,

701
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,420
you are creating another issue for me.

702
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,310
You...

703
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,940
Six hundred thousand.

704
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,230
These are around RMB600,000
after seven years?

705
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,310
No, Yi.

706
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,270
Can you don't create
so much trouble for me?

707
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,180
You are going to

708
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,790
launch your first

709
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,870
personal album soon.

710
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,350
And you want to

711
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,470
tread into the filming world.

712
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,190
If others

713
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,020
find out that

714
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,790
you stood up on your fan,

715
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,990
you'll gain yourself

716
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,630
more haters.

717
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,540
Don't touch me.

718
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,460
I can't be your manager anymore.

719
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,230
Listen.

720
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,910
Since the first year in
high school until now,

721
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,030
you've been torturing me.

722
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,270
It's just because

723
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,510
the girl you fancied in high school
liked me instead.

724
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,870
Do you have to do this?

725
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,710
Why can't you let it go?

726
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,830
Why are you still holding a grudge?

727
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,590
Forget it.

728
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,390
I don't want to talk anymore.

729
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,670
If you are really not satisfied with me,

730
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,900
find a new manager then.

731
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,670
Our decades of friendship

732
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,750
is going to end.

733
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,630
She's not my fan.

734
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,870
What?

735
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,390
Hurry up.

736
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:10,870
We have ten more minutes

737
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,470
until the next session.

738
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,540
Hurry up.

739
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,910
Yi.

740
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,710
Your dad

741
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,590
called you a few times just now.

742
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,630
Do you want to call him back?

743
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,390
Here.

744
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,390
I'll take the call outside then.

745
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,350
Okay.

746
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,190
Be quick.

747
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,750
[Son, happy birthday.]

748
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,260
What is it?

749
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,510
I'm not the one looking for you.
It's Mo Mo.

750
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,750
Mo Mo, come here.

751
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,270
You have something

752
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,310
to tell him, right?

753
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,670
[Happy birthday.]

754
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,510
[Mo Mo, ask him whether or not]

755
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,830
[he has a birthday cake.]

756
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,110
[Yi.]

757
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,470
[Are you very busy]

758
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,230
[recently?]

759
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,630
[No matter how busy you are,
remember to eat on time.]

760
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,510
[Don't tire yourself out.]

761
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,270
[Mo Mo.]

762
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,510
[Mo Mo]

763
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,500
[really admires you recently.]

764
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,430
[She has been insisting that]

765
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,470
[she wants to learn piano like you.]

766
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,780
[That's not true.]

767
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,310
[Look at her.]

768
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,550
[She's shy.]

769
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:35,990
[You know this too.]

770
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,190
[Her mother and I]

771
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,630
[can't go out to work.]

772
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,790
[She's still too young.]

773
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:41,990
How much is it?

774
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,510
From what I've found out,

775
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,710
it's around 30,000 to 40,000.

776
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,790
It's okay.

777
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,630
Don't bother.

778
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,510
We'll take care of this ourselves.

779
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,750
I'll transfer the money to you later.

780
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,870
Jiang Yi.

781
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,350
Come and eat with us when you are free.

782
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,510
[I'll cook some good food for you.]

783
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,110
I have to hang up. I have work to do.

784
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,830
[Okay.]

785
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,750
Hello, Tong Hua.

786
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,310
We did it!

787
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,190
Everything is going smoothly.

788
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,710
Of course.

789
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:19,750
Don't you know

790
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,230
how long I had practised
in front of the mirror?

791
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,750
Anyway,

792
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,750
if I can let Jiang Yi believe that

793
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,990
I am his fan,

794
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,030
we'll be able to save our public account!

795
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,710
Okay. I'll go home now.

796
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,830
I want to eat cake.

797
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,150
I was fooled by a reporter?

798
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,590
Continue with your foot bath.
I'll take care of this.

799
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,870
Miss Yu.

800
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,830
I am Jiang Yi's manager.

801
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,580
Jiang Da Chuan.

802
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:00,950
[It's like this.]

803
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,310
[Yi has]

804
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,470
[fallen ill.]

805
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,430
[I don't think he can
attend today's date.]

806
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,110
[I'm sorry that]

807
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,030
[you had to wait for so long.]

808
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,110
Jiang Yi has fallen ill?

809
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,550
He's sweating

810
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,580
and his stomach is unwell.

811
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,750
I think he's too tired.

812
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,110
I feel so bad for him.

813
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,270
How about I visit him instead?

814
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,750
It's okay.

815
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,790
He has already taken his medicine.

816
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,340
He's much better now.

817
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,470
Then, can I

818
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,540
still eat with him?

819
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,940
We've already planned out

820
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,150
his future schedule.

821
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,190
He has a tight schedule.

822
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,270
He's still sick

823
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,710
and you want him to work?

824
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,190
You are such a bully.

825
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,300
We did advise him to take a rest.

826
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,590
But he wouldn't listen to us.

827
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,630
Jiang Yi

828
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,070
takes his job too seriously.

829
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,390
How about this.

830
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,910
We'll send you some of his

831
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,390
signed photos as compensation.

832
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,070
[Okay?]

833
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,390
It's okay.

834
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,030
I have many of his signed photos.

835
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,030
Bye.

836
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,870
You want to fight with me, little girl?

837
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,470
My feast has turned into fast food.

838
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,740
Life is so unpredictable.

839
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,060
Jiang Yi will not accept an interview

840
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,350
from a public account yet.

841
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,030
At first, Jiang Yi was

842
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,660
reluctant to accept it.

843
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,150
But Tong Hua and I

844
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,740
had thought it through

845
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,470
and managed to convince them

846
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,310
with our professionalism.

847
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,950
So, they've decided

848
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,510
to give us a chance to interview him.

849
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,230
Don't worry, Editor-in-Chief.

850
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,510
I'll complete the mission.

851
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,990
What happened in the end?

852
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,190
What happened in the end?

853
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,460
Of course

854
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,510
she has been tricked.

855
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,270
Sister Sheng Sheng, Sister Tong Hua.

856
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,550
Go back to your work.

857
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,950
You've managed this account
for three years.

858
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,070
At first, it was doing well.

859
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,830
But many times,

860
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,750
you can't stop it from turning sour.

861
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,990
Don't force yourself too much.

862
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,590
Lately, I've heard a lot

863
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,910
of this kind of thing.

864
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,710
Some frauds

865
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,270
pretend to be a manager or
from a managing company

866
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,270
to trick others for money.

867
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,470
Editor-in-Chief.

868
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,620
We were not tricked.

869
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,230
I have the call log.

870
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,910
Let me show you.

871
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,070
That's not important.

872
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:41,950
How about

873
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,390
you make a new account?

874
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,310
We've been working on

875
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,430
Culture and Entertainment Detective
for so long.

876
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,510
We are sentimental towards it.

877
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,550
We can't just give up.

878
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,950
As long as there's a ray of hope,

879
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,630
we'll do our best

880
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,430
to bring it back to life.

881
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,350
Editor-in-Chief.

882
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,950
Give us three more months.

883
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,350
If we still can't revive it,

884
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,430
we'll give up.

885
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,870
Three months. Just three months.

886
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,460
Thank you, Editor-in-Chief.

887
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,390
Thank you, Editor-in-Chief.

888
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,220
Editor-in-Chief, I love you.

889
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,110
Enough. Go and do your work.

890
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,860
Okay.

891
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,030
I'll make sure to complete
the mission, Editor-in-Chief.

892
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,310
Thank you.

893
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,510
How can we

894
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,340
adjust our account?

895
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,350
The readers nowadays

896
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,910
have been brainwashed by

897
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,310
those gossip accounts that

898
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,350
curry favour by claptrap.

899
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,870
We have to believe in our own judgement.

900
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,510
Are we too confident?

901
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,750
When you set your mind

902
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,070
to do something,

903
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,350
the whole world will help you.

904
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,310
Did you read some

905
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,590
inspiring books yesterday?

906
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,910
I didn't block him?

907
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,710
[Miss Yu.]

908
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,590
[You are the one who]

909
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,110
[tampered with
the hot search on Weibo, right?]

910
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,990
What hot search?

911
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,510
[Let's not talk in circle.]

912
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,220
[I know that]

913
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,350
[you are a reporter from
a public account.]

914
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,630
[I know you are the one who]

915
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,740
[tampered with the signing event.]

916
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,750
I'll call you back later.

917
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,110
That's me.

918
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,470
I'm in the hot search now.

919
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,430
[Jiang Yi]

920
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,590
[has always been heartless.]

921
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,510
[But his managing company]

922
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,070
[tries to give him
the upright public persona.]

923
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,910
[Now, we know the truth.]

924
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,590
[Are you happy for torturing a fan?]

925
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,910
[Come on and make more excuses for him.]

926
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,430
[Smirk.]

927
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,150
[Those who've never liked Jiang Yi,]

928
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,990
[raise your hand.]

929
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,150
[Jiang Yi's Manager]

930
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,630
I've checked the hot search.

931
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,430
But this marketing account

932
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,390
is not my company's account.

933
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,590
Although I'm a reporter,

934
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,950
is there a rule saying that

935
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,190
I can't be his fan just because
I'm a reporter?

936
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,870
Are you saying that

937
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,550
you are not interested in Jiang Yi's

938
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,430
exclusive interview?

939
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,710
What do you mean?

940
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,950
[What I mean is,]

941
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,710
[we want to announce to the public that]

942
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,550
[Jiang Yi has fallen sick last night]

943
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,100
[and has rescheduled with his fan.]

944
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,590
I hope that you can stay silent.

945
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,550
To repay you,

946
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,430
I'll arrange an exclusive interview

947
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,110
with Jiang Yi for you.

948
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,270
Is Jiang Yi beside you right now?

949
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,270
What?

950
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,670
He has already stood me up

951
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,430
once.

952
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,820
I don't trust you.

953
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,270
[Jiang Yi is not someone]

954
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,630
[who takes well to order, right?]

955
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,350
[I just want to make sure that]

956
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,030
[he agrees to]

957
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,870
[your proposal.]

958
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,550
Fine. I'll let him talk to you.

959
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,270
Help me.

960
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,990
Our decades of friendship. Help me.

961
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,230
Come on. Show me some respect.

962
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,670
I'll be there on time.

963
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,030
Okay. It's a deal then.

964
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,470
I'll tell you after I've set the time.

965
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,950
Our decades of friendship

966
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,020
is going to end soon.

967
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,670
Don't.

968
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,950
We've just barely begun.

969
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,270
There's still a long way ahead of us.

970
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,030
Life is long

971
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,590
and you'll have me to tag along.

972
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,750
Let's work hard together

973
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,790
until the end of the day.

974
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,750
Tong Hua.

975
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,230
I feel that the whole world

976
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,870
is helping us.

977
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,470
They really know how to

978
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,750
get information.

979
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,710
They even went to the hotel to

980
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,110
wait for Jiang Yi's dinner with his fan.

981
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,470
Is there a problem?

982
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,110
Jiang Yi's voice sounds so nice.

983
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,990
Continue to savour it then.

984
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,110
I have to go back to work.

1020
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,450
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

1021
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,010
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

1022
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,090
♫ Oh loving you, loving you ♫

1023
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,200
♫ My soul ♫

1024
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,170
♫ Through my ups and downs ♫

1025
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,560
♫ Gradually I mature ♫

1026
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,050
♫ With you by my side ♫
