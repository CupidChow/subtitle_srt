Hi, Jiang Yi.

29
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,070
I'm Yu Sheng Sheng.

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,900
I'd like to introduce you

31
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,950
to this official account,

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,870
Culture and Entertainment Detective.

33
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,230
Our articles are analysed...

34
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,230
I'm not interested in that.

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,390
Okay.

36
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,870
Let's get to business.

37
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,750
What will you

38
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,670
produce next?

39
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,030
A solo album.

40
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,550
Will it also be in

41
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,790
the Little Galaxy style

42
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,510
or something brand new?

43
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,460
Not yet confirmed.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,390
You seldom post about yourself

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,470
on social media.

46
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,070
What do you do

47
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,180
when you're not working?

48
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,140
Sleeping at home.

49
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,390
The family variety show,

"Please, Dad" invitation

51
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,430
was rejected by you for many times.

52
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,550
But will you

53
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,230
consider joining this season?

54
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:58,950
No.

55
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,590
I know

56
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,990
that your parents have
been divorced for years.

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,790
Is this what you're worried about?

58
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,150
Could you please

59
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,230
give some cooperation?

60
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,390
It doesn't matter what I say, isn't it?

61
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,750
You're writing your own story anyway.

62
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,550
[Fine.]

63
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,230

65
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,550
You like Xu Shu Yi, don't you?

66
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,500
No.

67
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,910
On the birthday party,

68
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,630
I calculated.

69
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,430
You looked at her

70
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,390
for at least 20 times,

71
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,470
and sneaked a peak at her for three times.

72
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,590
Every time

73
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,740
she looked at you,

74
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,510
you shifted

75
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,870
your gaze right away.

76
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,790
One may tell lies,

77
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,460
but gaze won't lie.

78
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,660
Nonsense.

79
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,980
The intimate distance between people

80
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,590
is 15 to 45 cm.

81
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,070
When a stranger

82
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,620
enters this range,

83
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,870
one will get hostile

84
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,230
and feel infringed.

85
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,550
During your interaction with your fans,

86
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,590
you kept

87
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,630
your distance.

88
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,750
But when you

89
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,710
stood beside Xu Shu Yi,

90
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,870
you were so much
closer than safe distance.

91
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,350
She was the host.

92
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,590
And we're friends.

93
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,190
Actually,

94
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,590
those were just assumptions.

95
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,790
But judging from your respond today,

96
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,070
I believe

97
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,590
they are the truth.

98
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,390
I'm warning you.

99
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,180
Beware of what you write.

100
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,350
You told me to write my own story.

101
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,870
Why you changed your mind?

102
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,590
Don't worry.

103
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,830
Without strong evidence,

104
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,910
I won't

105
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,270
write an article based on my assumption.

106
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,830
Similarly,

107
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,750
I hope that before

108
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,030
you read my article,

109
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,540
don't simply assume

110
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,830
that I will make things up.

111
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,100
So, to avoid me from making things up,

112
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,630
please cooperate.

113
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,230
Okay?

114
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,710
Ask any question.

115
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,510
Hello, I'm done here.

116
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,470
Wait for me.

117
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,910
Okay.

118
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,350
It's raining heavily.

119
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,350
Can I get a taxi?

120
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,950
Thank you very...

121
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,190
Hey, wait up.

122
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,110
How ungentlemanly.

123
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,230
Luckily the one I like is Jia Shu.

124
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,340
Thank you.

125
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,670
[Hi, security room.]

126
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,140
Hi, the elevator malfunctioned.

127
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,020
Please repair it.

128
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,990
[Okay. Right away.]

129
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,790

Sorry.

131
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,270
I was trapped in the lift once.

132
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,710
It was traumatic.

133
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,510
When there's an emergency in the lift,

134
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,270
the right thing to do

135
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,510
is lean against the lift

136
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,910
and slightly bend your legs.

137
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,510
Take a deep breath.

138
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,750
Well...

139
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,740
Regarding the party,

140
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,350
it was a lie.

141
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,070
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,630
But my best friend

143
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,350
is truly your die-hard fan.

144
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,910
Let's bury the hatchet.

145
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,070
I'll write a great article.

146
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,860
If it's fine for you,

147
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,430
please tell Jia Shu

148
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,630
that I've adored him for seven years.

149
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,180
I don't think we'll see each other again.

150

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,950
so quiet?

177
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,390
Bo Qing, check on her.

178
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,870
What happened?

179
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,980
Don't worry, Mr and Mrs Yu.

180
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,670
Maybe she's just in shock.

181
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,550
Give her some time.

182
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,750
Are you feeling alright?

183
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,910
Who are you?

184
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,710
Where's my manager?

185
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,630
Manager?

186
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,430
Who are you guys?

187
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,630
Doctor, could you

188
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,910
check on him?

189
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,430
Okay, I'll try.

190
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,270
Actually,

191
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,150
waking up

192
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,950
being emotional

193
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,140
after getting into a shock

194
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,150
is really normal.

195
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,910
Isn't there a female doctor?

196
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,310
What's this?

197
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,510
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,510
Didn't you say

199
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,950
that he is in shock

200
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,950
and being emotional?

201
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,190
Sheng Sheng.

202
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,230
Don't scare us.

203
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,030
Could she have lost her memories?

204
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,950
Sheng Sheng.

205
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,710
Where are you going?

206
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,550
Sheng Sheng.

207
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,030
I think I'll leave you

208
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,590
to write you a discharge summary.

209
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,310
Okay. Thanks.

210
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,030
My apologies.

211
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,110
I'm really sorry.

212
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,030
My chest is so hard.

213
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,030
Do you have a mirror?

214
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,550
It's okay. Just a knock.

215
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,300
You'll recover very soon.

216
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,380
Go and get changed.

217
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,190
We need to go back to the villa.

218
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,030
There are too many reporters.

219
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,830
-Jiang Yi.
-Yu Sheng Sheng.

220
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,350
Sheng Sheng.

221
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:50,900
Doctor.

222
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,950
Where's the woman...

223
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,630
Jiang Yi. How is he?

224
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,550
He's fine.

225
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,510
Where is he?

226
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,830
The VIP room upstairs.

227
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,470
Sheng Sheng.

228
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,750
Where are you going?

229
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,150
Sheng Sheng.

230
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,190
You're still in this clothes?

231
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,510
Never mind. It's too late.

232
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,030
We can't stop the reporters now.

233
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,270
Actually, I'm not...

234
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,190
Not what?

235
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,630
I'm not...

236
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,470
What?

237
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,350
Let's go.

238
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,630
I'm not.

239
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,590
Jiang Yi.

240
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,110
Excuse me.

241
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,110
No photos.

242
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,030
Jiang Yi.

243
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,750
Please cooperate.

244
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,460
Please cooperate.

245
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,510
Jiang Yi.

246
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,710
Please answer our questions.

247
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,100
Jiang Yi.

248
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,470
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,190
Please cooperate.

250
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,630
Please answer.

251
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,550
Excuse me. Thanks.

252
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,470
Jiang Yi.

253
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,430
Hurry.

254
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,270
Jiang Yi.

255
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,950
There he is.

256
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,230
Hurry.

257
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,310
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,590
Catch up with him. Hurry.

259
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,670
Jiang Yi is coming out.

260
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,300
Jiang Yi.

261
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,270
Excuse me.

262
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,310
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

263
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,150
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,260
Excuse me.

265
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,630
Excuse me.

266
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,270
Excuse me.

267
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,390
We love you, Jiang Yi.

268
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,870
It's said that you fooled your fans

269
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,150
because you're sick, is that true?

270
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,790
Will your schedule

271
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,070
be affected now that you're injured?

272
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,870
It's said

273
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,910
that you fought with

274
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,510
Pei Jia Shu off stage at the party.

275
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,110
Is that true?

276
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,910
Please answer.

277
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,500
Please give us

278
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,380
a reply, would you?

279
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:29,870
Please...

280
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,830
Thank you.

281
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,190
[I'm shocked]

282
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,270
Thank you.

283
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,310
Thank you.

284
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,230
Thank you all.

285
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,710
Thank you.

286
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,310
You...

287
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,430
I...

288
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:43,990
Stop it. Hurry.

289
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,430
No, it's a mistake.

290
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,990
She is...

291
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,540
We love you a lot.

292
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,830
You're our angel.

293
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,910
We love you too.

294
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,910
[My body.]

295
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,910
[Oh, my body.]

296
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,110
Sheng Sheng.

297
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,830
Where are you going, Sheng Sheng?

298
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,710
Sheng Sheng, you're still working

299
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,990
in this condition?

300
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,710
Let's get back.

301
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,510
Come on.

302
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,750
What's wrong? Come on.

303
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:44,870
I...

304
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,110
I left something at the hospital.

305
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,710
I'm going back to get it.

306
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,270
Wait.

307
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,630
Hold on.

308
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:54,830
Is something

309
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,540
really wrong with you?

310
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,910
If you go back now,

311
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,230
the reporters will eat you alive.

312
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,750
I need to get something.

313
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,950
I'll be back soon.

314
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,870
Let's have Fatty

315
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,430
get it for you.

316
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,790
Don't touch me.

317
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,790
Fine. Let's go.

318
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,870
Let's go home.

319
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:05,870
No.

320
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,100
Be a good boy.

321
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,270
Knock it off.

322
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:08,860
Good boy.

323
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,070
Lunch is ready,

324
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,430
dear.

325
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,710
Yi.

326
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,190
You finally understand

327
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,070
my difficulties.

328
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,310
If you have stayed

329
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,190
on good terms with the reporters,

330
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,870
we could've

331
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,670
saved a lot of money.

332
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,510
Does it still hurt?

333
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,670
No.

334
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,670
Great.

335
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,990
Makeup should be able to cover it.

336
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,030
Let me know

337
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,670
if you feel funny.

338
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:20,870
Okay.

339
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,430
You have a photoshoot for a
magazine this afternoon.

340
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,340
I'll pick you up later.

341
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:24,990
Okay.

342
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,630
A photoshoot?

343
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,470
Yeah.

344
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,670
Did you forget

345
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,110
the appointment?

346
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,110
I think

347
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,790
I should drop it off.

348
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,150
[I can't do photoshoot.]

349
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,710
[I can only take artistic photos.]

350
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,790
Jiang Yi.

351
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,710
Are you trying to make me resign again?

352
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,510
Are you resigning?

353
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,070
Why?

354
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,310
Don't you know

355
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,030
the reason?

356
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,990
Why would I know?

357
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,550
Fine, forget it.

358
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,710
Eat first.

359
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,950
[As if I]

360
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,830
[have the appetite now.]

361
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,030
I'm not hungry.

362
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,190
You just got discharged.

363
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,780
You need supplement, dear.

364
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,790
I'll eat when I'm hungry.

365
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,430
Fine.

366
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,590
Get some rest upstairs.

367
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,590
What is it?

368
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,950
Nothing.

369
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,510
Looking for Jia Shu?

370
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,330
Is Jia Shu in?

371
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,270
He's at an event.

372
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,030
He won't be home until tomorrow.

373
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,070
Okay.

374
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,990
Le Yi isn't here too.

375
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,110
Do you have business with them?

376
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,470
Le Yi.

377
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,900
Just wanting to say hi.

378
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,390
I already told them you're fine.

379
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,990
Anything else?

380
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,230
My earphone is in your room.

381
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,070
I need to get it.

382
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,470
So you left your earphone in my room.

383
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,350
Go and get it.

384
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,830
Yi.

385
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,590
You...

386
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,350
Make yourself at home.

387
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,790
Are you really okay?

388
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,390
Yes.

389
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,630
Do you feel dizzy?

390
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,550
I...

391
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,750
Yes, I guess.

392
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,190
I don't think I can do the photoshoot.

393
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,830
I'll pick you up later.

394
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,350
[How are you, son?]

395
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,430
[Which hospital is it?]

396
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,550
[I called Da Chuan.]

397
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,110
[He told me not to go to the hospital.]

398
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,190
[Da Chuan said you're awake.]

399
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,310
[Call me]

400
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,150
[when you're free.]

401
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,270
[Li Zhen]

402
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,830
[Hello.]

403
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,110
Hi.

404
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,190
[Xiao Yi.]

405
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,430
[You were]

406
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,870
[trapped in the lift?]

407
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,830
I'm fine.

408
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,630
[I'm glad then.]

409
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,510
[Get back to work then.]

410
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,910
[I'm busy too.]

411
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:41,950
Mum?

412
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,340
Like mother like son.

413
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,390
She's so cold.

414
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,230
Exactly like Jiang Yi.

415
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,790
Now who's this?

416
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,750
Hello, is that you?

417
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,110
Yes, me.

418
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,590
It's me.

419
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,910
What happened exactly?

420
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,990
I'm at your room

421
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,790
despite wanting to see you.

422
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,390
I can't get out.

423
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,470
Jiang Da Chuan

424
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,310
and the reporters are out there.

425
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,550
He also said

426
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,270
I have

427
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,830
a photoshoot session this afternoon.

428
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,670
I don't want to go.

429
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,140
But he insisted on picking me up.

430
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,510
Calm down.

431
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,110
Let's meet up

432
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,230
and I'll tell you what to do.

433
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,990
You have a way?

434
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,110
Let's meet up now.

435
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,180
Come and see me.

436
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,500
You're an artist.

437
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,110
I can't just go and see you.

438
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,390
You have to come to me.

439
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,150
How do I do that?

440
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,310
There are reporters,

441
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,990
not to mention Jiang Da Chuan

442
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,270
who is watching me even more closely.

443
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,630
Finish the magazine photoshoot first.

444
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,270
Do the photoshoot?

445
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,350
I can't.

446
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,430
I'm not a celebrity.

447
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,510
[It's easy.]

448
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,310
Just sit still.

449
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,740
Follow

450
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,620
all their instructions.

451
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,630
Huh?

452
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,230
Then...

453
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,700
[Sheng Sheng.]

454
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,110
Are you in there, Sheng Sheng?

455
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,220
Yes.

456
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,190
Your dad has gone home to cook.

457
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,630
I'll go through the discharge procedure.

458
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,740
Pack up.

459
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,110
We're going home.

460
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,430
Okay.

461
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,950
After the photoshoot,

462
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,390
tell this to Jiang Da Chuan.

463
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,550
Sheng Sheng, I just made the chicken soup.

464
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,430
Here you go.

465
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,430
Thanks.

466
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,530
[Chicken soup 87kcal, asparagus and shrimp
71kcal/100g, beef tomato stew 84kcal/100g]

Sheng Sheng.

469
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,630
Stop staring blankly.

470
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,350
Dig in.

471
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,150
Here.

472
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,670
I said to go to a normal school

473
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,190
and become a teacher,

474
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,030
yet you refused,

475
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,100
and chose journalism instead.

476
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,070
Not only is the job

477
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,950
toilsome,

478
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,910
but look at you,

479
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,430
almost meet with a mishap.

480
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,110
Had you listened to me,

481
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,780
this wouldn't have happened.

482
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,230
Can you stop already?

483
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,550
Every job

484
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,870
has its risk.

485
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,710
The check-up showed she's fine.

486
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,950
Stop nagging.

487
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,870
Sheng Sheng.

488
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,430
Ignore your mum.

489
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,750
Eat more. Get replenished.

490
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,180
And you'll recover soon.

491
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,550
Why won't you dig in?

492
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,070
I'm not hungry.

493
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,710
Don't tell me you're on diet again.

494
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,150
Come on.

I...

496

Sheng Sheng was in shock.

497
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,270
It's normal

498
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,630
if she doesn't have appetite.

499
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,630
I...

500
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,790
I'll go.

501
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,590
Tong Tong.

502
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,070
Mr Yu.

503
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,990
Come on in.

504
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,470
Tong Tong, come and eat.

505
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,060
I'll serve the rice.

506
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,030
I've had my lunch.

507
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,150
I'm here to check on Sheng Sheng.

508
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,870
Are you alright?

509
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,870
I'm Tong Hua.

510
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,190
Your best girl friend and partner.

511
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,830
We live together.

512
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,510
Do you remember that?

513
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,790
Tong Hua.

514
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,030
My best girl friend.

515
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,380
Yeah. I'm glad you remember.

516
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,510
I already took a leave

517
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,580
for you from the editor-in-chief.

518
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,550
So, rest well.

519
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,390
Give me the recorder.

520
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,230
I'll write the article.

521
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,510
I don't know where it is.

522
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,270
Maybe it's in your bag.

523
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,830
Where is your bag?

524
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,110
On the couch.

525
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,060
It's not in here.

526
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,310
I don't know.

527
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,590
Never mind.

528
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,350
I'm glad you're fine.

529
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,270
Look for the recorder later

530
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,030
and send the file to me.

531
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,830
I'll take my leave.

532
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,630
Bye, Mr and Mrs Yu.

533
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,550
Carry on.

534
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,230
Be careful.

535
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,950
See yourself out.

536
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,670
Okay, Mrs Yu.

537
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,270
Drive safe.

538
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,990
Go and eat, Mr Yu.

539
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,110
Okay. Bye.

540
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,630
Okay.

541
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,310
Hello.

542
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,070
[Hello.]

543
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,230
[I have something serious]

544
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:22,910
[to tell you.]

545
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,390
Tell me. What is it?

546
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,350
I'm going to undress.

547
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,350
Got it.

548
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,470
But don't you dare take my clothes off.

549
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,190
Idiot.

550
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,270
[Wow, Jiang Yi.]

551
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,470
[You did a good job]

552
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,830
[keeping a good physique.]

553
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,550
[I need to show this to Tong Tong.]

554
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,910
[No.]

555
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,070
[I can't simply]

556
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,990
[share his privacy.]

557
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,270
So, take a rest.

558
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,590
Thanks.

559
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,110
No problem.

560
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,420
Wow, a complete set.

561
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,590
Come in.

562
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:09,910
Brother Yi.

563
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,420
Here's your snack.

564
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,550
We'll be ready in a minute.

565
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:13,990
Thanks.

566
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,630
I finally get to eat this.

567
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,430
It's been too long

568
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,790
since I had Bestore.

569
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,500
Hmm.

570
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,470
Amazing.

571
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,870
Come in.

572
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,910
Brother Yi.

573
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,110
We can start now.

574
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,230
Okay.

575
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,670
This way.

576
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,860
[Just take it as taking
an artistic photo.]

577
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,300
[Nothing to be nervous about.]

578
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:53,750
Brother Yi.

579
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,070
Our theme today

580
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,830
is environmental protection.

581
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,710
Later,

582
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,230
please just

583
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,630
stay natural

584
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,030
and relaxed.

585
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,750
The stool is a tool.

586
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,260
Use it as you see fit.

587
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:02,830
Okay.

588
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,230
Stylist.

589
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,830
Done. Thanks.

590
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,630
Thank you.

591
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,390
Let's get started, Brother Yi.

592
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,140
Okay.

593
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,190
It's like he's taking photo

594
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,430
for his ID card.

595
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,910
One minute please.

596
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,230
Okay.

597
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:23,550
That side too.

598
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:27,990
Brother Yi.

599
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,750
Let's begin.

600
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,540
Sure.

601
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,070
Ready.

602
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,710
Three.

603
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,750
Two.

604
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:34,750
One.

605
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,950
Unbelievable.

606
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,550
Brother Yi is smiling.

607
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,540
Did I see it wrong?

608
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,150
Brother Yi just smiled.

609
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,990
Did Brother Yi just smile?

610
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,670
Yeah.

611
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,150
He did.

612
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,630
How charming.

613
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,380
Yes, this is it.

614
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,670
Okay.

615
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,990
Carry on. Hurry up.

616
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,870
Brother Yi,
you're doing really good today.

617
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,750
Come on.

618
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,030
Not bad.

619
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,790
Nice.

620
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,390
Okay.

621
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,030
One more.

622
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,980
We're done, Brother Yi.

623
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,030
Take a break.

624
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,180
Okay. Thanks.

625
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,110
Yi, come and take five.

626
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,950
I... I need to go to the toilet.

627
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,620
Sure. It's there.

628
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,900
Brother Yi, the men's toilet is here.

629
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,990
My bad.

630
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,270
[Just go.]

631
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,110
[It's better than wetting myself.]

632
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,510
Occupied.

633
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,990
I swear

634
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,950
that before we switch back,

635
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,990
I'm not going to eat

636
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,710
or drink.

637
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:35,950
Live in seclusion then.

638
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,390
What? Did you just speak impolitely to me?

639
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,670
That's not what I mean.

640
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,030
Make yourself clear.

641
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,150
I mean,

642
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,100
we should meet up soon.

643
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,910
Okay. I'll do my best.

644
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,190
I'm hanging up.

645
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,470
[By the way, Jiang Yi.]

646
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,230
[Don't you dare drink water too.]

647
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:56,990
Okay.

648
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,390
But I can eat, can't I?

649
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,870
You must be tired. Take a sip.

650
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,550
No.

651
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,550
I'm not going to drink water anymore.

652
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,590
Here, grab a bite.

653
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,350
I'm not hungry.

654
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,350
Just eat.

655
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,620
Isn't this too bland?

656
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,270
You're on diet.

657
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,030
Eat less at night.

658
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,710
There's chicken breast, isn't it?

659
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,030
Grilled chicken breast

660
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,590
locks protein in.

661
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,350
Yu.

662
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,990
You're making medicinal food again.

663
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,110
I've told you again and again.

664
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,310
Sheng Sheng doesn't like it.

665
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:16,870
Can't you

666
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,980
cook something else?

667
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,860
She's just been discharged.

668
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,990
She needs nourishment.

669
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,910
It only works

670
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,470
if she'd eat it.

671
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:21,910
Look.

672
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,510
How does it taste?

673
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,470
Hmm.

674
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:29,980
Delicious.

675
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,710
Eat more then.

676
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,710
Here's a huge chicken thigh.

677
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,430
I'll get this for you.

678
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,950
Get replenished.

679
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,030
Eat slowly. Don't get choked up.

680
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,230
Take this.

681
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,190
I just asked them.

682
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,070
The photoshoot starts later.

683
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,780
After we're done at night,

684
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,540
let's go and see Yu Sheng Sheng.

685
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,630
That reporter?

686
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,510
Yes.

687
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,070
Yes, is her.

688
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,630
I almost forgot about this.

689
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,950
Things would've been fine

690
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,630
if she hadn't

691
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,950
pretended to be your
fan at the signing event.

692
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,030
I think

693
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,230
it's not really her fault.

694
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,870
That was an accident.

695
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,950
Accident?

696
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,420
What accident?

697
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,470
She clearly came prepared.

698
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,110
Since she would

699
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,820
pretend to be your fan,

700
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,550
she might

701
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,430
cause other troubles too.

702
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,630
I bet

703
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,470
their account

704
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,270
is

705
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:32,830
problematic.

706
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,910
And she herself

707
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,070
is not a good person either.

708
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,190
I tell you what...

709
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,950
Stop it!

710
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,310
I mean,

711
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,710
Yu Sheng Sheng

712
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,310
isn't that horrible.

713
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,910
After knowing her,

714
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,830
I found out that

715
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,790
she is a great reporter

716
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,900
with good work ethics

717
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,310
and principles.

718
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,550
Really?

719
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:58,910
Yeah.

720
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,940
I've seen

721
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,070
Culture and Entertainment
Detective's article.

722
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,390
They're well-founded

723
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,630
and not made up.

724
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,870
In the future,

725
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,030
we can work with them

726
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,830
if our artists

727
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,470
need to do interview

728
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,950
or promotion.

729
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,310
I'll think about it.

730
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,070
Leave it to the future.

731
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,310
Let's go and meet Yu Sheng Sheng tonight.

732
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,630
I mean,

733
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,830
she's a reporter after all.

734
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,110
It will do me good to
be on good terms with her.

735
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,630
You've changed, Jiang Yi.

736
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,180
Thank god.

737
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,270
My job

738
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,380
is finally easier.

739
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,230
Sheng Sheng,
what do you want to eat tomorrow?

740
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,150
List them out.

741
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,150
I'll make them for you.

742
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,110
Braised pork.

743
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,310
Good.

744
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,190
Stop thinking about losing weight.

745
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,910
Look

746
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,990
at the celebrities.

747
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:30,870
All of them

748
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,990
are too skinny

749
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,630
and not pretty at all.

750
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,590
I'll open the door.

751
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,190
Reporter Yu, sorry

752
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,990
for disturbing at this hour.

753
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,550
I brought some gifts.

754
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,750
How are you doing?

755
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,590
Come in.

756
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,550
Hi, Mr and Mrs Yu.

757
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,430
Hi.

758
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,750
Welcome.

759
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,110
These are

760
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,020
some gifts

761
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,710
from Jiang Yi.

762
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,070
Sheng Sheng already told us

763
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,870
that you're coming.

764
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,910
Thank you.

765
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,430
No, that's nothing.

766
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,230
Have a seat.

767
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,950
Come on.

768
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,470
Please.

769
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,870
Have some tea.

770
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,710
Thanks, Mum.

771
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,430
Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

772
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,910
I don't drink tea, Mrs Yu.

773
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,390
No?

774
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,670
Try some dates then.

775
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,390
This is

776
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,670
Sheng Sheng's favourite.

777
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,830
Crispy dates.

778
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,310
Here you go.

779
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,390
Thank you.

780
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,230
I'm on a special diet.

781
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,100
Special diet?

782
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,310
He's trying to lose weight.

783
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,150
Lose weight.

784
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:50,750
Lose weight.

785
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,230
Celebrities

786
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,430
do look better on camera

787
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,230
skinny.

788
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,110
We need to talk about work.

789
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:58,950
Please come in.

790
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,510
Yeah, Mr and Mrs Yu.

791
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,060
We need to talk about work.

792
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,030
I'll go inside.

793
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,710
Okay.

794
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,950
What's going on?

795
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,830
How do I know?

796
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,150
Thanks, Mr Yu.

797
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,230
Sure.

798
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,670
Enjoy.

799
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,030
You two look healthy.

800
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,350
Yeah.

801
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:20,710
Sort of.

802
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,190
We're great.

803
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,190
Ever listened

804
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,070
to Yi's songs?

805
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,230
Why are you staring at me?

806
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,910
This is my body.

807
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,110
How do you feel being in here?

808
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,350
Can you get used to it?

809
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,710
Well...

810
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,590
Did you

811
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,830
go to the toilet too?

812
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,030
You even changed clothes?

813
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,900
After I showered.

814
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,350
I don't like the smell of hospital.

815
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,190
You took a shower?

816
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,150
Of course.

817
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,190
Fine.

818
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,830
You called and said

819
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,350
you want to see me.

820
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,030
Have you found a way?

821
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,510
Not yet.

822
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,230
I worked so hard

823
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,430
on your behalf.

824
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,430
Yet,

825
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,710
you're enjoying

826
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,230
a peaceful life at home,

827
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,790
and even took a shower?

828
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,350
When you changed your bra, did you...

829
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,230
I'll give you that.

830
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,390
At least your closed your eyes.

831
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,030
I'm not wearing it.

832
