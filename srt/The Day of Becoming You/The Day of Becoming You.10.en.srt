[The Day of Becoming You]

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,010
[Episode 10]

28
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,070
I think

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,430
I'm quite happy.

30
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,190
I'm happy too

31
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,030
during the days when I became you.

32
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,070
So,

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,870
you also think that

34
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,540
is not bad to be Yu Sheng Sheng, right?

35
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,790
It's good.

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,630
Do you still want

37
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,350
to be Yu Sheng Sheng
for a few more days?

38
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,590
Hey,

39
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,190
look outside.

40
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,070
It's a thunderstorm out there.

41
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,710
We're in a

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,910
closed room together.

43
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,550
Maybe we can switch our bodies again?

44
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,430
Sounds

45
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,630
reasonable.

46
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,470
Let's try.

47
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,670
OK.

48
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,900
My heart beats quite fast now.

49
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,390
Curiosity kills the cat.

50
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,590
Do we really want to try?

51
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,150
Yes.

52
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,230
Let's make a deal first.

53
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,550
If we switched our bodies successfully,

54
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,110
and...

55
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,590
Did you catch a cold?

56
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,350
I'm alright.

57
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,470
Give me some time.

58
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,230
I'm speechless.

59
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,790
You can't even take care of yourself.

60
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,030
I'll check if there's any
medicine at the counter.

61
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,990
There's medicine in my bag.

62
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,950
OK.

63
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,430
I'll boil water then.

64
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,190
OK.

65
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,950
I think you're fine.

66
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,430
You just caught a cold.

67
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,590
We...

68
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,870
How about we try again later?

69
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,180
Don't worry.
My illness is not contagious.

70
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,910
Not contagious.

71
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,670
Go back to your bed.

72
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,780
OK.

73
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,660
Hold on.
It's hot.

74
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,670
[There were a lot of reporters
knocked on our door yesterday.]

75
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,110
[You aunt and sister]

76
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,190
[were scared.]

77
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,710
[Luckily, Da Chuan]

78
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,910
has arranged a hotel room for us.

79
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,550
He's looking for a house for us.

80
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,710
After he found a house,

81
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,670
we'll move.

82
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,030
I'm sorry

83
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,430
to trouble all of you.

84
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,470
Yes, you really troubled us.

85
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,150
They're jealous.

86
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,910
They're jealous that I have a good son.

87
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,470
They don't want us to go to work.

88
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,590
Don't worry.

89
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,430
[Your aunt will understand.]

90
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,430
Don't worry.

91
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,070
Everything will be fine after a few days.

92
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,350
[But, the rumours are too bad.]

93
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,630
Xiao Yi, do you need me

94
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,310
to act with you?

95
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,710
We can act

96
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,820
as if we have a very good relationship.

97
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,230
Let them have some stories
to write about.

98
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,430
Aren't our relationship

99
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,470
is good?

100
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,070
Just like previously.

101
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,830
I'll pay you.

102
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,550
You live a good life.

103
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,870
Don't make your life difficult.

104
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,710
This was our agreement.

105
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,630
You're right.

106
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,990
I'm wrong.

107
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,590
Your sister

108
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,910
wants to talk to you.

109
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,030
Wait a moment.

110
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm tired.
I'm hanging up the call.

111
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,030
OK.

112
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,070
Did you just call your dad?

113
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,190
Yes.

114
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,230
Do you feel better now?

115
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,110
I'm good now.

116
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,110
I was in the rain longer than you,

117
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,670
but you fell sick.

118
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,990
Looks like my dad was right.

119
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,910
It's easy for someone to fall sick

120
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,020
when they have worries.

121
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,950
I was sick for the whole night.

122
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,300
I feel much better

123
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,790
when I woke up in the morning.

124
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,350
Really?

125
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,350
Maybe because

126
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,390
you were taking care of me.

127
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,710
I felt relieved

128
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,510
and I don't feel alone anymore.

129
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,550
You were

130
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,750
never alone.

131
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,150
You have a lot of fans.

132
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,910
You also have Jia Shu, Le Yi,

133
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,110
Jiang Da Chuan, your assistant

134
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,430
and Xu Shu Yi.

135
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,590
Yes, I meant that.

136
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,030
I'll pack my bag.

137
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,470
Let's check out later.

138
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,150
OK.

139
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,190
Check out.

140
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,390
Do you need me to hold you?

141
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,590
Hey,

142
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,830
two boxes.

143
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,230
The guests are still here.

144
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,910
Don't mess up anymore.

145
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,710
I'm home.

146
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,150
Are you in the office yet?

147
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,950
I arrived in the office.

148
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,070
Are you home?

149
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,070
Rest well and drink more water.

150
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,390
Don't wander around.

151
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,190
Yes, Madam Yu.

152
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,470
My heart beats faster now.

153
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,340
My heart beats quite fast now.

154
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,430
If we switched our bodies successfully,

155
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:40,910
and...

156
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,830
Did you have a nightmare?

157
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,700
How come your face is reddish?

158
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,350
Are you having a fever?

159
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,390
No.

160
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,030
When were you here?

161
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,790
I just arrived.

162
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,390
I'm here to visit you.

163
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,620
Do you feel better now?

164
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,230
I'm good.

165
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,750
Good then.

166
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,110
Have you found a solution?

167
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,630
Your disappearing time

168
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,270
is short this time.

169
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,110
You can do your work.

170
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,500
I'll take a rest upstairs later.

171
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,390
OK.

172
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,630
I'm going back to the office

173
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,470
to check on the public responses.

174
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,590
Da Chuan,

175
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,110
I'm sorry to trouble you.

176
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,870
What for you hire a manager
if you don't have troubles?

177
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,030
You want me to lose my job?

178
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,430
I'm leaving.

179
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,990
I shouldn't read those novels
of bossy bosses.

180
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,590
I'm done.

181
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,350
How come no one is working
extra time today?

182
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,430
When you were away in the morning,

183
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,230
Zhang Zhi Xiao announced that
she wanted to treat everybody a dinner.

184
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,180
A villain showing off.

185
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,940
It's obvious that he just wants
to annoy us.

186
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,700
It's OK for him to annoy us.

187
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,750
I hope he won't annoy Jiang Yi anymore.

188
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,590
Let's go home then.

189
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,270
OK.

190
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,230
I wonder if Jiang Yi

191
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,550
feels better these few days.

192
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,900
He's fine.

193
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,910
How do you know?

194
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,550
The quality of a celebrity's mentality

195
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,940
is trained this way.

196
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,870
Moreover, Jiang Yi has been in
the entertainment industry

197
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,790
for such a long time.

198
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,830
He should know how to handle it.

199
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,990
He should be fine.

200
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,470
You're right.

201
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,710
My recommendation

202
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,950
seems to be effective now.

203
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,830
You started

204
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,110
to side Jiang Yi now.

205
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,910
How about you also try

206
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,150
to accept Shu Shu?

207
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,310
No.

208
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,710
Do you want

209
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,870
to watch

210
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,590
the first movie by Jiang Yi
tonight?

211
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,790
I don't want it too.

212
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,350
I'm learning a skill.

213
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,830
Leaning a skill?

214
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,700
What skill are you learning?

215
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,390
It's a secret.

216
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,430
Be quiet.

217
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,790
Wait a minute.

218
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,590
Don't

219
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,910
video call me suddenly.

220
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,500
It would be bad if Tong Hua
found out.

221
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,270
Aren't you in your room?

222
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,420
Yes.

223
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,470
Send a photo of the walnuts to me.

224
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,870
Didn't I send it to you already?

225
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,430
Look at the beauty effect
of the photo.

226
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,510
It looks like two pile of faeces.

227
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,550
So, you don't have a good image

228
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,990
in my heart now anymore.

229
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,470
But, you're a celebrity.

230
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,460
Please control yourself.

231
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,780
It's not easy

232
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,190
to have someone
who can understand

233
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,390
my body and life so well.

234
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,190
If I still can't do anything I like
in front of her,

235
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,590
[how fake and tired]

236
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,670
[my life will be?]

237
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,910
OK, you're right.

238
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,150
You're always right.

239
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,230
Can you see it now?

240
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,750
[But,]

241
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,990
[I have been touching it for a week now.]

242
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,430
[I didn't see any difference.]

243
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,550
The time is too short.

244
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,590
Maybe the way you touch it
is not right too.

245
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,750
Come to my house next time.

246
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,470
[I'll tell you.]

247
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,190
It's OK.

248
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,990
I'll just learn it by myself.

249
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,660
Is there anything else?

250
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,350
I'll continue to study it
if you have nothing else.

251
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,550
[I have.]

252
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,350
[Tell me.]

253
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,430
[I wrote a song.]

254
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,750
[I want you to listen to it.]

255
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,910
OK.

256
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,350
I'll keep it a secret.

257
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,110
Have you played this song

258
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,830
to Xu Shu Yi too?

259
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,270
Why did you ask about this?

260
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,150
[When I was recording a show for you,]

261
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,300
[Xu Shu Yi]

262
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,750
[said that you sent a new song
for her to listen.]

263
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,110
[Even Jia Shu hasn't heard of it.]

264
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,910
How come

265
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,950
you care so much about Xu Shu Yi?

266
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,830
No.

267
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,590
Isn't her your friend?

268
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,670
I was just asking.

269
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,230
OK.

270
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,590
I miss your dad's cooking.

271
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,350
I'll go to

272
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,310
your house for dinner tomorrow night.

273
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,830
[I'm not home tomorrow.]

274
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,470
How about another day?

275
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,110
[OK.]

276
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:06,950
[Bye.]

277
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,470
Bye.

278
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,510
Oh yes.

279
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,710
Why do I care Xu Shu Yi so much?

280
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,870
I won't eat then.

281
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,430
I'm not gluttony.

282
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,510
Yi, are you home tomorrow?

283
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,470
I'll visit you.

284
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,310
We need to restock

285
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,350
both Red Arowanas and Reef Lobsters.

286
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,150
Prepare a bit more

287
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,030
crabs too.

288
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,310
OK.

289
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,740
Tiger grouper is enough.

290
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,110
We can restock after we sold all.

291
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,510
Dad.

292
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,140
How come you're here?

293
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,460
It's still working hours now, right?

294
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,510
I applied for time off.

295
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,950
OK, you can go now.

296
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,710
Yes, chef.

297
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,550
I'm here to pack a few dishes

298
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,390
for Jiang Yi.

299
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,910
If he wants to eat,

300
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,140
I'll cook for him at home.

301
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,710
It's not convenient
for him to go out now.

302
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,470
OK.

303
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,660
It's not convenient for him to go out,

304
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,950
therefore, you became

305
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,910
a delivery girl

306
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,550
and bring food to him, right?

307
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,230
No.

308
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,020
I need his help

309
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,030
at work.

310
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,910
I can't be asking for his help

311
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,310
empty-handed, right?

312
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,470
You're a smart girl.

313
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,670
What do you want to eat?

314
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,910
I'll take a fish.

315
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,190
It looks good.

316
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,110
It's active.
It should be fresh.

317
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,510
I remember Jiang Yi

318
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,590
likes to eat braised meat.

319
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,860
How about that?

320
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,710
Braised meat is fattening.

321
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,710
He needs to be a vegan

322
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,070
for a few days after eating that.

323
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,590
OK, let's change then.

324
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,510
But, I'll order one

325
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,590
since he likes to eat it.

326
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,310
Please choose lean meat.

327
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,590
Lean meat can't be braised.

328
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,990
Dad, don't fight with me.

329
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,020
Just choose some leaner meat.

330
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,710
OK, you choose it then.

331
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,430
OK.

332
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,870
I'll order a sea cucumber dish too.

333
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,270
It looks fresh.

334
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,340
I want a braised sea cucumber.

335
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,750
No.

336
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,590
I want it to be slow-simmered.

337
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,590
It's fresher like that.

338
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,750
And...

339
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,380
You're really particular in this.

340
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,870
How about you cook it?

341
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,390
You can just pay the cost
of the ingredients to me.

342
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,750
Don't be like that.

343
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,910
Thank you, dad.

344
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,150
Please give a little support to my work.

345
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,710
Open the door.

346
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,020
Brother, your food delivery has arrived.

347
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,910
Cuisine from Yu's kitchen.

348
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

349
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,060
Didn't you like surprises?

350
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,310
I want to give you a surprise.

351
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,430
Take it.

352
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,110
OK.

353
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,470
I brought walnuts too.

354
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,190
You teach me about it after you eat.

355
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,510
I thought you want to do self-learning.

356
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,870
After thinking about it,

357
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,150
it'll be better to have a master first

358
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,420
before I do self-learning.

359
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,510
Jiang Da Chuan is not here, right?

360
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,110
Yes.

361
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,950
Good then.

362
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,030
Serve the dishes on plates.

363
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,070
I haven't eaten yet.
Let's eat together.

364
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,710
You...

365
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,470
I brought braised meat, stewed eggplants

366
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,670
and mapo tofu.

367
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,190
These are your favourite dishes.

368
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,150
I handpicked

369
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,550
the meal of this braised meat.

370
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,430
Look, it's all lean meat.

371
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,590
It's low in calories.

372
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,590
And this

373
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,470
bitter gourd fish soup.

374
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,030
It can cool down your body
and get rid of excess water in your body.

375
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,510
I purposely went to my dad

376
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,310
to get this thermos.

377
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,470
I think the soup is still hot.

378
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,990
Why?

379
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,630
Xu Shu Yi is here.

380
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,270
How come I didn't see her?

381
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,750
She's upstairs

382
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,870
chatting with Pei Jia Shu.

383
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,670
She'll leave soon.

384
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,710
Yi, I'm leaving.

385
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,070
The smell is so good.

386
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,110
Are you cooking?

387
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,390
Reporter Yu.

388
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,630
Sheng Sheng,

389
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,430
we meet again.

390
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,230
Yes.

391
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,670
Ms Xu, such a coincidence.

392
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,030
I love to eat

393
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,270
the dishes by Sheng Sheng's dad.

394
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,910
She's here to discuss something with me

395
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,270
and brought along some food.

396
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,030
His dad is a good chef.

397
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,430
The dishes look tasty.

398
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,590
I have a similar taste to Yi.

399
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,790
I think I'll like the food

400
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,910
that he likes too.

401
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,910
Which restaurant does your dad working in?

402
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,990
I'll visit his restaurant next time.

403
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,550
You can ask Jiang Yi.
He knows it.

404
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,070
Can I try

405
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,190
this braised meat?

406
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,870
These belong to Jiang Yi

407
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,990
since I brought them over.

408
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,150
You should ask him.

409
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,470
Yi.

410
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,950
I thought you're leaving already.

411
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,470
I'm not in a rush.

412
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,550
Then...

413
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,510
Let's eat together.

414
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,830
OK.

415
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,820
I'll go to the toilet first.

416
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:27,950
OK.

417
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,620
Xu Shu Yi...

418
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,990
Let's eat together.

419
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,790
There are quite a lot of dishes here too.

420
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,350
You said that Jia Shu
is around too, right?

421
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,830
Can you ask Jia Shu to come down

422
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,990
and eat together?

423
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,700
I don't want.

424
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,950
You can ask him along.

425
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,230
OK, I will.

426
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,580
I'll go.

427
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,980
Jia Shu, why are you not eating?

428
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,300
You don't like the dishes?

429
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,790
You should eat more.

430
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,510
I already had it.

431
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,310
Your dad's cooking is really good.

432
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,630
Actually, I rarely eat dinner

433
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,070
or I'll only eat a bit.

434
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,860
Your self-discipline is good.

435
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,150
No wonder your body is so fit.

436
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,830
I'm proud

437
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,950
to be your fan.

438
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,070
I believe that

439
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,670
you'll continue to shine.

440
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,270
Thank you.

441
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,310
Unlike Jiang Yi.

442
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,940
He called me in the middle of the night

443
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,590
and said that he missed my dad's cooking.

444
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,390
He's gluttony.

445
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,230
You can praise him

446
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,390
but why did you tease me?

447
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,230
Good friends are for teasing.

448
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,390
From a fake fan to good friends,

449
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,710
your fate with Yi

450
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,990
is really a miracle.

451
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,910
She did it for her job.

452
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,630
Yes.

453
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,340
It's normal for me to lie

454
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,790
for my job.

455
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,510
I heard that

456
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,950
a lot of female celebrities

457
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,310
are portraying themselves as gluttonies

458
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,270
but they never gained weight.

459
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,070
They make themselves vomit

460
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,990
behind the scene.

461
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,710
Is that true?

462
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,190
How do I know?

463
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,110
I'm just a hostess

464
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,110
who has passed my prime time.

465
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,140
Do I still consider a celebrity?

466
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,470
Ms Xu, you're too humble.

467
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,670
I heard that

468
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,550
a lot of celebrities invited you to host

469
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,580
their offline events.

470
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,110
Sheng Sheng,

471
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,150
as an entertainment news reporter,

472
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,790
you can't be believing in hearsay.

473
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,150
My channels to get real news is limited.

474
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,550
Therefore, I'm here to ask you.

475
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,070
The news is true.

476
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,150
Thank you everyone for supporting me

477
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,390
and recognised my ability.

478
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,350
If you would like to write about me,

479
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,030
please write something genuine.

480
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,510
Don't worry.

481
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,150
We don't simply cover people

482
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,550
in our public account.

483
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,470
Jia Shu, let's eat.

484
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,870
All of you can eat first.

485
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,790
I'll pick up a call.

486
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,190
OK.

487
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,150
Reporter Yu,

488
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,390
can I call you Sheng Sheng in the future?

489
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,950
Sure.

490
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,950
Is this bitter gourd soup?

491
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,270
Yes, it can cool down your body.

492
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,750
Let's me scoop it for you.

493
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,980
It's OK.

494
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,790
I'll do it.

495
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,430
Don't worry.

496
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,110
Thank you.

497
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,190
It's OK.

498
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,230
Drink more.

499
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,190
Thank you.

500
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,310
Sheng Sheng,

501
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,910
I finished my work earlier
than expected.

502
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,470
Where are you?

503
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,710
I'll pick you up.

504
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,590
You don't have to pick me up.

505
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,430
I'll depart now.

506
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,390
Let's meet

507
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,070
at the cinema later.

508
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,710
Are you going to leave now?

509
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,070
Yes.

510
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,070
I have something to do.

511
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,550
Please wait a moment then.

512
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,590
I'll get something for you.

513
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:51,870
OK.

514
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,540
Shen Bo Qing dated you for a movie?

515
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:06,870
Yes.

516
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,990
How's the trial?

517
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:13,950
Quite good.

518
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,790
Let me get Fatty to send you over.

519
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:19,830
It's OK.

520
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,150
I'll get a taxi.

521
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,750
You don't want to cradle
the walnuts anymore?

522
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,590
Let's do it another day.

523
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,670
My date is more important.

524
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,750
Sheng Sheng, thank you for the food.

525
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,550
A small gift for you.

526
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,230
Thank you.

527
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,870
It's nothing expensive.

528
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,550
It's just some skincare products
that I'm endorsing.

529
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,590
It'll be useful for you.

530
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,860
Thank you for your gift.

531
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,030
I'll use it all.

532
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,030
These belong to Jiang Yi

533
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,350
since I brought them over.

534
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,630
You should ask him.

535
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,460
Yi.

536
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,430
Then...

537
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,630
Let's eat together.

538
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,070
OK.

539
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:18,830
Let's eat together then.

540
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,070
He knows how to share.

541
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,910
This is a good personality.

542
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,820
Shu Shu is still better.

543
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,430
Bad Jiang Yi!

544
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,430
Yes.

545
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,830
OK,

546
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,150
we should have a private date then.

547
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,190
You can teach me first

548
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,110
so that I don't embarrass myself
in front of the audiences.

549
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,110
It's fixed then.

550
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,030
See you.

551
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,550
I've made tea.

552
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,420
Do you want to drink?

553
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,910
OK, good for digestion.

554
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,790
All of you are done eating?

555
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,710
Yes.

556
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,550
I'm sorry.

557
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,150
My call

558
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,990
was a bit long.

559
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,030
It's about work.

560
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,910
A friend invited me to be his guest.

561
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,910
Is Reporter Yu still around?

562
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,310
She left.

563
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,390
Yi,

564
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,190
don't blame me for talking too much.

565
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,390
That bad news

566
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,910
was published by Reporter Yu's company.

567
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,500
I know that it shouldn't be her.

568
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,230
But, it'll never be wrong to be cautious

569
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,350
with a reporter.

570
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,270
I understand.

571
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,470
But,

572
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,790
I'm treating Yu Sheng Sheng as a friend.

573
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,910
I didn't treat her as a reporter.

574
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,110
If I don't trust her,

575
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,670
I won't invite her to my house.

576
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,270
It's just a casual reminder.

577
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,350
Let's drink tea.

578
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,230
I'll leave after drinking the tea.

579
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,230
Let's go.

580
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,630
Senior,

581
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,070
I'm sorry to make you wait again.

582
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,430
I should be apologising

583
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,510
for changing the time last minute.

584
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,230
Let me carry it for you.

585
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,830
It's OK.

586
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,620
This is the skincare gift box

587
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,910
presented by my idol.

588
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,190
I'll carry it.

589
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,390
Idol?

590
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,710
Do you mean Jiang Yi?

591
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,350
He's not my idol.

592
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,510
I told you before,

593
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,030
Shu Shu.

594
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,150
Pei Jia Shu.

595
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,790
-Another celebrity from Little Galaxy?
-Yes.

596
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,790
Jia Shu is not only handsome,

597
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,670
but he's also kind,

598
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,830
gentle and caring.

599
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,950
I'll give all my votes to him

600
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,830
in the National Boyfriend
Selection Competition this time.

601
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,590
How come

602
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,590
he presented something to you suddenly?

603
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,470
I went to Jiang Yi's house
to look for him.

604
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,870
He was there coincidentally.

605
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,630
He thinks that

606
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,270
is awkward to call me Reporter Yu.

607
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,030
He asked if he can call me Sheng Sheng.

608
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,740
He also presented me with this gift.

609
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,790
I wish

610
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,310
I can

611
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,950
be your idol.

612
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,510
You're my senior.

613
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,110
He's my idol.

614
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,230
It's

615
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,110
different.

616
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,110
Have you changed the time earlier?

617
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,260
Yes.

618
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,670
Let's go then.

619
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,590
Let's go.

620
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,300
Hey,

621
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,390
that...

622
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,030
Why did you

623
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,990
present a gift to Yu Sheng Sheng?

624
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,390
Can't I present a gift

625
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:05,870
to my fan?

626
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,270
Do you really believe that she's your fan?

627
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,790
I don't care if she's a real fan

628
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,620
or a fake fan of mine.

629
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,670
I'll treat her as a real fan

630
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,070
before any verification.

631
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,310
Moreover,

632
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,750
I always want my fan

633
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,150
to be happy.

634
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,550
You're really practising

635
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,830
your fans loving personality.

636
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,710
You're wrong.
Fans loving is not a personality.

637
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,070
It's the personality

638
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,990
that I should have as an idol.

639
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,590
You're the one who has a problem.

640
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,590
What's wrong with me?

641
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,510
Didn't you realise

642
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,950
Yu Sheng Sheng is unhappy today?

643
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,110
It's OK.

644
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,270
My mood is not bad today.

645
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,510
I'll give you some advice.

646
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,790
I'm not sure

647
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,910
if both of you are friends

648
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,750
or fake friends.

649
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,110
I don't know

650
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,190
whether if she has other motives

651
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,390
for sending the meal to you.

652
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,910
But I can see that

653
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,790
she worked hard

654
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,270
to prepare the delicious dishes today.

655
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,990
But, you've asked someone

656
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,990
that she doesn't like to join.

657
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,870
Anyone will be unhappy with that, right?

658
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,030
That was just a coincidence.

659
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,670
Don't look for excuses anymore.

660
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,590
You should apologise to her.

661
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,550
Don't make my fan sad.

662
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:09,830
OK?

663
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,260
Can you stay away from me?

664
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,390
You're smelly.

665
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,870
Don't you know that

666
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,030
my sweat

667
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,390
is for my fans?

668
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,030
I'll go to shower now.

669
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,630
I'll put a beauty mask on my face

670
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,710
for my fans later.

671
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,710
There were too many discussions

672
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,630
about this movie.

673
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,590
The story is ordinary

674
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,990
and can't match the
amount of discussions.

675
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,790
The parallel universe, aliens

676
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,910
and anecdotes.

677
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,270
Your hobbies

678
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,590
have never changed.

679
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,870
I'm loyal.

680
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,670
You like it too, right?

681
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,310
I remember that you joined

682
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:48,870
our Occult Research Society

683
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,270
during secondary school.

684
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,030
You've never been absent.

685
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,350
You're

686
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,750
the girl who was most obsessed
with those I have ever seen.

687
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,630
Is that your thought over the years?

688
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,910
Am I wrong?

689
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,550
Yes, you're right.

690
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,270
Sheng Sheng,

691
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,100
this...

692
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,310
This weekend is my off days.

693
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,990
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

694
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,990
Where?

695
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,430
There's a new resort

696
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,510
in the north of our city.

697
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,550
I heard that the sceneries and services

698
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,310
are quite good.

699
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,310
Let me think about it.

700
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,830
If you don't want to go,

701
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,070
I'll cancel the room.

702
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,910
You've booked everything?

703
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,310
I wanted to arrange everything

704
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,390
and give a surprise to you.

705
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,190
But, I had a thought suddenly.

706
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,150
How if you are busy on the weekend?

707
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,030
Then, don't cancel it first.

708
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,830
I'll ask Tong Tong

709
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,430
if I need to rush for
any article this weekend.

710
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,870
OK.

711
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,150
Let me know after you know it.

712
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,150
OK.

713
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,870
I'll go to the toilet first.

714
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,460
I'll come back soon.

715
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,950
Tong Tong, my senior dated me

716
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,670
to a resort this weekend.

717
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,590
Shall I go with him?

718
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,190
Mr Creditor,

719
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,830
what's up?

720
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,630
What time you'll reach home?

721
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,950
I think around half an hour more.

722
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,070
What's wrong?

723
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,710
I'll send the thermos to you.

724
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:31,950
See you later.

725
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:32,950
What?

726
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,150
Hello.

727
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,190
He's always like this.

728
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,390
Hate him!

729
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,230
Let me tell you a lame joke.

730
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,380
A polar bear

731
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,750
is sitting on the iceberg.

732
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,190
It was pulling out its hairs.

733
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,870
One piece, two pieces,

734
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,540
three pieces, four pieces.

735
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,030
Then, the wind blew.

736
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,590
It's so cold.

737
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,270
I learnt

738
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,550
something new lately.

739
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,350
It says that smelling other people's farts

740
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,990
can prevent cancer.

741
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,830
But, I've found out the truth.

742
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,500
That's a hoax.

743
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,550
You...

744
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,110
Send my regards to Tong Hua.

745
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,910
Remember to send me a message

746
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,110
after you have a decision.

747
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:33,870
OK.

748
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,270
You like

749
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,510
the skincare products of this brand.

750
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,540
I'll present it to you in the future.

751
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,420
It's OK.

752
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,310
My idol is the spokesperson
of this skincare.

753
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,750
I want to support him with my money.

754
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,350
I know it.

755
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,030
This is...

756
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,460
It's called love contribution

757
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,630
for a fan like you.

758
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,630
Not bad, senior.

759
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,150
You even know about love contribution.

760
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,070
I also know

761
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,060
ordinary fans, drama fans, couple fans,

762
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,110
Liuzhou Luosifen,
and hot and sour rice noodles.

763
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,230
I'll go up first.

764
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,590
You should go home too.

765
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:02,670
OK.

766
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,310
Bye.

767
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,030
Sheng Sheng.

768
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,030
Sheng Sheng,

769
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,870
I wanted to confess to you

770
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,070
since a long time ago.

771
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,070
But, I was afraid that you'll reject me.

772
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,990
I was afraid that I can't even
be your friends anymore.

773
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,830
Until that day we went to a show together,

774
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,990
you held my hand

775
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,030
and made me dared to confess to you.

776
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,710
Thank you for giving me the chance.

777
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,790
I'll appreciate it.

778
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,870
Senior, I...

779
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,710
You don't have to say anything.

780
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,470
I'm leaving now.

781
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,430
Bye.

782
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,070
What's wrong with you?

783
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,750
You're quite happy with your date.

784
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,270
Of course I'm happy.

785
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,270
My idol even presented me with a gift.

786
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,510
I'm happy today.

787
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,030
Return this to you.

788
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,150
Anything else?

789
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,350
I'll go up if there's nothing else.

790
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,630
Nothing, I...

791
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,830
I thought you're unhappy.

792
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,470
But, you look happy.

793
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,710
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

794
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,070
Is he sick?

795
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,590
Did he come here
in the middle of the night

796
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,150
just to return the thermos to me?

797
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,870
Are all the delivery companies bankrupt?

798
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,630
Jiang Da Chuan is so unprofessional!

799
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,150
How can he let him

800
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,070
do such a nonsense thing?

801
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,940
I'm angry!

802
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,740
He was just here to return
the thermos to me.

803
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,110
What am I hoping for from him?

804
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,910
Eat well and chat well.

805
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,750
All the unhappiness will pass soon.

806
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,940
Who lets you eat?

807
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,630
Hate you, Jiang Yi.

808
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,070
You got nothing to tell me,

809
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,870
but you have a lot to talk to Xu Shu Yi.

810
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,870
He's close with Xu Shu Yi.

811
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,590
What is that to do with me?
