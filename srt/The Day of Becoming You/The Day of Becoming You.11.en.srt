[Episode 11]

28
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,630
Relax.

29
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,390
Clear your mind.

30
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,830
What if...

31
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,710
He's still awake?

32
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,550
Brother Yi.

33
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,630
It's already two o'clock.
You should be sleeping.

34
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,550
It is past

35
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,590
the optimal time for body detox.

36
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,110
I'm reading a script.

37
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,190
He's working too hard.

38
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,070
I can't let him beat me.

39
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,700
Good morning.

40
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,510
Good morning.

41
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
You didn't sleep well last night?

42
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,030
I had insomnia.

43
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,310
Was it because Doctor Shen

44
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,990
invited you for a trip
to the holiday resort?

45
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,950
Yes, but not exactly.

46
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,470
I went to bed early last night.

47
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,180
I only saw

48
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,870
your text this morning.

49
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,510
Tell me. What's bothering you?

50
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,990
During high school,

51
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,790
I liked him before.

52
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,110
I know.

53
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,110
You said

54
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,950
you joined

55
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,870
a mystery research club because of him.

56
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,590
You think he's knowledgeable

57
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,390
and you like to listen to him speak.

58
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,550
You admired him a lot.

59
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,630
That's right.

60
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,590
But you know what?

61
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,790
He thinks that

62
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,950
I still like those little things
about him.

63
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,460
A few days ago,

64
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,710
he gave me a small meteorite as a gift.

65
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,270
He even apologised for

66
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,270
not getting me a bigger one.

67
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,270
I guess there's more to him
than meets the eye.

68
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,150
So I think to myself,

69
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,470
he likes the Yu Sheng Sheng

70
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,470
who once had

71
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,270
the same interest

72
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,910
and hobby as him.

73
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,350
While the one who likes him

74
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,350
is the Yu Sheng Sheng
during high school.

75
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,510
But I'm not that girl anymore.

76
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,670
But love matters in the moment.

77
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,950
Why think about the past?

78
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,870
Tracing to the source

79
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,270
helps to understand a relationship better.

80
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,790
Didn't my relationship with him

81
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,910
change because of

82
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,980
an accident?

83
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,510
We already missed

84
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,710
the right time to fall in love.

85
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,870
That accident...

86
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,910
You're laughing?

87
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,190
Stop laughing.

88
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,390
Alright.

89
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,150
I won't laugh anymore.

90
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,110
After that?

91
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,590
After that, another accident
happened again.

92
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,950
So I wanted to give us another chance.

93
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,510
We went for dates

94
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,070
just like any other couples.

95
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,790
But when I'm with him,

96
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,470
I don't feel that adrenaline rush.

97
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,830
My heart

98
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,790
doesn't pound hard at all.

99
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,510
It's that bad?

100
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,540
When he tried to be

101
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,030
sweet or intimate

102
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,910
with me,

103
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,940
my heart didn't flutter.

104
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,550
I even felt

105
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,750
a little uncomfortable.

106
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,270
Are you going to end this relationship?

107
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,950
I don't know.

108
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,590
I think,

109
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,630
if I keep on

110
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,550
avoiding him,

111
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,070
it'll be unfair to him.

112
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,670
Why don't you

113
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,630
accept his invitation
to the holiday resort?

114
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,430
Going for a holiday trip

115
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,430
is the best relationship test for couples.

116
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,870
Give him and yourself another chance.

117
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,030
You can also take this opportunity

118
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,630
to see if your feelings
for him are real.

119
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,990
You said this is not exactly
the reason for your insomnia?

120
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,310
What else is bothering you?

121
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,510
That's nothing.

122
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,790
I'm just saying.

123
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,030
This is so delicious.

124
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,310
Why are you looking for me?

125
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,710
Le Yi told me that

126
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,340
you stayed up late last night

127
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,030
to read a script.

128
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,910
What script is that?

129
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,870
Why didn't I know about it?

130
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,350
Le Yi is such a chatter.

131
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,870
What did you say?

132
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,030
I'm saying that

133
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,710
a friend of mine

134
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,390
sent me that script.

135
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,510
So I read it.

136
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,870
You've never stayed up late
just to read a script.

137
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,470
Is the script interesting?

138
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,510
The script doesn't make sense.

139
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,910
Why do you say that?

140
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,670
Tell me about it.

141
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,470
The male and female lead
were high school classmates.

142
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,470
He had a crush on her secretly.

143
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,030
It's a teen drama?

144
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,780
The male lead is affectionate.

145
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,830
However,

146
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,470
the way he speaks is cringy.

147
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,350
It's too annoying.

148
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,630
The female lead's persona is quite decent.

149
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,550
She was born in a warm family
and she is kind-hearted.

150
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,070
She throws a fit sometimes,

151
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,470
but it's quite adorable.

152
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,350
They knew each other
for more than ten years.

153
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,670
Ever since they started working,

154
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,390
they're never in a relationship.

155
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,870
Urban romance drama.

156
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,950
After that,

157
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,830
something weird happened.

158
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,230
Weird?

159
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,470
After experiencing

160
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,230
that weird incident,

161
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,630
they both fell in love with each other

162
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,430
and decided to give
this relationship a go.

163
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,230
That makes no sense.

164
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,470
The female lead knew that

165
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,310
the male lead had a crush
on her all these while.

166
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,390
But she had no feelings for him at all.

167
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,590
Just because an external factor

168
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,350
pushed them to get together,

169
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,030
they've decided to give
that relationship a go.

170
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,150
Now here comes the question.

171
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,310
What happened between them
throughout that past ten years?

172
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,710
So you think the reason
she fell in love with him is...

173
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,030
Totally not convincing.

174
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,510
Why did you stay up late
to read this script then?

175
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,470
Weren't you just wasting your time?

176
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,550
Moreover,

177
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,390
you wouldn't take the role of

178
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,350
an affectionate and cringy character.

179
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,910
I think this persona

180
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,390
sounds more like a male supporting role.

181
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,470
A male supporting role?

182
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,590
Yes.

183
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,830
You're indeed a great script analyst.

184
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,110
That is for sure.

185
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,070
The number of scripts I've read

186
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,910
is equal to the books in a bookstore.

187
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,230
Listen.

188
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,830
Next time, you better let me

189
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,470
read through the scripts first.

190
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,750
I'll choose the good ones for you.

191
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,790
You have no idea

192
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,630
how bad

193
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,710
scripts are written nowadays.

194
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,630
They are really terrible...

195
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,390
You're not going to finish your food?

196
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,830
Clean it up for me.

197
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,110
I need to talk to the scriptwriter.

198
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,230
Who is the scriptwriter?

199
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,190
I'll go with you.

200
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,630
He must be losing his mind.

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,910
Why does he want to
talk to the scriptwriter?

202
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,390
Should I get you back on work?

203
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,780
Let's go shopping tonight.

204
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,150
I haven't bought any new clothes
for quite some time.

205
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,710
I need to discuss about a collaboration
with the publicity team tonight.

206
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,620
Let's go out another time.

207
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,790
Alright.

208
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,070
Did you bring your lipstick?

209
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,020
It's in my handbag. Take it yourself.

210
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,150
Why are there walnuts in your handbag?

211
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,550
To increase your brain power?

212
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,230
They're not edible.

213
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,910
Since when did you

214
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,670
like walnuts?

215
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,790
Didn't I tell you last few days?

216
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,110
I'm learning a skill.

217
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,910
Alright. Have fun learning then.

218
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,870
You know what?

219
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,230
Jiang Yi likes cradling walnuts too.

220
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,940
There's a pair of walnuts
he's been cradling for seven years.

221
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,150
[I know. I broke them.]

222
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,830
Do you know how much

223
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,710
do they worth?

224
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,180
[I know. Six hundred thousand.]

225
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,500
[It's my negative equity.]

226
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,470
Six hundred thousand.

227
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,870
I'll work hard to cradle

228
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,110
a pair of walnuts that worths
six hundred thousand.

229
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,310
You can't do it.

230
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,590
Why can't I?

231
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,990
Only the walnuts cradled by Jiang Yi

232
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,950
have that worth.

233
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,070
He has fans who are

234
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,190
willing to buy them for that price.

235
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,230
But Jiang Yi wouldn't sell them.

236
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,870
What if I have

237
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,940
a pair of walnuts similar to his?

238
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,190
How much would they worth?

239
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,460
A few thousand.

240
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,070
A few thousand?

241
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,510
Maybe a few tens of thousands.

242
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,110
That is such a ridiculous price.

243
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,230
That pair of walnuts is coated with

244
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,590
Jiang Yi's sweat and grease.

245
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,750
Is six hundred thousand worth the buy?

246
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,750
A fan's love is priceless.

247
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,830
I'm not his fan.

248
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,350
That's why you wouldn't buy them.

249
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,380
[Let's meet up tonight.]

250
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,590
[I have something to tell you.]

251
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,980
[Great. Me too.]

252
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,670
Yu Sheng Sheng.

253
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,750
What's so important that

254
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,590
you can't tell me over the phone?

255
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,030
You're not happy to see me?

256
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,940
That's not exactly it.

257
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,950
Sit here.

258
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,910
Don't you have something to tell me too?

259
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,510
That's right.

260
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,220
Tong Hua told me about

261
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,150
your pair of walnuts.

262
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,750
What did she say?

263
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,550
Your fans are willing to buy them

264
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,270
for six hundred thousand

265
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,350
because you cradled them personally.

266
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,110
They don't worth that much
in the first place.

267
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,150
At most, they only worth

268
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,670
a few tens of thousands.

269
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:55,950
I see.

270
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,470
I didn't know.

271
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,750
That's what my assistant told me.

272
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,270
Stop playing dumb.

273
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,750
I almost got scammed by you.

274
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,590
What did I do?

275
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:04,950
I just told you to compensate me

276
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,910
with another pair of walnuts.

277
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,150
Do you know how stressed out I was?

278
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,190
I thought I owe you

279
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,070
six hundred thousand.

280
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,150
It's precious because I cradled them

281
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,780
in my palms personally.

282
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,100
Of course its price is premium.

283
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,390
I have all the rights

284
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,230
over the price control.

285
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,380
Fine.

286
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,350
You win.

287
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,070
All I need to do is

288
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,230
compensate you with a pair of walnuts.

289
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,030
Is that right?

290
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,390
What did you want to tell me?

291
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,630
When you came to deliver food
the other day,

292
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,630
I shouldn't have

293
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,670
let Xu Shu Yi join us.

294
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,830
Moreover, you don't like her

295
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,630
in the first place.

296
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,870
She is your best friend.

297
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,430
Of course you can

298
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,230
ask her to join you.

299
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,390
It's not important if I like her.

300
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,830
I wasn't considerate enough.

301
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,950
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,460
I already forgot about that.

303
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,270
It's just a small matter.

304
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,710
I didn't expect you to
apologise to me personally.

305
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,950
It makes me sound like

306
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,190
a petty person.

307
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,750
What is this?

308
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,510
[Jiang Yi is finally back!]

309
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,150
[I am relieved.]

310
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,310
[This facial expression is meant]

311
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,750
[to scare Marketing Account off?]

312
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,750
[I support Brother Yi.]

313
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,590
[The food is good for health.]

314
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,180
[Brother Yi posted about his daily life?]

315
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,940
[That has never happened before!]

316
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,950
[Feeling grateful towards the cook.]

317
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,270
Why did you post it on Weibo?

318
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,270
It's causing a scene.

319
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,150
It's overreacting.

320
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,550
What are these?

321
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,910
Some medicinal herbs for your parents

322
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,990
to make wine.

323
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,790
I brought some health products too.

324
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,910
That's a lot.

325
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,820
As the leader of the fandom,

326
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,750
it's my duty to send
privilege gifts to fans.

327
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,830
I can't let Pei Jia Shu beat me.

328
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,230
Childish.

329
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,580
Are you planning on letting me

330
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,270
carry all those up on my own?

331
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,390
Come in.

332
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,270
Put them here.

333
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,180
Alright.

334
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,270
We don't have men sandals.

335
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,710
Here's a pair of women sandals.

336
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,030
Put them on first.

337
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,870
Alright.

338
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,110
Tea or coffee?

339
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,230
Tea.

340
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,790
Alright.

341
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,030
Shen Bo Qing never came in?

342
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,110
No.

343
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,910
There's no more tea.

344
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,830
I'll make you a wolfberry drink.

345
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,230
Alright.

346
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,310
Your house is nice.

347
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,190
Tong Hua's parents

348
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,390
bought her this house

349
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,310
when we graduated from university.

350
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,700
Since it's near to our office,

351
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,270
I moved in here as well.

352
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,630
Both of you

353
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,390
seemed to be good friends.

354
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,470
Tong Tong and I were classmates
from university.

355
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,110
The time we spent together is more than

356
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,790
the time you spent with Jia Shu and Le Yi.

357
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,780
The relationship among your group members

358
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,550
is quite good too.

359
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,630
You think so?

360
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,310
Yes.

361
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,750
It's just that men and women

362
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,590
have different ways

363
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,430
to express their feelings.

364
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,070
You told me

365
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,190
you had a public account on romance.

366
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,110
You need consultation?

367
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,510
It's not for me.

368
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,190
It's for a drama.

369
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,350
I need to analyse the emotions in it.

370
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,670
I see.

371
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,830
Ask away.

372
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,190
Do you think it is hard

373
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,630
to fall in love with someone?

374
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,790
It can be easy for some

375
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,300
but hard for others.

376
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,270
I'm asking about general situations.

377
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,470
Generally,

378
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,750
love has three situations.

379
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,270
Having a favourable impression,
liking someone and loving someone.

380
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,910
Before you meet someone you like,

381
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,870
you might have favourable impressions
towards many people.

382
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,550
Favourable impression means

383
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,030
admiration towards
certain traits, characteristics

384
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,540
or actions of someone.

385
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,670
You're open for further
development in that relationship.

386
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,260
Just like you and Shen Bo Qing?

387
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,670
I'm giving you information.

388
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,220
Don't apply it on me.

389
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,670
So, you're saying that

390
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,910
it's easy to have favourable impression

391
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,070
towards someone,

392
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,990
but things will get harder
as the relationship develops?

393
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,310
Not bad.

394
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,070
You're a fast learner.

395
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,870
That is exactly what I mean.

396
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,310
How about liking someone?

397
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,710
Liking someone is when

398
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,950
you have a strong urge to

399
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,750
get to know them even more.

400
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,670
You'll always feel like seeing them.

401
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,910
You'll make different excuses
just to see them.

402
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,390
You'll feel attracted to them.

403
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,110
When you like someone,

404
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,350
every emotion of them matters.

405
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,430
You want to see them smile.

406
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,430
You'll find different ways
to make them happy.

407
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,390
You'll get jealous easily.

408
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,350
It'll make you lose control.

409
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,220
You won't feel like yourself anymore.

410
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,910
When you like someone,

411
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,230
your heart flutters.

412
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,430
Quick. Hide yourself.

413
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,470
Hide yourself.

414
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,550
What is wrong?

415
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,670
I am cleaning the shoe rack.

416
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,670
Why are you home so early?

417
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,820
The client was busy.

418
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,830
He didn't show up.

419
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,150
You bought so many things.

420
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,070
They're for Yu.

421
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:42,950
I see.

422
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,630
Princess, here are your shoes.

423
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,430
Why are you trying so hard today?

424
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,590
Well,

425
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,910
since I'll be off for a trip this weekend,

426
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,630
I'll need your help

427
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,910
if something comes up at work.

428
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,230
All you have to do

429
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,990
is enjoy your trip

430
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,790
with Doctor Shen.

431
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,030
The outskirts of Chengbei County

432
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,590
is only a two-hour drive away from here.

433
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,270
Furthermore, I've also checked out

434
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,030
that new holiday resort.

435
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,510
The scenery is good.

436
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,110
I feel relieved to have you here.

437
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,910
[She's going on a vacation
with Shen Bo Qing?]

438
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,350
Didn't you say that

439
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,270
you have no feelings for him?

440
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,550
Now you can take this opportunity
to figure it out.

441
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,110
[No feelings?]

442
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,030
Chilling and relaxing at a place which has

443
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,830
a beautiful scenery and landscape

444
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,990
tends to

445
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,150
ignite love sparks among couples.

446
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,550
If you start having feelings for him,

447
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,510
I don't mind

448
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,270
if you stay there
for a couple more days.

449
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,750
Stop talking nonsense.

450
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,350
That is not nonsense.

451
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,670
I'm free tonight.

452
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,630
How about going out

453
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,870
to shop for clothes tonight?

454
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,710
You have to dress up.

455
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,550
That's a good idea.

456
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,510
Let's go now.

457
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,540
Let's go.

458
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,270
I'll go get changed first.

459
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,030
That's not necessary.

460
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,870
What you're wearing now

461
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,750
looks great.

462
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,950

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,590
to protect you.

514
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,870
You are my assistant.

515
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,030
You only listen to me.

516
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,390
No matter what happens

517
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,470
at the holiday resort,

518
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,310
don't report it to him.

519
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,630
If there's anything important,

520
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,390
I'll let him know myself.

521
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,670
In that case,

522
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,430
remember to put on your mask.

523
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,420
Call me anytime if you need me.

524
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,180
Okay.

525
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,430
There are so many trivias out there

526
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,190
that most people have no idea of.

527
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,590
For example, eating chocolates

528
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,870
can increase your mathematical abilities.

529
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,230
Hugging your partner for 20 seconds

530
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,630
makes them fall deeper in love with you.

531
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,030
Beetles taste like apples,

532
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,110
wasps taste like pine nuts

533
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,550
and worms taste like fried bacons.

534
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,830
You've tasted those insects before?

535
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,550
No.

536
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,310
I read them on the internet.

537
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,350
There's a more interesting one.

538
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,030
Have you tasted oysters before?

539
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,660
Yes.

540
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,950
Oysters can

541
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,950
switch their genders

542
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,990
to adapt to different living environment.

543
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,790
They can switch genders for many times

544
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,750
in a lifetime.

545
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,830
Senior.

546
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,430
I remember that

547
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,790
you liked reading books

548
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,110
about unsolved mysteries
during high school.

549
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,390
Do you still read them now?

550
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,430
I do.

551
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,030
But I'm mostly reading medical books

552
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,310
on the internet nowadays.

553
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,700
A long time ago,

554
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,830
there were cases in which a human body

555
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,070
experiences unusual body symptoms

556
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,950
that can't be explained scientifically.

557
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,510
As our medical technology advances,

558
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,510
humans realise that

559
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,430
it is actually

560
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,620
a rare disease.

561
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,590
Medical scientists

562
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,790
even gave these diseases
corresponding names.

563
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,750
Have you ever heard of

564
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,150
bizarre cases such as

565
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,270
two humans switching their bodies?

566
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,910
Yes.

567
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,550
Really?

568
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,990
I have a deep impression about it.

569
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,510
There were a few similar cases

570
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,070
that happened during the 19th century.

571
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,190
But they were all rumours

572
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,190
because nobody

573
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,310
believed in them.

574
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,030
People think that they are crazy.

575
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,550
Do you believe in it?

576
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,340
I think

577
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,710
it is believable.

578
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,150
Similar cases has happened

579
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,430
in different places
that are thousand miles apart.

580
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,710
Also, their statements match.

581
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,470
Before the body-switching happened,

582
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,260
each one of them also experienced

583
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,350
a certain strong external stimulation.

584
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,190
They can proof each other.

585
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,190
Why do you think

586
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,390
this could happen?

587
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,630
Well,

588
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,870
it's hard to explain.

589
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,150
I think it is motivated by

590
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,780
some kind of magnetic resonance.

591
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,990
I see.

592
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,910
Magnetic field.

593
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,230
You're interested in this?

594
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,030
I can gather some information

595
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,190
and send it to you.

596
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,230
That's great.

597
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,990
I brought a telescope

598
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,070
for this trip.

599
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,150
We can watch the stars together at night.

600
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,870
Brother Yi.

601
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,230
We have been sitting here

602
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,110
for almost two hours.

603
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,430
Should I check in first?

604
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,910
Wait a while longer.

605
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:33,950
Okay.

606
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,190
Hello, welcome to our hotel.

607
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,910
Hello.

608
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,990
Have you made a reservation?

609
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,710
Yes.

610
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,700
Please show me

611
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,670
your identification documents.

612
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,950
Brother Yi, isn't that Reporter Yu?

613
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:56,860
Keep it down.

614
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,630
Help me find out

615
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,230
-their room number.
-Okay.

616
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,110
Get me a room that is

617
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,150
opposite of Reporter Yu's room.

618
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,070
Okay.

619
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,110
One more thing.

620
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,550
Remember to

621
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,550
keep this from...

622
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,470
I understand.

623
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,110
I won't report this to Brother Da Chuan.

624
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,540
Your room is on the seventh floor.
Please head that way and take the lift.

625
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,470
Please enjoy your stay.

626
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,510
Brother Yi, where is
your identification documents?

627
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,870
They are not with you?

628
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,470
No.

629
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,540
Did you leave them at home?

630
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,350
I...

631
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,270
Why didn't you bring them?

632
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,060
I forgot.

633
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,030
Start looking.

634
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,350
Black and white.

635
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,620
Are we wearing a couple outfit?

636
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:09,990
What's with

637
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,950
your bulky hand carry?

638
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,310
It's our lunch.

639
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,750
Let's go.

640
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:14,870
Okay.

641
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,870
Let me tell you a joke.

642
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,510
Go ahead.

643
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,790
Do you know why Batman and Superman

644
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,100
wear tight suits?

645
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,150
I have no idea.

646
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,870
Because time is tight
during their rescue missions.

647
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,830
Girls should avoid
drinking cold beverages.

648
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,870
Drink hot tea instead.

649
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,350
Thank you.

650
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,350
You packed

651
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,990
all these?

652
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,070
You're right.

653
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,150
I woke up at five o'clock in the morning.

654
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,110
They are freshly made.

655
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,870
When did you learn to make these?

656
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,340
Just recently.

657
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,270
After we got together.

658
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,070
I learnt while doing it.

659
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,390
Give it a try.

660
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,750
I'll do it myself.

661
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,150
How does it taste?

662
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,470
Not bad.

663
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,790
I know

664
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,950
you're trying to be supportive.

665
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,750
But I'm already satisfied.

666
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,630
After this, I plan to learn cooking

667
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,470
your favourite dishes

668
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,430
from your father.

669
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,750
I know for sure that

670
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,070
my cooking won't be as good as him.

671
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,590
I can only hope that

672
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,150
my girlfriend will lower her benchmark.

673
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,470
You don't have to do that.

674
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,190
You are busy at work.

675
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,230
You don't have to learn to cook.

676
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,300
If I have any cravings,

677
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,390
my father will make them for me.

678
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,630
It's okay.

679
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,230
I'll spare some time to learn.

680
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,830
Try this fish.

681
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,150
Okay.

682
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,390
You take a bite too.

683
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,110
Okay.

684
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,780
Let me tell you a joke.

685
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,710
Alright.

686
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,860
Among metal, wood, water, fire and earth,
which is the most popular one?

687
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,270
Fire.

688
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,590
Do you know why?

689
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,430
Because it's a hot stuff.

690
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,070
Because fire is a hot stuff.

691
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,670
It's a hot stuff.

692
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,990
Sheng Sheng.

693
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,390
Let's take a photo together.

694
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,950
Sure.

695
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,270
Look for the best view for our background.

696
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,110
Sheng Sheng. What are you looking at?

697
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,980
Nothing.

698
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,630
Let's take a photo.

699
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,190
Look here.

700
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,590
From now onwards,

701
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,700
let's take more photos together.

702
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,350
During our

703
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,270
first anniversary,

704
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,030
I'll make them into a digital photo album.

705
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,270
What do you think?

706
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,910
What are you looking for?

707
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,550
Nothing.

708
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,830
I'm just looking around.

709
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,710
Let's pack up now

710
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,630
and play some billiard.

711
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,830
Okay. Let's do that.

712
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,670
Sheng Sheng. You'll do the opening shot.

713
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,270
I only played this a few times

714
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,470
with Tong Tong during university.

715
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,870
I'm not good in it.

716
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,420
It's okay.

717
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,630
We don't have to play

718
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,790
according to the rules of snooker.

719
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,940
You just need to make sure
the white cue ball

720
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,190
hits the red cue ball.

721
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,870
Okay.

722
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,030
It's okay. Let's try again.

723
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,390
Come on.

724
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,310
Good one.

725
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,510
It's my turn now.

726
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,340
Yes, it's your turn.

727
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,350
You're amazing!

728
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,270
I didn't know you were an expert.

729
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,230
I still have a long way to go.

730
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,590
Wow.

731
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,950
It's your turn.

732
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,590
That's not a good idea.

733
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,070
It's okay. Give it a go.

734
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,310
I am too clumsy.

735
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,220
It's okay. I'll go ahead then.

736
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,750
Bravo!

737
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,950
My family ran a billiard business
back then.

738
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,910
I've played billiard for a long time.

739
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,190
What is your score?

740
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,550
I didn't score at all.

741
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,750
Well... I'm sorry.

742
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,510
I was busy playing.

743
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,030
It is no fun in playing billiards

744
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,910
if you don't score any points.

745
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,310
I'll teach you how to play.

746
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,350
Sure.

747
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,590
Place them like this.

748
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,910
Align them straight with the side pocket.

749
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,510
Aim carefully

750
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,310
and make your shot.
Don't hesitate.

751
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,060
Okay.

752
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,670
Give it a shot.

753
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,150
Let's do it one more time.

754
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,510
Your pose

755
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,390
is not right.

756
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,790
Do this.

757
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,990
Tilt up your arm.

758
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:04,830
That's right.

759
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,900
Place your elbow outwards.

760
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,950
What a weird guy.

761
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,390
Three, two and one!

762
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,230
It's okay. Let's try again.

763
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,990
Tilt up your arm.

764
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,910
What's wrong?

765
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,620
What's wrong with guys nowadays?

766
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,550
Why are they so handsy?

767
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,310
Stay away from

768
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:25,870
guys like that.

769
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,390
Do you understand?

770
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,670
It's okay. Let's try again.

771
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:30,910
Senior.

772
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,110
Forget it.

773
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,030
I have no talents in this.

774
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,030
Let's try something else.

775
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,190
Sure. I brought a drone.

776
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,310
Do you want to try flying it?

777
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,510
You brought a drone?

778
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,390
That's right.

779
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,510
The view is beautiful here.

780
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,870
I want to take a video for you.

781
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,470
Great.

782
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,580
Wait for me outside at the empty space.

783
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,340
I'll go get the drone.

784
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:52,780
Okay.

785
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,150
It is you.

786
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,990
What a coincidence.

787
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,710
It's not a coincidence.

788
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,150
Why are you here?

789
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,230
Tong Hua said that the review
for this resort is great.

790
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,630
So I came for a trip.

791
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,030
Stop giving excuses.

792
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,820
I'm asking why you are here.

793
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,750
You were also out there just now,
weren't you?

794
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,630
A famous celebrity secretly
following an entertainment reporter.

795
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,310
Did you get the wrong script?

796
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:32,940
You're right.

797
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,830
I'm following you.

798
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,670
Why?

799
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,270
Why?

800
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,030
I'm here to observe life

801
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,750
and people.

802
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,870
It's to improve my acting skills.

803
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,910
What?

804
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,590
Performing is an expression

805
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,790
of what you personally hear, see and feel.

806
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,190
When we switched our bodies previously,

807
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,340
I had to act as you.

808
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,230
But I still need to do more observations

809
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,470
on who you truly are.

810
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,950
That is interesting.

811
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,230
Go ahead in making up your stories.

812
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,390
I'm telling the truth.

813
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,150
We've been seeing each other

814
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,900
for a long time.

815
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,070
Isn't that more than enough?

816
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,150
Yes. But that was you

817
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,030
in a normal state.

818
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,470
Since you're not in your right mind,

819
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,390
I need to observe
that side of you as well.

820
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,270
Just like what's happening now.

821
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,750
You got together

822
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,190
with a guy whom you don't like.

823
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,990
You looked awkward
throughout this date.

824
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,590
We don't look awkward.

825
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,860
Really?

826
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,820
We're just trying to
strengthen our connection.

827
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,150
Fine.

828
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,430
Just continue to strengthen
your connection.

829
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,310
I'll continue with my observation.

830
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,030
Do as you wish.

831
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,390
[Why did I agree to let him stay?]

832
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,310
[I should have made him leave.]

833
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,230
[So what if he is a celebrity?]

834
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,550
[So what if he is good looking?]

835
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,510
[Don't think about him.]

836
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,310
[Don't bother about him.]

837
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,790
Here, Sheng Sheng.

838
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,300
Look at the camera.

839
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,670
Senior.

840
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,910
Let me try.

841
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,630
Sure. I'll teach you how to do it.

842
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,390
That's right. Now take a shot of me.

843
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,270
Give it a try.

844
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,750
Let the drone follow me.

845
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,790
Sheng Sheng. The drone...

846
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,110
I'm sorry.

847
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,430
I think it's stuck somewhere.

848
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,350
It's okay.

849
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,390
I'll think of a way.

850
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,060
It's so high.

851
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,430
Wait for me.

852
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,350
Hello.

853
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,030
Can I borrow your ladder?

854
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,590
I need to use it

855
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,390
to get back my drone.

856
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:38,990
Sure.

857
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,070
Thank you.

858
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,670
Do you need my help?

859
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,470
It's okay.

860
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,670
I'll return your ladder

861
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,510
once I'm done.

862
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,510
Alright.

863
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,270
Thank you.

864
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:56,790
Be careful.

865
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,790
Aren't you afraid of heights?

866
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,990
It's okay. I'll overcome it.

867
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,870
Be careful.

868
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,540
I'll hold the ladder.

869
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,030
Be careful.

870
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,190
Be careful.

871
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,830
Take it easy. Be careful.

872
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,710
Why don't we

873
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,030
ask for help?

874
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,550
It's okay.

875
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,710
Trust me. I can do it.

876
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,310
Be careful.

877
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,070
Be careful.

878
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,470
Take it easy.

879
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,790
Be careful.

880
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,790
Come down slowly.

881
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,830
Let's continue.

882
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,620
You're hurt.

883
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,630
It's just a scratch from the branches.

884
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,430
Why don't we

885
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,590
go back and clean your wound first?

886
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,710
I heard that hugging your partner
for 20 seconds

887
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,230
will make them fall deeper
in love with you.

888
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,070
I hope that you'll fall deeper
in love with me.
