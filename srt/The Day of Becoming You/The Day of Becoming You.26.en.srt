[Episode 26]

28
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,390
What? I just took a toilet break

29
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,190
and you're not watching anymore?

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,550
I don't feel like watching anymore.

31
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,190
Upset?

32
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,390
No.

33
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,830
Why would I be upset?

34
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,270
You sound upset.

35
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,390
The person mentioned by Jiang Yi

36
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,500
who wanted him to make a decision

37
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,350
is you, huh?

38
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,110
Now, he's finally

39
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,460
successfully living a normal life.

40
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,510
He can now date

41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,150
without hiding.

42
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,430
Well, it seems like

43
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,420
Yu Sheng Sheng toiled hard

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,470
and he reaped the benefits of it.

45
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,030
Even I feel that it's so unfair for you.

46
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,830
It isn't his fault.

47
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,310
We didn't have a choice.

48
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,030
Why are you still siding with him?

49
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,990
It's just facts.

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,310
You know it.

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,870
What if

52
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,790
the switch can be solved,

53
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,950
would there be a chance of
getting back together?

54
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,030
You're daydreaming.

55
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm going to shower.

56
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,070
Oh, right.

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,910
Pei Jia Shu

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,430
invited us for a meal tomorrow.

59
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,380
Is he serious about investing?

60
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,190
Yeah.

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,110
I told him

62
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,110
our business idea.

63
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,910
He's been thinking about it.

64
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,870
Anyway, we'll talk about it first.

65
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,710
Prince charming-turned-boss.

66
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,910
That would work.

67
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,110
Put on makeup

68
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,550
and dress up tomorrow.

69
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,670
No problem.

70
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,230
Old schoolmate,

71
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,630
I'm not joking

72
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,190
about investing in the both of you.

73
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,550
I do that because I believe you'd do well.

74
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,110
Although it's still new media,

75
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,230
we won't be

76
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,070
involved in entertainment.

77
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,590
Yup, you've told me.

78
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,470
It goes well with me.

79
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,590
And, I think,

80
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,230
writing content for practical life

81
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,270
is more meaningful.

82
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,710
Sheng Sheng,

83
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,820
anything to add?

84
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,910
No.

85
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,340
Hey, don't treat him as a celebrity.

86
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,550
It's impossible.

87
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,390
Boston lobsters.

88
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,630
All dishes are served.

89
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,190
Please enjoy your meal.

90
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,700
Thank you.

91
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,230
It's just the three of us,

92
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,110
and there's so much food!

93
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,310
Don't worry.

94
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,190
There will be others.

95
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,180
Others?

96
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,830
Yeah.

97
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,670
Hi.

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,230
Sis Sheng Sheng, long time no see.

99
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,510
You're becoming prettier by the day.

100
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,270
Le Yi,

101
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,860
I've been watching you quite a lot.

102
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,830
You're now the regular guest

103
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,110
on many variety shows.

104
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,750
Don't talk about this.

105
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,910
My schedule's so packed,

106
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,310
I don't even have time
for video games now.

107
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,390
When will he be arriving?

108
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:07,710
Soon.

109
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,550
There's someone else?

110
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,070
I'm not late, am I?

111
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,230
Right on time.

112
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,990
Brother Da Chuan.

113
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,710
Brother Yi.

114
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,310
Yi.

115
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,590
Long time no see.

116
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,790
Long time no see.

117
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,950
This is my former bandmate,

118
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,590
Cheng Le Yi.

119
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,990
My old schoolmate, Tong Hua.

120
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,190
Hi, Le Yi.

121
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,830
I'm Tong Hua.

122
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,470
Hello.

123
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,790
Brother Jia Shu has
been talking about you.

124
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,590
Now we finally meet.

125
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,190
I've been admiring you.

126
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,270
I finally meet you in person.

127
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,150
Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,870
Nice to meet you.

129
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,940
Come, eat. Come, eat.

130
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,940
Eat while we talk.

131
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,870
I heard from Jia Shu,

132
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,110
he's interested in investing
in your business start-up.

133
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,910
Have I told you?

134
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,740
Yeah.

135
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:32,830
Yeah,

136
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,340
we plan to open a studio.

137
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,550
Is there anything I can help with?

138
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,300
Nothing.

139
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,790
It's manageable.

140
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,940
Don't stand on ceremony with me.

141
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,750
That's mutton.

142
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,590
You can't eat that.

143
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,350
You remembered it so clearly.

144
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,220
Let me reward you with it.

145
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,670
Look at Brother Yi and Sis Sheng Sheng.

146
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,510
They broke up and remained friends

147
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,030
and are still getting along so well.

148
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,110
This is just awesome.

149
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,870
Yi,

150
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,710
I watched that TV show of yours.

151
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,230
Do you really plan to find a girlfriend?

152
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,030
Yes.

153
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,030
Have you found someone you like?

154
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,710
Yeah.

155
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,590
But, I haven't confessed.

156
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,860
A "Yes" isn't guaranteed.

157
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,990
Oh.

158
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,390
I think it won't be a problem.

159
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,390
It's hard to say.

160
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,350
Introduce her to us next time.

161
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,310
I need to be well-prepared.

162
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,310
Yeah,

163
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,740
don't do it like how you
introduced Sis Sheng Sheng.

164
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,150
What a mess!

165
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,950
Don't worry.

166
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,150
I'd introduce her to you this time.

167
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,910
Sheng Sheng,

168
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,110
I'm going to see an old friend

169
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,150
with Pei Jia Shu later.

170
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,260
Why don't you head home on your own?

171
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:14,950
Okay.

172
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,430
Let me give you a lift.

173
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,430
I'm fine.

174
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,030
I'll hail a cab.

175
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,350
Don't stand on ceremony.

176
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,230
What?

177
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,510
Need me to put on the safety belt for you?

178
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,110
No. I'll do it myself.

179
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,830
Why did you come knowing
I was going to be there?

180
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,740
I wanted to see you.

181
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,350
Didn't we make a pact...

182
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,550
Don't you want to see me?

183
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,550
I just feel that it isn't ideal.

184
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,470
That means, you do want to see me.

185
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,590
But, you're just worried.

186
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,590
Stop fumbling around for a point.

187
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,190
Moreover, you're a guy who's

188
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,950
setting out afresh
to look for a girlfriend.

189
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,470
So, you should be careful with your words.

190
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,670
And, you shouldn't send
your ex-girlfriend home.

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,230
Your new girlfriend wouldn't be happy

192
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,550
if she finds out about it.

193
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,670
Yeah, you're right.

194
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,910
That's how Yu Sheng Sheng operates, huh?

195
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,830
Always putting others before herself.

196
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,990
Not inviting me in?

197
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,190
No.

198
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,310
It's best for us not to meet anymore.

199
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,710
What are you doing?

200
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,070
Sheng Sheng,

201
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,390
we'd not switch bodies again.

202
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,510
What do you mean?

203
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,710
I told my mom about

204
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,550
what happened to us.

205
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,670
Through reading and researching,

206
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,470
she consulted

207
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,180
some of her friends.

208
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,430
They found the

209
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,990
third party magnetic field
that's affecting us.

210
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,310
It's an asteroid

211
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,150
named B56743.

212
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,750
This asteroid

213
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,110
has moved far enough from earth

214
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,390
that it won't affect us anymore.

215
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,940
What? The cause to our switch

216
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,870
is that bizarre?

217
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,630
That depends on the scriptwriter.

218
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,980
We should still be careful.

219
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,910
I'm sorry that it caused you to
constantly be alarmed.

220
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,380
But, I've made sure

221
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,510
many times.

222
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,270
Or else, I wouldn't

223
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,670
be there with you today.

224
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,830
You came just to see me?

225
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,510
Yes.

226
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,190
I still like you.

227
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,790
So, I'd like to ask

228
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,580
if you're willing to be my girlfriend?

229
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,190
No!

230
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,710
No?

231
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,790
My thoughts are everywhere.

232
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,300
I need to think it through.

233
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,350
Bye.

234
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,590
You're at home?

235
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,110
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

236
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,750
Where would I be besides home?

237
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,270
On a date with Jiang Yi?

238
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,310
So, you knew?

239
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,190
Tong Tong, you liar!

240
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,390
And, Jiang Da Chuan and Cheng Le Yi.

241
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,550
Both of them are big fat liars too!

242
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,270
Why didn't you include Pei Jia Shu too?

243
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,670
Jia Shu is a little liar.

244
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,870
All of you are bad guys!

245
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,870
You guys were in cahoots
to make a joke out of me.

246
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,350
You got it wrong.

247
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,950
We really wish for

248
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,430
you and Jiang Yi

249
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,110
to get back together.

250
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,300
How did Jiang Yi tell you guys?

251
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,190
He hoped that we could be of help

252
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,070
to pave the way,

253
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,830
then, to test out your thoughts

254
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,870
with him being there.

255
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,510
You rejected him?

256
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,510
Yeah.

257
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,670
Why?

258
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,470
He's the one you like, no?

259
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,750
Moreover, the

260
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,590
obstacle between the both of you

261
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,470
has been removed.

262
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,950
I promised to help Jiang Yi

263
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,190
knowing that you've

264
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,740
never forgotten him.

265
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,070
I don't know.

266
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,390
I just don't feel at ease.

267
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,750
Let me be honest.

268
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,550
In fact,

269
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,630
Jiang Yi and I

270
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,670
have been keeping in touch.

271
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,390
He's concerned about you.

272
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,030
But, he couldn't come see you.

273
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,390
He hoped that you could forget him

274
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,310
and start anew.

275
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:38,990
In the past half a year,

276
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,950
his mom helped in

277
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,270
identify that asteroid.

278
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,470
However, they weren't sure of

279
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,950
how long it'd take for
the asteroid to leave.

280
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,590
So, he's been holding it in

281
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,550
to not come to see you.

282
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,590
He's afraid that it would just
be a flash in the pan.

283
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,830
But, this time,

284
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,150
he's fully assured of

285
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,110
everything,

286
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,020
and hence, chosen to come see you.

287
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,750
Yeah,

288
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,470
he's indeed done a lot.

289
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,270
Let me think about it some more.

290
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,220
Think about it long and hard.

291
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,550
I'm going to pen my resignation letter.

292
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,510
I'm going back home tomorrow.

293
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,990
Okay.

294
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,430
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

295
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,390
Oh,

296
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,070
you're back!

297
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,630
Yeah.

298
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,300
Cooking so early?

299
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:43,950
Yeah.

300
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,030
Why are you here?

301
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,150
I was craving for

302
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,230
Uncle Yu's cooking.

303
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,590
Just ask Fatty to

304
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,550
come pack some food for you.

305
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,470
Is that the way to talk to your guest?

306
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,900
I'm learning to cook

307
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,780
from Uncle Yu.

308
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,430
Whatever.

309
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,510
Dad, where's Mom?

310
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,310
In the bedroom, I think.

311
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,500
Sweetie.

312
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,910
Hi!

313
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,670
Tong Tong, you're here too?

314
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,910
Follow me.

315
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,470
Tell me, what's going on?

316
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,470
While you were dating
Jiang Yi last year,

317
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,350
he asked me for help

318
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,630
to explain to your parents

319
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,150
why was it inconvenient to

320
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,470
tell others about it.

321
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,270
But now, it's different.

322
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,550
And, I'm one to

323
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,950
finish what I've started.

324
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,870
So, I've come again

325
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,260
to explain to your parents

326
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,430
that if the both of you
get back together,

327
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,780
what's convenient

328
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,630
and why it doesn't need to stay secret.

329
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,060
What did my parents say?

330
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,750
"Totally understood."

331
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,390
You planned to come back today

332
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,710
and tell them yourself, right?

333
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,670
Am I not thoughtful?

334
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,030
You...

335
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,710
You really wish for us
to get back together?

336
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,950
Of course.

337
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,590
I'm the number one fan

338
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,780
of your ship.

339
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,980
However, fans' opinions

340
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,110
are just for reference.

341
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,910
The decision

342
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,550
totally lies

343
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,750
in your heart.

344
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,350
Yeah.

345
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,910
Here.

346
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,900
Yesterday, Bo Qing told me

347
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,030
he was dating a new girl.

348
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,070
I looked at her photo.

349
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,070
She's quite pretty.

350
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,590
For real?

351
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,390
He'll be bringing

352
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,550
her over next weekend.

353
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,830
You can see it for yourself.

354
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,070
Sure.

355
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,470
Let me see if

356
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,950
she's really like an angel.

357
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,470
Jiang Yi, since now it's convenient,

358
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,590
visit more often

359
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,710
when you're free.

360
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,910
Sure, Uncle.

361
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,910
I won't stand on ceremony.

362
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,670
I'll come regularly.

363
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,100
You should come drink with me.

364
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,230
I will drive, maybe next time.

365
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,630
Don't bring so many things

366
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,510
the next round.

367
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,590
Okay.

368
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,380
Sure, Aunty.

369
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,550
Dad, Mom,

370
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,990
you guys...

371
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,750
What's wrong with us?

372
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,950
He's my ex-boyfriend.

373
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,910
Have you forgotten?

374
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,670
And?

375
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,100
It's awkward for me.

376
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,630
Really?

377
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,430
But, that's never the case

378
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,750
with Bo Qing.

379
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,310
How is that the same?

380
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,830
Senior Shen and I only

381
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,150
tried dating for a short time.

382
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,950
It wasn't love.

383
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,190
We weren't really into each other.

384
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,190
Whatever.

385
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,430
I don't care anymore!

386
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,630
There, there.

387
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,630
Eat up, eat up.

388
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,750
If having me over

389
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,870
is making it awkward for you,

390
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,110
then, I'd better not come again.

391
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,070
I don't mean that.

392
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,790
Just joking.

393
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,900
I'll come often.

394
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,350
You're getting cheeky.

395
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,420
Have you thought about

396
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,950
becoming my girlfriend?

397
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,350
Do you have to know now?

398
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,950
Although I just asked you yesterday,

399
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,070
my heart

400
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,270
has waited for a whole year.

401
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,430
Since you've been waiting for a year,

402
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,430
what is a day to you?

403
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,380
I'll be resigning tomorrow.

404
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,430
So, I'm getting off work early.

405
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,750
Let's go hiking.

406
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,590
Hiking?

407
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,470
Yeah.

408
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,870
I'll come get you then.

409
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,830
No need.

410
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,750
Let's meet in the hills.

411
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,990
Okay.

412
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,190
So, you've decided?

413
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,630
All the best.

414
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,870
Look, look.

415
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,670
That's Jiang Yi, right? Right?

416
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,750
Hurry.

417
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,630
Hello, are you Jiang Yi?

418
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,350
My girlfriend is your fan.

419
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,830
Can you take a photo with her?

420
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,180
Sure.

421
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,550
One, two, three.

422
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,430
Done. Thank you.

423
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,830
Can I shake hands with you?

424
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,750
Sure.

425
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,710
Thank you.

426
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,310
Thank you.

427
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,990
Let's go.

428
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,790
Let me see.

429
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,510
I found you again.

430
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,870
You've changed so much.

431
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,670
After not needing to wear masks,

432
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,070
you look more relaxed

433
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,710
and more confident.

434
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,390
Well, I'm a celebrity.

435
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,470
Sometimes, people would
want to do a double take.

436
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,590
I just let them.

437
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,590
As long as you don't

438
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,700
see yourself as a circus monkey.

439
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,430
Wow, you've become more daring,

440
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,150
you took the initiative to hold my hand.

441
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,270
It's because I've resigned.

442
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,350
What does this have to with resigning?

443
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,590
It's some sort of a ceremony.

444
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,030
Bidding goodbye to my past self

445
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,270
and starting anew.

446
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,750
In the past, besides worrying
that being photographed

447
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,150
would affect your career,

448
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,270
I was a coward myself too.

449
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,150
You're not worried now,

450
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,230
neither am I.

451
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,270
Hold on.

452
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,870
Hello.

453
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,870
Yeah, I booked the room.

454
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,150
We're almost there.

455
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,750
Bye.

456
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,660
What?

457
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,550
It's not what you think it is.

458
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,870
What?

459
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,750
I said nothing.

460
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,340
Hurry up.

461
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,100
They're calling to rush you.

462
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,510
It's really not what you think it is.

463
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,230
What are you referring to?

464
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,630
You've got to be clear.

465
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,430
What were you thinking?

466
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,470
I just laughed

467
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,550
because you laughed. Is that a crime?

468
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,500
Here's your card.

469
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,070
Thank you.

470
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,430
This is...

471
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,190
He'll be here just for a moment.

472
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,630
Okay.

473
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,710
Would you prefer Oriental or

474
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,190
Western style for tomorrow's breakfast?

475
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,230
In fact, I'll leave in a moment too.

476
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,590
We'll leave after doing the business.

477
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,630
Understood.

478
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,700
Not in that way.

479
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,950
We really have matters to take care of.

480
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,830
Understood.

481
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,910
I think it's best to register.

482
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,030
We might not leave

483
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,950
after taking care of business.

484
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,590
Okay.

485
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,070
Don't worry.

486
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,070
Guests' information is

487
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,070
kept strictly confidential.

488
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,470
So, you came here to fulfill a vow?

489
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,460
Yeah.

490
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,670
All my wishes have come through.

491
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,350
We can be together again.

492
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,430
So, I have to come to
thank Perseus (a constellation).

493
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,630
Do you

494
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,910
have any new wishes?

495
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,550
No.

496
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,470
So many people make a wish

497
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,070
upon a star.

498
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,110
It must be busy.

499
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,630
Leave the chance

500
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,630
for those who need it.

501
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,150
I shouldn't be too greedy.

502
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,510
I'm considered

503
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,190
exceptionally, extremely,
incredibly lucky.

504
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:48,830
Of course,

505
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,070
thanks to your mom too.

506
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,750
She's the one who helped us.

507
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,110
Yeah.

508
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,310
In that way,

509
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,340
I need to thank Shen Bo Qing too.

510
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,100
Without his reminder,

511
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,030
I wouldn't have thought of

512
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,950
asking my mom for help.

513
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,950
In that way,

514
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,470
I need to thank Tong Tong,

515
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,390
Da Chuan, Jia Shu and Le Yi.

516
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,750
And, your adorable parents.

517
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,750
Let's take a photo

518
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,710
and send it to them.

519
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,470
Good idea.

520
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,590
[Congrats for
recapturing my prince charming.]

521
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,190
Things would be less
awkward this way, huh?

522
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,350
[Congrats!]

523
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,710
[See you this weekend.]

524
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,030
[You don't need
to hide anything this time.]

525
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,910
[I'll be the guarantee.]

526
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,630
[Brother Yi,]

527
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,670
[I'll reserve myself as your groomsman.]

528
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,670
[What's the rush?]

529
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,590
[He doesn't have friends.]

530
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,990
[So, you don't need to be in a hurry.]

531
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,950
[Don't need to thank me.]

532
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,750
[Being able to help you]

533
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,310
[is my pleasure.]

534
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,830
[I'll always love you.]

535
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,150
Right.

536
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,390
There's something

537
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,950
I've been wanting to ask you.

538
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,510
After I confessed to you that day,

539
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,430
why didn't you accept me immediately?

540
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,630
Were you having worries?

541
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,830
Are you saying that I must

542
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,790
rejoice upon hearing your confession?

543
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,270
I don't mean it that way.

544
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,630
The problem is on my side.

545
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,990
In the past year,

546
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,990
you've made huge changes,

547
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,470
you've paid a hefty price and
made great sacrifices.

548
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,990
But, I

549
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,750
remained in the same place

550
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,870
and did nothing.

551
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,980
I felt uneasy.

552
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,270
I couldn't thank the heavens enough

553
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,030
that you've remained in the same place.

554
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,430
You said,

555
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,230
love involves limitless
affection for each other.

556
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,380
Because of that,

557
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,580
hence, one would bear the pain of

558
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,510
being apart for the other person.

559
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,510
Just to be together,

560
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,670
no matter how hefty the price or effort,

561
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,710
one would still be willing.

562
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,270
Because of the limitless affection,

563
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,150
hence,

564
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,990
one would be hopeful for the future.

565
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,190
Every step

566
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,190
is taken

567
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,630
with a clear direction

568
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:33,950
towards the destination.

569
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,030
Sheng Sheng,

570
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,910
I'm now more than sure

571
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,910
that I love you.

572
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,470
I'm also more than sure

573
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,750
that I love you.

574
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,270
[A shooting star shoots across the sky.]

575
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,620
[This intriguing journey of]

576
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,670
[a body switch has come to an end.]

577
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,590
What do you think of this ending?

578
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,510
As your editor, I love it.

579
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,990
However, doesn't it seem

580
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,830
too ideal for

581
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,550
celebrities to be given

582
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,070
such a perfect solution?

583
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,150
In fact, I've come up with

584
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,030
a few versions.

585
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,820
But, I still chose this version.

586
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,150
It may seem too good to be true.

587
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,430
But, I like such stories

588
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,540
that's full of hope and romance.

589
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,270
Perhaps, only I knew

590
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,190
what you've gone through

591
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,380
writing this novel.

592
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,670
Using your love life

593
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,150
as a reference point for writing,

594
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,710
impressive.

595
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,630
I didn't have any inspiration

596
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,670
while you were rushing me for the submission.

597
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,350
Yi Jiang and I quarreled
a lot during then,

598
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,140
we weren't on speaking terms.

599
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,070
I couldn't understand the

600
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,750
different concerns of a celebrity.

601
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,830
Once, he got so upset that

602
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,510
he said, he wished to

603
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,710
switch identities with me,

604
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,710
so I could taste what it's like

605
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,510
to live his life.

606
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,310
That was what

607
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,630
brought me inspiration.

608
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,550
This is my first time hearing this.

609
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,710
So, what did you feel

610
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,430
and experience

611
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,350
writing this book?

612
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,150
Put aside the factors
of realistic emotions,

613
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,070
and think from the shoes

614
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,990
of the character.

615
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,630
That helped me understand him better.

616
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,190
Besides that,

617
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,510
a few new thoughts were birthed.

618
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,420
Spill them.

619
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,390
We often say "to feel as if
it had happened to oneself".

620
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,950
But, it's almost impossible to

621
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,510
achieve in real life.

622
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,830
Sometimes, people just

623
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,950
easily judge a person

624
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,070
according to

625
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,070
one-sided message

626
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,230
or by stereotyping.

627
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,470
Such as,

628
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,190
celebrities who get high site traffic

629
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,350
are not really talented.

630
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,070
Entertainment reporters are
just a bunch of people

631
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,710
who chase for gossip.

632
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,270
We also

633
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,060
subconsciously brand others.

634
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,470
Such as, "hypocrite",

635
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,580
"selfish",

636
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,030
"kind",

637
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,830
"good guy", "bad guy".

638
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,270
In fact, everyone is many-faceted.

639
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,430
We have multiple sides.

640
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,350
We are complex beings.

641
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,150
That's true.

642
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,190
Switching bodies

643
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,150
is the best method to
understand the other person.

644
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,550
It allows us to

645
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,870
be completely immersed to

646
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,110
experience the other person's life.

647
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,030
Like what you've written in the preface,

648
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,430
if men experienced

649
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,470
menstrual cramps,

650
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,750
they won't just tell us to
"drink hot water".

651
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:06,990
Yeah.

652
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,350
When I was deciding on the setting,

653
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:09,950
I was thinking,

654
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,870
it'd be awesome if everyone could

655
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,710
be completely present

656
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,990
to experience the other person's life.

657
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,270
Perhaps, people would not

658
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,070
easily blurt

659
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,590
words that hurt.

660
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,230
I can see that you and Yi Jiang

661
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,310
are like the main characters

662
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,190
in the novel.

663
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,670
It took a lot for

664
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,390
the both of you to be together.

665
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,900
Perhaps, had you understood

666
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,510
each other earlier,

667
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,540
the both of you could have

668
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,910
avoided the part where you broke up.

669
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,150
Perhaps, that's

670
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,510
part of maturing.

671
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,310
Right,

672
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,950
there's something I'm curious about.

673
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,790
When you wrote about

674
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,550
the broke up last year,

675
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,110
your love life hit a low,

676
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,700
and you couldn't continue.

677
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,910
So, you thought of

678
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,270
writing a tragic ending.

679
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,390
What made you come around?

680
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,830
And, I wasn't rushing you for submission.

681
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,150
But, you took the initiative to

682
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,390
turn the story around
with a wholesome ending.

683
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,470
Because, Yi Jiang came back.

684
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,510
And, we're back together.

685
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,980
Really?

686
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,070
Yes.

687
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,870
This year,

688
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,230
like Jiang Yi, the male lead

689
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,910
made many changes.

690
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,110
This ideal ending

691
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,390
is inspired by him.

692
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,350
It's also the purpose
he's been working for.

693
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,110
I've grown so much

694
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,510
from writing this novel.

695
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,630
It's also given me courage and strength

696
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,870
to face future obstacles

697
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,190
with him.

698
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,230
Look at you.

699
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,470
I envy you.

700
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,030
Makes me want to
fall in love listening to you.

701
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,110
Right,

702
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,070
would you be rectifying

703
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,790
the parts I mentioned

704
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,950
which might

705
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,830
arouse controversy?

706
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,150
No.

707
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,870
All that I hope and want to express

708
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,150
are written in there.

709
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,070
Controversy is inevitable,

710
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,030
because everybody

711
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,030
perceives differently.

712
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,620
I can't ask every reader

713
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,870
to jump into my story

714
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,470
and experience a body switch, right?

715
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,510
Okay, you have my support.

716
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,190
Tomorrow, I'll officially report

717
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,230
the topic selection.

718
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,990
You finished the novel?

719
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,230
Any comments?

720
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,670
Very interesting.

721
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,950
You're just trying to
get me off your back.

722
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,950
In fact, I've read

723
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,150
a part of it before this.

724
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,670
It's just that,

725
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,230
we were not on speaking
terms at that time.

726
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,030
So, there's a question

727
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,230
I haven't addressed.

728
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,870
You can address it now.

729
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,510
In real life,

730
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,270
we

731
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,430
knew each other only after
the band disbanded.

732
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,710
But, why did you

733
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,150
shift it to an earlier
timeline in the novel?

734
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,590
It's a novel.

735
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,390
Many stories and characters

736
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,620
are just fiction.

737
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,870
I didn't maintain

738
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,110
originality for all characters.

739
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,390
I jumbled them up and rearranged.

740
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,070
That way, readers wouldn't
come to assumptions.

741
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,910
For instance, we'd never

742
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,150
experienced body switch.

743
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,310
Actually, there is another reason.

744
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,670
It's something to do
with my selfish motives.

745
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,470
What is it?

746
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,790
You were the reference point
for the male lead's

747
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,750
experiences while growing up.

748
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,150
Your sadness and sorrows

749
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,390
are real.

750
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,950
A loving family

751
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,150
is extremely important

752
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,670
to a person's growth.

753
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,550
Some people say,

754
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,270
writing stories make up for

755
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,790
the regrets in real life.

756
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,870
My regret

757
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,710
is not knowing you earlier.

758
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,270
Any other questions?

759
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,070
Yeah.

760
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,190
Don't you think

761
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,110
their love

762
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,430
is too much of a rough journey

763
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,750
in the novel?

764
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,150
In the beginning, they experienced

765
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,980
body switch

766
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,270
where mutual understanding is needed.

767
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,990
After that, they needed to be cautious

768
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,150
even when kissing, hugging,

769
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,580
or holding hands

770
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,790
to avoid a body switch again.

771
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,790
Love isn't an easy thing

772
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,150
to start with.

773
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,950
Do you think

774
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,030
the possibilities for one
to meet the right one

775
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,670
would be higher than

776
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,550
the possibilities of two planets

777
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,510
colliding into each other?

778
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,710
Life is full of

779
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,550
changes and surprises.

780
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,670
So, we should treasure

781
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,430
every chance we get to hold hands,

782
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,030
hug and kiss.

783
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,910
