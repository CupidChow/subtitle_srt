[Episode 9]

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,270
What's the matter?
You're scared?

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,590
You've got to be joking.

30
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,990
I've never been afraid.

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,390
Then let's take a shot at it.

32
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,710
Go ahead then.

33
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,750
Game on.

34
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,870
What was up with you yesterday?

35
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,390
You dad was a better drinker than I am.

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm not asking about that.

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,180
I'm asking about

38
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,590
your attitude towards Shen Po Qing.

39
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,310
What kind of attitude do you mean?

40
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,710
Someone's getting defensive.

41
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,430
A few days back when we switched,

42
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,510
did he wrong you?

43
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,190
Get your facts right.

44
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,950
He made me an imaginary rival first

45
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,950
and acted hostile towards me.

46
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:01,780
Why would he

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,870
make you his imaginary rival?

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,710
That's normal.

49
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,430
A guy so brilliant

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,870
and attractive

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,790
is around his girlfriend.

52
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,070
Anyone would feel threatened.

53
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,190
You feel bad for him?

54
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,310
You've agreed to be his girlfriend for me.

55
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,630
So you should

56
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,750
feel bad for him as well.

57
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,550
When did I do that

58
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,470
for you?

59
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,740
You didn't?

60
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,500
Why would I make that decision for you?

61
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:35,830
But you said

62
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,990
you'd let us be together

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,980
and wished us happiness.

64
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,430
When did I say that?

65
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,230
You forgot?

66
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,710
Back when your sister
was sent to my place,

67
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,510
you called me in rage.

68
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,900
Didn't you make out

69
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,110
that I said those things out of anger?

70
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:55,910
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,150
I didn't

72
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,790
make things clear back then.

73
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,550
But I think

74
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,550
Shen Po Qing's not bad.

75
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,430
Perhaps try to mingle with him
for two days first?

76
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,910
Or if you don't want to,

77
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,100
I'll help you break up with him now.

78
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,030
I'll do it right now.

79
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,070
Forget it.

80
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,790
Forget it?

81
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,030
My parents, my colleagues,

82
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,870
and his colleagues

83
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,550
all know we're together now.

84
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,070
Breaking up just after two days

85
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,790
will make me look like a psycho.

86
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,260
The important thing is

87
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,270
he's really not too bad.

88
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,270
Since I've promised him,

89
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,350
we'll try to date first.

90
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,820
Maybe it'll turn into the real thing.

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,310
You eat up.

92
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,270
I'm off to work.

93
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,840
[Jiang Da Chuan]

94
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,750
Really?

95
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,950
What do you expect me to say?

96
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,310
You're a famous artist

97
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,270
getting drunk

98
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,830
and crashing at

99
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,270
a female entertainment reporter's house.

100
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,110
If she took photos of you

101
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,110
and made something up,

102
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,670
I'll be in deep water

103
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,070
and you'll lose your fans.

104
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,190
Yi.

105
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,630
I'm not exaggerating here.

106
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,430
Nothing could be worse than this.

107
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,750
There is.

108
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,270
You slept with her?

109
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,750
She's pregnant?

110
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,110
Stop making wild guesses.

111
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,750
It's been resolved.

112
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,270
No, wait.

113
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,350
Yi, be honest with me.

114
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,190
Does she have

115
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,310
any leverage over you?

116
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:01,870
If not,

117
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,270
you're simply spoiling her.

118
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,150
You took her to your house.

119
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,550
You hid that from me

120
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,110
and did her interview along with Le Yi.

121
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,870
Yesterday I offered

122
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,030
to make you my signature dish
but you refused it.

123
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,630
The minute she mentioned how good
her father's cooking was,

124
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,710
you went straight to his restaurant.

125
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,510
Is my cooking

126
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,430
not up to par with her father's?

127
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,030
Stop embarrassing yourself.

128
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,470
Don't forget

129
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,270
you were the one who forced me

130
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,430
to accept Yu Sheng Sheng's interview.

131
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,390

Thanks.

Home sweet home.

143
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,070
No nagging, no medicinal food,

144
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,430
and no little kids.

145
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,590
Little kids?

146
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,310
Nothing.

147
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,550
I'm just free and at peace here.

148
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,430
It's as if the good life

149
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,750
is waving right at me now.

150
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,910
Shu Shu.

151
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,550
Have you been good

152
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,030
while I was gone?

153
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,390
With that kind of name,

154
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,070
you expect it to be nice?

155
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,630
Darling.

156
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,550
Stop your insinuations.

157
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,030
Darling.

158
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,820
I've not been insinuating.

159
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,110
I've always been up front with you.

160
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,270
Alright, fine.

161
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,430
You've got a friend

162
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,710
who is Jia Shu's classmate.

163
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,070
He's bad at making a living

164
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,990
and lacks common sense.

165
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,110
I can even memorize it now.

166
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,140
When will you have him over?

167
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,790
So we can battle it out.

168
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,150
He's not in the country now.

169
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,870
I'm just joking.

170
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,820
No celebrity

171
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,140
can make everyone a fan.

172
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,670
That's true.

173

I'm actually siding with Jiang Yi on this.

334

It's obvious that

335

his father asked him
to take care of his sister.

336

Didn't he take her back?

337

That's plausible.

338
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,070
It does make sense
if you speculate it that way.

339

This isn't speculation. It's the truth.

340

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,630
living off him all these years

345
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,190
until he has finally reached his limit.

346
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,950
You've seen all of that
with your own eyes?

347
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,470
This is based on logical speculation

348
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,740
and reasonable questioning.

349
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,350
We even left a question mark there.

350
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,670
If we question it,

351
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,430
Jiang Yi can always come out
to explain himself.

352
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,910
Doesn't that place Jiang Yi
in a miserable spot?

353
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,550
His photo was secretly taken.

354
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,910
His bitter past was exposed.

355
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,830
His character was questioned.

356
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,390
Now he's forced to respond

357
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,510
and let people like you

358
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,350
capitalize on his dismay.

359
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,630
Alright, alright.

360
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,910
We're all colleagues

361
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,190
just trying to make a living.

362
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,030
It doesn't have to go down like this.

363
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,590
That's right.

364
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,110
If you are so morally conscious,

365
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,390
just join the social news department then.

366
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,670
No matter

367
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,990
the type of news,

368
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,030
we must adhere to

369
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,150
principles of factual reporting.

370
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,470
Entertainment news

371
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,590
is more influential

372
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,190
than other forms of news.

373
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,230
Hence, you should be

374
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,300
accountable for every word

375
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,150
in your reporting.

376
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,790
Yu Sheng Sheng, you better
watch your mouth.

377
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,110
Do you own the government?

378
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,070
Must you control everything?

379
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,430
I'm writing it my way.

380
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,430
So what?

381
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,430
Call the cops then.

382
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,630
Do you even understand what news is?

383
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,070
Where's your professionalism?

384
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,500
Alright, that's it.

385
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,350
Zhi Xiao, that's enough, okay?

386
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:33,950
Let's go.

387
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,190
Who wants to drink her coffee anyway?

388
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,510
Why are you more worked up than I am?

389
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,590
You're really going to ditch Pei Jia Shu

390
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,710
and join me as a fan of Jiang Yi?

391
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,710
I just can't stand by and do nothing.

392
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,590
Jiang Yi never mentioned anything

393
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,510
about his family.

394
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:58,750
I wonder

395
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,710
how depressed he'll be

396
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,550
when he sees this on the search list.

397
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,670
I wonder

398
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,470
what kind of manager

399
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,270
you are.

400
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,340
You're even unaware

401
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,110
that pictures were secretly taken

402
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,790
of your own celebrity.

403
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,470
Where's your diplomacy

404
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,670
with the reporters?

405
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,790
How can they just publish

406
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,750
those pictures so fast.

407
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,380
Moreover,

408
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,910
you also didn't know that

409
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,070
your celebrity was doing an interview

410
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,230
in this very house.

411
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,230
What has become of this house?

412
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,100
People come and go
as they please now.

413
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,110
Is this a hotel?

414
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,300
Why don't you just place
a few cameras over here

415
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,950
and live broadcast everything instead?

416
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,350
Da Chuan, I'm sorry.

417
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,790
I'll be extra cautious next time.

418
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,750
Brother Yi was resting at home these days

419
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,190
so we've let our guard down.

420
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,270
One more thing.

421
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,670
I looked it up.

422
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,110
The official account
that published Yi's scandal

423
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,190
was similar to

424
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,310
the official account of

425
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,070
the agency that interviewed

426
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,310
Le Yi and Brother Yi the other day.

427
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:49,910
You mean

428
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,060
the reporter who revealed the news

429
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,950
is of the same agency with Reporter Yu?

430
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,430
Yes.

431
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,670
See that?

432
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,830
You can't trust people.

433
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,750
You can't trust people nowadays,

434
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,950
especially reporters.

435
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,950
Now we've got to deal with this trouble.

436
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,790
I don't think

437
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,110
this has anything to do
with Miss Sheng Sheng.

438
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,630
Why link them?

439
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,030
Miss Sheng Sheng?

440
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,710
You trust her?

441
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,590
I do.

442
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,390
All of you

443
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,550
are too naive.

444
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,510
Jia Shu.

445
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,830
The car is here. We can go now.

446
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,110
I'm off to work.
You guys continue.

447
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,790
Alright, I won't accompany you today.

448
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,350
Do your best at work.

449
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,070
Just ignore the stuff

450
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,110
written on the internet.

451
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,990
Shut it all out if you want a good rest.

452
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,830
Jiang Da Chuan will handle the rest.

453
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,470
That's the whole point

454
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,910
of having a manager.

455
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,350
Stay away from me.

456
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,710
Your cologne stinks.

457
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,500
You have a poor taste.

458
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,630
Where are you off to?

459
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,910
I'm having lunch with a friend.

460
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,390
Brother Jia Shu is giving me a ride.

461
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,230
What kind of friend?

462
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,230
A musician

463
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,270
you don't know.

464
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,630
Brother Yi, take a rest.

465
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,550
I'll go out now.

466
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,230
Okay.

467
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,510
Someone I don't know?

468
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,550
Why doesn't he just tell me?

469
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,990
Wait, where are you going?

470
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,430
Going to bed.

471
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,190
Alright, sleep is good.

472
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,990
Have a good sleep.

473
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,390
Three difficult brats.

474
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,990
Actually you did pretty well.

475
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,030
Damage control was done on spot.

476
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,110
Let's head back to the company.

477
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,350
I know

478
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,620
you ranted on purpose

479
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,910
to show those three brats.

480
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,830
[A picture]

481
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,030
[to spin the entire story?]

482
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,990
[We all experience bad mood at times.]

483
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,340
[It's okay to follow his work]

484
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,990
[but stay away from his personal life.]

485
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,190
[A father and stepmother
who leeches off their son.]

486
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,950
[I bet the sister]

487
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,030
[isn't much of a difference too.]

488
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,190
[Not a devil's advocate here.]

489
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,230
[No matter what, ]

490
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,950
[he shouldn't disrespect his elders.]

491
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,790
[I never really cared,]

492
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,950
[but now he's totally lost my respect.]

493
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,350
[So many Virgins Mary wannabes here.]

494
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,470
[Whoever sides Jiang Yi this time]

495
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,380
[ought to be criticized.]

496
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,030
[Pity her.]

497
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,830
[What wrong has his sister done?]

498
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,870
[It's a girl's right to be pampered]

499
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,870
[and dress up.]

500
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,470
[Head over to my page.]

501
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,830
[Yi.]

502
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,990
[I saw that article.]

503
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,390
[Don't take it too personally.]

504
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,790
[They're just grandstanding.]

505
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,750
[I might be speaking out of turn.]

506
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,750
[But be more careful]

507
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,870
[when making friends next time.]

508
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,750
[I'm attending a commercial event today.]

509
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,630
[So I can't head over to see you.]

510
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,830
[Rest well.]

511
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,110
[Hello. ]

512
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,510
[The number you've dialled
is not in service.]

513
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,310
[Please try again later.]

514
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,470
[Le Yi.]

515
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,260
[I can't reach Jiang Yi.]

516
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,230
[Is he still okay?]

517
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,150
[Miss Sheng Sheng.]

518

[I think it's better for you]

519

[to not contact Brother Yi at the moment.]

520
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,870
[Everyone is a bit sensitive]

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,670
[towards your identity now.]

522
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,710
[You think I had
something to do with that?]

523
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,110
[I don't know.]

524
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,670
Let's go and have lunch.

525
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,110
Thanks.

526
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,670
What's the matter?

527
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,190
It's nothing.

528
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,510
Try to contact

529
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,270
Jiang Yi's agency.

530
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,710
If he plans to explain,

531
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,670
we'll write the article.

532
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,900
Alright, I'll ask them about it.

533
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,470
Let's go.

534
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,430
Any updates?

535
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,190
It's still the same.

536
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,230
It's among the top search titles
of three engines simultaneously.

537
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,150
Both him and his agency

538
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,750
have not responded.

539
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,030
But he seldom updates his Weibo.

540
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,630
It's even more unlikely for him
to do that now.

541
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,780
His fan club is actively doing
damage control too.

542
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,540
This scandal

543
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,350
won't actually affect

544
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,430
his career too much.

545
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,510
But he has always refused

546
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,550
to disclose his family matters.

547
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,070
Now that it's out there,
he must really be upset.

548
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,030
That's right.

549
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,660
Plus the article was all made up.

550
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,110
Have you contacted Jiang Yi?

551
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,790
He switched off his phone.

552
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,390
The number he gave you

553
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,630
must've been his manager's.

554
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,950
The fact that it's unreachable

555
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,590
means they don't want to be disturbed.

556
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,670
Yes.

557
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,070
Moreover I'm an entertainment reporter.

558
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,910
We reporters

559
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,230
are always treated like that

560
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,110
by their staff.

561
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,630
We're cherished when needed

562
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,830
and discarded when not.

563
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,030
But I have an internal source saying that

564
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,150
Jiang Yi goes under the radar

565
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,950
whenever he's upset.

566
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,670
Under the radar?

567
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,430
He won't bring any staff.

568
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,030
He heads out alone

569
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,950
to somewhere no one knows.

570
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,990
I bet it's some therapeutic

571
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,030
secret place of his.

572
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,350
This is...

573
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,470
What is it?

574
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,710
It's nothing.

575
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,150
Tong Tong.

576
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,350
I've got something up this evening

577
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,310
so I'm not going back to the office.

578
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,300
Please help me apply leave.

579
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,670
That's so sudden.
Where are you heading to?

580
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,070
I have to go.

581
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,390
Remember to apply my leave.

582
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,550
Jiang Yi, where are you?

583
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,990
I couldn't find him

584
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,190
and I'm stuck here.

585
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,190
Why am I so unlucky?

586
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,430
You're not working today?

587
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,190
It's a coincidence or perhaps...

588
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,350
Do you think I did it too?

589
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,700
I know I did agree

590
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,470
about Jiang Mo,

591
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,310
and I was there when you're arguing,

592
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,110
and the official account

593
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,100
happens to be our company's.

594
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,110
It all seems

595
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,590
somewhat related to me.

596
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,470
Tong Tong even made me contact you

597
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,430
to ask whether you'd
like to clear things up.

598
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,230
No matter how you see it,

599
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,830
it just seems like

600
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,100
I've staged everything.

601
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,510
I never said anything.

602
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,790
Why are you acting so guilty?

603
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,110
You switched off your phone
and didn't reply to my messages.

604
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,590
How can I not feel guilty about it?

605
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,470
That's because I forgot to charge my phone

606
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,150
and the battery died.

607
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,670
And you couldn't find a power bank?

608
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,390
I wanted the battery to be dead.

609
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,190
So you do want to
go under the radar.

610
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,150
How did you know

611
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,630
I was here?

612
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,110
I...

613
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,630
When we switched bodies,

614
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,900
I used your phone

615
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,270
and saw your other account.

616
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,390
This is

617
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,870
the only mountain in the city.

618
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,510
What are you laughing about?

619
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,150
You found me.

620
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,790
You found me.

621
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,270
Thanks.

622
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,470
Only one identity card?

623
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,150
My boyfriend forgot to bring his.

624
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,470
We came for a hike.

625
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,430
But it's raining heavily

626
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,390
so we can't leave now.

627
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,470
Indeed,

628
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,470
it started raining out of the blue.

629
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,110
Room 206.

630
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,430
This one has a balcony.

631
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,990
Thanks.

632
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,030
Let's go.

633
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,630
Oh, wait.

634
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,910
The one in the cabinet is quite pricey.

635
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,470
Would you both like to

636
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,430
take a box from the counter instead?

637
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,910
We won't need that.

638
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,660
We've brought our own.

639
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,870
Are you crazy?

640
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:29,710
Two boxes.

641
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,150
You're really something.

642
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,910
I never knew

643
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,110
you had such thick skin.

644
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,150
You're enjoying it.

645
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,110
It's just a joke.

646
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,550
Jokes in the entertainment industry

647
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,550
are often so shameless?

648
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,910
That's not really the case.

649
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,310
It's because I read

650
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,710
those books at your house

651
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,630
about the president kissing Cinderella.

652
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,350
Why were you reading those books?

653
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,710
I was bored.

654
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,190
But I've learnt something from that.

655
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,950
I realized those presidents

656
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,510
had really good physiques.

657
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,190
You seem to be in a good mood.

658
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,910
I guess you're feeling better now.

659
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,790
Why isn't it a king-sized bed?

660
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,590
Will you stop it?

661
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,030
Does it amuse you to mess with me?

662
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,510
Head to the shower.

663
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,350
Don't catch a cold.

664
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,350
You go first.

665
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,790
You go first.

666
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,820
You go first.

667
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,030
You're soaked from head to toe.

668
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,430
Let's shower together then.

669
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,350
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

670
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,710
In your dreams.

671
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,870
Got you there.

672
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,190
Tong Tong.

673
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,750
I won't be going home today.

674
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,230
You're staying at your own place?

675
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,990
No.

676
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,630
I'm in the middle of the mountain.

677
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,190
It's raining outside.

678
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,990
So I got

679
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,310
[a room for the night.]

680
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,190
In the mountains?

681
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,230
I realized

682
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,630
it's getting harder for me

683
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,590
to get you.

684
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,190
Are you

685
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,030
checking in with a guy?

686
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,670
That's right.

687
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,110
[You've got it right.]

688
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,510
He even brought two boxes

689
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,430
of family planning supplies.

690
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,950
That sounds terrific.

691
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,430
Enjoy yourself then.

692
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,670
Thank you.

693
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,510
Anything else?

694
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,310
I wanted to ask you

695
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,310
when you'd be back

696
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,630
so we could chew out Zhang Zhi Xiao.

697
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,070
[This afternoon]

698
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,660
[someone spotted Jiang Yi's father]

699
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,630
[and took some photos.]

700
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,030
Now netizens are at it again.

701
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,230
I'll send it you.

702
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:00,990
[I can't talk anymore.]

703
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,030
[I've got damage control to do. Bye.]

704
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,110
Alright, bye.

705
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,900
What are you looking at?

706
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,750
Nothing.

707
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,830
Please be more mindful of yourself.

708
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,790
We're still of opposite genders.

709
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,630
I've given up on resisting you.

710
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,350
After all, you seen everything

711
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,030
from top to bottom.

712
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,150
I've indeed seen it all.

713
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,750
But it's different.

714
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,950
There's only the two of us

715
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,070
in this room alone

716
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,910
and it feels weird.

717
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,550
Alright.

718
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,390
I know you're not interested in me.

719
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,110
You fancy Pei Jia Shu.

720
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,110
My feeling for Jia Shu is admiration.

721
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,670
I'm willingly support him with my love

722
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,420
without asking anything in return.

723
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,710
I only hope

724
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,820
he does his best in singing and dancing,

725
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,460
maintain his glorious looks

726
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,470
and be a good role model to others.

727
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,110
That'd suffice.

728
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,990
And I thought

729
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,030
all girls fantasized

730
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,080
dating their prince charming.

731
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,110
We do fantasize,

732
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,070
but it can only remain a fantasy.

733
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,270
In the real life,

734
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,750
there's no way of knowing him at all.

735
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,150
What more to make him notice me

736
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,150
and fall in love with me.

737
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,350
The probability of it happening
is literally zero.

738
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,870
Thanks to you,

739
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,590
I now even have a boyfriend.

740
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,230
You're bringing it up again.

741
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,150
Do you want to charge your phone?

742
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,910
My phone is still good.

743
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,980
I'm under the radar now.

744
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,070
Jiang Da Chuan and the rest

745
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,710
have always doubted my intentions.

746
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,830
If they know

747
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,950
you are with me the whole night,

748
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,550
I won't be able to explain myself

749
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,550
no matter how hard I try.

750
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,350
If I were Jiang Da Chuan,

751
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,750
I wouldn't believe it either.

752
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,220
That's exactly

753
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,630
your typical demoness
of the Silken Web Cave.

754
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,350
I asked Le Yi if he trusts me.

755
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,870
He said he doesn't know.

756
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,750
Le Yi took your side back at the house.

757
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,990
He told Jiang Da Chuan that he trusts you.

758
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,950
Da Chuan couldn't believe his ears.

759
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,510
I trust you too.

760
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,630
Back when we switched bodies,

761
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,590
you could've done anything you wanted.

762
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,430
Yet you didn't.

763
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,150
You protected me well.

764
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,350
You're also better than me

765
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,150
in so many things.

766
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,790
For example, you're likeable.

767
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,870
You don't have to be too likeable.

768
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,710
The way you are right now

769
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,030
is just fine.

770
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,030
Is that so?

771
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,020
When we truly fancy someone,

772
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,350
we don't need them to change

773
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,310
into the way we want.

774
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,670
We fancy them

775
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,270
simply because of who they are.

776
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,150
Is that so?

777
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,390
I answer your question

778
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,430
but you doubt my answer.

779
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,950
I'm not doubting you.

780
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,590
It's just that I haven't met

781
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,070
anyone like that before.

782
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,070
How's that possible?

783
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,230
You've got so many fans.

784
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,070
While some may scold

785
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:07,910
or defame you,

786
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,390
but there are

787
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,910
also those who like you

788
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,590
and love you.

789
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,900
They only like

790
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,150
the Jiang Yi they imagine,

791
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,070
not the real me.

792
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,670
The real me

793
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,710
is dispensable

794
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,950
and redundant.

795
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,940
Why would you think so?

796
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,430
The public official account got it right.

797
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,030
Since I was very young,

798
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,790
my parents divorced.

799
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,510
The court assigned me to my father.

800
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,150
But he left me

801
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,420
to my grandpa instead

802
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,190
while he tried to make a living faraway.

803
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,110
I heard that he's attempted many jobs.

804
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:02,990
A promoter,

805
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,190
insurance agent,

806
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,620
delivery guy...

807
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,550
He disregards small amounts of money.

808
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,950
He aims too high

809
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,030
and ends up with nothing in the end.

810
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,990
When my grandpa passed away.

811
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,830
he never visited.

812
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,990
I only got to know

813
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,190
through others

814
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,710
that he remarried.

815
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,470
How about

816
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,910
your mother?

817
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,220
She went overseas

818
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,860
and has never remarried.

819
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,630
She's doing pretty good with her research.

820
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,670
In their lives,

821
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,190
I'm the dispensable one.

822
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,950
In your wardrobe,

823
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,940
I saw many gifts

824
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,310
from your mother.

825
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,310
She still misses you in her heart.

826
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:01,830
Yes.

827
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,990
But that's not enough.

828
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,070
You're right.

829
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:11,670
It isn't enough.

830
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,670
A child needs lots of love

831
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,190
growing up.

832
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,070
Yes.

833
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,710
Just like how your parents treat you.

834
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,390
Yes.

835
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,660
When you put it that way,

836
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,710
I'm indeed blessed with a happy life.

837
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,630
Me too...

838
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,510
When I became you.

839
