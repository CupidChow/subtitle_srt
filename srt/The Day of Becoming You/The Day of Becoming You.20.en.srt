[Episode 20]

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,910
I never knew you liked me since
a long time ago.

29
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,190
I was young and foolish.

30
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,980
That's right. It's not a big deal.

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,830
Writing love letters during high school

32
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,060
was just like doing homework.

33
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,870
To me,

34
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,750
your feelings were more sincere

35
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,870
because you were still young.

36
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,590
If I had known earlier

37
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,390
that you liked me too,

38
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,590
we wouldn't have

39
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,710
wasted so many years.

40
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,230
Actually, it's not always a bad thing

41
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,710
you didn't cross path.

42
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,790
It's indeed a good thing that
you didn't get together earlier.

43
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,750
What's wrong? Were you thinking of

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,110
getting into a relationship
at such a young age

45
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,750
in front of your teacher?

46
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,950
Luckily Sheng Sheng didn't send out
that love letter.

47
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,550
Look how well it turned out now.

48
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,670
You're at a suitable age

49
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,430
and have a stable job now.

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,060
That is best for your relationship

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,910
to develop in the long term.

52
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,030
But sometimes when you
missed the right timing,

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,110
you won't get a second chance.

54
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,750
It will never be the same.

55
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,910
Mother.

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,470
Actually, we've already broken up.

57
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,310
Why did you

58
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,750
hide your break up from us?

59
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,390
Uncle Yu. Mrs Cai.

60
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,510
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,390
I was the one who stopped Sheng Sheng
from telling you.

62
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,750
So I'm here today

63
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,030
to explain it to you.

64
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,310
Actually...

65
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,830
Father. Mother.

66
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,950
I initiated the break up.

67
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,430
I think we're better off

68
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,510
as friends.

69
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,550
Your mother thinks

70
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,340
it's a pity.

71
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,790
Are you really going to

72
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,750
break up?

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,870
Yes.

74
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,100
We've already made up our minds.

75
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,630
This matter is

76
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,110
between the both of you.

77
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,870
As long as you've thought it through,

78
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,780
we'll accept it.

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,150
Mother. Don't be angry at me.

80
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,430
It's my fault.

81
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,550
What is your fault?

82
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,510
I've let you down.

83
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,380
You still don't get it?

84
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,790
It's your fault that you lied to us.

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,950
Is your mother that unreasonable

86
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,950
to you?

87
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,390
I do hope that

88
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,830
things will go well between
you and Bo Qing.

89
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,430
But it's still

90
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,670
up to the both of you.

91
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,270
If you don't suit each other well,

92
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,150
it's normal to break up.

93
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,630
Will I force you to be together?

94
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,550
Bo Qing.

96
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,310
I've always treated you

97
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,310
as a part of the family.

98
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,910
I hope you'll be happy

99
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,630
and live a good life too.

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,190
In future, you're always welcome

101
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,350
to visit us

102
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,500
and enjoy Uncle Yu's dishes.

103
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,950
Don't be awkward with us

104
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,030
after this break up.

105
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,750
Don't worry, Mrs Cai.

106
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,670
As long as you welcome me here,

107
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,990
I'll come visit you often.

108
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,710
How would we

109
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,870
not welcome you here?

110
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,030
It's just that

111
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,870
our Sheng Sheng doesn't know her loss.

112
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,830
It's my fault.

113
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,230
I'll eat another bowl of rice
as my punishment.

114
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,150
Jiang Yi.

115
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,390
I apologise for

116
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,750
letting you witness this.

117
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,790
It's okay.

118
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,030
Don't treat me like an outsider.

119
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm also part of the family, am I not?

120
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,310
You're right.

121
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,350
Oh right.

122
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,550
Sheng Sheng told me

123
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,710
you like the lean meat.

124
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,420
This should suit your tastebuds.

125
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,710
She also said that
you're allergic to lamb.

126
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,790
So I didn't include that in today's menu.

127
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,110
The other dishes here

128
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,310
are also your favourite.

129
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,350
Here. Try this.

130
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,710
Thank you, Uncle Yu.

131
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,180
Sheng Sheng. I think we are

132
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,910
back to friends now?

133
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,990
I still prefer being friends with you.

134
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,030
It feels better this way.

135
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,550
Actually, I'm curious

136
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,740
about the reason

137
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,630
you didn't give me that love letter.

138
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,590
I've forgotten.

139
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,710
Did you really forget

140
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,270
or do you have another reason?

141
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,510
What do you mean?

142
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,590
Nothing.

143
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,190
The friend we met

144
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,070
at the television station the other day

145
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,830
was Jiang Yi, wasn't it?

146
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,950
You took the initiative to hold my hand

147
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,870
because you had a fight with him?

148
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,270
You're right.

149
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,470
After that, you brought his sister

150
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,390
to the Emergency Room at the hospital.

151
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,350
I was just helping out.

152

bring this up suddenly?

156
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,270
I saw a link.

157
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,180
So I'm just asking.

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,790
any trouble,

173
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,630
remember to look for me.

174
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,900
I'll get going.

175
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,990
It's not easy as a doctor.

176
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,950
He had to leave immediately

177
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,670
after getting a call

178
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,350
from the hospital.

179
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,470
Your life as a celebrity

180
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,510
is busy too, isn't it?

181
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,510
Yes.

182
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,150
At times when we're really busy,

183
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,950
it's just like going for war.

184
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,550
Father. Mother.

185
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,510
We've to go now.

186
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,060
Drop me off

187
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,830
since we're going in the same way.

188
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,750
I almost forgot.

189
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,790
Uncle Yu. Aunt Yu.

190
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,900
Thank you for having me here today.

191
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,780
You're welcome.

192
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,750
Please drop by often.

193
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,430
Drop by anytime.

194
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,470
I'm happy

195
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,430
you like my cooking.

196
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,670
Alright. Thank you, Uncle Yu.

197
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,630
We'll get going now.

198
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,150
Go ahead.

199
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,470
Be careful while you drive.

200
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,190
Be careful.

201
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,110
To be honest,

202
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,150
I knew it all along that

203
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,830
Sheng Sheng and Xiao Shen
wouldn't make it far.

204
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,310
Why?

205
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,150
Sheng Sheng has been reading

206
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,110
so many love novels,

207
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,260
movies and dramas.

208
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,950
But throughout the time

209
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,230
they were together,

210
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,590
she was quiet

211
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,190
and unenthusiastic.

212
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,180
They don't look like a couple.

213
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,190
You're just acting like
a genius in retrospect.

214
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,630
Yu. Look at Jiang Yi.

215
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,630
He comes here all the time.

216
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,070
Did he fall for Sheng Sheng?

217
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,790
You think too much.

218
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,350
He just likes my cooking.

219
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,510
Brother.

220
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,790
I've something

221
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,270
to report to you.

222
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:22,990
What is it?

223
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,180
Just now,

224
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,150
senior told me

225
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,430
a bunch of weird stuff.

226
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,270
I think,

227
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,070
he found out something.

228
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,510
What did he find out?

229
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,980
Our relationship

230
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,590
or the body switch.

231
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,590
Any of them.

232
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,110
Earlier on, he even asked Tong Tong

233
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,950
if I was acting weird

234
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,670
after the incident

235
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,590
in the elevator.

236
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,910
Is he someone you can trust?

237
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,710
Yes.

238
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,070
In that case, you've nothing to worry about.

239
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,910
You're right.

240
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,510
He's a rational person.

241
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,230
Moreover, he wouldn't harm me.

242
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,990
Yes. He's very rational.

243
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,110
Through his rational analysis,

244
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,870
he told me and Tong Hua

245
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,870
very seriously

246
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,270
that you like Pei Jia Shu.

247
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,670
He's indeed clueless

248
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,190
when it comes to relationships.

249
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,710
So that was the reason

250
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,030
you didn't give him the love letter?

251
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,190
No.

252
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,350
What was it then?

253
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,380
We were still students at that time.

254
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,910
We should focus on our studies.

255
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,460
You even wrote a love letter.
Are you kidding me?

256
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,160
Do you really want to know why?

257
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,070
I'm all ears.

258
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,460
Okay.

259
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,660
It's not a long story anyway.

260
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,350
I'll tell you now.

261
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,750
Senior.

262
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,310
Senior.

263
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,270
[Ever since that incident,]

264
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,230
[for a very long time,]

265
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,510
I couldn't forget him farting

266
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,470
everytime I see him.

267
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,230
That went on for quite a long time.

268
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,790
Everytime I see him,

269
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,950
I felt as if that smell

270
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,310
still lingered around him.

271
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,420
So, after that incident,

272
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,550
I just couldn't like him anymore.

273
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,230
It was because of

274
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,500
such an insignificant reason that

275
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,030
you stopped liking him?

276
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,790
My fantasy was ruined.

277
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,070
I was too naive.

278
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,310
I thought

279
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,550
prince charming wouldn't fart.

280
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,030
Thank goodness

281
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,220
we don't have this problem between us.

282
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,990
In your eyes,

283
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,430
my image

284
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,420
is long shattered anyway.

285
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,030
No, it isn't.

286
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,430
You're the most perfect one

287
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,190
in my heart.

288
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,310
I thought that was Pei Jia Shu.

289
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,630
That's why I'm thinking

290
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,590
we should break this image.

291
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,870
How should we do that?

292
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,870
Brother.

293
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,510
I want to interview Pei Jia Shu.

294
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,750
Can you do me a favour

295
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,950
and go back to work?

296
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,630
Now I see what you're trying to pull.

297
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,710
Can you do that for me?

298
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,710
No.

299
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,190
Please. Can you do that for me?

300
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,990
You're right.

301
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,870
I should make it clear

302
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,190
between love and work.

303
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,190
I'll figure out something

304
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,940
on my own.

305
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,550
Stop the car there.

306
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,830
Tong Tong wants me

307
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,470
to grab some crispy dates at Bestore.

308
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,270
Okay.

309
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,620
Wait here for me.

310
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,910
Good evening.

311
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,150
Welcome to Bestore.

312
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,630
Are you here to buy some snacks?

313
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,460
You've come to the right place.

314
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,430
We sell many

315
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,110
high-end snacks in our store.

316
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,310
Feel free to choose what you like.

317
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:21,950
Okay.

318
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,510
I want some crispy dates

319
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,590
and dried mangoes.

320
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:24,990
Okay.

321
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,510
Okay.

322
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,230
We have

323
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,710

325
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,230

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,830
you'll stand a chance

327
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,350
to win snacks in our lucky draw.

328
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,350
No, thank you.

329
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,310
I'm already lucky

330
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,310
because of someone.

331
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,230
There's no harm in
receiving more luck.

332
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,150
Here you go.

333
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,430
Thank you.

334
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,150
[You are in love with the greatest hero]

335
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,670
Here are your items.

336
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,590
I'm sorry.

337
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,470
Tell me.

338
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,470
Why did you leave me?

339
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,470
You're drunk. Go home.

340
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,510
I won't let you go.

341
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,390
Let go of me.

342
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,100
I won't.

343
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,790
I won't let you go.

344
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,420
Let go of me.

345
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,230
I don't want to.

346
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,750
Who are you?

347
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,790
You must be drunk.

348
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,430
It hurts.

349
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,190
Are you awake now?

350
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,790
Yes, I am.

351
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,750
Get lost now.

352
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,550
Are you okay?

353
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,470
I'm fine.

354
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,150
Why didn't you wear a mask?

355
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,340
I was in a hurry so I forgot.

356
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,830
Let's get in the car.

357
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,070
We shouldn't get caught.

358
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,860
Let's go.

359
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,300
Jiang Yi.

360
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,070
It's really Jiang Yi.

361
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,390
Can I have your autograph?

362
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,510
Who is she?

363
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,670
I'm also Jiang Yi's fan.

364
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,990
He helped me just now.

365
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,940
Can you take a photo of us?

366
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,510
Sure.

367
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,630
I'll help you to take a photo.

368
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,710
Please help us after that.

369
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,270
Jiang Yi.

370
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,710
Can I take a photo with you?

371
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,430
Jiang Yi is so handsome and warm hearted.

372
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,980
Okay.

373
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,510
Thank you.

374
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,070
Thank you.

375
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,870
Three, two and one!

376
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,980
Please help us now.

377
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,140
Quick!

378
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,110
Take a few more.

379
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,670
Thank you.

380
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,910
Here's your pen.

381
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,350
Brother.

382
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,110
You should get going.

383
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,110
There're many students coming this way.

384
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,220
You won't get to leave later.

385
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,270
Alright. Thank you.

386
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,110
You should get going.

387
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,030
Go home and rest earlier.

388
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,950
Okay.

389
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,350
Look at this.

390
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,790
He is so handsome.

391
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,290
[Comrade Jiang]

392
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,470
[Stay where you are.]

393
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,910
[I'll turn back to pick you up.]

394
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,870
You don't need to.

395
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,590
Let's not create more troubles.

396
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,390
I'm just a station away from home.

397
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,790
I'll walk.

398
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,910
[Okay.]

399
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,510
[Be careful.]

400
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,030
I'll talk to you when I'm home.

401
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,030
Goodbye.

402
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,110
[A meaningful couple photo.]

403
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,550
[Treasure it well.]

404
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,030
You're home?

405
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,790
I just arrived.

406
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,550
Are you mad?

407
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,510
No.

408
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,910
It was unexpected.

409
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,860
Luckily I've prepared myself for it.

410
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,180
I'll stay away from you

411
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,310
in public.

412
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,710
In urgent situations,

413
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,790
I'll act as your fan.

414
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,150
I'm sorry.

415
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,830
It's hard to be

416
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,870
in a relationship with me.

417
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,350
Moreover,

418
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,590
accidents can happen unexpectedly.

419
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,030
I'm not afraid of troubles.

420
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,710
So,

421
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,310
don't burden yourself emotionally.

422
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,590
Well,

423
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,390
I was thinking of

424
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,910
compensating you though.

425
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,710
You can do that.

426
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,110
What is it?

427
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,390
Pei Jia Shu will be at home tomorrow.

428
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,540
Do you want to come over?

429
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,230
Sure!

430
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,590
I love you so much, brother.

431
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,460
Come in.

432
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,870
What's wrong?

433
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,910
You want to sleep with me tonight?

434
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,510
Sleep with you?

435
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,070
Well, it's possible.

436
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,470
Come here.

437
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,790
You look like you need a favour.

438
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,590
Go ahead. What is it?

439
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,510
Actually,

440
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,870
here is the thing.

441
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,300
I'll be going to the villa

442
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,430
to interview Shu Shu tomorrow.

443
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,190
I want you to accompany me.

444
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,350
Why do you want me to accompany you?

445
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,710
Don't you know me well?

446
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,910
I'm just bluntly bold.

447
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,830
I can handle the interviews
with other people.

448
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,550
But when it comes to Shu Shu,

449
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,190
I'll lose my mind.

450
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,150
He even thought that
I was a hater previously.

451
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,860
When it comes to strategies,
I have to count on you.

452
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,470
We have to work together

453
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,030
to make a formidable combination

454
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,670
so we will win in every battle.

455
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,630
You have a point.

456
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,510
But I don't feel like seeing him.

457
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,030
Don't feel like that.

458
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,750
I've prepared everything.

459
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,510
You need not worry about anything.

460
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,390
You just have to stand by me.

461
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,070
No.

462
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,630
Isn't your boyfriend there?

463
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,150
Get him to stand by you.

464
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,630
Speaking about my boyfriend,

465
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,470
if you were to go with me,

466
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,700
he might give you something in return.

467
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,830
I need to avoid getting involved
with my besties' boyfriend.

468
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,190
It's just about getting his autograph
and receiving some gifts.

469
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,350
What is there to avoid?

470
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,470
You can send them to me instead.

471
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,590
Wouldn't that do?

472
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,190
You have a point.

473
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,150
Yu Sheng Sheng.

474
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,790
I know you well.

475
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,830
Tell me. What's going on?

476
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,870
Well.

477
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,070
Jiang Yi told Jia Shu that

478
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,310
we wanted to do an interview with him.

479
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,710
He agreed to meet up with us

480
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,070
because he wanted you to come.

481
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,910
He

482
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,020
requested that?

483
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,390
I was afraid that if I told you the truth,

484
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,310
you will rebel

485
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,790
and refuse to go even more.

486
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,950
In that case,

487
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,550
I'll go meet with him.

488
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,750
So you buy this.

489
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,590
Great. That's a deal.

490
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,910
You can't change your mind.

491
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,550
I'll go prepare

492
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,590
something special now.

493
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,230
What is it?

494
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,710
You'll find out tomorrow.

495
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,350
It's a done deal.

496
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,550
You can't change your mind.

497
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,350
Goodnight.

498
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,030
I love you.

499
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,150
Hello.

500
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,070
We meet again.

501
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,110
Hello.

502
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,510
It was a special situation the other day.

503
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,750
Let's treat it like

504
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,110
it never happened before.

505
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,980
That's right.

506
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,270
The both of you should

507
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,430
make a fresh start.

508
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,470
Get to know each other again.

509
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,510
I agree.

510
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,020
Come in.

511
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,830
Have some dried mangoes.

512
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,910
Here. Drink some water.

513
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,190
Thank you.

514
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,860
So, what is it

515
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,180
that you brought?

516
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,190
I was inspired by the presents

517
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,990
you gave me last time.

518
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,790
Everything inside this box

519
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,390
is related to Pei Jia Shu.

520
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,670
This is to prove that

521
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,150
I am a real fan.

522
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,150
I liked him since his first debut.

523
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,790
So did you come here for an interview

524
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,550
or to meet your idol?

525
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,190
I came for both.

526
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,780
Tong Tong.

527
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,190
You understand how I feel, don't you?

528
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,790
No, I don't.

529
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,270
How could you not understand?

530
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,350
You've collected many items

531
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,910
related to Jiang Yi,

532
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,830
just like me, haven't you?

533
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,470
You've promised not to mention about this.

534
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,070
I just want you to

535
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,190
help me prove that

536
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,430
what I did

537
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,590
is normal of a fangirl.

538
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,590
Just in case my boyfriend gets jealous.

539
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,870
Oh heavens.

540
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,870
I shouldn't be here

541
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,830
with the both of you.

542
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,710
It's a double blow to me.

543
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,590
Alright.

544
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,870
I'll control myself.

545
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,510
Did you tell Jia Shu that

546
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,630
we're here?

547
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,190
Yes.

548
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,670
It's been half an hour.

549
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,830
Why isn't he showing up?

550
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,710
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

551
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,590
I apologise for

552
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,430
letting you wait so long.

553
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,470
It's okay.

554
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:33,910
We have no plans

555
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,550
this whole noon anyway.

556
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,310
Jia Shu.

557
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,670
This is the outline for the interview.

558
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,990
Please take a look.

559
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,630
If you don't feel like

560
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,710
answering any questions there,

561
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,510
you can skip them.

562
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,030
You're also free to add on

563
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,230
anything else that you wish to say.

564
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,350
It's not good.

565
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,150
Which part of it?

566
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,870
It's not about the questions here.

567
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,190
I'm saying

568
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,590
it's not good to let you interview me.

569
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,710
Jia Shu.

570
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,110
I'm really your fan.

571
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,790
I even brought many collections

572
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,910
about you.

573
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,990
Take a look at them.

574
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,150
I believe that

575
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,950
you're my real fan.

576
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,270
But because of that,

577
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,430
it's not a good idea.

578
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,510
I was hoping

579
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,470
you can write about me

580
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,150
objectively.

581
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,150
I can do that.

582
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,390
I think it'll be hard for you.

583
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,710
If Sheng Sheng can't do that,

584
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,630
let me do it.

585
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,310
That's a good idea.

586
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,230
My former classmate.

587
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,990
Do you think

588
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,150
you can be fair in writing about me?

589
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,550
What do you mean?

590
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,590
You came to find me a few days ago.

591
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:45,910
To be honest,

592
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,350
I was quite happy.

593
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,830
But after thinking about it again,

594
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,220
there's something wrong.

595
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,980
Your best friend was the one

596
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,860
who knew Jiang Yi in the first place.

597
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,590
You thought she's in love with a playboy.

598
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,230
In the end,

599
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,470
the first person you thought about

600
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,580
was me.

601
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,990
That's heartbreaking.

602
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,230
I acted rashly the other day.

603
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,550
I already apologised to you.

604
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,710
Because Sheng Sheng

605
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,070
is indeed your fan,

606
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,550
so I...

607
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,830
I believe that is not all of it.

608
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,510
Although I have no idea why,

609
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,710
but I've always had a feeling that
you have a prejudice against me.

610
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,990
Eventhough we're former classmates.

611
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,510
However,

612
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,470
you hid that from your best friend

613
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,140
for so many years.

614
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,670
Also,

615
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,750
when our classmate got married last time,

616
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,110
you were the bridesmaid.

617
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,270
But something came up suddenly,

618
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,990
so you were absent for the wedding dinner.

619
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,470
If I've guessed it right,

620
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,030
you didn't show up

621
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,790
because of me, right?

622
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,030
Very well then.

623
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,340
Seems like you're admitting it now.

624
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,670
You were the one who

625
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,270
wanted them to come over

626
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,190
to discuss the interview.

627
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,830
Why are you

628
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,150
talking about this now?

629
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,460
I need to get a better
understanding about this

630
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,950
to work well with them.

631
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,300
I've considered it.

632
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,390
You and Le Yi

633
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,590
have done these interviews before.

634
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,390
I want to try something
different this time.

635
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,460
Former classmate.

636
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,510
Why don't you

637
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,510
write a feature article about me?

638
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,790
Feature article?

639
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,150
Yes.

640
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,270
Let's try a different approach.

641
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,430
Since you have some misunderstandings

642
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,310
and prejudices towards me,

643
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,270
I'll give you chances

644
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:20,990
to have close contact

645
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,350
with my work and life.

646
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,870
You can then know me more wholesomely.

647
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,430
Your article about me

648
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,550
will be more truthful.

649
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,870
This is a good idea.

650
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,590
It's more solid than a personal interview.

651
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,030
Brother.

652
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,870
Should I write one for you too?

653
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,340
No, thank you.

654
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,270
You're right.

655
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,150
It won't be objective since
I'm your girlfriend.

656
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,190
If I'm not careful,

657
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,910
it will cause problems.

658
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,030
What do you think, former classmate?

659
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,430
Is my suggestion interesting?

660
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,470
Yes.

661
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,390
But I'll need to consider.

662
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,670
What's left to consider?

663
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,390
It's okay.

664
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,110
Take your time.

665
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,470
Let me know your decision anytime.

666
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:10,870
Should we add each other as friends

667
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,670
on Wechat?

668
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,230
Sure.

669
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,110
I'll add yours too.

670
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,270
You don't have to.

671
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,140
You're right.

672
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,390
Add Tong Tong will do.

673
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,430
If I had known earlier that
Shu Shu's target was you,

674
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,950
I wouldn't have carried

675
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,750
this evidence box around.

676
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,510
If I had known earlier that he wanted to
expose me in front of everyone,

677
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,190
I wouldn't have gone there.

678
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,190
What do you think?

679
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,590
We gained quite a lot this time,
didn't we?

680
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:48,710
We got to know

681
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,830
the other side of Shu Shu.

682
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,230
His logical analysis ability

683
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,310
is so strong.

684
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,870
Moreover, the idea that he suggested

685
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,470
was better than

686
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,150
doing a personal interview.

687
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,790
You should seriously consider it.

688
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,230
I've seriously considered it.

689
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,750
He just wants to seek revenge.

690
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,150
That's not true.

691
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,350
He's very kind-hearted.

692
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,060
That's your prejudice against him.

693
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,380
You're the one

694
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,990
who is siding him now
because you're his fan.

695
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,750
No matter how I think about it,

696
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,990
there's only one reason

697
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,310
he's being so proactive

698
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,070
in giving me a so-called good opportunity.

699
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,830
Are you really planning to reject him?

700
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,670
It's such a good opportunity.

701
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,870
Give it a thought.

702
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,510
Please give it a thought.

703
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,430
I'll take a shower

704
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,910
and have a good sleep first.

705
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,230
We'll talk about work

706
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,070
tomorrow.

707
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,590
Okay?

708
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,150
Goodbye.

709
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,230
Remember to give it a thought.

710
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,790
Okay.

711
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,510
Think about it seriously.

712
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,030
I can't believe you got this photo.

713
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,390
I'll hit the business target again

714
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,630
for this month.

715
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,990
Curly, you're such a capable person.

716
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,030
It's not a big deal.

717
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,190
I'm just trying to make a living.

718
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,070
You're just like a hunter

719
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,270
who can bear loneliness.

720
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,510
Once you've got your eyes on your prey,

721
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,590
you make no mistakes.

722
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,070
That is your capability.

723
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,190
Oh right.

724
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,030
Did you get any news from your colleagues

725
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,790
about what I told you before

726
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,630
regarding Jiang Yi?

727
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,190
Yes.

728
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,670
They have no idea about it.

729
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,700
But it's weird.

730
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,430
If they claim

731
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,870
to have no contact with each other,

732
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,150
I wouldn't believe it too.

733
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,190
During the meeting last week,

734
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,670
they were certain that

735
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,550
they would get to interview Pei Jia Shu.

736
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,470
Didn't you like

737
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,700
crispy dates the most?

738
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,230
What's with all these jerkies?

739
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,950
My boyfriend said

740
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,070
these jerkies are chewy.

741
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,190
It's especially delicious.

742
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,270
You've really lost your sanity

743
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,380
after having a boyfriend.

744
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,150
Since you're unhappy, I won't buy them.

745
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,470
Just feed me with sweets
and let me grow chubbier,

746
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,110
Let me get dumped by my boyfriend.

747
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,390
Look at you being all dramatic again.

748
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,590
But the snacks in Bestore

749
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,670
are made from healthy ingredient,

750
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,950
they won't make us gain weight.

751
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,670
But you have to be careful of

752
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,870
gaining a type of weight.

753
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,870
What is it?

754
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,350
Weight gain due to too much love.

755
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,910
They are...

756
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,150
Speaking of the devils.

757
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,430
Those two ladies there

758
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,750
are my colleagues.

759
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,270
They always buy snacks

760
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,230
at Bestore.

761
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,990
What are their names?

762
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,030
The one on the left is Yu Sheng Sheng.

763
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,660
The one on the right is Tong Hua.

764
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,230
Previously,

765
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,110
their account almost got terminated.

766
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,590
But somehow

767
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,470
they got to interview Jiang Yi.

768
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,830
I heard

769
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,670
Tong Hua came from

770
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,870
a rich family.

771
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,990
I'm not sure if it's true.

772
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,590
I was wondering

773
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,350
if they have any special connection.

774
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,390
But I think it's not true.

775
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,630
Why would she choose to work in this line
if she is already rich?

776
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,390
What about that Yu Sheng Sheng?

777
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,790
Yu Sheng Sheng.

778
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,500
She was the one who interviewed Jiang Yi?

779
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,070
Yes.

780
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,790
Jiang Yi didn't show up
for the first interview.

781
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,350
Later on, she got trapped

782
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,750
in the elevator with Jiang Yi.

783
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,510
She was so unlucky.

784
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,150
You're saying that

785
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,390
she was together with Jiang Yi

786
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,590
when the elevator incident happened?

787
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,230
Look at how pathetic

788
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,510
our job is.

789
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,430
People were only concerned
about the celebrities.

790
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,270
I'll get going.

791
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,230
Zhi Xiao, I'm leaving now.

792
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,790
Goodbye.

793
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,350
Goodbye.

794
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,510
Are you both going to

795
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,750
work overtime till very late today?

796
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,790
No.

797
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,150
We're leaving soon.

798
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,550
When will you upload the interview

799
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,590
with Pei Jia Shu?

800
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,270
My niece is a big fan of him.

801
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,510
We're not in a hurry to upload it.

802
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,740
We've a lot of back-up articles.

803
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,550
Even if he's a big star,
he has to wait in line too.

804
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,550
I'm so envious of you.

805
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,070
Look at your confidence
for having the resources.

806
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,670
Oh right.

807
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,670
Why didn't I see your boyfriend sending

808
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,430
flowers and fruits to the office anymore?

809
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,430
That I've learnt from you.

810
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,860
We have to stay low profile.

811
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,870
Continue with your work. I'm leaving now.

812
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,110
Okay. Goodbye.

813
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,140
Zhang Zhi Xiao likes to

814
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,310
have small talks with you recently.

815
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,110
I bet she still hasn't give up.

816
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,390
She wants to dig out my secret.

817
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,590
I don't want to be

818
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,470
on bad terms with her.

819
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,190
I'm trying to find out

820
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,380
who took those photos of Jiang Yi.

821
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,030
I always had a feeling that

822
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,910
someone is following Jiang Yi

823
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,310
and pulling tricks on him.

824
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,750
Something is off.

825
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,070
This is the price you pay

826
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,990
for dating a big celebrity.

827
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,670
Didn't you say

828
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,870
those photos didn't mean anything?

829
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,030
So don't worry too much.

830
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,430
Just be careful next time.

831
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,150
Brother. Do you have any plans tonight?

832
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,710
[I need to meet up with the director.]

833
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,140
[You miss me?]

834
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,310
Other than working,

835
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,430
I miss you all the time.

836
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,550
That's wrong.

837
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,630
I miss you even when I'm working.

838
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,910
Two days later,

839
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,070
I'll be back.

840
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,510
I hope time passes fast.

841
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,150
After being together with you,

842
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,830
I'm starting to feel like

843
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,070
this is a long distance relationship.

844
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,550
So where should we go

845
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,430
for our date this weekend?

846
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,550
I haven't thought about it.

847
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,390
I'm already very happy

848
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,910
to be with you.

849
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,550
You're such a sweet talker.

850
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,550
I feel the same way too.

851
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,470
Is Jiang Da Chuan feeling teased

852
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,830
by our conversation?

853
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,670
No.

854
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,670
He's already immuned to it.

855
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,110
I'm about to reach my destination.

856
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,270
Stay busy first.

857
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,390
Let's plan ahead

858
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,510
for our date this weekend.

859
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,710
Okay. Goodbye.

860
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,670
Goodbye.

861
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,070
I'll be frank with you.

862
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,270
Many celebrities came to meet me before.

863
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,030
Some of them are like Jiang Yi

864
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,030
who is popular in other fields

865
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,510
but wishes to focus on acting

866
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,270
as a transition.

867
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,190
That's for sure.

868
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,510
Early this year,

869
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,270
your movie won awards
in International Film Festival.

870
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,950
It's also strongly recommended by

871
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,990
local film critics.

872
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,230
Everyone must be looking forward

873
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,110
to work with you.

874
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,550
Those who came to see me

875
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,310
said the same too.

876
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,550
So...

877
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,350
The reason behind not hiring celebrities

878
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,070
as your actors

879
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,230
is your concern about their acting skills?

880
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,550
I think you've misunderstood.

881
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,470
Of course I hope to

882
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,470
expand the influence of my movie

883
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,910
through celebrities' popularity.

884
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,990
But that is not up to me.

885
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,110
Half of those who came to me

886
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,390
turned down the opportunity

887
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,180
when we discussed about the pay.

888
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,070
Don't worry about this, Director Chen.

889
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,590
Jiang Yi and I both agree that

890
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,950
the pay is not

891
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,830
our main concern.

892
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,830
That's right.

893
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,670
That's not all though.

894
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,710
After reading the script,

895
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,910
the other half of them turned me down too.

896
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,030
Why?

897
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,950
I've read the movie synopsis

898
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,750
you sent to me.

899
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,580
I think

900
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,670
it's a highly valuable

901
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,550
and insightful story.

902
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,430
Most of them think

903
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,550
the persona is not cool enough

904
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,830
and the personality
of the role is unpleasing.

905
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,790
They're afraid of losing fans.

906
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,270
Also, they're afraid of being styled in

907
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,430
dirt and dust covering
half of their faces.

908
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,110
This will affect their commercial value.

909
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,510
I think they should have

910
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,150
prepared themselves earlier for this.

911
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,070
That's right.

912
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,950
So they would usually suggest that I

913
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,830
make some changes to the script

914
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,230
or they would bring
a different script to me

915
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:48,990
and ask for collaboration.

916
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,910
If that's the case,

917
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,110
I would rather have

918
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,030
an ordinary person to star in my movie,

919
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,550
just like my previous movie.

920
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,190
Director Chen.

921
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,390
I understand everything

922
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,350
you've mentioned.

923
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,470
But to me,

924
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,910
I only work for the creativity.

925
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,270
In that case,

926
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,030
we can further discuss

927
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,870
about this.

928
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,390
I've watched your acting.

929
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,620
You're quite talented.

930
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,500
Thank you.

931
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,510
What do you think

932
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,310
about this role?

933
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,460
I think

934
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,470
he's simple and honest.

935
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,870
You're not done yet?

936
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,030
I'm thinking about a plan

937
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,430
to make it more perfect.

938
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,750
Our account has

939
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,030
been through a lot these two months.

940
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,630
I have to work harder

941
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,030
to make it stable.

942
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,790
I'll refill some water for you.

943
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,670
Thank you.

944
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,990
Go to bed.

945
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,990
Don't bother about me.

946
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,630
I'll discuss with you tomorrow morning.

947
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,310
Sheng Sheng.

948
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,350
If I don't go for the interview
with Pei Jia Shu,

949
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,390
will you be mad at me?

950
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,710
Of course not.

951
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,980
But anyhow, it's a good opportunity

952
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,590
that can help our account greatly.

953
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,310
Don't overthink it.

954
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:19,950
If you chose not to go for it,

955
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,990
you must have your own reasons.

956
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,460
I won't make it hard on you.

957
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,750
We can just forget about it.

958
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,710
Moreover, you've always
taken the heavier load

959
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,710
than me

960
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,110
in our partnership.

961
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,150
You could have chosen
to live an easier life.

962
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,910
If all fails,
just inherit your family business

963
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,950
and live that rich daughter's life.

964
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,830
I don't want to do that.

965
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,230
I like this job.

966
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,380
Our account

967
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,910
gets to continue because

968
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,710
you came up

969
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,630
with the opportunity

970
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,510
during Jiang Yi's birthday party.

971
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,270
You have a huge contribution in this.

972
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,270
Stop flattering me with words.

973
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,310
I had to put you on the line for that.

974
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,750
You should change your perspective.

975
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,190
Little Galaxy put Jiang Yi

976
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,100
on the line.

977
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,470
Forget it.

978
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,030
I'll do Pei Jia Shu's interview.

979
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,070
Aren't you afraid

980
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,950
he will seek revenge?

981
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,750
Even if he does,

982
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,790
I'll hold it in

983
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,070
for the sake of work.

984
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,110
Don't be hard on yourself.

985
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,350
I'm not.

986
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,510
After figuring it out,

987
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,750
I'm enlightened.

988
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,630
I'll support you then.

989
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,710
I'm hungry.

990
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,270
Do you want instant noodles?

991
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,150
Let's share it.

992
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:26,830
Okay.
