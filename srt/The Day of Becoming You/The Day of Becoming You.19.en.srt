You just want water?

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,870
My assistant

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,950
can buy food for you.

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,030
No, thanks.

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,870
Are other members out?

33
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,700
Le Yi is out of town.

34
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,910
Jiang Yi might not

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,830
come back at night.

36
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,500
I thought you wear masks

37
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,070
due to face allergy.

38
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,830
You're as beautiful

39

here for old times' sake?

42

No.

43

To discuss

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,950
cooperation?

45
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,860
You should've come sooner.

46

We are ex-classmates.

I'll gladly help you.

Moreover, back then,

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,710
you liked me.

50
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,710
No.

51
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,510
No?

52
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,470
Of course not.

53
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,830
You misunderstood.

54
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,620
Maybe

55
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,870
in junior two.

56
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,190
Not junior two,

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,910
but senior three.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,030
Yes,

59
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,310
around that time.

60
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,110
I am here today

62
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,590
Yu Sheng Sheng?

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,470
Yes,

64
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,470
she is your huge fan.

65
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,270
We are besties.

What happened?

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,190
I wish

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,270
you'd leave her alone.

69
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,150
Let her give up.

70
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,830
I'll

71
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,860
pretend I don't know.

72
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:39,990

73
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,380
I don't understand

75

Do you like her?

76

No.

77
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,830
Why did you kiss her?

78
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,550
I didn't.

79
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,750
Admit it!

80
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,550
Why would I kiss her?

81
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,030
She's...

82
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,670
She's what?

Go to bed early.

That's okay. I'll give you a ride.

89

You don't have to.

90
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,870
Tong Tong,

91
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,710
why are you here?

92
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,030
Yu Sheng Sheng, you lied to me.

93
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,750
Let me explain.

94
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,630
Stand there!

95
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,230
Still want to lie?

96
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,910
On my way here,

97
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,790
I thought I'll tell you

98
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,870
the truth when I go home.

99
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,670
She did say that.

100
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,260
My ex-classmate,

101
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,390
you wrongly accused me.

102
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,710
Classmate?

103

Yes.

Senior high tablemates.

105
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,030
You didn't know?

106
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,030
Only one year.

107
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,230
You lied to me also.

108
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,990
I...

109
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,300
Two

110
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,230
frenemies!

111
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,750
Shut up!

112
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,910
Let's settle this between us,

113
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,990
and not look like fools.

114
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,270
Okay, I admit that

115
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,310
the friend

116
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,150
I told you before

117
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,910
was actually myself.

118

Why didn't you tell me?

119
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,190
I don't want

120
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,350
any link with Pei Jia shu.

121
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,270
You were a fangirl.

122
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,750
You'd beg me to introduce

123
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,830
had you known.

124
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,590
I'll be stuck forever.

125
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,430
I know what Pei Jia Shu

126
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,380
is capable of.

127
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,030
I feared you'd get hurt

128
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,460
if you liked him.

129
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,590
All these years,

130
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,740
how did you conceal it?

131
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,990
I got used to it.

132
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,110
I taunted you

133
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,350
for being a fan.

134
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,430
No conflict.

135
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,430
I simply forgot.

136
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,830
Treat it like nothing.

137
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,150
Why do you come here

138
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,390
today?

139
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,110
I saw

140
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,830
your post

141
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,830
accidentally.

142
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,030
What post?

143
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,590
You got drunk.

144
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,750
Prince charming kissed you.

145
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,230
He didn't confess,

146
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,190
but said

147
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,910
you're his joy.

148
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,230
It sounded like

149
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,470
what Pei Jia shu would do.

150
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,990
You really don't know

151
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,180
your prince charming.

152
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,590
Shut up.

153
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,830
So, you assumed

154
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,350
he played with my feelings,

155
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,990
and had it out with him.

156
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,230
What else?

157
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,990
I disgraced myself

158
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,510
in front of him.

159
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,430
Tong Tong,

160
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,140
you are my good sister.

161
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,230
Behave yourself.

162
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,030
Are you and Jiang Yi dating?

163
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,460
For how long?

164
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,470
Day two.

165
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,350
Really?

166
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,230
I swear.

167
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,390
You can verify the posting time.

168
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,390
So, you've kissed?

169
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,510
Tong Tong.

170
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,310
Don't talk.

171
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,950
Leave me alone.

172
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,830
Yu Sheng Sheng

173
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,790
is really my fan.

174
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,790
No. She is a fair-weather fan.

175
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,750
Don't be jealous.

176
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,710
Your girlfriend

177
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,550
has good taste.

178
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,870
Your old friend

179
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,190
has good taste. She's my fan.

180
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,430
She liked me before.

181
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,510
Sorry

182
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,270
for disturbing.

183
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,790
I'm leaving.

184
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,830
It's okay.

185
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,150
I'll send you.

186
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,430
Thanks.

187
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,390
I drove.

188
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,110
Just send Sheng Sheng.

189
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,270
Contact me anytime.

190
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,430
Keep in touch.

191
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,510
I answered what she asked.

192
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,340
I said what was to be said.

193
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,790
And she said?

194
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,910
Nothing.

195
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,590
But

196
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,750
what an attitude!

197
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,580
She drove home

198
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,630
without me.

199
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,430
Didn't she say

200
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,350
she is a wise fan?

201
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,270
She didn't treat me as her boyfriend.

202
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,590
She's overreacting.

203
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,790
Before this happened,

204
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,950
she could be sensible,

205
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,310
but

206
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,470
she witnessed what happened

207
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,310
beside her.

208
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,190
She needs time

209
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,110
to digest it.

210
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,350
Sorry.

211
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,660
I hurt you both.

212
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,390
Hey,

213
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,180
you underestimate

214
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,310
our sisterly love.

215
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,310
We sleep and forget

216
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,260
our quarrels.

217
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,550
Relax.

218
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,390
[Unlocked].

219
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,110
Tong Tong.

220
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,350
Good night.

221
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,590
Okay, I get it.

222
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,390
Don't worry.

223
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,470
We are fine.

224
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,070
Good.

225
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,670
But I still want to use

226
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,790
my ace in the hole.

227
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,910
Are you sure about that?

228
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,030
[Anyway, I won't lie to
Tong Tong anymore.]

229
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,870
Up to you.

230
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,270
I absolutely trust

231
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,430
whoever you trust.

232
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,430
Talk later.

233
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,470
Bye bye.

234
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,430
Bye bye.

235
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,230
Tong Tong, breakfast is ready.

236
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,230
Are you up?

237
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,590
No?

238
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,510
I'm up. Come in.

239
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,070
Tong Tong.

240
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,740
Are you still mad?

241
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,790
You can hit me.

242
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,430
I swear I won't hit back.

243
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,830
I'm not mad.

244
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,030
Last night you didn't

245
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,110
give me a ride.

246
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,310
I let you two

247
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,470
spend more time together.

248
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,390
But I want

249
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,150
to spend time with you.

250
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,510
Trashy!

251
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,590
Not mad anymore?

252
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,380
I already said I'm not mad,

253
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,190
but I'm a bit embarrassed,

254
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,590
and need to sort things out.

255
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,540
Sort what?

256
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,910
A fan's feelings.

257
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,670
Jiang Yi's stuff.

258
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,750
Help me remove

259
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,830
Jiang Yi's photos.

260
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,830
Do you want to unfollow?

261
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,670
No.

262
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,630
I feel it's inappropriate

263
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,390
to fill my room with your boyfriend's

264
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,430
face.

265
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,310
Well?

266
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,030
Yes, seems weird.

267
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,390
Do it yourself.

268
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,190
Tong Tong,

269
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,230
you left in a hurry last night.

270
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,230
Tell me how you and Jia Shu

271
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,310
were tablemates.

272
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,990
I don't want.

273
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,310
Do you want to hear

274
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,590
how Jiang Yi and I

275
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,510
become an item?

276
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,590
No.

277
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,630
Forget it.

278
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,630
Aren't you going to tell me?

279
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,790
I know you.

280
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,550
Ready?

281
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,830
What I'm about to say next

282
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,510
will be a little scary.

283
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,750
I should begin

284
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,150
with the story about

285
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,630
the elevator accident.

286
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,550
That was

287
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,990
the body-swapping process.

288
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,710
I swear on Jia Shu's stardom

289
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,870
that it was the truth.

290
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,950
Why don't you eat?

291
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,070
I have indigestion.

292
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,110
Don't you believe me?

293
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,190
I'll call Jiang Yi.

294
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,350
He can testify.

295
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,230
Stop!

296
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,830
I believe you.

297
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,390
Tong Tong, I'm really sorry.

298
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,310
I didn't mean to keep it secret.

299
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,350
It was

300
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,990
unbelievable!

301
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,110
Didn't I

302
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,310
tell you once?

303
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,630
So, you

304
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,510
sent the red packet

305
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,100
two days ago?

306
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,870
So, somehow,

307
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,790
I lived with Jiang Yi for several days.

308
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,470
He saw me without make-up

309
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,710
and shampooed hair,

310
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,700
bored, and picking nose?

311
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,870
I'm afraid that's correct.

312
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,750
I'll unfollow.

313
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,670
Want to

314
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,630
have a meal with

315
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,630
Jiang Yi?

316
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,710
Okay.

317
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,790
My bestie's boyfriend invites me.

318
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,750
Why should I reject?

319
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,710
Tong Tong, you are the best.

320
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,750
You always forgive

321
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,110
and forget.

322
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,390
Are you

323
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,350
really Yu Sheng Sheng now?

324
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,830
The genuine one.

325
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,060
Okay.

326
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,030
Now,

327
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,590
I formally congratulate you

328
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,190
for successfully catching
my prince charming.

329
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,070
Keep the goodies within us.

330
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,070
Why don't you date Jia Shu?

331
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,230
I'm okay with that.

332
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,950
Go to hell!

333
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,510
Don't get carried away.

334
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,950
Eat some more.

335
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,790
We are already late.

336
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,190
I'll pay for your salary deduction.

337
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,070
You call me right after deplaning.

338
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,190
Miss me?

339
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,670
Miss you.

340
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,030
How is Tong Hua?

341
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,550
I told her everything.

342
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,950
She believed me.

343
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,430
Feel confident now?

344
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,390
[Yes.]

345
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,270
Tong Tong said

346
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,270
when you two lived together,

347
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,190
you didn't stare or misbehave.

348
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,790
Praiseworthy, isn't it?

349
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,830
You set your bar low for

350
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,510
a boyfriend.

351
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,710
Don't be cocky.

352
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,590
Is

353
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,430
Jiang Da Chuan there?

354
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,350
Yes, beside me.

355
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,990
Let's not talk about it.

356
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,390
It's okay.

357
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,830
He can't hear you.

358
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,710
He'll be mad if he hears that.

359
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,950
He is, a bit.

360
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,310
Don't bully him.

361
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,870
He loves you very much.

362
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,510
He is jealous already.

363
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,710
[Talk later.]

364
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,830
[I'm going to work.]

365
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,710
[Stop now.]

366
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,630
Okay, bye.

367
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,110
What?

368
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,270
[Jiang Yi]

369
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,590
[and Cheng Le Yi's interview]

370
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,700
[was well written.]

371
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,030
[Not taken out of context.]

372
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,460
[Any interview with Jia Shu?]

373
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,780
[Add Jia Shu,]

374
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,270
[and complete the Small Galaxy.]

375
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,110
[Jia Shu deserves to be named too.]

376
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,620
[When will he get an interview?]

377
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,150
[I've waited for half a month.]

378
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,750
Tong Tong, look!

379
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,990
Many people asked for

380
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,900
Jia Shu's interview.

381
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,470
I saw that.

382
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,740
We should go for it.

383
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,430
Forget it.

384
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,820
What's there to interview?

385
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,790
All the answers are written on his face.

386
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,710
I think you're

387
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,990
prejudiced against him.

388
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,420
In senior high,

389
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,590
boys were like that.

390
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,500
Playful, didn't want to study,

391
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,150
inattentive, and clumsy.

392
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,830
That was so long ago.

393
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,470
People change.

394
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,790
I'm not prejudiced.

395
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,110
I'm allergic to him. Get it?

396
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,270
If I interview him,

397
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,950
will you object?

398
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,430
I

399
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,710
couldn't ask for more.

400
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,030
I'm not stupid.

401
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,190
I want traffic.

402
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,710
Fine.

403
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,270
The administration bought
nice new teabags.

404
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,270
Sister Zhi Xiao,

405
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,630
may I have one?

406
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,230
Thank you.

407
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,630
Last week you were

408
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,590
out gathering news.

409
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,110
Did you get anything?

410
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,550
Sigh,

411
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,790
forget it.

412
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,470
I was exhausted.

413
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,110
I didn't get anything solid.

414
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,030
Should have just bought it directly.

415
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,910
Yes,

416
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,390
let professional people
do professional jobs.

417
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,590
Sister Zhi Xiao,

418
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,990
I know you have

419
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,190
many resources.

420
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,750
Can you introduce me

421
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,510
when you can?

422
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,590
Sure.

423
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,350
Sister.

424
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,670
About Jiang Yi's love affair...

425
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,070
Any news?

426
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,270
No,

427
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,710
but

428
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,590
there is no smoke without fire.

429
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,020
Give me some leads,

430
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,150
so that I know

431
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,910
where to snoop.

432
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,710
Dig up his love affair?

433
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,710
Will Tong Hua agree?

434
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,750
If Jiang Yi is in love,

435
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,430
Tong Tong will unfollow.

436
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,630
When a fan becomes an anti-fan,
it's scary.

437
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,630
If I tell you,

438
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,950
you have to inform me

439
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,350
when you have any scoop.

440
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,590
Definitely.

441
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,590
My friend

442
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,710
took

443
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,750
Jiang Yi's photo.

444
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,590
What photo?

445
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,350
Him and a woman

446
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,150
outside Little Galaxy's villa

447
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,150
community area.

448
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,070
Why wasn't it published?

449
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,790
I didn't see the photo.

450
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,230
It

451
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,430
must be blurry.

452
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,590
He took it intuitively.

453
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,500
Okay,

454
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,230
I got it.

455
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,870
Don't forget our pact.

456
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,270
I know.

457
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,190
It must be that time.

458
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,190
The first time

459
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,070
I babysit Jiang Mo.

460
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,510
Her dad picked her up

461
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,270
and

462
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,670
quarrelled with Jiang Yi outside.

463
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,390
Were you there?

464
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,310
Yes.

465
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,710
Wasn't Jiang Yi photographed?

466
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,990
Zhang Zhi Xiao

467
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,710
happened to buy those photos.

468
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,150
I think the paparazzi

469
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,550
took a photo of Jiang Yi and I.

470
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,310
Because at that time

471
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,190
I was far away

472
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,070
and wearing a mask,

473
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,630
there's

474
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,670
nothing of value.

475
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,710
No wonder Zhang Zhi Xiao

476
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,310
has been friendly lately.

477
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,990
We interviewed

478
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,710
two

479
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,790
Little Galaxy members.

480
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,350
She wanted information.

481
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,270
We solved the case.

482
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,500
Fortunately, it was a false alarm.

483
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,350
To be honest,

484
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,670
I admire your courage

485
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,470
to fall in love with a big star.

486
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,590
I know it's not easy.

487
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,030
But when love is here,

488
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,070
just accept it.

489
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,070
Think about this.

490
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,900
We

491
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,950
have the same birth date.

492
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,550
We swapped bodies.

493
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,710
What is this?

494
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,470
Coincidence?

495
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,110
No!

496
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,230
This is fate.

497
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,710
Regardless of what awaits me
in the future,

498
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,950
let me love first.

499
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,470
Typical Yu Sheng Sheng.

500
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,150
I'll call

501
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,150
my boyfriend first,

502
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,110
and update him.

503
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,430
Detective Yu Sheng Sheng,

504
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,070
you analysed logically.

505
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,550
We must be more careful in the future.

506
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,590
Okay.

507
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,270
Oh right.

508
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,820
Take an annual leave next month.

509
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,030
Let's travel abroad.

510
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,910
Okay.

511
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,340
Let's go to

512
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,310
a remote island.

513
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,590
We'll feel more uninhibited.

514
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,350
Okay, it's decided.

515
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,070
When will your trip

516
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,870
end?

517
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,990
Saturday morning.

518
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,950
Next,

519
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,350
I'll meet some old artists

520
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,110
to add elements for my album.

521
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,310
There are recording

522
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,110
and endorsement too.

523
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,670
You can do it!

524
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,020
[I am looking forward to]

525
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,230
[the weekend.]

526
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:50,980
Me too.

527
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,350
This month, we plan to

528
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,710
write a series of articles

529
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,910
on recasting idols.

530
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,390
Talent shows have reigned in recent years

531
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,310
with constant turnovers and replacement.

532
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,230
Many artists who started as idols

533
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,030
with certain fan bases

534
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,990
are moving towards

535
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,230
other directions

536
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,950
for career breakthroughs.

537
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,710
We should be able to trigger
a discussion on this.

538
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,350
Okay.

539
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,390
Write two items and see.

540
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,350
Adjust promptly.

541
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,150
Okay.

542
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,750
Recently, I heard that

543
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,230
Pei Jia Shu's fans

544
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,710
called his company to complain

545
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,910
that he

546
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,990
didn't get interviewed.

547
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,950
What do you think?

548
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,950
What do fans know?

549
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,780
They think we can interview idols,

550
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,270
and we have the final say.

551
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,350
Ridiculous.

552
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,150
Our back office

553
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,350
received similar messages.

554
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,790
Actually,

555
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,230
we have the same idea as well.

556
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,870
Go for it.

557
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,910
Advertisers

558
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,110
recognise his ability

559
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,150
to promote products.

560
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,470
If you

561
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,630
can win over his fans,

562
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,430
it'll boost

563
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,390
your traffic.

564
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,190
Yes.

565
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,910
Editor-in-chief,

566
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,110
don't push Sheng Sheng too hard.

567
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,740
After all, she did an interview

568
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,230
with two Little Galaxy members.

569
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,550
That's not bad.

570
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,790
She shouldn't take the good jobs only.

571
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,830
Maybe it's possible.

572
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,110
We will try our best.

573
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,820
Editor-in-chief,

574
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,990
we'll get it. Relax.

575
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,110
Good.

576
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,190
Great that you have the confidence.

577
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,310
I believe you.

578
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,860
Okay.

579
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,910
Next,

580
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,630
Pen Ke, talk about your topic.

581
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,510
Okay.

582
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,510
Changed your mind?

583
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,750
Change what mind?

584
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,110
Interviewing Jia Shu.

585
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,830
Wasn't that your plan?

586
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,670
You promised her.

587
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,790
I thought you are going to do it.

588
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,110
I believe

589
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,630
your boyfriend will help you.

590
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,100
Time to test

591
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,630
your love.

592
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,230
My boyfriend will be jealous.

593
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,630
This is a bit difficult.

594
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,270
[Hi.]

595
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,270
[How are you]

596
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,990
[and Sheng Sheng?]

597
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,510
[I can't ask her directly.]

598
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,870
[So, I ask you.]

599
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,470
We can't tell him now.

600
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,510
It's my fault.

601
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,470
I shouldn't have visited.

602
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,190
You're not to be blamed.

603
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,910
You were worried about me.

604
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,910
How do I answer?

605
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,350
Just say you made a blunder.

606
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,270
It was nothing.

607
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,910
Okay.

608
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,870
[I'm going home tomorrow]

609
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,310
[to explain to my parents]

610
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,590
[my breakup with my senior.]

611
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,070
[Okay.]

612
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,390
[After my recording,]

613
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,060
[I'll see you.]

614
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,630
[Why not I go along?]

615
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,510
[I want to eat uncle's dishes.]

616
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,860
[Request approved.]

617
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,390
Should've

618
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,350
taken a video of

619
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,270
how you looked like

620
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,110
and post it online.

621
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,350
Let netizens who say you are

622
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,430
emotionless take a look.

623
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,190
The sweet taste of love

624
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,550
is so vivid on you.

625
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,420
You're jealous.

626
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,430
So?

627
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,070
No wonder there are online rumours
saying you're that.

628
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,110
What?

629
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,990
Who spread that nonsense?

630
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,070
Beats me.

631
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,950
Le Yi told me.

632
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,710
As my senior high classmate,

633
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,830
you can vouch for me.

634
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,590
I don't

635
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,190
remember you going after girls.

636
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,390
I...

637
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,590
Mr. Liu!

638
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,060
Da Chuan,

639
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,750
you're here.

640
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,550
Mr. Liu.

641
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,110
Jiang Yi.

642
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,390
-Hello.
-Hello.

643
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,580
Hello.

644
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,190
Am I late?

645
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,910
No, no.

646
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,430
Jiang Yi

647
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,470
wanted to be here early

648
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,420
to wait for you.

649
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,430
Good that youngsters are punctual.

650
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,310
Take a seat.

651
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,670
Thank you.

652
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,150
Take a seat.

653
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,780
Mr. Liu,

654
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,990
two years back,

655
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,670
I did a stage show with you.

656
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,270
I've been looking forward to

657
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,350
working with you again.

658
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,510
This time

659
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,510
I want to produce

660
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,870
my own new album.

661
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,190
Can you help?

662
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,910
Tell me about it.

663
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,150
I want to make a breakthrough

664
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,230
in the musical style

665
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,110
in this album.

666
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,390
You know

667
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,820
what's popular now is...

668
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,230
Sister Sheng Sheng,

669
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,390
wait a moment.

670
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,470
He'll be down soon.

671
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,670
Okay.

672
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,990
In case you get bored,

673
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,590
he asked me to get you snacks.

674
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,070
So much!

675
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,790
Just the crispy jujube.

676
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,060
It's okay. Just eat.

677
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,510
Okay.

678
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,430
You have one also.

679
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,990
The jujube is super delicious!

680
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:54,990
Okay.

681
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,390
Sister Sheng Sheng, I'm getting off work.

682
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,990
Alright. Bye.

683
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,270
Shu Yi.

684
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,990
Car lights are on.

685
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,990
Thought you're in there.

686
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,550
Getting off work?

687
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,390
Yes.

688
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,710
Didn't know

689
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,550
you're coming to the studio.

690
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,430
Well,

691
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,310
I decided yesterday.

692
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,310
Nothing much.

693
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,390
I'm leaving.

694
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,670
Le Yi said

695
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,350
your mum is back.

696
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,630
I ran into your dad

697
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,590
when visiting you.

698
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,470
Just a coincidence.

699
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,030
Did you feel bad?

700
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,350
Getting used to it.

701
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,390
Time

702
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,350
for your recording.

703
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,470
Yes, I'll go up right away.

704
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,510
See you.

705
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,510
Yi,

706
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,150
if you are in a bad mood,

707
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,100
call me anytime.

708
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,510
I will always have time for you.

709
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,580
I have to go.

710
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,590
Bye bye.

711
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,950
I especially enjoy dishes

712
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,190
made by Sheng Sheng's dad.

713
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,790
She came over to talk to me,

714
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,950
and brought some dishes.

715
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,910
You learnt bad things from me.

716
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,020
Were you scared?

717
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,870
Yes, she nearly saw me.

718
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,710
She knows

719
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,550
we're friends.

720
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,070
It's okay to be in my car.

721
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,550
Just find an excuse.

722
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,790
Isn't that a guilty conscience?

723
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,950
Guilty?

724
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,950
As if we're having an affair.

725
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,070
Dating a big star

726
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,700
is like having an affair.

727
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,590
Fans, reporters,

728
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,390
and passersby can catch the adulterers.

729
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,470
But it was very exciting just now.

730
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,590
I was eating

731
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,550
jujube in the back,

732
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,630
and I dared not chew.

733
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,710
Want one?

734
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,190
Sweeter than honey.

735
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:37,910
Right.

736
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,190
Le Yi told Xu Shu Yi

737
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,030
about your parents.

738
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,310
Will he

739
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,100
talk about us?

740
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:42,980
Relax.

741
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,190
He's not a fool.

742
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,550
He

743
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,990
can keep secrets.

744
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,270
Good.

745
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,630
Xu Shu Yi

746
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,310
knows you well.

747
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,190
Thought you aren't jealous.

748
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,190
I'm not jealous.

749
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,870
I realise that

750
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,470
she knows

751
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,430
about your parents.

752
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,780
I'm just curious.

753
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,540
How did you become friends?

754
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,830
I'm just a little curious.

755
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,230
A little? I won't tell you.

756
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,830
Alright, alright.

757
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,750
I'm very curious.

758
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,180
I'm nosy, okay?

759
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,870
I met her

760
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,510
two years after my debut.

761
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,070
I was a bit popular.

762
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,990
Do you know

763
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,030
Jiang Yi? He'll do

764
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,430
the show with us.

765
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,830
No.

766
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,990
He is popular these days.

767
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,990
His dad uses his name

768
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,550
to sell fried chicken,

769
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,110
and bought expired stuff

770
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,950
but was exposed.

771
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,940
That's why he's hot.

772
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,750
A bit hot, but already a demon.

773
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,710
He'll be gone soon.

774
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,670
He's a hillbilly

775
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,030
who can't see the big picture.

776
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,230
That's why some stars are evergreen,

777
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,910
while others are just meteors.

778
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,670
He couldn't wait to cash in

779
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,790
on the few fans he has.

780
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,150
His character

781
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,150
might just be so so.

782
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,150
Aren't you afraid

783
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,590
I'll tell him?

784
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,350
It was just a casual discussion.

785
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,310
Just chatting.

786
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,710
Shu Yi, we were joking.

787
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,990
We didn't say anything.

788
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,710
Children and parents

789
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,590
are

790
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,510
separate entities.

791
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,030
His dad

792
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,910
made a mistake.

793
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,870
Don't negate him.

794
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,510
I heard his songs.

795
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,110
He is quite professional.

796
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,510
That's true.

797
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,190
Yes.

798
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,670
Why are you here?

799
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,470
You didn't answer my calls.

800
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,710
So, I came here to see you.

801
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,470
Your aunt had a preemie

802
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,870
and needs an incubator.

803
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,350
My shop is shuttered.

804
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,070
Money is tight.

805
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,140
Can you help me?

806
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,870
I paid compensations.

807
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,870
I have no money now.

808
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,550
Because you're a star,

809
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,740
people blackmailed you.

810
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,060
Why not

811
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,310
borrow from your friends?

812
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,350
I bought you coffee.

813
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,870
I went out to greet a friend,

814
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,950
and saw your dad.

815
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,830
Reporters saw him.

816
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,950
Fearful he'd say wrong things,

817
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,150
I brought him in.

818
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,310
Sorry.

819
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,630
No,

820
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,710
I should thank you.

821
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,980
Actually, I understand.

822
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,110
A while ago,

823
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,350
my dad used my name

824
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,430
to discuss cooperation

825
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,820
to make money.

826
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,270
He wasn't that capable

827
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,550
and was nearly cheated.

828
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,670
Luckily, I found out.

829
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,190
If you need help...

830
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,070
No,

831
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,150
I'll ask the company.

832
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,550
We

833
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,830
cannot choose

834
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,030
the families we're born in.

835
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,030
We depend on no one

836
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,870
to find a way out.

837
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,900
I'm more experienced.

838
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,110
Come see me anytime.

839
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,110
I have to go.

840
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,990
Okay.

841
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,750
Shu Yi.

842
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,420
Thank you.

843
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,670
You're welcome.

844
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,030
What happened later?

845
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,070
I told my dad

846
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,670
to not work

847
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,190
or open a business,

848
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,670
and supported him.

849
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,510
Was that Xu Shu Yi's idea?

850
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,630
Yes.

851
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,310
Misery loves company,

852
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,110
like in an idol drama.

853
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:02,910
Jealous?

854
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,910
No.

855
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,390
I wish before you met me,

856
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,460
you met many nice people

857
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,750
who cared about you.

858
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,140
Look at the clouds!

859
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,950
They're so pretty!

860
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,950
I have to take a photo.

861
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,630
My senior made three missed calls.

862
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,110
My phone was muted.

863
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,270
Call him.

864
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,190
[Hello, Sheng Sheng.]

865
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,470
Hello, senior.

866
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,590
What's up?

867
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,230
[I thought about]

868
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,700
[our breakup.]

869
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,390
[I should be there,]

870
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,780
[or I'll be embarrassed]

871
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,630
[when I see Mrs. Cai.]

872
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,070
Are you

873
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,990
going to my house?

874
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,430
[I called you but you didn't answer.]

875
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,790
[I'm almost there.]

876
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,710
Okay.

877
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,390
See you soon.

878
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,710
Alright, bye bye.

879
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,350
Bye bye.

880
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,270
I feel that

881
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,950
he hasn't given up.

882
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,630
Dr. Shen, are you free today?

883
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,510
Not really.

884
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,350
I didn't know

885
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,630
he is coming for dinner.

886
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,310
Should we announce it?

887
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,270
Let's play it by ear.

888
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,630
Tong Hua said

889
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,790
it was a misunderstanding.

890
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,190
If you regret it,

891
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,990
don't announce then.

892
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,310
Actually...

893
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,230
Make yourself at home,

894
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,910
Jiang Yi.

895
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,790
Okay, aunty.

896
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,310
Sheng Sheng,

897
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,510
why did you say Bo Qing

898
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,750
is too busy to come?

899
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,670
I was busy,

900
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,070
but my colleague took over.

901
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,910
You two

902
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,750
are usually busy.

903
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,910
You should

904
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,270
go out on the weekend.

905
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,670
Bo Qing, I have something

906
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,030
to show you.

907
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,670
What?

908
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,270
Is it my love letter?

909
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,110
Yes.

910
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,830
You wrote it

911
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,830
in senior high.

912
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,710
Don't read.

913
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,390
I threw it away.

914
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,470
Why do you have it?

915
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,030
I found it in the trash can

916
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,910
and kept it.

917
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,950
I saw it

918
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,830
while going through things.

919
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,310
Why did you take it out?

920
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,910
I want to show Bo Qing.

921
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,870
Jiang Yi is your good friend.

922
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,030
Nothing to be embarrassed.

923
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,550
Was it for me?

924
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,140
Let me see.

925
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,710
No.

926
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,990
Nothing to see.

927
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,270
I'll keep it.

928
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,310
It wasn't for me,

929
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,630
but let me read it.

930
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,390
We're friends.

931
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,430
No need.

932
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,510
You're usually curious about me.

933
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,230
Return me the courtesy,

934
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,390
or you can't be nosy in future.

935
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,070
I'll

936
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,150
read it to aunty

937
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,100
and Dr. Shen.

938
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,430
Hello Senior,

939
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,310
I'm Yu Sheng Sheng
from Senior One Class C.

940
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,300
I thought about it

941
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,750
and took the courage

942
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,550
to write you this letter.

943
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,750
From the outside, a black hole

944
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,910
looks extremely dark

945
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,390
because light cannot escape it.

946
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,750
But if you are inside the black hole,

947
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,590
you will find

948
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,670
that it is very bright.

949
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,190
Next, we talk about Venus.

950
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,270
Venus is...

951
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,430
In the Mystery Club,

952
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,110
when I first saw you,

953
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,060
I couldn't

954
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,910
control my heart beats.

955
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,910
Go! Go! Go!

956
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,270
Every time you played basketball,

957
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,910
I would watch

958
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,230
and root for you.

959
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,540
Only after a long time

960
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,910
was I sure what

961
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,710
my mixed emotion is.

962
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,310
Senior, I like you.
