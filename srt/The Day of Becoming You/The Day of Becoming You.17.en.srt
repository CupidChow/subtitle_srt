[Please open the door.]

29
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,070
Wait. What happened?

30
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,750
She's drunk.

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,030
Hurry up and get me my slippers.

32
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,510
Be careful.

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,790
Wait. What happened?

34
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,030
I've decided to

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,990
meet Director Stephen.

36
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,910
Help me book a ticket.

37
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,750
Tell me after you've done that.

38
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,470
I want the earliest fight.

39
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,270
Okay.

40
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,910
Open the door.

41
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,470
Wait. Report Yu...

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,830
She's asleep.

43
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,750
Don't go.

44
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,670
Don't go.

45
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,950
Brother Da Chuan.

46
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,590
It's so late already.

47
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,670
Why are you still here?

48
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,110
I'm taking care of Yi's issue.

49
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,870
Brother Yi's issue?

50
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,790
Do you want to gossip?

51
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,710
Are you saying that

52
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,750
Brother Yi's parents were here

53
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,390
and he was acting normal?

54
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,790
But Sister Sheng Sheng

55
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,940
was the one who ran out

56
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,260
and got herself drunk?

57
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,430
Isn't that weird?

58
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,230
Based on my experience,

59
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,510
there are at least three possibilities.

60
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,630
Tell me.

61
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,310
What are they?

62
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,750
The first one is the normal version.

63
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,350
Sister Sheng Sheng
was being compassionate.

64
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,820
She found out about
Brother Yi's childhood.

65
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,630
And then, she saw

66
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,790
Brother Yi's parents fighting.

67
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,510
So, it felt suffocating to her.

68
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,110
No.

69
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,510
Yu Sheng Sheng is not that kind of person

70
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,910
who will easily be suffocated.

71
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,670
The second one is

72
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,830
the evil version.

73
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,430
Sister Sheng Sheng is not drunk at all.

74
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,150
She has been

75
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,270
staying by Brother Yi's side

76
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,190
to wait

77
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,190
for this chance.

78
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,830
She might be wearing
a hidden camera somewhere

79
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,910
to expose him.

80
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,430
No.

81
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,790
Yi was so drunk in front of her
before this.

82
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,390
She would've exposed her
if that was her intention.

83
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,270
This will be troublesome then.

84
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,790
It's very likely that it's the third one.

85
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,590
They have a complicated relationship.

86
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,710
No.

87
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,740
Yi told me that

88
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,910
he doesn't like Yu Sheng Sheng.

89
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,790
Explain it to me then.

90
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,510
Why is Brother Yi still inside?

91
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,110
No. I have to take a look.

92
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,990
Why is it so quiet in there?

93
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,150
Maybe they are asleep already.

94
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,990
Nonsense.

95
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,550
What are you doing?

96
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,710
Well.

97
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,430
I've booked the plane ticket for you.

98
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm here to tell you that.

99
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,990
The ticket has been booked.

100
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,750
I'm here to tell you about it

101
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,540
together with Brother Da Chuan.

102
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,630
What do you think?

103
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,790
Did you notice anything?

104
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,430
He just left

105
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,830
without any explanation.

106
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,310
Could it be that

107
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,630
he's sleepy?

108
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,990
[Yi, I'm sorry for]

109
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,460
[embarrassing you.]

110
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,070
[Please]

111
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,350
[apologise to Miss Yu]

112
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,510
[on my behalf.]

113
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,270
[Son, I took Mo Mo back.]

114
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,030
[Call me when you miss her.]

115
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,350
[I'll bring her over again.]

116
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,990
You are awake.

117
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,590
Why are you here?

118
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,150
You were drunk last night.

119
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,300
I brought you back.

120
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,310
You wouldn't let me leave.

121
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,390
So,

122
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,270
I'm your responsibility now.

123
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,750
Oh my goodness!

124
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,510
Luckily, it's just a dream.

125
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,070
You told me that

126
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,870
I always smile

127
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,590
when I'm Yu Sheng Sheng.

128
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,630
And that I'm happier.

129
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,550
After thinking about it,

130
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,430
I realised that I'm happy

131
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,510
not because I'm hiding inside your body.

132
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,230
Why is it then?

133
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,790
It's because I'm happy

134
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,990
when I'm with you.

135
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,460
Where are

136
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,780
all of you rushing to?

137
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,510
Sister Sheng Sheng, you are awake.

138
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,910
Yes.

139
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,310
It's just you here?

140
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,870
Where are Jiang Yi and Mo Mo?

141
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,350
Brother Yi and Brother Da Chuan

142
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,310
went to meet up with the director.

143
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,150
Mo Mo

144
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,510
went home with her dad last night.

145
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,110
My assistant

146
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,390
went out to buy breakfast for me.

147
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,990
Do you want him to
buy breakfast for you too?

148
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:15,830
It's okay.

149
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,070
I'll go back soon.

150
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,230
Did Jiang Yi say anything

151
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,340
last night?

152
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,830
Should he say anything?

153
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,350
How did you

154
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,310
get drunk last night?

155
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,150
I have bad tolerance to alcohol.

156
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,510
Are you and Brother Yi

157
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,390
in a relationship?

158
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,980
No. That's impossible.

159
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,550
Why would you think that?

160
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,310
Looks like I'm wrong.

161
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,790
Brother Yi is a very rational person.

162
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,430
Now is a critical turning point
for his career.

163
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,350
I think he won't want
to be in a relationship.

164
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,270
He said that

165
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,550
you are just a friend to him.

166
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,870
In my opinion,

167
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,590
even if he really likes you,

168
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,110
I don't think this will work.

169
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,630
Sister Sheng Sheng.

170
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,310
I'm not trying to belittle you.

171
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,150
This is just my hypothesis and analysis.

172
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:16,910
I understand.

173
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,470
I'll take my things

174
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,150
and go back now.

175
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,390
Okay. Come here again if you are free.

176
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,390
It's because I'm happy

177
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,590
when I'm with you.

178
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,140
What does he mean by happy?

179
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,110
What is our relationship now?

180
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,430
[How about I send him a message]

181
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,790
[to ask him about it?]

182
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,670
[No.]

183
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,590
[I can't be too eager.]

184
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,310
[If he was just being impulsive,]

185
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,110
[it would be so awkward for me.]

186
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,150
[Emergency.]

187
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,510
[I confessed to my prince charming
last night.]

188
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,980
[After that,]

189
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,590
[he kissed me.]

190
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,940
[I was too drunk.]

191
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,590
[So, he sent me back to rest.]

192
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,710
[But he still hasn't]

193
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,830
[contacted me since then.]

194
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,550
[Please answer me.]

195
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,030
[What is happening right now?]

196
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,750
[What happened to you?]

197
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,230
[You are being hunted.]

198
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,430
[Who dares to hunt you?]

199
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,590
[After kissing you,]

200
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,870
[did he ask you to]

201
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,910
[date him,]

202
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,070
[become his girlfriend or]

203
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,870
[something similar?]

204
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,670
[No.]

205
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,740
[Actually, I've always felt that]

206
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,870
[me and him are from
two different worlds.]

207
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,310
[I only dared to confess]

208
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,460
[to him last night]

209
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,750
[because I was drunk.]

210
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,150
[People from two worlds.]

211
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,790
[Can you be more specific?]

212
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,140
[For example,]

213
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,100
[my prince charming is like a superstar]

214
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,470
[and I'm just]

215
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,710
[a normal fan.]

216
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,270
[These two worlds]

217
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,710
[are quite far apart.]

218
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,350
[Your prince charming must be]

219
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,910
[someone rich and handsome.]

220
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,310
[This kind of prince charming]

221
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,670
[is very popular among girls.]

222
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,350
[Based on]

223
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,950
[my experience in bad boys,]

224
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,230
[I think]

225
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,990
[he kissed you maybe because]

226
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,310
[you looked nice last night and]

227
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,710
[literally served yourself up
in a platter.]

228
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,550
[You better don't think too much.]

229
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,990
[He's just playing with you.]

230
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,350
[But he said that]

231
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,310
[he's happy to be with me.]

232
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,020
[How old are you?]

233
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,270
[Are you an adult?]

234
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,750
[How can you believe in]

235
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,190
[this kind of old-fashioned]

236
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,350
[pick-up line?]

237
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,590
[You are so naive.]

238
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,940
[You've been played.]

239
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,710
[Period.]

240
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,550
[You've been played.]

241
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,350
[Period.]

242
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,950
[You've been played, period.]

243
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,030
When I was writing about love
in a public account,

244
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,190
you were not even born yet.

245
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,110
He's not like

246
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,150
what you said he is!

247
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,910
What's wrong? Why are you so upset?

248
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,820
I can't write anything.

249
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,340
I'm going to

250
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,910
get my tablet fixed later.

251
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,510
Do you want to

252
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,950
have a teatime with me?

253
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,670
[Goodone]

254
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,950
I've been taking leave so often lately.

255
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,190
Is the editor-in-chief mad at me?

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,630
No.

257
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,110
She even said that by
running around outside every day,

258
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,110
it shows that you can endure hardship.

259
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,750
Besides,

260
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,430
our public account

261
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,430
is doing well lately.

262
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,390
She won't comment anything.

263
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:52,950
Thank you.

264
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,670
Please enjoy.

265
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,470
This is so good.

266
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,230
Dessert

267
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,270
is indeed the best remedy for depression.

268
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,190
There's no need to be depressed.

269
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,030
What topic is it?

270
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,950
I can analyse it together with you.

271
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,350
It's a new topic that I

272
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,270
came up with lately.

273
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,790
I haven't told you about it.

274
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,070
Can idol get into

275
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,750
a relationship?

276
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,070
Of course.

277
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,910
So, Jiang Yi...

278
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,620
Jiang Yi can't.

279
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,750
Fine.

280
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,190
I'll stop joking around.

281
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,150
Let's be serious.

282
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,870
If

283
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,790
his profession is idol

284
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,590
who sells

285
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,670
dream to others,

286
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,870
it's better to stay single.

287
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,590
What if he finds his love?

288
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,710
Then, he has to keep it a secret

289
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,870
from his fans.

290
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,590
Act like he's single.

291
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,190
I've seen a post on Weibo before this.

292
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,630
If an idol

293
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,630
wants to make his relationship public,

294
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,580
there are three ways to do it.

295
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,830
What are they?

296
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,990
First type, career transformation.

297
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,230
Make a name for himself
with his own talent.

298
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,150
Second, just let his fans unfollow him.

299
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,630
It doesn't matter that
he'll lose his income.

300
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,020
What about the third type?

301
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,670
The third type is,

302
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,830
his lover is someone from his team.

303
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,230
What about

304
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,980
it's someone like Jiang Yi?

305
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,310
Analyse it rationally.

306
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,270
Jiang Yi can sing very well.

307
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,390
And he's a talented songwriter.

308
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,110
Lately, he has been acting

309
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,710
and he's really gifted.

310
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,110
His acting skills have been improving.

311
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,820
He's highly recognised in that industry.

312
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,750
Overall, he's really talented.

313
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,430
So, I think

314
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,630
he's a great idol

315
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,790
with actual talent.

316
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,030
Since he's an idol with real talent,

317
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,070
why did you say no just now?

318
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,870
Because the talent agency

319
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,270
has to maximise the value of

320
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,950
an artist.

321
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,830
So, they'll manage their fans for them.

322
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,270
Although

323
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,550
the majority of his fans are rational

324
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,310
like me,

325
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,510
there are some

326
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,550
irrational fans too.

327
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,670
Never underestimate

328
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,470
these irrational fans.

329
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,750
You know it too.

330
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,150
I don't want

331
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,750
Jiang Yi to be attacked by them.

332
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,230
It'll affect the future of his career.

333
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,860
What's wrong?

334
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,070
Is Jiang Yi in a relationship?

335
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,110
I don't think so.

336
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,150
Why are you so worried about it then?

337
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,110
You gave me a fright.

338
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,550
I thought you know that

339
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,430
he's in a relationship

340
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,590
and you are hesitating
to tell me about it.

341
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,510
Even if I know,

342
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,390
I can't tell you about it.

343
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,230
You better not tell me.

344
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,190
I don't want to know.

345
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,870
Last minute travel is great.

346
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,990
No fan waiting for us. So quiet.

347
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,910
If I'm no longer popular one day,

348
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,470
there'll be no fan waiting for me.

349
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,190
Will you be happy?

350
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,430
Don't worry.

351
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,790
You won't be without fans.

352
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,140
So confident in me?

353
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,030
I'm confident in myself.

354
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,630
I'll always be

355
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,590
your last fan.

356
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,470
Aren't you tired?

357
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,950
You didn't sleep at all last night.

358
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,150
You don't have any job tomorrow.

359
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,700
But you want to go back on the same day.

360
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,190
I have things to do.

361
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,510
What is it?

362
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,070
I want to treat all of you with hotpot.

363
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,430
What?

364
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,350
I have to use the toilet.

365
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,110
After that, let's go.

366
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,870
Okay.

367
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,580
[Where are you?]

368
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,390
[Tong Hua and I are in a coffee shop.]

369
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,270
[I'll be home soon.]

370
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,790
[Come to the mansion now.]

371
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,230
[Let's eat hotpot together tonight.]

372
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,910
[Jiang Mo has already gone home.]

373
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,950
[And we've switched back to our own bodies.]

374
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,870
[I don't think]

375
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,390
[I should go there anymore.]

376
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,710
[If you don't come,]

377
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,510
[I'll go and find you.]

378
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,870
[Forget it. I'll go to the mansion then.]

379
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,710
Let's go.

380
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,910
My mum is suddenly looking for me.

381
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,900
I have to go back.

382
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,660
Okay. Let me give you a ride.

383
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,470
It's okay. I'll take a taxi.

384
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,310
Let's go.

385
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,710
Okay.

386
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,060
[Why aren't you here yet?]

387
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,390
[There was an accident in the tunnel.]

388
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,030
[The traffic was really bad.]

389
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,910
[I'll be home soon.]

390
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,550
Sister Sheng Sheng,
the drinks are in the fridge.

391
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,390
Feel free to get them. No need to be shy.

392
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,590
Just treat this as your home.

393
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,350
Okay.

394
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:57,910
If she were shy,

395
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,710
she wouldn't be here.

396
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,470
You are right.

397
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,670
I saw her twice today.

398
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,860
That's more than me seeing you.

399
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,670
[Door opened.]

400
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,190
Reporter Yu.

401
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,710
Why is she still here?

402
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,510
Do you have

403
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,550
anything to hide here?

404
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,710
You must be hungry.

405
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,790
You can start eating now.

406
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,190
I'll come down after I change.

407
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,310
Okay. Let's eat.

408
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,070
How should I cook it?

409
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,510
[Is he trying to butter me up?]

410
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,390
[Is he]

411
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,830
[trying to apologise for
kissing me again?]

412
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,710
I haven't eaten hotpot
at home for so long.

413
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,510
This is so aromatic.

414
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,270
Jia Shu, what condiments you want?

415
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,030
I'll mix it for you.

416
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,150
I don't eat condiments.

417
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,910
Too many calories.

418
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,110
Sister Sheng Sheng,

419
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,870
usually, I rarely eat

420
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,950
in front of them

421
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,990
because I don't want to

422
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,830
tempt them.

423
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,780
But you still eat a lot.

424
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,910
Eating alone and eating with others

425
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,030
are different.

426
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:12,990
Yes.

427
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,950
Right, Sister Sheng Sheng?

428
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,310
Yes.

429
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,190
Another thing.

430
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,830
You brought us some delicious food
last time.

431
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,110
But I wasn't here.

432
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,350
Such a pity.

433
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,030
If you want to eat it,

434
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,790
I'll bring you some food next time.

435
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,550
Okay.

436
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,340
Why did you kick me?

437
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,870
I didn't do it on purpose.

438
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,910
Let's eat.

439
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,910
What were you talking about?

440
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,950
Nothing.

441
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,590
What do you mean by nothing?

442
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,030
We were just chatting.

443
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,980
Le Yi.

444
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,950
We talked about

445
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,230
the food that Sister Sheng Sheng
brought for us last time.

446
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,310
And I didn't get to eat it.

447
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,340
If you don't be careful again,

448
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,030
I'll chop off both of your legs.

449
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,350
And then,

450
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,910
Sister Sheng Sheng said that she'll
bring me some food again next time.

451
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,340
Le Yi.

452
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,590
Do you think Sister Sheng Sheng

453
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,590
is a food delivery girl?

454
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,190
How can she come here so often?

455
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,150
She has to work, right?

456
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,590
Sister Sheng Sheng just needs

457
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,310
a tablet to work.

458
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,230
Yes.

459
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,110
In the future,
she can just write your story.

460
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,710
Don't worry.

461
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,350
I won't write anything

462
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,150
without your permission.

463
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,310
Enough. Don't mind them.

464
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,310
Eat some meat.

465
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,750
Eat.

466
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,870
Why are you staring at me?

467
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,470
Is it not good?

468
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,630
Brother Yi.

469
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,270
How did it go with that great director?

470
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,470
Not bad.

471
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,980
Do you have a good news?

472
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,510
Is that why you treat us this hotpot?

473
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,260
They just want to meet

474
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,110
and get to know each other.

475
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,630
If nothing goes wrong,

476
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,340
I think the role will be mine.

477
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,470
Congratulations, Brother Yi.

478
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,910
You are going to advance into
the international movie industry.

479
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,750
You'll have a bright future ahead of you.

480
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,630
Thank you.

481
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,790
You are so lucky.

482
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,990
And only treat us with hotpot?

483
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,550
Luck is part of our strength too.

484
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,990
All the best to you too.

485
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,580
Another thing.

486
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,310
Actually, hotpot has high calories.

487
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,990
You don't have to eat
if you are on a diet.

488
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:18,910
I'm afraid that

489
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,070
someone will write about
us not getting along.

490
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,550
It's true that we don't get along.

491
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,030
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,470
My best friend is looking for me urgently.

493
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,310
I have to go now.

494
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,110
Continue with your dinner.

495
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,230
Wait.

496
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,070
Your best friend rarely
talks to you through messaging.

497
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,270
I think it's strange too.

498
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,990
Maybe

499
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,030
her WeChat has been hacked.

500
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,630
Jiang Yi, I haven't congratulated you yet.

501
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,070
All the best.

502
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:07,830
Wait.

503
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,430
What are you doing?

504
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,270
Come with me.

505
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,710
At first,

506
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,750
I wanted to tell you after dinner

507
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,190
in case you'll lose your appetite.

508
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,270
But all of you look

509
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,670
uncomfortable with her here.

510
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,390
So, I'll tell you now.

511
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,630
Yu Sheng Sheng and I

512
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,270
are in a relationship now.

513
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,510
It means that

514
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,910
she's my girlfriend now.

515
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,750
We'll meet each other often after this.

516
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,070
So,

517
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,350
just be yourself

518
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,270
as usual.

519
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,110
No need

520
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,030
to feel burdened.

521
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,310
I'm talking about you, Pei Jia Shu.

522
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,230
When you see my girlfriend after this,

523
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,990
stop trying to be charming.

524
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,510
No need to put on make-up and

525
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,070
change your clothes.

526
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,190
I didn't do that.

527
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,750
Le Yi.

528
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,950
You can say

529
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,100
whatever you want.

530
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,150
I'll vouch for Yu Sheng Sheng.

531
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,550
If anything happens, I'll take the blame.

532
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,790
Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.

533
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,470
Da Chuan.

534
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,390
Find more work for yourself.

535
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,910
Don't always come here.

536
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,950
Out of sight, out of mind.

537
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,310
Come with me.

538
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,230
You can eat first.

539
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,030
Am I too tired in the past two days?

540
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,230
Did I fall asleep just now

541
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,270
and had a dream?

542
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,910
You can still dream?

543
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,110
Your artist

544
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,350
is in a relationship with
an entertainment reporter.

545
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,910
You can still eat?

546
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,230
This is good.

547
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,190
Why can't I eat it?

548
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,790
What's wrong?

549
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,070
When did I

550
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,990
become your girlfriend?

551
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,470
Are you not?

552
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,430
No.

553
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,190
Or you don't want to be my girlfriend?

554
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,190
Looks like you want to be my girlfriend.

555
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,430
No matter whether I want it or not,

556
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,150
you still have to

557
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,070
ask the permission
from the person involved.

558
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,870
I agreed.

559
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,230
You agreed?

560
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,510
You were drunk last night.

561
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,670
And I sent you into the room.

562
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:21,950
When I wanted to leave,

563
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,030
you grabbed my hand

564
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,230
and asked me

565
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,910
if I want to be your boyfriend or not.

566
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,310
I was drunk.

567
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,830
It sounded real for me.

568
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,750
Okay.

569
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,830
Even if I mentioned it first

570
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,180
and you agreed,

571
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,150
you knew that I was drunk

572
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,590
and might have forgotten everything.

573
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,430
And you didn't contact me
for the whole day.

574
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:56,710
How would I know

575
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,870
what you are thinking?

576
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,070
I thought

577
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,710
you were going to apologise

578
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,470
for accidentally kissing me again.

579
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,230
Didn't I leave a note for you?

580
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,270
What note?

581
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,830
I put it beside your pillow.

582
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,190
I think it fell down.

583
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,830
I ate garlic.

584
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,310
Yu Sheng Sheng.

585
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,390
It's just a kiss.

586
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,150
Do you have to gargle?

587
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,990
Or

588
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,670
do you want to proceed further?

589
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,350
No.

590
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,110
I just don't want

591
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,230
my mouth to smell.

592
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,350
It doesn't matter if you

593
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,110
want to proceed further.

594
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,340
This is

595
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,220
not our first time anyway.

596
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,190
No.

597
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,950
Go ahead and gargle. I'll wait for you.

598
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,620
Why did you switch off the lights?

599
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,190
Wow.

600
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,470
So beautiful.

601
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,550
When did you prepare this?

602
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,470
When I came up to change clothes.

603
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,190
Yu Sheng Sheng.

604
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,310
I've thought about it very carefully.

605
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,870
Maybe our body swap

606
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,630
is not a coincidence

607
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,860
but fate.

608
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,510
It made me

609
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,670
step away from my path

610
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,790
so that I could meet you.

611
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,830
It brought us

612
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,110
into each other's lives

613
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,950
and into each other's hearts.

614
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,470
It didn't

615
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,230
allow me to hide myself.

616
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,270
It showed me what I really want.

617
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,470
And it showed me
your real feelings for me.

618
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,470
Since you don't remember,

619
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,510
I'll have to confess again.

620
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,070
Yu Sheng Sheng.

621
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,990
I like you.

622
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,670
Let's be together.

623
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,430
[My dearest girlfriend.]

624
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,270
[I have to leave to meet the director.]

625
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,710
[I might not be able to contact you.]

626
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,830
[See you tonight.]

627
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,550
I thought it'll be love words.

628
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,220
Tell me honestly.

629
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,910
Did you plan a long time

630
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,830
about what you want to say
when you confess to me?

631
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:57,950
No.

632
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,020
Looks like you've watched too many dramas

633
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,550
and read too many novels.

634
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,510
You've learnt a new skill.

635
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,990
I think that

636
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,150
when you really like someone,

637
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,310
you'll naturally know what to do.

638
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,470
I see.

639
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,630
Looks like I've underestimated you.

640
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,310
So,

641
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,990
you didn't get my note today.

642
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,070
And I didn't contact you
for the whole day.

643
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,860
You must be

644
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,030
upset for the whole day then.

645
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,110
No, I was not upset.

646
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,710
That's impossible.

647
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,110
Why didn't you contact me then?

648
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,150
Don't you think that's strange?

649
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,420
I don't think so.

650
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,070
You might have kissed me to comfort me

651
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,470
because my confession failed.

652
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,590
So, I can comfort you by kissing you.

653
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,070
That's not the point.

654
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,230
It'll be awkward for me if you apologise

655
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,670
to me again and

656
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,310
say that it's a mistake just like

657
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,910
what you did after
you kissed me last time.

658
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,870
I'm sorry.

659
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,110
I chickened out last time.

660
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,390
You are not shy

661
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,030
with your apology now.

662
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,430
That's because

663
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,420
my girlfriend is always right.

664
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,990
Actually, I was worried just now.

665
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,230
What if we

666
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,230
accidentally switched again?

667
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,030
Why did you do it then?

668
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,950
We were both in the mood.

669
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,150
I didn't want to ruin it.

670
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,870
So, you owe me one.

671
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,590
Owe you what?

672
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,070
I need to gargle.

673
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,390
Stop it.

674
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,030
But back to the issue,

675
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:48,870
I don't think

676
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,060
we need to worry about it.

677
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,230
Think about it.

678
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,790
We tried so many times before that.

679
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,110
But it didn't work.

680
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,070
In the end, we accidentally changed back.

681
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,310
Besides, based on

682
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,390
our previous experience,

683
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,910
the probability of us switching

684
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,710
from a kiss is very low.

685
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,830
So maybe,

686
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,830
we won't switch anymore

687
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,710
after this.

688
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,270
If we switch again,

689
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,030
we can think of a way

690
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,710
to switch back again.

691
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,310
Yes.

692
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,430
Is it really okay to just tell

693
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,230
Jiang Da Chuan and the others about us?

694
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,550
Don't worry. They know what to do.

695
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,150
Besides, I don't want you

696
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,150
to have to make an excuse every time

697
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,470
you go to the mansion.

698
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,350
No need to come down.

699
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,830
Someone might see you.

700
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,190
Are you really going to
keep this from Tong Hua?

701
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,350
I don't know how to tell her.

702
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,550
I need to find a right time, right?

703
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,230
It's fine with me.

704
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,190
Brother. I'm not fine with it.

705
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,870
I'm a coward.

706
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,350
I'll go now. Bye.

707
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,390
Did you forget something?

708
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,740
Here you go.

709
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,110
I don't like to owe someone.

710
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,710
Come in.

711
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,100
I thought you went back
to see your mum.

712
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,030
Why are you here?

713
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,430
I don't want to rush tomorrow.

714
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,870
It's our off day tomorrow.

715
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,510
That's right.

716
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,830
I forgot.

717
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,660
What is it?

718
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,430
Why are you so happy?

719
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,990
A miracle has happened!

720
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,990
What miracle?

721
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,430
I'll tell you about it later.

722
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,470
So mysterious.

723
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,190
I'll tell you about it later.

724
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,550
[Door opened.]

725
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,350
You are still here?

726
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,510
Do you want to drink some tea?

727
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,990
Say whatever you want.

728
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,220
I don't understand.

729
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,030
Didn't you say that

730
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,230
you don't like Yu Sheng Sheng?

731
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,750
Did I?

732
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,150
Why are you acting dumb?

733
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,670
You told me about it

734
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,830
in this room.

735
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,510
That time, I hadn't

736
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,350
decided on it yet.

737
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,870
So, I lied to you.

738
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,310
You've made up your mind now?

739
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,670
Yes.

740
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,830
Dating her

741
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,390
is more important than your future?

742
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,070
So many artists' careers

743
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,870
were ruined

744
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,030
because their relationship was exposed.

745
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,390
So, you are here to ask me to break up?

746
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,630
This is just my opinion.

747
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,910
Isn't it better to get into a relationship

748
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,710
after Little Galaxy

749
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,550
is officially disbanded

750
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,830
and your career has stabilised?

751
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,070
I understand.

752
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,910
I'll try to

753
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,820
be as discreet as possible.

754
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,780
Anything else

755
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,870
you want to tell me?

756
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,070
You've already made up your mind.

757
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,860
I have nothing else to say.

758
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:20,830
Drink some tea.

759
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,790
Is this tea drugged?

760
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,630
Why are you smiling?

761
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,470
I'm happy.

762
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,990
As your friend,

763
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,670
I feel happy for you

764
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,310
because you found

765
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,030
someone you like

766
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,510
and trust

767
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,630
without any doubt.

768
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,550
You were with Yu Sheng Sheng

769
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,910
during the diving activity
last time, right?

770
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,670
I'm right.

771
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,070
She's someone

772
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,900
who can pull you out

773
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,710
from your bad mood.

774
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,590
Now, we know

775
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,110
why you like her so much.

776
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,950
Actually, that's not the only...

777
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,750
Enough.

778
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,790
Don't torture a single person like this.

779
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,590
Help me tell her this.

780
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,710
From now on,

781
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,030
I won't treat her like
an information thief anymore.

782
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,150
From today onwards,

783
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,310
she's just

784
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,100
my best friend's girlfriend.

785
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,030
Okay.

786
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,310
I'll leave now. I'm sleepy.

787
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,030
By the way,

788
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,900
if you don't start working,

789
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,350
your boss might visit you soon.

790
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:57,750
Now,

791
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,710
you can arrange tasks for me as usual

792
00:41:59,230 --> 00:41:59,950
except weekend.

793
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,830
Weekend for dating?

794
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:04,870
I'll get going now.
