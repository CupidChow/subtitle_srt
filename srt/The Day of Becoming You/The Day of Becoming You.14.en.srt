00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,010
[Episode 14]

28
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,630
[She doesn't have
her mobile phone with her.]

29
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,390
[Why is she not back yet?]

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,550
Yu Sheng Sheng isn't someone of that sort.

31
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,390
Oh yeah?

32
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,670
I saw with my own eyes.

33
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,990
She first pretended to be your fan

34
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,870
to get close to you.

35
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,630
Then, she came to our home
to care for Jiang Mo

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,670
and bring you food.

37
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,390
Now, she's even giving lousy excuse

38
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,830
such as learning how to cradle walnuts.

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,820
You should know better.

40
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,110
Don't you feel she's

41
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,550
scheming something in
long term to achieve her motive?

42
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,750
She's not.

43
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,270
Just check her

44
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,590
social media account.

45
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,550
How can you be so naive?

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,110
How would a few articles and photos

47
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,270
reveal one's motive?

48
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,510
Then, what's the motive?

49
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,390
You.

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,230
You are her motive.

51
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,110
She sees it as fitting

52
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,670
to throw herself at you as a bait.

53
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,430
Jiang Yi, this is your private matter.

54
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,710
Perhaps, you took the bait willingly.

55
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,710
I should not meddle in it.

56
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,390
But, don't forget,

57
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,750
this is the crucial time where we

58
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,830
focus on our solo careers.

59
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,910
If the relationship is exposed,

60
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,510
I'm sure you know

61
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,070
what the consequences are.

62
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,990
When the time comes, don't blame me

63
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,750
for not reminding you.

64
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,860
I intended to make you some

65
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,430
red dates and wolfberry porridge.

66
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,350
But, it's burnt.

67
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,830
It isn't edible anymore.

68
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,470
What were Pei Jia Shu
and you talking about?

69
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,350
Seems like it was quite a conversation.

70
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,630
I saw it when I was outside.

71
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,150
Nothing.

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,230
You're using my body.

73
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,350
I have the right to know

74
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,710
what he told you.

75
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,590
Just some unimportant stuff.

76
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,550
You don't need to know.

77
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,260
I determine whether I need to know or not.

78
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,070
Okay.

79
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,390
Then, tell me about everything

80
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,990
my body went through.

81
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,670
What it heard,

82
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,510
every word it said.

83
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,790
Repeat all those things for me.

84
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,270
I know it, even if you keep mum.

85
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,270
I bet it's ecstatic to be
this close to your idol, huh?

86
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,670
Eating with Pei Jia Shu,

87
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,230
staying and talking to him.

88
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,430
Oh, please!

89
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,270
You came here today

90
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,550
and made a mess.

91
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,910
You made me

92
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,870
lose face in front of

93
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,630
my Shu Shu.

94
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,470
Getting close to my idol?

95
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,830
I'm embarrassed now.

96
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,590
It's my fault.

97
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,590
Sorry.

98
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,350
I shouldn't have come today.

99
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,710
Not just that!

100
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,270
You shouldn't have kissed me yesterday!

101
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,270
Yeah,

102
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,750
you're right.

103
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,550
I came to apologize.

104
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,990
The kiss yesterday

105
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,790
happened out of curiosity.

106
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,830
I acted on impulse.

107
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,150
It's my mistake.

108
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,670
Sorry.

109
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,390
Hello.

110
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,430
Sheng Sheng,
your mom wants me to remind you

111
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,310
to invite Bo Qing over for dinner.

112
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,230
Dinner?

113
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,310
Have you forgotten?

114
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,230
No.

115
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,940
I'm in a meeting.

116
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,110
I'll call you back.

117
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,190
I called for this, nothing else.

118
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,070
Don't need to call back.

119
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,150
Go be about your business.

120
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,780
Okay.

121
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,070
Today's the wedding anniversary

122
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,150
of my parents.

123
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,780
We celebrate the annual affair together.

124
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,590
It's our family's tradition.

125
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,030
Well, you could cook up an excuse

126
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,910
and not go.

127
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,750
This is a special situation.

128
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,870
Since it's your family's tradition,

129
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,470
it's better that I go.

130
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,390
They must be very happy today.

131
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,590
I don't want to disappoint them.

132
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,790
However,

133
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,220
I've never told them about the break up

134
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,670
between Senior Shen and I.

135
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,990
You'd have to wait till

136
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,750
our bodies are switched back

137
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,070
to tell them about it yourself.

138
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,590
I'll ring Shen Bo Qing

139
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,150
to get his help.

140
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,110
Okay?

141
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,070
That seems like the only choice.

142
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,070
Anyway, you already know what happened

143
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,070
between me and Shen Bo Qing.

144
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,070
So, you should have
the sense of propriety.

145
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,300
It was my fault to begin with.

146
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,310
I won't be any more of a trouble to you.

147
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,470
Bye.

148
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,070
Bo Qing,

149
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,430
you missed the good wine the last time.

150
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,590
You're not driving today,

151
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,910
so, just enjoy.

152
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,550
Sure, Uncle.

153
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,310
I'll have a go with you.

154
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,140
Come.

155
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,950
So?

156
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,990
A good wine, indeed.

157
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,390
Wow, youngsters nowadays have a eye

158
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,030
for quality goods.

159
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,390
It's kind of strong.

160
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,750
Don't chug till you drop.

161
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,230
The last time, that Jiang Yi overdid it.

162
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,150
He was so drunk

163
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,510
that he couldn't even recognize himself.

164
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,590
He laid still

165
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,470
in Sheng Sheng's room

166
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,790
the whole night.

167
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,750
It seems like the huge idol

168
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,910
doesn't hold liquor well.

169
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,590
Sheng Sheng,

170
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,750
why are you so quiet?

171
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,110
Are you not well?

172
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,790
No.

173
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,270
Here, Dad, Mom,

174
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,390
wishing you a sweet wedding anniversary.

175
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,060
Okay.

176
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,110
Okay. Thank you, Darling.

177
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,990
Cheers, Bo Qing.

178
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,870
Cheers, all of us.

179
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,070
Teacher Cai, Uncle Yu,

180
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,710
happy wedding anniversary.

181
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,190
Okay. Cheers.

182
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,310
Gosh,

183
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,230
your Uncle Yu,

184
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,790
is being so extra.

185
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,910
We're an old couple.

186
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,550
Who cares about
wedding anniversaries anymore?

187
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,550
Teacher Cai,

188
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,910
I might need to correct you.

189
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,070
Wedding anniversaries

190
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,470
get more precious with time,

191
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,630
like this medicated wine.

192
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,910
The longer it ages, the better the scent.

193
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,910
Bo Qing knows me well.

194
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,220
One more. Bottoms up!

195
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,190
Cheers.

196
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,070
Before this,

197
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,190
I was worried for

198
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,230
our Sheng Sheng.

199
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,550
It wouldn't worry me if she

200
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,430
did not have a boyfriend.

201
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,270
I'm just worried that she'd

202
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,510
be with the wrong guy

203
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,430
and be bullied.

204
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,430
But now, everything's perfect.

205
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,670
The both of you are together.

206
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,550
I can finally let go of

207
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,670
my worries.

208
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,390
Bo Qing is definitely a man of character.

209
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,110
Our Sheng Sheng is also a good girl.

210
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,620
When two are together,

211
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,550
forgiving and understanding
each other are a must.

212
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,470
This way, your relationship will last.

213
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,670
Yes,

214
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,310
we'll take note.

215
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,470
Eat up.

216
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,630
Let's eat. Enough talking.

217
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,470
Eat, eat.

218
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,110
Okay.

219
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,150
Dad,

220
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,470
this is for you.

221
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,310
Graphene waist support band.

222
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,190
Can this really massage my back?

223
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,470
Yes.

224
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,990
You stand for long hours to cook.

225
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,230
It strains your back.

226
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,630
This reduces back strain.

227
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,350
And this,

228
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,950
Mom bought this neck
and shoulder massager.

229
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,630
Both of you can take turns to use them.

230
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,790
Okay. I'll try them out later.

231
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,670
Thank you.

232
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,950
It's our pleasure.

233
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,270
Sheng Sheng, Sheng Sheng.

234
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,470
Get over here.

235
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,990
Okay.

236
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,870
Bo Qing,

237
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,870
open this one too.

238
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,190
Are you on your period?

239
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,830
I could tell by the look on your face.

240
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,020
You're embarrassed to say it

241
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,070
in front of Bo Qing, I bet?

242
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,910
Come, drink this while it's hot.

243
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,990
I added some red dates
and some dried longan

244
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,630
for replenish Qi and blood.

245
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,110
You'd feel better.

246
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,590
Thank you, Mom.

247
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,630
Shu Li.

248
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:17,950
Yeah?

249
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,830
Come and try

250
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,110
the presents they got us.

251
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,550
Alright!

252
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,150
I'm coming!

253
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,750
Drink it while it's hot.

254
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,150
You're here?

255
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,030
I was knocking for so long,

256
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,950
why didn't you budge?

257
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,670
I didn't hear you knocking.

258
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,420
What are you up to? Writing songs?

259
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,710
What's up this time?

260
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,110
Nothing.

261
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,390
Just wanted to chat with you.

262
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,790
This vase

263
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,470
is a gift to yourself

264
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,350
on the second anniversary

265
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,790
of Little Galaxy, right?

266
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,430
Yes.

267
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,030
Wow, in the blink of an eye,

268
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,670
Little Galaxy

269
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,310
has been around for seven years.

270
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,630
I remembered

271
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,030
when you were still a trainee,

272
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,870
you stayed up till the wee hours

273
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,110
practising dancing just to

274
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,300
obtain a good ranking.

275
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,180
You were so exhausted that

276
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,630
you needed to be hospitalized.

277
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,550
After that, you finally debuted.

278
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,830
But, there weren't good opportunities.

279
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,350
So, we did

280
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,230
performances in colleges and universities.

281
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,550
It went on for a year.

282
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,430
We were bushwhacked.

283
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,350
This was how

284
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,350
we finally got

285
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,470
the first batch of fans.

286
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,510
Yi,

287
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,030
I saw how much you've toiled.

288
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,550
The achievements

289
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,430
you have today

290
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,910
were obtained through great effort.

291
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,030
Why are you mentioning
these all of a sudden?

292
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,470
Jia Shu told me that

293
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,950
Reporter Yu dropped by again.

294
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,270
What did Jia Shu say?

295
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,230
He said nothing.

296
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,510
It's just me regretting.

297
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,230
I regret that

298
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,110
I ever arranged for lucky fans

299
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,820
to meet you at the birthday party.

300
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,350
Since the elevator incident,

301
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,430
it seemed like

302
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,070
you haven't been doing well mentally.

303
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,230
Something seemed off.

304
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,470
It's my fault for not
taking good care of you.

305
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,510
It's just an incident.

306
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:56,870
I was hoping that

307
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,350
it'd just be a mini episode

308
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,180
instead of a main interruption.

309
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,590
Yi,

310
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,710
now you're at the crucial turning point

311
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,990
of your career.

312
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,910
You need to focus.

313
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,350
Understand?

314
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,830
Are you also worried that

315
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,870
I'm dating Yu Sheng Sheng?

316
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,710
I'm just reminding you.

317
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,550
Don't worry.

318
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,830
I...

319
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,870
Jiang Yi, will not

320
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,540
fall in love with Yu Sheng Sheng.

321
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,260
That's good to hear!

322
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,700
In fact,

323
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,830
liking something is just normal.

324
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,550
But, you should be careful
going into a relationship.

325
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,430
If there's nothing else,

326
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,420
why don't you leave if you're

327
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,740
just here to give examples?

328
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,950
I'd want to continue writing songs.

329
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,270
Okay, then. I'll leave you alone.

330
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,340
Enjoy writing.

331
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,390
[We're done celebrating]

332
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,710
[your parents' anniversary.]

333
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,310
[I'm heading back home now.]

334
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,230
Thank you for doing me this favour.

335
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,310
Since you're willing to continue
to ask me for help,

336
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,260
it means that, we're indeed

337
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,950
still friends.

338
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,390
I'm happy about that.

339
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,510
But, today's really not the right time

340
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,910
to break the news that we've broken up.

341
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,510
Yeah.

342
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,110
I'd tell them

343
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,030
when the time is right.

344
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,670
If you ever change your mind...

345
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,950
I'll never change my mind.

346
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,180
So...

347
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,150
You really like

348
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,470
that Pei Jia Shu?

349
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,510
Did I say that?

350
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,980
It's not hard to tell.

351
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,670
I'm the

352
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,590
ex-boyfriend of the
great detective Yu Sheng Sheng.

353
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,430
Tell me more.

354
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,830
That day, you told me through the phone

355
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,510
saying that there's someone you like.

356
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,420
You only realised it recently.

357
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,950
It got me thinking,

358
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,390
those you've met recently.

359
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,990
That day,

360
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,270
you were overjoyed to receive

361
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,550
a gift from Pei Jia Shu.

362
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,790
I've never seen you that happy

363
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,550
when we were dating.

364
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,670
It's just normal for one to be

365
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,350
overjoyed when receiving gifts from idols.

366
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,310
You said,

367
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,140
you and him

368
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,460
do not belong in the same world.

369
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,830
He's like the products branded
"Not For Sale" on display.

370
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,750
He's never lacked admirers.

371
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,310
Well, isn't this the gap between

372
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,870
idols and fans?

373
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,230
Before this, you only liked him

374
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,710
as a fan.

375
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,630
But because of Jiang Yi,

376
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,910
you got to know him.

377
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,300
It created a connection.

378
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,110
That changed your feelings.

379
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,350
From admiring him as a fan,

380
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,310
you now have a crush on him.

381
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,380
Sheng Sheng,

382
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,270
I'm saying all these because

383
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,550
I don't want to see you get hurt.

384
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,030
What do you mean?

385
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,910
You yourself said,

386
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,750
you can't make someone like you.

387
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,550
You know that he doesn't like you.

388
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,950
Unless, a miracle happens.

389
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,540
I think,

390
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,990
you won't be happy if things

391
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,430
remain status quo.

392
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,750
It will only bring more sufferings.

393
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,430
Did I say all these to you?

394
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,910
Have you forgotten?

395
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,030
No.

396
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,590
I just wanted to confirm.

397
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,270
Don't worry.

398
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,860
Even if I'm right,

399
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,670
I'd tell no one.

400
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,950
[Okay.]

401
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,990
[You're not interested in me anyway.]

402
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,100
[The one you like is Pei Jia Shu.]

403
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,740
[I only have admiration]

404
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,670
[for Jia Shu.]

405
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,910
[I could give him]

406
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,710
[care]

407
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,900
[without expecting any returns]

408
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,750
[in hopes that he'd be able to]

409
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,990
[sing and dance well,]

410
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,470
[and maintain his beautiful face]

411
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,350
[and be a good example.]

412
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,470
[This is enough.]

413
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,670
[I thought]

414
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,580
[you girls fantasize of]

415
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,870
[dating your prince charming.]

416
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,150
[We do.]

417
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,150
[But, that stays a fantasy.]

418
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,310
[In real life,]

419
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,350
[I won't even have the chance]

420
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,190
[to know him.]

421
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,950
[And, for him to notice me,]

422
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,070
[fall in love with me?]

423
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,470
[Zero chances.]

424
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,710
[Thanks to you,]

425
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,270
[I have a boyfriend now!]

426
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,550
[Here we go again.]

427
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,350
Comrade Jiang!

428
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,950
What brings you here?

429
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,150
I've come to see you

430
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,550
and apologize.

431
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,350
Apologize?

432
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,270
I was a little blunt.

433
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,100
And, you didn't wish for us

434
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,670
to switch bodies.

435
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,270
I shouldn't have blamed you.

436
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,950
I am to be blamed.

437
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,190
It's my fault.

438
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,830
It's right for you to blame me.

439
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,150
Even so,

440
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,310
it's both our fault.

441
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,870
Before this, I acted on impulse too.

442
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,790
And, when you wanted to kiss me,

443
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,150
I should have avoided.

444
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,710
Then, I should apologize to you too.

445
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,470
You like Pei Jia Shu so much.

446
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,710
I shouldn't have destroyed your reputation

447
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,110
in front of him.

448
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,190
I spoke in a harsh manner.

449
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,390
I lacked consideration.

450
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,190
You're in your period

451
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,510
where hormones are at a mess

452
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,790
and you have mood swings.

453
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,990
I should understand all these.

454
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,270
It seems like you've thought well
about giving me an out.

455
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,630
Nah.

456
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,750
I'm just stating facts.

457
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,430
After thinking it through,

458
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,950
such behaviour coming from you

459
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,150
is totally understandable.

460
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,790
Understandable?

461
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,430
Be honest.

462
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,350
Were you jealous?

463
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,830
I...

464
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,870
Actually,

465
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,750
I sensed it right from the start.

466
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,460
You noticed?

467
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,150
Yeah.

468
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,550
You're Little Galaxy's captain.

469
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,910
But, I admire Jia Shu and not you.

470
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,030
It's normal to be jealous.

471
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,950
It's just human nature.

472
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,270
Yeah, I was indeed jealous.

473
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,790
You don't need to be.

474
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,310
We're friends.

475
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,350
Yeah.

476
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,390
We're friends.

477
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:48,750
[I was hoping that]

478
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,670
[it'd just be a mini episode]

479
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,780
[instead of a main interruption.]

480
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,270
[Now you're at the crucial turning point]

481
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,030
[of your career.]

482
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,870
[You need to focus.]

483
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,550
I think,

484
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,540
we better think of ways

485
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,830
to switch back.

486
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,590
I know.

487
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,230
But, we'd need

488
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,470
a whole lot of time

489
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,070
to try all sorts of methods.

490
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,470
I agree.

491
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,670
And,

492
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,550
we shouldn't do things
that go way out of line.

493
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,550
Or else, even if we switched back,

494
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,590
we'll have a huge mess to take care of.

495
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,550
It might cause

496
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,780
unnecessary troubles.

497
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,750
I agree.

498
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,030
We need to play each
other's character well

499
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,350
until the right opportunity shows up.

500
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,430
Yup.

501
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,710
We could also create the opportunity.

502
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,580
But, it should be reasonable.

503
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,030
I agree.

504
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,190
That's that. I'm off.

505
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,790
Keep in touch.

506
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,910
Okay.

507
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,620
Keep it up, Yu Sheng Sheng.

508
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,190
I'm really tempted to

509
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,140
take a photo of how silly

510
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,070
I look now.

511
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,900
Go ahead, then.

512
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,390
Right. We've never taken a photo together.

513
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,230
Come on.

514
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,710
Forget it. It'd cause you trouble.

515
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,110
We could take photos of our shadows.

516
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,390
Shadows?

517
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,060
Yeah.

518
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,910
Right.

519
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,110
We're each other's shadow.

520
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,550
This is just apt.

521
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:20,990
Come.

522
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,670
Done.

523
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,030
I've sent it to my phone.

524
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,270
Remember to store it in

525
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,390
the photo gallery when you get home.

526
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,630
Okay.

527
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,940
I'm off, then.

528
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,190
Okay.

529
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,830
[You yourself said,]

530
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,460
[you can't make someone like you.]

531
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,950
[You know that he doesn't like you.]

532
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,190
[Unless, a miracle happens.]

533
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,190
[I think, you won't be happy if things]

534
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,550
[remain status quo.]

535
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,020
[It will only bring more sufferings.]

536
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,230
[This morning I practised signing]

537
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,510
[your autograph for half an hour.]

538
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,830
[I did it about a hundred times.]

539
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,230
I think

540
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,950
no one would be able

541
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,790
to tell them apart.

542
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,110
It could be the muscle memory

543
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,430
of my body.

544
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,390
How's work?

545
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,230
I pitched three ideas

546
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,230
during the meeting.

547
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,430
All three accepted.

548
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,550
Thank you.

549
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,430
Why don't you get trained in writing

550
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,910
and get into entertainment reporting?

551
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,870
I'm afraid that I won't be
able stop once I start,

552
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,030
and end up being assassinated.

553
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,220
Would we have a shot today?

554
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,270
Probably not.

555
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,150
I'd need to do overtime tonight.

556
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,150
You could keep me company from afar.

557
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,230
Okay, then.

558
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,510
I think I have the fate of a workaholic.

559
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,870
Alright, I'll be about my business.

560
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,430
Bye.

561
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,420
Bye.

562
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,310
Where's Tong Hua?

563
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,150
Went to get takeout.

564
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,910
Coffee for the both of you, my treat.

565
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,060
I don't like coffee.

566
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,830
It's been so long,

567
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,190
are you still angry?

568
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,510
We're all here to earn a living.

569
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,990
I think you can understand.

570
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,790
Or, I could apologize to

571
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,150
Tong Hua for unintentionally

572
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,310
hurting her feelings as a fan

573
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,710
when she gets back.

574
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,670
What brings you here?

575
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,270
Nothing.

576
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,750
Who did you contact

577
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,790
for the interview with Jiang Yi

578
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,230
and Cheng Le Yi?

579
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,630
Why do you ask?

580
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,270
Just asking.

581
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,910
Has Jiang Yi gone into

582
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,500
a relationship recently?

583
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,990
He's not been showing face
for quite a long time.

584
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,660
Wasn't he on the live show a few days ago?

585
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,150
Right.

586
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,670
A friend of mine,

587
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,070
he said that

588
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,310
he thinks Jiang Yi has a girlfriend.

589
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,630
Are there shots of them?

590
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,790
No.

591
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,190
Have you gotten any news about it?

592
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,910
I'm hearing it for the first time.

593
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,790
News about Jiang Yi reach you

594
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,030
quicker than me.

595
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,310
Well, there's no harm sharing news
between colleagues.

596
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,150
Sheng Sheng,

597
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,470
food's here.

598
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,940
Coming.

599
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,750
Why did that Zhang Zhi Xiao go to you?

600
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,230
To treat us coffee.

601
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,950
Big deal!

602
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,470
Right. I have something to tell you.

603
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,430
Initially, I am to attend a high school

604
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,350
friend's wedding day after tomorrow.

605
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,150
But, her bridesmaid had to
attend to an urgent matter.

606
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,070
My friend begged for me to be the backup.

607
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,950
Tomorrow after work,

608
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,430
I'd go help out.

609
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,910
I'd be on leave day after tomorrow.

610
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,990
Eat up.

611
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,310
Okay.

612
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,670
[So, Tong Tong]

613
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,190
will not be there tomorrow night
and the day after tomorrow?

614
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,990
This is an excellent opportunity.

615
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,350
Tong Tong's absence
couldn't be more timely.

616
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,790
Would it be convenient over at my place?

617
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,670
[Yeah.]

618
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,550
[I'm not scheduled for work at all.]

619
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,430
[Any time is good.]

620
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,030
Do we want to

621
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,390
come up with strategies?

622
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,230
Yeah.

623
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,100
I've concluded over the past two days,

624
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,350
that the things we done
before this were foolish.

625
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,470
Foolish?

626
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,590
[Such as, the elevator isn't the]

627
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,630
key factor for the switch at all.

628
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,510
But, we still went there

629
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,070
to try to switch back before this.

630
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,220
[Yeah.]

631
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,270
That goes for the thunderstorm too.

632
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,830
It's my fault.

633
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,150
I've watched too much time travel movies.

634
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,870
Switching from a kiss

635
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,150
is only accidental.

636
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,910
Our first switch

637
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,350
has nothing to do with kissing.

638
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,830
You're right.

639
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,070
Oh, you took advantage of me for nothing.

640
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,070
You suffered no loss too.

641
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,190
So,

642
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,710
what's the conclusion you've got?

643
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,420
Whether it's crashing into
each other in the elevator

644
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,590
or kissing,

645
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,950
the similarity is, physical contact.

646
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,790
Only physical contact

647
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,390
gives us the probability
of us switching back.

648
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,550
You've got a point.

649
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,620
Which also means,

650
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,350
let's say the probability to switch back

651
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,670
is constant,

652
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,910
then, the longer the physical contact,

653
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,950
the higher the chances.

654
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,310
That's right!

655
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,540
Right.

656
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,070
That day, I heard

657
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,270
from Senior

658
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,060
that he read from a book

659
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,430
about similar weird occurrence.

660
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,030
The speculation is that a type of

661
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,190
resonance in the magnetic field causes it.

662
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,070
Let's take this into consideration.

663
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,070
Okay.

664
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,990
Let me think about it.

665
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,030
What if we

666
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,670
never switched back?

667
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,350
Yu Sheng Sheng.

668
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,230
Yeah?

669
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,070
If we switched back,

670
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,230
let's not

671
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,950
ever meet again.

672
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,310
Sure.

673
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,950
I was about to say that.

674
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,510
Well, switching bodies

675
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,990
includes many uncertainties.

676
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,430
It'd be troublesome if

677
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,550
anything happens again.

678
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,990
It's best for us

679
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,550
to just remain as friends online later on.

680
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,630
Okay.

681
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,060
You're fortunate.

682
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,580
You have parents that love you,

683
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,790
friends that care for you,

684
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,510
I should return them to you.

685
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,910
You're the one who's truly blessed.

686
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,390
You're so talented.

687
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,750
You must be a superstar in the future.

688
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,020
Don't let me mess it up for you.

689
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,630
See you tomorrow.

690
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,110
Okay.

691
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,430
See you tomorrow.

692
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,750
Welcome to

693
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,030
high-end junk food store, Bestore.

694
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,270
Mister, do you have a favourite?

695
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,230
Perhaps, I can help
with a few suggestions.

696
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,190
It's okay. I'll help myself.

697
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,270
Okay. Go ahead.

698
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,030
Is there no more pork jerky?

699
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,950
There is.

700
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,550
We placed it somewhere else, over there.

701
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:41,990
Okay.

702
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,910
Why don't you write one too?

703
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,550
The pork jerky you ordered,

704
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,150
bro.

705
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,750
I can tell that it's

706
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,910
Yu Sheng Sheng just by that line.

707
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,350
Don't you ever get bored saying that?

708
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,550
That is what makes me unique.

709
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,020
And, I controlled myself

710
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,110
for so long to

711
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,630
reduce this habit.

712
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,270
What?

713
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,470
You're watching

714
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,830
the trendy drama in my collection?

715
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,510
I was bored out of my wits.

716
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,070
Leave it be.

717
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,580
I've not watched it for a long time.

718
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,670
I'd like to watch it.

719
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,950
Come, let's watch together.

720
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,870
[I'm doing this for myself.]

721
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,830
[I can't live without you.]

722
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,510
[I'm willing to love]

723
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,630
[only you in this lifetime.]

724
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,740
[Tragic endings in]

725
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,550
[trendy dramas are all like this.]

726
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,430
[When one person looks back,]

727
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,950
[the other person has disappeared.]

728
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,550
[When I look back,]

729
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,150
[I might only see]

730
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,550
[your gravestone.]

731
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,220
[This thought]

732
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,470
[urges me to not wait any longer.]

733
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,790
[I hope to skip over everything]

734
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,670
[and head towards a]

735
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,470
[blissful ending with you.]

736
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,070
Come on, let's eat.

737
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,550
Or else, the food will go cold.

738
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,790
Okay.

739
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,150
After that, you can enjoy

740
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,620
the drama alone.

741
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,230
I don't like to watch.

742
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,430
Oh, yeah? You're twenty episodes in.

743
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,230
Just finish the whole series already!

744
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,430
Perhaps, these tactics would

745
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:50,750
be of good use

746
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,150
when you get a girlfriend.

747
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,550
Am I not right?

748
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,310
I've played such characters.

749
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,350
I know, bro.

750
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,390
The more real the tactics look,

751
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,510
the deeper the viewers indulge.

752
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,710
Learn new experiences as you go.

753
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,430
Look at you. Fried chicken and Coke.

754
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,270
Not on a controlled diet for me anymore?

755
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,030
Go on a diet

756
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,140
when we're switched back.

757
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,590
High-calorie foods

758
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,990
put one in good mood.

759
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,310
After switching back,

760
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,420
you won't get to eat such food.

761
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,510
Don't be so good to me.

762
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,590
Why does this seem like

763
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,750
a farewell meal?

764
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,310
Why is there two cups of Coke?

765
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,670
I've not been enjoying
these for a long time.

766
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,750
Be good to me, bro.

767
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:40,950
Okay.

768
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,470
Okay. This is farewell to you too.

769
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,110
Don't move.

770
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,270
You're so adorable, bro.

771
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,630
Bro,

772
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,390
you look good when you smile.

773
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,350
Isn't this your face?

774
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,350
But,

775
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,470
your soul is smiling.

776
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,830
That means, you're becoming cheerful.

777
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,590
This is cold.

778
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,270
It's not for you.

779
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,510
Here, have this instead.

780
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,750
A drink that makes people fat and happy.
Nice!

781
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,790
After we're switched back,

782
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,510
avoid drinking cold stuff.

783
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,910
Menstrual pain

784
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,510
might be caused by this one.

785
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,420
Oh,

786
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,350
are you

787
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,110
feeling connected to my body already?

788
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,230
Use your brain before you speak.

789
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,910
There're hints of discrimination.

790
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,860
As long as you get what I mean.

791
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,590
Eat up.

792
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,030
We'd need the energy for the day.

793
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,670
Here.

794
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,230
Dry-braised chicken wing.

795
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,950
This is just awesome.

796
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,870
[What's so funny?]

797
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:13,870
[Must be]

798
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,270
[Yu Sheng Sheng's muscle memory.]

799
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,830
Bro, are you done changing?

800
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,910
Hurry up.

801
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,950
Do you want to get
changed into sportswear?

802
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,390
There are loose-fitting ones
in the wardrobe.

803
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,550
It's okay.

804
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,310
Didn't you notice

805
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,190
what I'm wearing today

806
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:32,630
is the outfit

807
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,430
that we wore

808
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,150
when we first switched?

809
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,110
Hope this brings us luck.

810
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,660
You're superstitious.

811
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,750
Be focused.

812
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,390
What happens next

813
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,710
might be intense.

814
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,670
Round one.
