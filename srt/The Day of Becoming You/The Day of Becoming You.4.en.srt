Why is there no kernel?

29
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,030
Help me find

the kernel.

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,630
Brother Yi,

32
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,350
what's gotten into you?

33
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,390
What do you mean?

34
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,070
RMB600,000.

35
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,230
You just cracked them like this?

36
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,180
What do you mean by that?

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,110
You said it yourself,

38
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,070
you've been keeping
these walnuts for seven years.

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,820
They are worth RMB600,000.

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,270
Did I say that?

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,790
Brother Da Chuan,

42
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,110
I don't think Brother Yi

43
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,110
is malingering.

44
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,710
The walnuts are his favourite.

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,110
The stakes are too high.

46
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,310
Yi,

47
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,630
are you going through

48
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,630
something lately?

49
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,310
Do you need to

50
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,230
see a therapist?

51
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,350
I know the show business

52
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,670
can be very stressful.

53
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,350
You must learn how to self-regulate.

54
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,230
And of course,

55
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,030
you must combine work with pleasure.

56
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,790
Don't put too much

57
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,950
pressure on yourself.

58
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,350
How about this? I'll arrange

59
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,430
for you to take two days off,

60
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,670
okay?

61
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,670
You should go.

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,910
I want...

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,750
I...

64
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,870
I want to be alone.

65
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,150
Did you manage to play dead?

66
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,670
I'm already dead.

67
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,350
How did you convince Jiang Da Chuan?

68
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,110
You've

69
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,590
made a great sacrifice.

70
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,070
Don't mess around with my body.

71
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,830
No, technically,

72
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,870
I was the one who made the sacrifice.

73
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,590
So you don't have to work?

74
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,030
Not for now.

75
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,180
That's great.

76
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,150
I'll take leave tomorrow.

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,950
Let's meet up.

78
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,710
Okay, where should we meet?

79
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,750
The hotel where the incident took place.

80
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,030
Under the same circumstances,

81
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,310
let's see if we can find a way

82
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,430
to switch bodies again.

83
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,630
Okay.

84
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,350
[Hold on.]

85
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,270
Do something for me.

86
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,270
What?

87
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,150
There's a tray on the bookshelf

88
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,990
in my room.

89
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,270
There are two walnuts inside the tray.

90
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,830
Check if they are still there.

91
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,190
Do you see the walnuts?

92
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,230
I do.

93
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,030
Bring them to me tomorrow.

94
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,670
Okay.

95
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,590
Bye.

96
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,230
Why are you wearing sportswear?

97
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,270
I've got

98
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,860
so many nice clothes

99
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,710
in my wardrobe.

100
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,910
You didn't even wear any accessories.

101
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,260
Don't tell me

102
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,110
this is what you wore

103
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,950
when you went to work yesterday.

104
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,510
They are all the same for me.

105
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,670
You have no fashion sense.

106
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,790
Oh dear,

107
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,390
I can finally have a nice meal.

108
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,390
Why do you want to eat first?

109
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,150
I can't work if I don't eat.

110
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,620
When I'm inside your body,

111
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,710
I've never had

112
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,150
a proper meal.

113
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,990
I'm starving.

114
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,990
Are you not going to eat anything?

115
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,470
Give me the walnuts.

116
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,950
I think

117
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,100
you're in no hurry at all, right?

118
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,830
Maybe it can wait till after.

119
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,590
I am.

120
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,790
I'll give them to you now.

121
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:23,830
Here you go.

122
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,510
These aren't my walnuts.

123
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,150
How did you know?
You didn't even hold them.

124
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,150
The colour is different.

125
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,950
I grabbed the wrong ones.

126
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,980
How about these two?

127
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,620
The pattern is different.

128
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,910
You can tell that

129
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,750
the pattern is different?

130
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,710
They are

131
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,990
truly your favourite things.

132
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,110
I'll give you the real ones now.

133
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:05,980
Put your hands out.

134
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,150
Are you messing with me?

135
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,430
I was just kidding.

136
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,390
What kind of a person are you?

137
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,470
You have no sense of humour at all.

138
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,990
I just want to see

139
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,950
how well you know

140
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,860
your favourite things.

141
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,550
Unsurprisingly,

142
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,830
you know them very well.

143
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,750
Where are my walnuts?

144
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,470
I didn't bring them with me.

145
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,310
I figured

146
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,980
it'd be very dangerous

147
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,950
to keep the walnuts that are

148
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,670
worth RMB600,000 with me.

149
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,790
Someone might take it away.

150
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,510
Besides, I'm just a girl.

151
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,710
Who told you

152
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,430
they are worth RMB600,000?

153
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,870
Jiang Da Chuan.

154
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,590
Are they really worth RMB600,000?

155
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,510
Yes.

156
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,100
But nobody would steal

157
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,070
the walnuts in your pocket.

158
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,310
You've got a point.

159
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,230
Finish your food.

160
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,420
Don't forget

161
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,190
what we are here for.

162
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,060
Yes, let's eat first.

163
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,550
We'll talk after that.

164
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,030
There's CCTV in the elevator.

165
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,420
Don't take off your mask.

166
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,790
If someone's here,

167
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,030
we'll stop immediately.

168
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,550
Okay,

169
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,380
I know.

170
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,670
What are you doing?

171
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,310
Have you forgotten

172
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,590
that I had physical contact with you

173
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,350
when we switched bodies?

174
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,510
I just want to re-enact the scene.

175
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,670
Why is it not working?

176
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,910
Try it again.

177
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,950
Did we get it wrong?

178
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,150
Should we try

179
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,830
some other poses?

180
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,230
Last time,

181
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,230
I think you were holding my leg.

182
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,550
Last time, I was

183
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,670
using my own body

184
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,790
to hold your leg.

185
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,420
Now that we've switched bodies,

186
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,630
are we supposed to

187
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,390
use your body

188
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,030
to hold my body

189
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,830
or use my body

190
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,590
to hold your body?

191
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,750
Stop saying tongue twisters.

192
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,150
There's only one way to find out.

193
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,830
Let's do it.

194
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,750
Why is it not working?

195
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,110
Right,

196
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:28,830
the last time

197
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,990
the elevator was falling rapidly,

198
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,350
you didn't want to protect me.

199
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,950
I remember you were lying on me

200
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,070
when we got up.

201
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,230
I'm afraid that's inappropriate.

202
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,230
Fair enough.

203
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,740
What?

204
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,870
You're blushing.

205
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,910
You said it's inconvenient

206
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,750
to lie on me.

207
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,350
This is an alternative version.

208
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,270
Let's try this.

209
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,510
Sure.

210
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,910
It's your own body.

211
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,550
Don't be shy.

212
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:14,910
Nonsense!

213
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,110
We tried for an hour

214
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,110
but it wasn't effective at all.

215
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,030
This indicates that

216
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,830
the elevator is not the key component.

217
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,150
There probably are some other conditions.

218
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,430
I remember

219
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,470
it was raining and thundering that day.

220
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:57,990
Brother,

221
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,230
do you think it has

222
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,790
something to do with the rain and thunder?

223
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,750
Thunder?

224
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:03,750
Well,

225
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,070
yes.

226
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,550
In the drama,

227
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,390
they always switch bodies after

228
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,790
getting electrocuted
or getting hit by a car.

229
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,550
Brother,

230
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,150
have you had an electric shock
when you were young?

231
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,590
Don't get me killed
if you have a death wish.

232
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,110
If we can't

233
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,830
get back to our bodies,

234
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,990
we're all going to die anyway.

235
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,110
What difference does it make?

236
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,310
The difference is that

237
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,180
Jiang Yi and Yu Sheng Sheng

238
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,110
will die from electric shock together.

239
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,870
Guess what

240
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,110
the entertainment tabloids
will write about us.

241
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,510
You're right.

242
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,860
I can't make myself

243
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,470
a trending topic using such a ridiculous

244
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,190
yet sad method.

245
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,830
If the weather forecast

246
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,630
is accurate,

247
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,190
there will be a thunderstorm in 3 days.

248
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,750
When the time comes,

249
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,180
we'll try it again.

250
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,870
Three days?

251
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,830
Oh no,

252
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,100
I have to wait for three days

253
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,950
to switch back.

254
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,070
This is so annoying.

255
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,390
[I have three days left]

256
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,470
[to spend with my Jia Shu.]

257
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,710
You must always wear a mask.

258
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,910
This is my first time

259
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,990
seeing such a big smile

260
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,740
on my face.

261
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,990
I'm a little scared.

262
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,430
For the next three days,

263
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,310
you must avoid

264
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,830
being on the variety show

265
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,830
with Jia Shu.

266
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,180
Honestly, you're nothing like me.

267
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,500
Jia Shu and Le Yi

268
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,430
are too familiar with me.

269
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,710
Brother,

270
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,430
you've got no job these days.

271
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,150
You don't have a chance
to be on a variety show.

272
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,750
Besides,

273
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,060
nobody will give this much thought.

274
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,550
Your best friend, Tong Hua...

275
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,950
She's very smart.

276
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,990
Stay away from her.

277
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,590
She wanted me to stay with her.

278
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,190
Don't!

279
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,670
Just

280
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,060
stay at my parents' house.

281
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,110
I swear,

282
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,630
I'll stay away from

283
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,230
my Shu Shu

284
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,070
and Le Yi.

285
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,270
I won't talk to them.

286
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,470
Me and you.

287
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,470
We must take good care of ourselves.

288
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,380
Don't get each other into trouble.

289
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,550
That's brilliant.

290
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,430
Good luck!

291
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,990
Good luck!

292
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,620
Hey!

293
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,230
Walnuts.

294
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,510
Okay, I know.

295
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,510
I'll bring them to you next time.

296
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,460
Walnuts.

297
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,590
Stupid walnuts.

298
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,710
Why do you have walnuts?

299
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,220
Please open the door.

300
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,950
Brother Yi!

301
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,150
Why would you buy so many walnuts?

302
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,150
I want to cradle them.

303
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,230
You want to cradle

304
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,390
all of them?

305
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,630
No,

306
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,230
I just want to find

307
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,630
the walnuts that are similar to

308
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,300
the ones I cracked before.

309
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:53,910
Right, Le Yi,

310
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,910
do you know

311
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,990
what my old walnuts

312
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,630
look like?

313
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,110
Can you help me find a similar one?

314
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,590
Yes,

315
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,310
that's my Brother Yi.

316
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,420
Now you sound like you.

317
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,710
Sure, we'll just cradle another walnut.

318
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,470
I'll help you.

319
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,310
Come.

320
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,030
Brother Yi,

321
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,470
it's impossible

322
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,430
to find the walnuts

323
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,470
that look exactly the same.

324
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,510
Why don't you just choose
the ones that look nice?

325
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,630
They have to be exactly the same.

326
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,710
Brother Yi,

327
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,830
do you know

328
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,270
whom I met backstage today?

329
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:29,990
Who?

330
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,140
Chen Chen.

331
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,230
Who is Chen Chen?

332
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,550
Chen Chen is that girl.

333
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,190
Yes.

334
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,670
The company used to have high hopes

335
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,390
on her when she debuted.

336
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,430
But now she's become a backup dancer.

337
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,390
It's such a waste.

338
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,710
I know. And also Liu Xi.

339
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,380
I heard she's divorced.

340
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,430
It seems like her husband

341
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,950
had an affair with a model.

342
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,990
Liu Xi?

343
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,910
Didn't they just celebrate

344
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,110
their fifth wedding anniversary?

345
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,830
Brother Yi, you know her?

346
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,150
I saw it on Weibo.

347
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,550
I thought you said

348
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,870
Weibo is a waste of time?

349
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,750
That's not important.

350
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,590
Tell me

351
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,350
how he cheated on her.

352
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,790
Here's how it is.

353
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,270
Liu Xi found a hair band

354
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,470
in her car.

355
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,510
The hair band

356
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,670
didn't belong to her.

357
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,510
Then, she brought it

358
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,590
home

359
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,820
and...

360
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,070
Sheng Sheng.

361
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,030
This kid

362
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,830
never left her room

363
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,310
once she finished her meal.

364
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,230
Yu Sheng Sheng, open the door.

365
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,470
What are you doing in your room?

366
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,790
I'm meditating.

367
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,630
What's the matter?

368
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,510
Come and watch TV with me.

369
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,750
Why would you keep yourself

370
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,550
in your room every day?

371
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,670
Come.

372
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,070
Your aunt sent a message on WeChat.

373
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,710
She asked whether you've

374
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,790
collected the medicine from Bo Qing.

375
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,470
[Bo Qing? Medicine?]

376
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,820
You didn't pick it up?

377
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,750
Just a second,

378
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,190
I need to reply to a message.

379
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,470
You seem

380
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,670
busier than the president.

381
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,500
[Who is Bo Qing?]

382
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,550
[Your mom asked]

383
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,550
[if you've collected your aunt's]

384
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,430
[medicine from Bo Qing.]

385
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,150
[Shen Bo Qing was my mom's student]

386
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,230
[in high school.]

387
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,150
[He's my senior.]

388
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,910
[He works in the hospital.]

389
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,150
[I collected the medicine.]

390
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,630
[It's in the top right drawer]

391
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,540
[of the coffee table.]

392
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,550
It's in the top right drawer

393
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,310
of the coffee table.

394
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,750
I should let her know now.

395
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,750
Sheng Sheng, how to use the medicine?

396
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,190
Just a few more minutes,

397
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,710
let me reply to another message.

398
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,870
Put down your phone.

399
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,550
You're always

400
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,510
on your phone.

401
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,550
It's not good for your eyes.

402
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,750
You were discharged a few days ago.

403
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,910
Your brain hasn't recovered

404
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,310
and yet you keep playing with your phone.

405
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,150
What does this have to do with my phone?

406
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,470
Don't you know

407
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,830
smartphones can damage your brain?

408
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,630
Still looking at your phone?

409
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,470
Right,

410
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,150
the medicine needs to be taken
once a day after a meal.

411
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,030
Take one tablet every time.

412
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,910
It's to be taken once a day,
one tablet every time.

413
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,750
After the meal.

414
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,950
Sheng Sheng,

415
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,150
drink it while it's warm.

416
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,110
Here.

417
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,790
I added jujube.

418
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,630
It's very sweet.

419
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,750
What is this?

420
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,630
Angelica egg.

421
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,550
Stop acting like you don't know.

422
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,030
Quick.

423
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,710
Hold your nose and finish it.

424
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,670
Geez,

425
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,790
you're feeding her herbal remedies

426
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,110
as though it's poison.

427
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,550
Stop torturing her.

428
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,710
She just got out of the hospital.

429
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,950
She needs better nutrition.

430
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,710
Fine.

431
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,510
I don't believe

432
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,550
you can make her drink it.

433
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,550
Do you have another egg?

434
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,590
I want another one.

435
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,430
I do.

436
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,100
Don't bother.

437
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,470
What?

438
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,670
Dad,

439
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,350
I'll get it myself.

440
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,950
What's wrong with our daughter?

441
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,150
Before this,

442
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,750
she would never drink this soup.

443
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,150
Is this a different person?

444
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,510
[Why isn't he replying?]

445
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,390
[Our Jia Shu]

446
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,350
[looks good in every angle.]

447
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,270
[Look at these two pictures.]

448
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,790
[He's so much more
handsome than the other.]

449
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,550
[Turns out a pretty face]

450
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,270
[is inseparable from the retoucher.]

451
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,710
These marketing accounts

452
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,350
would do anything

453
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,070
to get more views.

454
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,750
[Please behave like a man.]

455
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,870
[How could you compare retouched photos]

456
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,470
[to candid photos?]

457
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,950
I deleted it instantly.

458
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,310
It's okay, it'll be fine.

459
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,470
I'll cradle walnuts.

460
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,790
Cradle them.

461
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,030
Red bean barley porridge

462
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,670
for clearing damp from your body.

463
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,550
Here you go.

464
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,430
Thank you.

465
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,830
Yo,

466
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,910
why are you being

467
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,150
so polite?

468
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,460
Hey,

469
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,110
our daughter

470
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,190
is eating very well these days.

471
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,630
Come on,

472
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,150
since when is having

473
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,940
a good appetite a good thing?

474
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:41,430
What?

475
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,590
She's no better than

476
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,870
Bo Qing in studies.

477
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,950
And unlike

478
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,950
my colleagues' children,

479
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,990
she doesn't have a skill.

480
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,950
She doesn't even have a stable job.

481
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,670
She has a lot of good qualities.

482
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,470
At least she's very optimistic, right?

483
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,870
Fine,

484
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,790
your daughter is the best.

485
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,630
Go get the door, Sheng Sheng.

486
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,510
Eat your breakfast, I'll go.

487
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,710
It's okay, let her go.

488
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,830
You're spoiling her.

489
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,220
Morning.

490
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,420
This is for you. Get well soon.

491
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,030
Do you feel sick anywhere?

492
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,350
Thank you.

493
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,470
Who is it?

494
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:34,630
Oh,

495
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,310
my doctor.

496
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,110
It's me, Mrs. Cai.

497
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,550
Bo Qing?

498
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,310
When did I

499
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,300
become your doctor?

500
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,780
Do you

501
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,910
feel sick anywhere?

502
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:55,950
No.

503
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,390
Come in.

504
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,110
We're having breakfast now.

505
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,590
Have some porridge.

506
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,070
Thank you.

507
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,390
You're visiting

508
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,510
Sheng Sheng early in the morning.

509
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,830
She's fine already.

510
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,030
I'm here for the food.

511
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,540
Bo Qing, that's so sweet of you.

512
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,300
Stop.

513
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,990
Where are you going?

514
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,670
To the washroom.

515
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,390
I know you're going

516
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,510
to play with your phone again.

517
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,550
Sit down and have your breakfast.

518
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,980
Mrs. Cai,

519
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,710
Sheng Sheng is an adult now.

520
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,910
You don't have to worry about her.

521
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,870
An adult should be

522
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,550
more disciplined.

523
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,030
When she was young,

524
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,910
she was always on her phone during class.

525
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,830
The teachers always

526
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,630
complained to me about her.

527
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,070
And yet she gave me an excuse

528
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,790
that she was reading
eBooks and learning.

529
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,190
Right,

530
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,110
she said she learned it from you.

531
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,150
But Senior Shen

532
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,430
didn't do it during class.

533
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,830
Besides, do you know

534
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,870
what Bo Qing was reading?

535
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,150
He read the classics,

536
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,190
Forces of Nature

537
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,190
and science fiction.

538
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,750
What book were you reading?

539
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,230
What book was I reading?

540
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,270
You don't even remember

541
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,150
what book it was?

542
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,750
Are you pretending to
have lost your memory?

543
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,230
You were reading a romance novel about

544
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,070
a CEO who couldn't think

545
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,350
of anything except kissing a poor girl.

546
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,870
So now you're embarrassed.

547
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,950
Popular literature attracts

548
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,030
a broad audience.

549
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,350
An romance novels

550
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,790
sell the best in bookstores.

551
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,790
Fine.

552
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,310
When you're free,

553
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,950
take her to the bookstore.

554
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,150
All she does all day

555
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,910
is playing with her phone at home.

556
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,310
I've got time today.

557
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,190
Sheng Sheng, do you have time later?

558
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,470
Do you want to go to the bookstore?

559
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,580
No.

560
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,990
You're being rude!

561
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,390
How could you hit her?

562
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,670
What if she's hurt?

563
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,310
It's alright.

564
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,310
The hospital gave me two tickets

565
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,630
to the show, Super Fun Weekend

566
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,340
tomorrow.

567
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,710
The member of Little Galaxy

568
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,510
whom you like will be on the show.

569
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,550
I changed my mind.

570
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,910
Yu, look. The kids today

571
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,390
are all crazy

572
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,190
about their idols.

573
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,510
I don't see what's so good

574
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,470
about them.

575
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,550
Not all of them are bad.

576
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,910
Jiang Yi is quite nice,

577
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,870
isn't he?

578
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,270
He's smart and capable.

579
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,790
Most importantly, he's very well-mannered,

580
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,300
right?

581
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,910
Yes,

582
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,070
he's a pretty good kid.

583
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,820
But his manager

584
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,910
looks really obnoxious.

585
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,270
Don't say that.

586
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,750
He's very righteous as well.

587
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,270
He's on the hot search list today.

588
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,030
Hot search list?

589
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,950
Jiang Yi advises you to behave like a man.

590
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,190
[He paid to be on
the hot search list again.]

591
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,750
[How many times had he done this?]

592
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,390
[Jiang Yi's agency must have]

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,110
[He's clearly trying to get attention.]

595
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,790
[Am I the only one]

596
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,620
[who can see that?]

597
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,030
[He deleted instantly.]

598
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,390
The response is quite good.

599
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,550
You gained more followers.

600
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,030
See,

601
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,590
I always told you to be
more active on social media

602
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,030
but you said you've got nothing to post.

603
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,430
It's pretty good, isn't it?

604
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,310
But you should

605
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,390
let me know in advance next time

606
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,270
or our team

607
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,990
will be caught off guard.

608
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,950
We thought something had happened to you.

609
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,230
He must be so mad.

610
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,270
You're talking about Jia Shu?

611
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,740
No, he won't.

612
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,470
You were standing up for him.

613
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,950
He knows that.

614
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,990
I'm not talking about him.

615
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,270
Alright, kid.

616
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,470
It's really fine.

617
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,390
We'll go to the TV station tomorrow

618
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,470
to shoot the commercial for charity.

619
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,030
It'll improve your public image.

620
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,550
Commercial?

621
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,390
Yes,

622
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,670
you wanted to

623
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,900
make time for the commercial.

624
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,470
But my body...

625
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,270
Don't worry,

626
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,510
I've spoken to them.

627
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,110
Your car will stop

628

right in front of the studio.

629
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,190
No, I...

630
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,190
I need to go back to the office.

631
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,150
I have a meeting.

632
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,950
Take a good rest.

633
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,070
I'm on my way. Stop rushing me.

634
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,430
Get some rest.

635
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,550
Oh no.

636
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,790
Hi.

[How's your day?]

638
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,790
Why didn't you reply to me on WeChat?

639
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,910
Your manager was here. He just left.

640
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,190
I was going to report to you.

641
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,830
I'll read you some comments on Weibo.

642
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,910
The netizen, Bunny Who Loves Cat Broth

643
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,470
said this is so sweet.

644
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,550
[Come on.]

are not on good terms

649

must be blind.

650

I don't want to switch back now.

I wish you two happily ever after.

657
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,350
Stop it.

658
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,750
It wasn't intentional.

659
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,270
It was a slip of the mind.

660

[Besides,]

00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,310
I really

696
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,270
don't feel that way about him.

697
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,550
We're just friends.

698
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,630
But he seems to like you.

699
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,310
Hey,

700
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,700
Jiang Yi, what's that supposed to mean?

701
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,340
I meant it literally.

702
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,750
I meant

703
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,350
what you meant.

704
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,830
[Since you don't mind]

[causing trouble for me,]

706
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,630
I wouldn't mind

707

going on a date with that doctor either.

708
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,110
A date?

709
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,540
I'm sorry.

710
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,030
I'm on my knees now.

711
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,470
[I shouldn't]

712

[go to the birthday party.]

713
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,710
If I didn't go there,

714
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,590
I wouldn't have won the prize.

715
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,470
If I didn't win the prize,

716
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,830
I wouldn't

717
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,790
have to eat with you.

718
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,830
If I didn't eat with you,

719
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,660
we wouldn't have switched bodies.

720
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,540
[If we didn't switch bodies,]

721

It's all my fault.

724
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,390
I'm sorry.

725
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,310
I'm already on my knees.

726
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,070
What do you want?

727
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,270
[No worries.]

728
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,270
If you really like him,

729
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,470
I can help you.

730
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,990
I don't have feelings for him.

731
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,870
I regard

732
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,870
him as a friend.

733
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,550
Don't kneel with my body.

734
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,580
Get up.

735
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,470
Fine, I'm sorry.

736
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,230
I'm truly sorry.

737
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,390
You can say whatever you want.

738
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,630
You're forbidden to use

739
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,470
my Weibo account.

740
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,830
I don't want to see anything

741
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,430
about Jiang Yi mistakenly liking a post.

742
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,870
I won't do that again.

743
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,790
In order to survive this crisis,

744
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,910
both of us need to

745

[What did Jiang Da Chuan say?]

750

He said you've gained more followers.

[And he said]

757
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,590
[you really wanted this.]

758

Go and shoot the commercial.

759
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,070
I can't.

760
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,270
[It's easy.]

761
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,950
It's easy for you

762
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,750
but I've never

763

I'm taking photos of the plants.

777

779

I didn't know you're home.

780

I just came back.

781

Your assistant hasn't

782

783

Wow,

Well, actually...

790

Last night?

793
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,950
You're talking about Weibo.

794
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,550
Luckily, it didn't have a

795

negative impact on us.

Are you trying to change style and

799
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,420
build an image of being an upright person?

800
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,790
Or is it queerbaiting?

801
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,910
No.

802
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,700
No, you got this all wrong.

803
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,630
Actually...

804
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,030
Actually, it's me, not him...

805
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,870
Anyway,

806
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,750
I'm sorry.

807

Anyway, thanks for your concern.

808

Next time, please ask for my permission

809

before you do anything related to me.

810
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,790
Okay,

811
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,030
the makeup artist may leave now.

812
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,230
Alright, let's get ready.

813
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,510
We'll start now.

814
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,630
Roll the camera.

815
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,030
Action!

816
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,430
Hello, everyone. I'm Jiang Yi.

817
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,190
Let us protect

818
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,470
the finless porpoise's smile together.

819
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,430
Protect the finless porpoise.

820
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,510
There's no time to lose.

821
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,910
Let's take action together.

822
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,190
Cut!

823
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,070
Jiang Yi, that was good.

824
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,830
We'll try again later.

825
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,550
Try to do it with more emotions.

826
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,990
Make your words sound
more sincere and gentle.

827
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,670
Sure, Director.

828
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,470
Brother Yi, drink some water.

829
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,470
Okay.

830
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,310
My phone.

831
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,950
Here you go.

832
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,710
You have a message.

833
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,070
Thank you.

834
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,270
[Thanks for doing the commercial.]

835
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,150
[Good luck. You can do it.]

836
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,070
[Don't worry, sir.]

837
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,020
[I'm working on it now.]

838
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,310
[I'll surely complete the task!]

839
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,190
Thank you.

840
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,310
Do you remember high school?

841
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,350
You were just like them.

842
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,630
You came to watch basketball

843
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,510
and cheered for us at the side.

844
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,830
You got everything set up except a banner.

845
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,030
When you were in the university,

846
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,310
you thought you were
too immature in high school.

847
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,070
But after you worked,

848
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,270
you became a fangirl again.

849
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,300
I never expect you

850
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,790
to last this long.

851
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,150
But I believe

852
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,790
persistence will pay off.

853
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,790
And you'll get a response.

854
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,950
Be it on work,

855
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,190
fangirling

856
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,630
or loving someone.

857
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,030
Why are you so quiet today?

858
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,150
I'm listening to you.

859
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,030
I'll do it for you.

860
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,870
Do you remember

861
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,550
giving me a book as a gift?

862
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,830
I keep it until now.

863
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:10,710
I don't remember.

864
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,950
You...

865
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,990
Shen Bo Qing, don't touch me.

866
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,550
I'm sorry.

867
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,430
Are you sure Yu Sheng Sheng...

868
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,670
I like

869
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,870
this member from Little Galaxy?

870
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,550
Did I not say it's Cheng Le Yi?

871
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,790
I know,

872
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,070
you like Pei Jia Shu.

873
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,670
Why wouldn't it be Jiang Yi?

874
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,190
How could I possibly know

875
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,910
why you don't like Jiang Yi?

876
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,070
Shu Yi is here.

877
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,670
Shu Yi!

878
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,230
Shu Yi goddess!

879
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,150
Be careful.

880
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,670
Thank you.

881
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,870
Thanks, everyone.

882
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,870
Bye.

883
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,830
Shu Yi, you're so pretty!

884
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,310
She's just photogenic.

885
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,590
You're prettier than her in person.

886
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,310
You blind?

887
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,070
Xu Shu Yi is so much prettier.

888
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,140
Be careful.

889
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,430
Don't push.

890
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,110
Be careful.

891
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,430
Xu Shu Yi, I'm your fan!

892
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,110
You have a nice body! You're so pretty!

893
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,630
Thank you, Director.

894
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,790
Good job.

895
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,390
Good job.

896
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,390
Thank you, Director.

897
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,190
We look forward to working with you again.

898
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:24,430
Sure.

899
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,630

902
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,870

[It's so tiring.]

905
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,150
[You have to pay me.]

906

[It's for charity. You won't get paid.]

[I'll thank you with
finless porpoise's smile instead.]

908
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,310
[Okay, I can go with that.]

909
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,630

[We're waiting to get into the studio.]

913
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,910
What's wrong, Brother Yi?

914
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,860
You can go now.

915
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,030
I'm meeting up with a friend.

916
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,390
I'll go back by myself later.

917
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,670
Will you be alright by yourself?

918
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,790
I'll be fine. Bye.

I need to go to the washroom.

921
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,580
It's about time to get in.

922
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,900
Don't take too long.

Okay.

00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,950
You...

925
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,990
Put on sunglasses.

926
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,350
Don't get caught by others.

927
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,470
I'm dressed like this.

928

How could they possibly recognize me?

929
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,550
Jiang Yi, are you here to do the show?

930
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,510
Director Wang,

931
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,030
thanks for taking care of

932
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,950
Brother Yi when he came

933
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,030
for the shooting last time.

934
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,790
You're welcome.

935
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,230
I'll leave you to your work.

936
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,710
Sure.

937
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,870
I need to go soon.

938
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,070
Make it fast.

939
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,910
I apologized to you

940
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,870
and you accepted my apology.

941
00:40:59,310 --> 00:40:59,940
Why would you

942
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,110
go on a date with Shen Bo Qing?

943
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,950
What are you trying to do?

944
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,190
This isn't a date.

945
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,470
He has the tickets

946
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,270
and I want to see the show.

947
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,180
See the show?

948
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,590
You've shot so many shows

949
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,310
and you still want more?

950
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,910
I see what's happening here.

951
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,550
You're using my body

952
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,830
to see Xu Shu Yi, right?

953
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,550
I just want to experience how it feels

954
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,270
to be an audience.

955
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,590

957
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,310
Fine, I should warn you.

Your good friend
