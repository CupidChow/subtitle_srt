Back then, Jia Shu

173
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,470
even told his fans in his concert that

174
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,630
his hope is to sing forever

175
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,670
for his fans.

176
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,700
[He can even answer that?]

177
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,870
[I'm shocked.]

The winner

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,390
in this game session is Brother Yi.

186
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,100
Okay.

187
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,670
That's it for

[Bye.]

195
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,510
Bye.

196
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,190
This weekend is perfect.

197
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,710
I've watched my prince charming's
live broadcast

198
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,270
and contributed to a charity event.

199
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,350
If you have a boyfriend after this,

200
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,670
will he be jealous if he finds out that

201
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,590
you love Jiang Yi so much
until you spend

202
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,190
time and money on him?

203
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,790
Why would he be jealous?

204
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,710
Doctor Shen

205
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,390
is jealous because you like

206
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,630
Pei Jia Shu?

207
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,110
I don't know.

208
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,270
If he's jealous,

209
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,230
it means that he's not confident enough.

210
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,030
The love between a couple

211
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,150
comes from understanding each other,
having feelings

212
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,350
for each other and
accompanying each other.

213
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,150
And idol is for you

214
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,350
to admire and look up to.

215
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,550
Idol is like a totem.

216
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,350
It's totally different.

217
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,630
Am I right?

218
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,110
Yes.

219

Yu Sheng Sheng.

220
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,070
Do you have no feelings

221
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,390
for Doctor Shen

222
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,510
because

223
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,830
you like Pei Jia Shu?

224
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,350
How is that possible?

225
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,910
Do tell me that you are

226
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,230
still dreaming about marrying Pei Jia Shu?

227
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,630
You better wake up.

228
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,190
Keep your idol dream.

229
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,270
When did I

230
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,510
dream about marrying Pei Jia Shu?

231
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,750
Have you forgotten

232
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,310
when you started liking him?

233
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,070
My memory is blurry.

234
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,910
Help me recall it.

235
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,430
During our third year in the university,

236
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,790
Little Galaxy had just debuted.

237
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,780
They had a concert in our university.

238
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,030
[7 Years Ago]

239
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,270
Sheng Sheng.

240
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,460
What happened to your leg?

241
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,030
I thought you went to the library.

242
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,910
What happened?

243
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,710
There's a newly debuted boy band

244
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,550
called Little Galaxy.

245
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,470
They were having a concert
at the west plaza.

246
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,430
I ran into them.

247
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,830
One of them

248
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,030
is really my cup of tea.

249
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,310
His smile is so charming.

250
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,630
After the concert ended,

251
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,500
I went to ask for his autograph.

252
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,870
But there were too many people.

253
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,550
And I fell down from being pushed away.

254
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,070
You are still so happy
although you fell down?

255
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,030
I got to feast my eyes today.

256
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,830
If he was not an artist,

257
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,500
I would have asked him for his number.

258
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,350
He's still new. He's not an artist yet.

259
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,430
Maybe they'll fail.

260
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,430
If he fails,

261
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,550
I'll pursue him!

262
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,670
You are already like this.

263
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,910
And you still want to pursue him.

264
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,870
Let me get you to the infirmary.

265
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,390
My leg is in pain.

266
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,070
Help me buy some iodophor

267
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:06,950
to apply it on my wound.

268
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,110
And then, we'll go to the infirmary.

269
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,150
Okay.

270
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,980
Wait for me then.

271
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:11,950
Don't run around.

272
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,710
So, you are here.

273
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,470
I saw that you left after you fell down.

274
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,710
You must have gotten hurt.

275
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,830
This is for you.

276
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,790
You came all the way here

277
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,070
to give me a bandage?

278
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,430
No.

279
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,590
I'm here to give you this too.

280
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,820
Thank you.

281
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,310
When you come to our concert next time,

282
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,750
remember to be careful.

283
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,750
Okay.

284
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,710
Bye.

285
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:11,990
Bye.

286
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,630
Thank you.

287
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,590
[When did he become an artist?]

288
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,150
Tong Hua.

289
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,350
He's so gentle.

290
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,910
I want to marry him.

291
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,110
Are you out of your mind?

292
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,180
I'm not.

293
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,630
Just now, he came here

294
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,390
to give me this autograph and a bandage.

295
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,710
Look. This is him.

296
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,710
His name is Pei Jia Shu.

297
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,470
Isn't he handsome?

298
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,030
He looks normal.

299
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,470
He's handsome.

300
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,030
His looks and personality

301
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,940
totally match my dream man.

302
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,470
You don't know him.

303
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,110
I'll find out

304
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,390
more about him after this.

305
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,270
Actually...

306
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,270
Tong Hua, from today onwards,

307
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,830
Pei Jia Shu will be one of

308
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,110
the most important people

309
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:56,950
in my life.

310
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,790
He'll be on the same level
with my parents and you.

311
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,740
He's so kind.

312
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,710
You even said that

313
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,950
your encounter

314
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,190
is like a heart-throbbing love plot

315
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,270
between the male and female lead
in a drama.

316
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,270
You still remember, right?

317
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,710
After that, you always forced me

318
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,940
to watch Little Galaxy's videos with you.

319
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,190
That's how I became Jiang Yi's fan.

320
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,420
I was not serious about

321
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,710
marrying Pei Jia Shu.

322
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,510
I hope so.

323
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,190
How does the saying go again?

324
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,230
Don't be afraid of thief,
be afraid of becoming the target.

325
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,030
I'm worried that you'll lose your mind

326
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,070
after targetting him for too long.

327
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,590
That's why I'm warning you.

328
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,430
What is it?

329
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,470
You did well today.

330
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,310
I was just lucky.

331
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,310
I didn't

332
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,510
tell you much about me, right?

333
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,790
How did you find out?

334
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,510
You've

335
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,740
talked about them in your interviews

336
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,060
and shows, right?

337
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,510
You watched my interviews?

338
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,710
You remember the date

339
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,590
of my concert so clearly.

340
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,830
I...

341
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,070
It's because...

342
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,150
I knew about this session.

343
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,270
So, I did my research.

344
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,310
I see.

345
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,190
Looks like you are quite competitive.

346
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,590
No.

347
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,990
I'm not being competitive.

348
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,670
I just...

349
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,550
Keep this up.

350
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,470
I like to compete with others too.

351
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,990
If you and Le Yi

352
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,990
are both so mellow,

353
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,150
I'll lose my fighting spirit.

354

[Finally, I can catch my breath.]

Don't come too near to me.

361
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,590
What if we switch again?

362
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,310
Let's give it a try then.

Are you really going to do it?

371

Yes.

372

I was waiting for you to call me.

389

I'm afraid that there might be
others beside you.

Yes. You did well.

No.

My body is the one without good sleep.

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,510
Really?

516
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,510
Actually, I've already guessed it.

517
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,230
I'm a man

518
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,470
having period for you.

519
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,030
What is happening?

520
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,030
Calm down.

521
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,430
It's your period now.

522
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,630
It's your period.

523
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,830
No. It's our period.

524
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,870
[You are in the toilet now, right?]

525
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,790
Yes.

526
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:52,990
That's good.

527
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,830
Luckily, you realised it yourself.

528
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,790
No one saw you.

529
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,510
[You have a pad with you, right?]

530
00:25:59,270 --> 00:25:59,630
No.

531
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,190
I didn't realise it myself.

532
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,790
[Your colleague saw it.]

533
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,190
Don't tell me that

534
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,910
you listened to my advice

535
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,380
and wore the floral dress.

536
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,070
No, I didn't.

537
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,590
Good.

538
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,710
It's a white dress

539
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,540
that I chose.

540
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,380
Pure white?

541
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,630
What should I do now?

542
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,030
I don't know anything.

543
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,150
Okay.

544
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,870
Calm down, Jiang Yi.

545
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,750
Send a message to Tong Hua now.

546
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,430
Ask her to send you some clothes

547
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,510
and some sanitary pads.

548
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,030
Call me after you've changed.

549
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,590
Okay?

550
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,910
Okay.

551
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,830
I need to calm down right now.

552
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,190
[No.]

553
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,580
[This is Jiang Yi's body.]

554
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,870
[I cannot kill him.]

555
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,150
[The person I like]

556
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,030
[is having a period for me.]

557
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,270
[What kind of]

558
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,390
[calamity is this?]

559
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,990
[How can I live after this?]

560
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,750
[Someone, save me!]

561
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,710
You got it?

562
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,030
Yes.

563
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,230
Well.

564
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,700
What's the difference between
day use and night use?

565
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,190
Exactly like what it means.

566
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,790
Is there a lot right now?

567
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,270
What do you mean?

568
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,820
That.

569
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,390
What do you mean by a lot?

570
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,750
Forget it.

571
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,470
Don't care about that now.

572
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,790
Wear your pad

573
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:02,750
and change your clothes first.

574
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,750
How do I use it?

575
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,110
Brother.

576
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,990
Can you

577
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,070
look it up online?

578
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,910
How can I

579
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,710
explain it to you?

580
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,310
Besides, this is really awkward for me.

581
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,990
It's awkward for me too.

582
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,270
Now, not only my stomach is in pain,

583
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,670
my breast is swelling.

584
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,470
What should I do?

585
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,750
Massage it.

586
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:20,990
Okay.

587
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,110
No.

588
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,510
You can't massage it.

589
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,670
I made you a cup of brown sugar water.

590
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,550
Drink it while it's hot.

591
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,030
How could you forget
your menstruation date?

592
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,110
You even wore a white dress.

593
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,830
Thank you.

594
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,030
[Having period is like this.]

595
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,390
[Your waist will be sore and
your breast will swell.]

596
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,590
[Your lower abdomen will be in pain.]

597
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,110
[Sometimes, you'll feel cold.]

598
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,830
[Anyway, it'll be quite uncomfortable.]

599
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,190
[Sorry that you have to endure it.]

600
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,390
[I always got hurt]

601
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,710
[in dance practices and
when I was acting.]

602
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,550
[How painful]

603
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,590
[can a period be?]

604
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,710
Sheng Sheng, are you okay?

605
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,430
Let me get you a painkiller.

606
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,030
Don't torture yourself.

607
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,190
Curly.

608
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,830
Why are you so free today

609
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,830
to drink coffee with me?

610
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,940
What do you want? I'll go and order.

611
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,550
I've already ordered

612
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,470
latte for you.

613
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,790
Have a seat.

614
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,070
Thank you.

615
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,710
I'll treat you to a meal later.

616
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,950
It's okay. I have things to do later.

617
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,430
You have something good for me?

618
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:11,830
No.

619
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,670
But I want to ask for your help.

620
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,110
Help?

621
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,430
Culture and Entertainment Detective

622
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,390
is from your company, right?

623
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,670
Yes. Why?

624
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,380
I've taken some photos lately.

625
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,830
It's about Jiang Yi

626
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,550
and a woman.

627
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,950
Jiang Yi is in a relationship?

628
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:25,830
With whom?

629
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,310
I don't know for sure yet.

630
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,350
After I took a photo

631
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,550
of him and his father last time,

632
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,670
the security

633
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,910
in that mansion has been raised.

634
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,630
It'll be hard for me

635
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,270
to capture his photos again.

636
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,310
Can you show me the photos?

637
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,030
I can't show them to you yet.

638
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,470
But in my experience,

639
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,030
something fishy must be going on for

640
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,470
Jiang Yi to take such a long leave.

641
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,630
How can I help you?

642
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,190
Culture and Entertainment Detective

643
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,550
has interviewed

644
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,180
Jiang Yi and Cheng Le Yi
from Little Galaxy.

645
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm sure they have a connection.

646
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,350
Talk to your colleagues

647
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,990
to get some information.

648
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,190
If it's a big news,

649
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,150
I'll give it to you first.

650
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,510
Okay. I'll give it a try.

651
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,670
[Why do I]

652
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,740
[need to change so many times?]

653
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,150
[Practice makes perfect.]

654
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,590
[You can use this chance to practise.]

655
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,070
[Did you think that]

656
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,710
[you can use one pack of
sanitary pads for a year?]

657
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,940
[So funny.]

658
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,270
[Don't add weird emoticons]

659
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,470
[to my WeChat.]

660
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,060
[I didn't add them.]

661
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,670
[I made them myself.]

662
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,620
Is the painkiller working?

663
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:01,790
Yes.

664
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,190
Don't you think it's too over the top?

665
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,180
What do you mean?

666
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,940
I like Pei Jia Shu

667
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,870
just because

668
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,070
he gave me a bandage.

669
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,550
Although

670
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,510
I hate Pei Jia Shu,

671
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,030
I can understand.

672
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,110
You had an intimate moment

673
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,430
with your idol.

674
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,140
The majority of the people

675
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,110
will not have a chance to

676
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,150
stand beside their idols
in their entire life.

677
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,590
Most of them can only look at their idols

678
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,590
from afar in events

679
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,470
or concerts.

680
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,870
And it'll already be
very memorable for them.

681
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,790
Yours is really classic.

682
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,190
If they can get to know their idols

683
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,830
and eat with them?

684
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,790
I can't imagine it.

685
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:45,950
If your idol

686
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,230
gives you some sort of signal,

687
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,350
you'll easily fall for him.

688
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,030
Reporter Yu.

689
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,710
I'll call you Sheng Sheng after this.

690
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,830
Okay.

691
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,070
Is that bitter gourd in this soup?

692
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,230
Yes. It'll be cooling for your body.

693
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,790
Let me serve it to you.

694
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,150
It's okay.

695
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,950
I can do it myself.

696
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,390
Don't worry about it.

697
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,430
Sheng Sheng, thank you.

698
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,150
Here's a little gift for you.

699
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,990
Thank you.

700
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,230
It's not something expensive.

701
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,550
It's just a skincare product that
I'm endorsing.

702
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,710
It'll be useful for you.

703
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,110
Thank you for your gift.

704
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,910
I'll definitely use it.

705
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,750
Hello?

706
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,150
I took a leave.

707
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,790
I'll put my things at home first

708
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,510
and I'll go to find you.

709
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,550
You want to come here to find me?

710
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,070
You are unwell.

711
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,910
You better stay put.

712
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,910
I'm unwell. That's why
you need to take care of me.

713
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,390
This is aftersales service.

714
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,110
I have no problem with that.

715
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,790
But Jia Shu is here.

716
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,750
Are you sure you can come?

717
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,950
Just find an excuse.

718
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,870
[Besides,]

719
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,350
about me kissing you yesterday,

720
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,710
I want to tell you something face-to-face.

721
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,110
Come over here then.

722
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,260
[See you later.]

723
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,910
[He wants to talk about]

724
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,270
[that kiss?]

725
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,670
[Don't tell me that
there'll be a miracle.]

726
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,780
Sheng Sheng.

727
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,910
Where are you going?

728
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,190
Home.

729
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,830
I see.

730
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,670
What is it in the bag?

731
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,390
Something delicious?

732
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,710
A dress with blood on it.

733
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,710
Do you want to eat it?

734
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,390
Are you joking?

735
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,470
I'm not.

736
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:51,790
Bye.

737
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,870
[Door opened.]

738
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:31,910
Come in now.

739
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,630
Why are you wearing like this?

740
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,070
I already told you that

741
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,950
Jia Shu is at home today.

742
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,270
Why are you in a tracksuit again?

743
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,510
I dirtied my clothes.

744
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,430
So, I went back to change.

745
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,070
You can change into other clothes.

746
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,790
Wait.

747
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,910
Why didn't you wear a lipstick?

748
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,310
You didn't put on foundation too.

749
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,820
Why do you

750
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,670
look so pale?

751
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,830
You are wearing a cap.

752
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,750
Don't tell me that
you didn't wash my hair.

753
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,350
Did you do this on purpose?

754
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,060
Yes. I did this on purpose.

755
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,420
Reporter Yu?

756
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,590
She's here to learn about
cradling walnuts from me.

757
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,460
She wants to get a pair for her dad.

758
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,630
So filial.

759
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:28,950
Sheng Sheng.

760
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,990
Greet your dad for me.

761
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,380
Please call me Reporter Yu.

762
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,190
She likes this title.

763
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,270
It sounds friendly to her.

764
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:40,790
Reporter Yu.

765
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,910
Have you used the mask I gave you?

766
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:43,910
No.

767
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,430
It's from an idol.

768
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,910
So, she feels bad to use it.

769
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,790
You look pale.

770
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,910
Remember to use it.

771
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,790
Right?

772
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,870
I said the same to her too.

773
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,230
Jia Shu.

774
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,230
If there's nothing else,

775
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,110
we'll go up first.

776
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,910
Okay.

777
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,630
Reporter Yu.

778
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,710
I just signed some posters.

779
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,390
Do you want it?

780
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:17,670
No.

781
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,750
She already has it.

782
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,830
So, she doesn't need it.

783
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,500
Go and do your things.

784
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,550
She's indeed a fake fan.

785
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,140
What's wrong with you today?

786
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,350
What do you mean?

787
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,470
Are you holding a grudge towards

788
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,430
Pei Jia Shu or me?

789
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,750
You were so rude.

790
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,110
Didn't we agree that

791
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:50,870
we'll take care of each other

792
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,990
after the body swap?

793
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,910
Does taking care of your life

794
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,750
include chasing after your idol for you?

795
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,830
Even if we ignore that,

796
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:57,830
you are

797
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,030
acting very strangely

798
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,790
as Yu Sheng Sheng today.

799
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,950
Your acting is too bad.

800
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,790
Or do you want

801
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,430
others to know

802
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,310
about our secret?

803
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,230
Are you not feeling well?

804
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,630
My stomach is in pain.

805
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:15,950
See?

806
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,510
Now you know

807
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,460
how painful period is.

808
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,750
Do you want me to massage it for you?

809
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,500
Okay.

810
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,380
Get into the bed.

811
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,070
Now you know

812
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,230
how hard it is to be a woman.

813
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,190
We have to

814
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,750
experience this pain every month.

815
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,950
Forget it.

816
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,030
I'll forget about being awkward.

817
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,110
Just think of this as an experience.

818
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,470
I don't need to experience it.

819
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,830
Maybe it'll help you with your acting.

820
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,630
I'm a man.

821
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,470
Where would I need this experience for?

822
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,460
For example, a movie about body swap
between man and woman.

823
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,470
Do you feel better?

824
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,310
Yes.

825
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,870
My breast is swelling too.

826
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,630
Don't be so greedy.

827
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,990
This is your breast.

828
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,230
This is your hand.

829
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,430
Yes.

830
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:38,990
You are right.

831
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,230
It's inappropriate.

832
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,550
Massage my waist for me then.

833
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,910
This is my first time looking at

834
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,070
my body from this point of view.

835
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,140
I never thought that my body
will look so good.

836
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,430
Don't be too arrogant.

837
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,190
By the way,

838
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,150
you called to say that

839
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,510
you have something to tell me.

840
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,430
What is it?

841
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,190
Yu Sheng Sheng.

842
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,350
I kissed you yesterday.

843
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:43,750
Actually...

844
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,270
Jiang Yi.

845
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,870
Are you cooking?

846
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,310
I think something is burnt.

847
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:51,990
This is bad.

848
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,630
I forgot that I was cooking porridge.

849
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,620
♫ The night is used to
the pitch-black darkness ♫

850
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,060
♫ It never thought that it'd someday ♫

851
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,580
♫ Cross paths with brightness ♫

852
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,330
♫ The shooting star
must be missing someone ♫

853
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,690
♫ To be diving hard without hesitation ♫

854
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:38,670
♫ Towards a better tomorrow
in brave pursuit ♫

855
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,880
♫ If it's possible for love ♫

856
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,700
♫ To be present in this dull life ♫

857
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,350
♫ Like the stars in the night ♫

858
