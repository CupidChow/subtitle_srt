[The Day of Becoming You]

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,020
[Episode 5]

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,630
You and Shu Yi are only good friend.

29
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,630
Okay.

30
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,110
Let me remind you.

31
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,500
This good friend of yours

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,030
is a fishery manager.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,390
Manager?

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,030
What do you mean?

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,150
A fishery manager

36
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,670
is in charge of fish-farming.

37
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,870
Having many targets, casting the net,

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,190
feeding fishes

39
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,030
like you guys

40
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,790
and you will all get frisky.

41
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,220
She focuses on training

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,070
those with good

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,390
popularity and status,

44
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,430
she feeds them more

45
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,230
and she'll pick the most juicy one

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,030
and eat it at last.

47
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,580
You treat her as your good friend.

48
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,870
But this good friend of yours

49
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,270
has a lot of good friends.

50
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,270
You're a girl too.

51
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,430
Why do you

52
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,670
maliciously speculate
on the other girl?

53
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,710
Do you know her?

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,750
I don't maliciously speculate on her.

55
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,350
I have proof.

56
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,550
The first proof.

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,390
Right, Yi,

58
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,750
the demo you sent me last time

59
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,740
is really great.

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,310
Every word in the lyrics

61
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,470
hits my heart.

62
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,950
She tries to build connection
with the other parties

63
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,670
and praise the things
they care about.

64
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,630
This can buy her some goodwill

65
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,070
and increase invisible intimacy as well.

66
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,430
Shu Yi is not praising me.

67
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,750
It's true that

68
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,390
I'm talented.

69
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,980
Look at you, you're being clumsy.

70
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,070
It's not applied accurately.

71
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,310
Second proof,

72
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,430
she makes the boys

73
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,150
think that they are special to her

74
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,190
and makes them

75
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,190
imagine things

76
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,150
through natural and close

77
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,670
physical contact with them.

78
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,590
It's normal

79
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,550
to have this level of physical contact

80
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,990
with friends.

81
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,620
Third proof,

82
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,390
she never managed
two fishes at the same time.

83
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,020
She shares the same towel

84
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,790
with our Shu Shu

85
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,430
when you're not around, man!

86
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,980
It's too intimate.

87
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,390
Obviously, she did it purposely.

88
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,550
Shu Yi's always been

89
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,470
a carefree person.

90
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,910
If she was carefree,

91
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,750
she wouldn't have

92
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,390
pretended to be a tough girl,
only in front of the camera.

93
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,790
She is real smart.

94
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,870
She knew she won't

95
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,150
be assaulted because of

96
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,870
having physical contact

97
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,670
in this way and
this will gain the fans' favour.

98
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,110
The truth is hidden in these details.

99
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,110
Why can't you see it?

100
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,190
Xu Shu Yi, she is...

101
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,630
Enough!

102
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,540
I don't wish to hear words of

103
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,270
discrediting Shu Yi from my lips.

104
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,510
I already showed

105
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,590
you many evidences.

106
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,870
How am I discrediting her?

107
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,430
Am I this untrustworthy?

108
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,590
Entertainment reporters like you

109
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,190
are good to make things up.

110
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,190
Stop there!

111
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,550
I warn you.

112
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,590
I don't wish to hear you say words

113
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,430
of discrediting

114
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,630
entertainment reporters from my lips.

115
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,030
What's wrong with being
an entertainment reporter?

116
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,750
Which stars can live

117
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,740
without the entertainment reporters?

118
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,350
Okay.

119
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,350
You look down on
an entertainment reporter, right?

120
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,630
I'll bet on

121
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,230
the dignity of an entertainment reporter

122
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,750
and tell you

123
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,070
that you, Jiang Yi,

124
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,620
are one of the fishes in Xu Shu Yi's

125
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,310
fishery.

126
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,910
Don't think that you're special.

127
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,910
Sheng Sheng, it's time for admission.

128
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,870
Is that your friend?

129
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,470
[I've finished recording, it's exhausted.
You need to pay me.]

130
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,910
[There's no pay for public
service advertisement.]

131
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,260
[Use the smile of finless
porpoise to thank you. ]

132
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,810
[Okay, it's acceptable.
What are you doing?]

133
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,330
[Shen Bo Qing invites me
to "Super Fun Weekend".]

134
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:17,570
[I'm waiting for admission.]

135
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,020
[Meet you at the small gate
on the west side of first floor.]

136
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,870
Here you go.

137
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,590
Our Sheng Sheng

138
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,270
is good at saving money for me.

139
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,630
We had a deal that this is my treat

140
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,990
and you're satisfied
by just having fried chickens.

141
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,950
I haven't had them in a long time,
I wish to eat them.

142
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,150
You don't like

143
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,230
Cheng Le Yi, indeed.

144
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,310
You didn't scream

145
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,150
with those girls

146
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,870
throughout the show.

147
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,830
So someone denies only in words

148
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,190
but the body answers honestly that

149
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,390
you want to hang out with me.

150
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,470
What did you say?

151
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,670
Who is the friend that

152
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,430
we met at the auditorium?

153
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,470
You've gotten in a bad mood

154
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,910
since you met him.

155
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,940
What's going on?

156
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,910
He's just an

157
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,230
ordinary friend of mine.

158
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,230
We had conflict.

159
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,350
It's nothing.

160
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,580
Is he your ex-boyfriend?

161
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,030
Of course not.

162
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,110
That's good.

163
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,310
It's inevitable

164
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,190
about quarrelling with friends.

165
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,780
Don't mind him.

166
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,070
Try this, it's delicious.

167
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,350
Brother Yi,

168
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,830
what's wrong?

169
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,790
Did you see those criticisms

170
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,070
on the internet after
checking the phone?

171
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,550
Sort of.

172
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,190
An absolute criticism.

173
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,270
It's real bad.

174
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,510
Eat some small tomatoes.

175
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,110
It's more depressing
to be on Taoist diet

176
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,430
if you gain weight.

177
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
You'll gain weight with

178
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,950
drinking cold water when
you're going to gain weight.

179
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,430
The louder they curses on the internet,

180
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,350
the darker their real life is.

181
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,350
If these trolls

182
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,470
live a comfortable life,

183
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,300
they wouldn't have to

184
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,510
find their presence by

185
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,030
being trolls on the internet.

186
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,790
Brother Yi, you should
learn this from me.

187
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,350
Relax,

188
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,270
hold it and don't read them.

189
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,300
Is it possible?

190
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,430
That's amazing.

191
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,510
If you can't hold it,
just create another account

192
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,430
and fire back.

193
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,830
[We just finished recording.]

194
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,390
[Babies in the audience
were very enthusiastic.]

195
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,150
[Be safe on the way home.]

196
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,670
[Don't make me worry.]

197
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,830
[I wish to swing on brother's]

198
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,830
[eyelashes.]

199
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,830
[You look cute in a simple shot.]

200
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,430
[Brother, I like it.]

201
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,950
[Le Yi is so sweet.]

202
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,340
[He's so ugly.]

203
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,870
[Why did he act cute
with that kind of look?]

204
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,030
[I suggest you to reincarnate.]

205
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,830
I...

206
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,270
You're ugly, so is
your whole family.

207
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,630
[So this is the legendary
devil with an angelic face.]

208
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,510
Stupid trolls,

209
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,030
why do I have to put up with him?

210
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,110
Making myself feel
good is what matters.

211
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,180
[Oh my god!]

212
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,830
[He's brutal but cute.]

213
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,310
[Le Yi,]

214
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,910
[mother loves you!]

215
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,910
Brother Yi,

216
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,830
you need to learn more from me.

217
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,150
Or you can look at

218
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,230
the things you like.

219
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,390
It's very healing.

220
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,030
[I can't do this.]

221
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,270
[He's too cute.]

222
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,470
[I'm having a heart attack.]

223
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,630
Thanks for today.

224
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,390
The supper you want.

225
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,910
Goodbye.

226
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,190
Hold on.

227
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,310
Anything else?

228
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,350
Sheng Sheng,

229
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,230
I understand

230
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,230
it's hard for you

231
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,470
to see me as

232
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,310
your boyfriend

233
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,550
at the moment.

234
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,990
But I hope that you could consider it.

235
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,390
Tell me the answer.

236
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,670
It's useless to say this to me now.

237
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,830
You don't have to

238
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,190
reject me so soon.

239
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,190
I don't mean that.

240
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,470
I can't give you

241
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,670
the answer now.

242
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,750
I might be able to answer you afterwards.

243
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,710
Because I can't

244
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,630
decide for myself of tomorrow.

245
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,550
Do you understand?

246
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,750
I understand.

247
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,950
Are you sure?

248
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,990
I've been waiting for so long.

249
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,270
I don't mind to wait a few more days.

250
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,270
Hold on.

251
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,710
This is for you.

252
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,470
I'll wait for you.

253
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,430
Then just wait.

254
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,790
Thank you.

255
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,590
[He still hasn't apologize to me]

256
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,700
[yet he's angry,]

257
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,070
[what's wrong with him?]

258
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,140
I'm really not comfortable with this.

259
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,670
Are you silly?

260
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,150
Are you blind?

261
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,870
You even look down on me!

262
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:10,790
Isn't

263
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,790
an entertainment reporter a reporter?

264
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,950
They bring happiness
to everyone as well.

265
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,980
I'll unmask you

266
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,710
and take you to death

267
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,790
when I'm back.

268
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,070
[Maybe]

269
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,870
[I can take a nude photo to threaten him.]

270
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,470
[Calm down, calm down.]

271
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,710
Didn't he say he doesn't
accept gifts from fans?

272
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,590
Why didn't he open them?

273
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,110
[Yi,]

274
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,150
[happy 26th birthday.]

275

[Don't forget to eat
even if you're busy.]

276

[I saw you guys release a new album.]

277

[It's great.]

278
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,830
[Congratulations!]

279
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,150
[From mother.]

280
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,030
[Yi,]

281

[you're an adult now
as you turn 18.]

[You might gradually go through]

283
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,470
[a lot in the future.]

284
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,510
[You need to do your best]

285
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,830
[and take care of yourself.]

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,990
[I love you.]

287
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,020
[It's Jiang Yi's father.]

288
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,310
[Yi, it's urgent.]

289
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,550
[Quickly answer my call!]

290
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,190
Hello.

291
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,510
Yi,

292
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,310
how do you feel after taking rest?

293
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,310
I'm fine.

294
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,110
[That's great.]

295
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,470
[I tell you what.]

296
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,790
The elderly in your aunt's house is sick.

297
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,550
We have to return to
the hometown for a few days.

298
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,510
No one takes care of Mo Mo.

299
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,070
I want to send her to

300
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,910
your place for a few days.

301
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,230
[You have many assistants]

302
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,910
[and Mo Mo is well-behaved.]

303
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,150
I...

304
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,550
[I really have no choice.]

305
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,310
Mo Mo insists to go to your place.

306
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,710
She won't trouble you.

307
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,630
Or I'll find Jiang Da Chuan

308
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,350
to settle this.

309
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,590
No need for that.

310
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,070
Okay, just send her over.

311
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,510
I told you.

312
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,470
Yi won't leave

313
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,270
his own little sister alone.

314
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,070
Okay.

315
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,070
That's great.

on the day after tomorrow.]

[Sorry to trouble you, Yi.]

318

[I want to go home.]

Your parents are asleep.

410
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,590
Do you want to come up

411

and wake them up to

412

take a photo with you?

413
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,390
Don't do it.

414
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,230
Or they would think

415
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,150
I'm in a relationship.

416
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,390
Did

417

my parents sense anything?

418
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,710
No.

419
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,590
Are you their child?

420
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,030
They didn't even know you get switched.

421
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,630
Jia Shu, Le Yi and Jiang Da Chuan

422
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,390
didn't notice

423
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,430
you get switched as well.

424
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,710
This is normal.

425
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,350
Who would think about this?

426
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,990
Do your fans know

427
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,150
you're snarky?

428
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,950
Tong Hua likes you being

429
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,190
humble, luxurious and insightful.

430
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,190
You're going to lose fans.

431
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,790
It's true that only you know this.

432
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,390
I apologize

433
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,910
for what happened today.

434
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,630
I said the wrong thing.

435
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,750
I shouldn't have said that to you.

436
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,670
I didn't despise
entertainment reporters.

437
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,310
I know there's no

438
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,190
disinformation and fake news

439
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,030
on the official account

440
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,310
that you and Tong Hua created.

441
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,150
Actually,

442
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,150
I should apologize too.

443
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,150
I shouldn't have

444
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,430
spoken ill of Xu Shu Yi in front of you.

445
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,470
After all,

446
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,110
you treat her as your friend.

447
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,470
It's fine.

448
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,790
You don't know her after all.

449
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,150
She is carefree and simple-minded.

450
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,510
Eat it, it'll get oily
if you don't eat it.

451
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,150
Get oily?

452
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,110
Since I'm

453
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,270
a bit special,

454
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,910
then can I know

455
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,590
your little secret?

456
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,750
Go ahead.

457
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,830
Why don't you

458
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,510
get along with our Shu Shu?

459
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,710
No such thing.

460
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,790
But you guys

461
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,830
don't talk much.

462
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,590
Yes.

463
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,510
We don't talk much personally.

464
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,460
Isn't that not getting along?

465
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,230
No.

466
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,910
We have nothing to talk
as our personalities are different.

467
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,950
I got it.

468
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,670
You two are like

469
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,110
an arranged marriage by the parents.

470
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,710
The life is tolerable

471
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,470
as you live together

472
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,430
for a long time but you're not soulmates.

473
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,710
This metaphor of yours

474
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,870
sounds a bit strange.

475
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,470
It's fine as long as it's right.

476
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,110
But our Shu Shu

477
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,030
is cute and nice,

478
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,070
you should be more

479
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,150
initiative and talk to him.

480
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,790
He's probably being shy.

481
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,630
I don't think he's being shy.

482
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,230
And

483
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,110
don't always send me

484
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,660
your candid snapshots of him.

485
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,470
I sent them to myself.

486
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,550
Just save them,

487
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,510
none of your business.

488
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,790
Do you ask me these

489
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,390
to write on the official account?

490
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,150
Who do you think I am?

491
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,420
Then who was the one
pretending to be my fan

492
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,350
on my birthday party?

493
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,070
I...

494
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,660
It's sour.

495
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,070
So sour.

496
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,870
There are many mosquitoes

497
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,030
on such windy day.

498
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,430
You came home late.

499
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,470
Where have you been?

500
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,950
I went to meet a friend.

501
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,350
It's rare that you have friend.

502
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,270
Jia Shu.

503
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,900
What?

504
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,230
Just say it.

505
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,550
My mask is drying.

506
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,710
Are you still mad?

507
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,230
I am.

508
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,710
I don't want to talk to you.

509
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,350
In today's meeting,

510
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,750
I would first like to praise

511
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,350
team of
Culture and Entertainment Detective.

512
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,910
You've done a great job

513
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,590
on the exclusive interview

514
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,670
with Jiang Yi last week.

515
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,870
You uncovered

516
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,870
many interesting stuffs.

517
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,270
It's been read by
more than 300,000 people.

518
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,270
It's forwarded by Big V bloggers

519
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,790
and it's trending on Weibo.

520
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,820
Come, let's give them
a round of applause.

521
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,070
Thank you.

522
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,470
It's mainly because

523
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,750
Jiang Yi is influential.

524
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,110
We have to continue to work hard.

525
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,150
Yes, you're lucky.

526
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,830
You've got the advantage.

527
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,750
Right,

528
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,350
being lucky

529
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,550
is a part of our strength too.

530
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,510
Hope that you have good luck

531
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,030
and don't lose fans again.

532
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,710
Quickly catch up with our team.

533
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,430
So that it won't seem like

534
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,310
we're showing off

535
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,380
when we're talking about

536
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,260
the advertising revenue

537
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,710
during meeting afterwards.

538
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,590
Am I right,

539
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,350
Yu Sheng Sheng, the big detective?

540
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,910
Anyway, you did a great job.

541
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,660
Impressive!

542
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,830
Okay, cut to the chase.

543
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,030
Talk about the topic
you choose for next week.

544
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,710
Start from Zhang Zhi Xiao.

545
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,070
Apart from the daily hot topic,

546
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,950
we don't have any

547
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,870
special topic,

548
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,350
they are all regular tweets.

549
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,670
Just that Yu Sheng Sheng and Tong Hua

550
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,140
can interview
an advanced start like Jiang Yi,

551
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,460
this makes me curious

552
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,470
if there's any amazing

553
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,990
topic arrangement that you have.

554
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,910
We'll keep focusing on the hot topics

555
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,350
and some regular tweets on next week.

556
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,870
And we'll follow up the news about

557
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,470
Zhang Xiao Quan having an affair.

558
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,830
Zhang Xiao Quan?

559
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,190
Zhang Xiao Quan is a recognized player,

560
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,990
there're clear shots about it too.

561
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,710
This is

562
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,270
not a fresh news,

563
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,990
the readers are tired of reading it.

564
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,670
And you're planning

565
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,790
to write a series for him.

566
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,550
Who would want to read it?

567
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,030
Do you guys want to read it?

568
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,670
It seems to be boring.

569
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,550
We think something is fishy

570
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,190
in this case of Zhang Xiao Quan

571
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,190
having an affair.

572
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,710
So you guys really plan to
investigate this case?

573
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,990
It's a bit risky.

574
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,630
That'll be awful if it's

575
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,470
seen as an article
which Zhang Xiao Quan

576
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,590
spends money to whiten himself.

577
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,550
Write it out for me.

578
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:14,830
What about Peng Ke's team?

579
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,590
We're going to take fans

580
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,910
to the roadside movie preview,

581
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,310
interview the creator and

582
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,630
follow up an issue of movie review.

583
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,790
Are Gao Xuan and Zhou Xi Zhe going?

584
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,310
They look great together.

585
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,030
You ask them

586
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,140
if they are together.

587
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,790
Aren't they already married?

588
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,790
We were going to keep it
as a secret for one of

589
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,190
our topics in next week.

590
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,670
Why did you spill the beans?

591
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,150
Where are you going?

592
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,950
I'm not feeling well.

593
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,310
I've taken the day off to go home.

594
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,390
Sit down.

595
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,790
Let me ask you.

596
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,060
How did you know

597
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,710
about the marriage

598
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,630
of Gao Xuan and Zhou Xi Zhe?

599
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,110
[Because I gave them wedding gift.]

600
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,830
I heard it from friend.

601
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,750
Which friend?
Do you have evidence?

602
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,230
I do.

603
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,390
But I wish to go back and rest.

604
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,670
Are you up to something recently?

605
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,030
No.

606
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,750
When are you going
to move back home?

607
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,150
It's inconvenient for you to come to work.

608
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,510
After a few days.

609
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,990
You must tell me if anything

610
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,030
makes you unhappy.

611
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,230
Don't keep it inside.

612
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,350
Don't stress yourself out.

613
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,550
You have me.

614
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,550
Get some rest.

615
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,470
Go back.

616
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,750
Bye bye.

617
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,190
Does Yu Sheng Sheng

618
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,230
hook up with

619
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,230
some big shot lately?

620
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,990
I guess

621
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,430
she rides one's coattails.

622
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,230
Can't a big star

623
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,390
have concept of time?

624
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,710
Didn't I go on meeting for you?

625
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,150
The traffic is a bit congested today.

626
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,070
I'll pull you up.

627
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,830
Don't you think it's like Korean drama?

628
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,070
My legs are numb.

629
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,150
My legs are numb.

630
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,590
My legs are numb.

631
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,470
We don't

632
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,710
have to post strange
gesture today, right?

633
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,860
But physical contact
is still needed, right?

634
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,340
It's so small.

635
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,790
I mean your hand.

636
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,150
It's your hand.

637
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,670
Right.

638
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,910
Do you feel anything?

639
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,390
Now, I feel

640
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,110
a bit cold.

641
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,940
Are we going to switch back?

642
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,830
You're standing under an air conditioner.

643
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,790
Then how do you feel?

644
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,790
I feel nothing.

645
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,310
Thunderstorm, elevator,

646
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,470
physical contact.

647
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,270
These conditions are met.

648
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,660
Except that the elevator didn't fall.

649
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,420
This is an unexpected condition.

650
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,470
We can't fulfil that.

651
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,190
The falling of the elevator

652
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,870
is a kind of strong stimulation.

653
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,510
We might need this kind of

654
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:00,670
weightlessness

655
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,030
or terror,

656
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,750
trepidation,

657
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,630
thrill and so forth.

658
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,020
I've got an idea.

659
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:19,870
Tell me.

660
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,270
Give me the umbrella.

661
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,310
This looks like poster colour.

662
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,540
Right, and this colour...

663
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,590
Thank you.

664
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,670
You're welcome.

665
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,630
We've finally switched back.

666
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,630
My C cup.

667
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,950
What is there to be embarrassed about?

668
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,190
It's not like
you've never touched it before.

669
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,550
Can you be conscious

670
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,750
of your image in the public area?

671
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,030
It's great, Jiang Yi!

672
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:53,710
It's great!

673
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,230
We've finally switched back.

674
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,190
Thank goodness!

675
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,950
Thanks to my father and mother!

676
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,070
Thanks to the elevator!

677
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,950
If I couldn't switch back,

678
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,540
I was going to die in your body.

679
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,630
Enough.

680
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,310
I won't die in your body anyway.

681
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,870
Jiang Yi,

682
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,110
let's go eat something delicious

683
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,070
to celebrate.

684
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,470
Let's go.

685
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,310
I'm not hungry.

686
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,590
Do you know how hard it was

687
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,070
for me to eat greens in your body?

688
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,190
Let's go.

689
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,060
You won't gain weight by having a meal.

690
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,670
Cheers!

691
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,670
This is to celebrate

692
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,630
we spent time together

693
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,150
on a magical journey

694
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,950
which is unbelievable.

695
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,470
True.

696
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,900
No one would believe us if we say it.

697
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:36,870
Moreover,

698
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,670
there's no privacy

699
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,350
between both of us.

700
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,820
Human is a kind of

701
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,470
creature which has strong adaptability.

702
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,070
I've gotten used to

703
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,750
the way I bath

704
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,750
and use the bathroom.

705
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,350
I'm not used to it.

706
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,390
Don't you have fun

707
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,750
on experiencing other's life?

708
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:54,670
I don't.

709
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,590
You're right.

710
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,270
My house is small

711
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,950
and my parents are always nagging.

712
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,030
I didn't mean that.

713
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,990
Your parents are nice

714
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,630
and your father is a good cook.

715
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,780
Just that it's hard for me,

716
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,910
as a man,

717
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,790
to turn into a girl.

718
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,990
It's hard for both of us.

719
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,630
Congratulations

720
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,950
on returning to your own life.

721
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,190
Eat more greens.

722
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,270
What about you?

723
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,670
Do you think it's fun to turn into me?

724
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,150
If it was a week ago,

725
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,740
I would think it'd be very fun

726
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,910
and I'd be excited.

727
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,870
If I were to exchange body

728
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,750
with my man crush,

729
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,990
I'd immediately post an update

730
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,900
to announce

731
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,590
our relationship by using his Weibo.

732
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,630
You can use my Weibo

733
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,430
to post an update

734
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,430
and tag you and Jia Shu

735
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,310
to congratulate you two on tying the knot.

736
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,510
That's why

737
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,870
self-fulfilling can only

738
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,030
rely on imagination.

739
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,150
If we indulge ourselves in reality,

740
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,550
we'll end up getting ourselves killed

741
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,790
and getting ripped to pieces by fans.

742
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,230
It's true.

743
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,510
Greedy people

744
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,430
never end well.

745
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,390
And

746
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,390
why am I afraid of meeting

747
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,300
other people?

748
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,350
I don't know what to say.

749
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,430
It's inappropriate

750
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,470
to say nothing.

751
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,510
Just like playing Minesweeper,

752
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,430
I don't know if I said anything wrong.

753
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,270
I'm frightened in every minute.

754
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,350
Don't you think so?

755
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,830
I think I'm doing fine,

756
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,670
I can handle it.

757
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,830
You're a great actor.

758
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,550
The mental quality of a big star

759
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,350
is amazing.

760
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,270
Does it have anything to do
with my acting skill?

761
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,270
Mainly because

762
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,670
it's really easy to live

763
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,590
with your parents.

764
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,550
Like you just have to

765
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,390
listen to your mother's chatter

766
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,590
and not to contradict her.

767
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,630
Your father

768
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,620
just have to prepare the meal.

769
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,910
It's really happy to have

770
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,590
a family like this.

771
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,590
Brother,

772
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,870
we are basically the closest person

773
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,550
to each other now.

774
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,950
Rest assured.

775
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,350
We can share the same father

776
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,150
and mother.

777
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,950
My house is yours.

778
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,870
We can be friends.

779
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,670
I'm relying on you
to cover me in the future.

780
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:25,750
Let go.

781
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,430
The more friends you have,
the more options you have.

782
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,670
I, Yu Sheng Sheng,

783
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,550
am your spokesman.

784
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,190
Do you still remember

785
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,910
what I said in the elevator?

786
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,510
Which one do you mean?

787
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,070
I said

788
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:40,670
let's

789
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,500
not meet again.

790
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,510
I remember.

791
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,230
That's what I think now.

792
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,590
After this meal,

793
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,710
we're going back

794
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,710
to our separate lives.

795
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,470
You'll be an entertainment reporter

796
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,020
and I'll be an artist.

797
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,470
But I'll provide one week's warranty

798
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,030
for this exchange.

799
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,030
So I'll cooperate with you

800
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,110
to write the topic for next week.

801
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,990
As expected from the best idol.

802
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,390
Come, here's another toast for you.

803
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:15,910
As expected from

804
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,350
a temporizing social man.

805
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,750
I'm flattered.

806
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,070
Eat more.

807
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,350
Thank you.

808
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,830
Come, a date for you.

809
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,860
Father, mother, I'm back!

810
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,230
Mother, father,

811
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,660
I miss you guys so much.

812
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,270
Did you drink?

813
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:46,470
You...

814
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,030
Why did you drink this much?

815
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,820
Mother, just scold me.

816
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,460
Are you drunk, kid?

817
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,070
I'm not drunk!

818
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,110
I just drank a little.

819
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,110
A little?

820
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,590
You even talk nonsense.

821
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,950
Mother, let me ask you guys.

822
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,230
Do you like the Yu Sheng Sheng

823
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,790
who's quiet and
well-behaved during the daytime

824
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,630
or

825
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,870
the Yu Sheng Sheng
who's frisky at night?

826
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,350
I like

827
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,710
the Yu Sheng Sheng
who stays away from me.

828
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,750
You...

829
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,630
Enough.

830
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,830
Go wash up now.

831
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,230
Yes, mother!

832
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:27,950
Why don't you go and take a look?

833
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,510
She's going crazy.

834
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,180
I love you!

835
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,390
That's more like it.

836
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,710
Come on in.

837
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,190
Shoes.

838
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,750
Socks.

839
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,430
Here he goes again.

840
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,150
I saw your mental status were good

841
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,310
on the public service
advertisements yesterday.

842
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,350
You have no idea

843
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,590
how scared I was in these few days.

844
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,190
I thought

845
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,550
you have some mental issues.

846
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,670
So I went to consult the doctor.

847
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,660
But the doctor said

848
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,350
he can only determine

849
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,310
after seeing the patient.

850
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,750
I'm relieved after seeing you like this.

851
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,750
What are you looking for?

852
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,220
Walnut.

853
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,070
Walnut?

854
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,350
Yes, the one I use every day.

855
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,070
Where did she put it?

856
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,790
She?

857
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,550
I mean me.

858
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,990
Didn't you crack that walnut?

859
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,150
Crack?

860
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,630
Yes.

861
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,020
Door.

862
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:21,870
"Snap".

863
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,350
No.

864
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,150
Why?

865
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,620
How would I know why?

866
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,750
You personally

867
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,350
cracked it here

868
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,390
in front of me and Le Yi on that day

869
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,630
and looked for the walnut kernel.

870
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,790
Really?

871
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,470
Door.

872
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,230
"Snap".

873
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,510
Let's give you a name.

874
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,580
Friend Jiang.

875
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,790
He deleted all chat histories on WeChat.

876
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,350
He guards me to this extent.

877

♫ The night is used to
the pitch-black darkness ♫

878
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,470

♫ The shooting star
must be missing someone ♫

881
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,090
♫ To be diving hard without hesitation ♫

882

♫ Towards a better tomorrow
in brave pursuit ♫

♫ Considered whole
only after they've shone ♫

887
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,920
♫ If your destiny is wounded ♫

888

♫ Time is the best testament ♫

889
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,390
♫ To this journey ♫

890

♫ I get used to ♫

894

♫ Having you by my side ♫

895

heart is just so precious ♫

896
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,550
♫ Don't need to speak or
beat around the bush ♫

897
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:25,490
♫ I always get a glimpse of your world ♫
