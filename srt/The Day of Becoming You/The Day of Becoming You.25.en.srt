mentioning this for over a year.

We've parted ways now, after all.

54

an official announcement.

56

may be a trending topic

for a short period.

59
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,990
By then,

60
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,390
who else would care about Yu Sheng Sheng?

61
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,070
It's a great idea.

62
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,110
I have no objection.

63
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,350
Over these years,

Brother Yi and Brother Jia Shu

65
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,630
care much about me.

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,230
I know I'm not outstanding

67
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,470
in every aspect.

68
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,420
I'm a drag on Little Galaxy.

69
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,270
I'm one of the reasons

70
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,870
the official announcement

71
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,990
has not been made.

72
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,470
You want to wait

73
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,750
until I can stand on my own.

74
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,390
I'll spend less time playing games
from now on.

You don't have to worry about me.

76
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,470
I'm alright.

77
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,830
Le Yi, don't say so.

78
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,700
You're excellent.

79
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,150
If it weren't for you,

80
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,750

81

82
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,950
Actually,

83
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,350
I'm the one who should say sorry.

84
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,380
As the leader,

85
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,140
Little Galaxy

86
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,510
took a lot of criticism

87
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,790
due to my personality.

88
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,420
And this time,

89
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,590
it's because

90
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,830
I'm careless.

91
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,990
Stop it.

92
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,350
Why do you become so sentimental

93
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,750
after being in a relationship?

94
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,070
Let's disband as soon as possible.

95
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,670
It's good for everyone.

96
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,870
Otherwise those marketing accounts

97
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,990
always compare me with you.

98
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,310
I'm so annoyed.

99
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,910
If there's nothing else,

100
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,830
I'll go upstairs to apply a face mask.

101
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,670
There's nothing else. Go ahead.

[Goodbye, Little Galaxy!]

179
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,190
Since Little Galaxy announced
their disbandment,

180
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,670
it's been on the trending topic.

181
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,390
Everyone is recalling their youth.

182
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,030
It's been hotly discussed.

183
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,430
Nobody cares about

184
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,230
you and Jiang Yi now.

185
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,700
The marketing account
that created the rumour

186
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,750
has been banned by the platform.

187
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,340
Many of those reposted articles

188
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,430
on the internet

189
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,430
has been deleted too.

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,150
It's finally over.

191
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,830
Oh, right.

192

Culture and Entertainment Detective

193
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,830
hasn't been updated these few days.

194
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,910
The article about Pei Jia Shu

195
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,150
is not suitable to post now.

196
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,910
Editor-in-Chief discussed with me today

197
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,830
about quitting

198
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,710
Culture and Entertainment Detective.

199
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,630
All the troubles happened

200
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,400
because we wanted to

201
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,950
protect this account.

202
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,310
But we still didn't manage to protect it.

203
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,950
Maybe Editor-in-Chief was right.

204
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,490
Life is full of ups and downs.

205
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,430
It can't be forced.

206
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,350
Yes, it's the fate.

207
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,030
Uncle went for a walk for long.

208
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,910
Why hasn't he come back yet?

209
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,790
He can't stay in the ward for long.

210
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,630
Maybe he went to talk

211
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,710
with someone next door.

212
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,590
Luckily he can be discharged
this afternoon.

213
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,390
These few days,

214
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,870
I accompanied my dad in the hospital.

215
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,070
My mum will be here after her class ended.

216
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,550
I feel relieved as our whole family

217
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,940
stays together.

218
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,870
I've been thinking a lot these days.

219
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,110
Maybe all the people around me

220
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,430
are too nice.

221
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,750
I live so happily.

222
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,070
That's why

223
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,070
I think life is like a drama.

224
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,470
As long as you're diligent and optimistic,

225
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,990
everything will come to

226
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,510
a perfect ending.

227
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,750
But the reality is

228
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,230
we'll always

229
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,630
get hurt unexpectedly.

230
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,910
After losing something,

231
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,590
we'll regret it only.

232
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,510
It's time for me to be sober.

233
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,870
What do you and Jiang Yi

234
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,190
plan to do now?

235
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,900
Apart from being on the trending topic
for no reason

236
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,790
and being called names,

237
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,950
we have

238
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,550
another big trouble.

239
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,580
Sheng Sheng told me the details

240
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,070
about you and her switching bodies.

241
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,510
I know

242
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,950
you've tried many ways.

243
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,030
But you switched back accidentally.

244
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,430
Recently,

245
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,230
both of you always switch bodies easily.

246
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,910
That's right.

247
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,070
That's why I visit you.

248
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,190
I want to know your opinion as well.

249
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,510
The magnetic field resonance
that I used to say

250
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,030
is a vague idea.

251
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,590
The magnetic fields around us

252
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,030
are made up of

253
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,150
different elements.

254
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,230
The magnetic field resonance between

255
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,710
you and her

256
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,070
is only a tiny part.

257
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,510
The condition that

258
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,750
causes you to switch bodies

259
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,750
may be

260
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,660
due to the change in

261
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,630
third party magnetic field.

262
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,270
How can I know

263
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,590
what causes

264
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,590
the third party magnetic field to change?

265
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,630
Global climate change,

266
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,070
motion of the stars,

267
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,310
unknown powers

268
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,870
and so on

269
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,910
are all possible causes.

270
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,990
It's a complicated topic

271
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,270
to determine

272
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,430
which third party magnetic field

273
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,360
is

274
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,830
the cause.

275
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,270
It involves many fields.

276
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,390
There'll be a slight possibility

277
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,230
if top scientists around the world

278
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,750
work together

279
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,380
on this.

280
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,950
Like doctors,

281
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,510
each of us has

282
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,350
a different specialty.

283
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,670
If there are complicated cases,

284
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,870
specialist consultants are needed.

285
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,230
It's the same meaning.

286
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,350
But there's always no cure

287
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,870
for complicated cases.

288
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,740
Do you have any good suggestions?

289
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,430
I won't give a suggestion.

290
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,390
It'd sound like my selfish motive.

291
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,110
But Jiang Yi,

292
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,950
to be objective,

293
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,710
the risk of switching is very high

294
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,990
if you're together with Sheng Sheng.

295
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,990
If there's a special case,

296
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,710
you both will be in danger.

297
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,590
Like when we were in the basement.

298
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,030
Sheng Sheng told me

299
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,070
last time

300
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,830
you both switched when
the car was stopped.

301
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,590
But if you were

302
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,950
driving at a high speed,

303
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,710
there would be hell to pay.

304
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,270
Although you

305
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,230
carefully

306
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,510
avoid this situation,

307
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,010
you can't switch back

308
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,710
if the condition of switching

309
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,150
changes.

310
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,030
Do you want to

311
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,230
act like each other forever?

312
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,670
Mum.

313
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,750
Dad.

314
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,470
Go to your room and sleep if you're sleepy.

315
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,550
How did I fall asleep?

316
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,870
Go to room and sleep.

317
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,710
Sheng Sheng.

318
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,740
Although you applied for leave,

319
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,670
don't stay up too late.

320
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,380
I know.

321
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,870
[Have Uncle and Aunty gone to sleep?]

322
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,070
[You can depart now.]

323
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,190
Why do you want to

324
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,990
watch a movie suddenly?

325
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,790
We didn't manage to watch it last time.

326
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,670
Let's watch it today.

327
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,300
Pass me the popcorn.

328
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,590
Sheng Sheng.

329
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,220
Let's watch the movie first.

330
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:09,710
Okay.

331
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,590
I heard from Bo Qing that

332
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,670
you visited him.

333
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,550
You talked to him too, didn't you?

334
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,390
Yes.

335
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,390
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,350
Why do you say so?

337
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,660
You were attacked.

338
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,600
Uncle was admitted to the hospital.

339
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,700
You all are sad.

340
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,580
But I did nothing.

341
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,750
I know

342
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,750
you've done a lot.

343
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,550
No.

344
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,900
It's not even enough.

345
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,430
I can't even

346
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,070
hug you

347
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,990
to comfort you.

348
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,270
It's not your fault.

349
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,380
It's my fault.

350
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,270
I could only tell you

351
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,150
everything will be fine.

352
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,190
There's a way for everything.

353
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,430
But I couldn't do anything.

354
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,150
I'm really

355
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,470
not the male lead in your drama.

356
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,460
I'm not able to protect you.

357
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,030
I can't

358
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,390
give you romantic moments.

359
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,190
I'll only put you in danger

360
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,030
and troubles.

361
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,590
How unqualified I am.

362
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,580
Don't think so.

363
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,910
I never thought about it too.

364
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,390
Actually,

365
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,110
I've always been
unrealistically optimistic.

366
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,990
I trust to luck.

367
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,510
I thought

368
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,030
everything can be solved

369
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,780
if we face it

370
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,990
bravely.

371
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,870
But the truth is

372
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,070
life is not as simple as we think.

373
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,390
You're right.

374
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,590
Life is not simple.

375
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,380
We forgot it for the moment.

376
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,030
Yes.

377
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,150
We also forgot

378
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,390
we're not the only ones

379
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,230
in our life.

380
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,390
Let's break up.

381
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,990
Okay.

382
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,070
If you didn't pretend

383
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,470
to be a fan at my birthday party,

384
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,070
how nice would it be?

385
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,430
It's me! It's me!

386
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,390
Hello, Jiang Yi.

387
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,270
I'm your big fan.

388
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,030
Thank you.

389
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,310
Happy birthday to you too.

390
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,990
Thank you.

391
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,070
I can fulfil one of your wishes.

392
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,550
Let's get married!

393
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,510
[If we didn't switch bodies]

394
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,270
[in the lift on that day,]

395
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,830
[how nice it would be.]

396
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,740
[If we didn't meet again]

397
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,310
[after switching back on that day,]

398
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,870
[how nice it would be.]

399
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,590
[If I didn't]

400
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,190
[find you on that day]

401
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,070
[and we didn't fall for each other,]

402
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,870
[how nice it would be.]

403
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,630
[If I didn't]

404
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,990
[fall for you and]

405
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,590
[kiss you impulsively on that day,]

406
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,270
[how nice it would be.]

407
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,190
[If you weren't drunk]

408
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,870
[and I didn't confess on that day,]

409
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,820
[how nice it would be.]

410
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,790
You're my only treasure.

411
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,630
Jiang Yi.

412
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,230
I like you.

413
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,670
[If you rejected me]

414
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,510
[on that day,]

415
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,070
[how nice it would be.]

416
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,030
Let's be together.

417
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,070
[If so,]

418
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,390
[your life]

419
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,550
[would go on smoothly.]

420
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,940
[You'd live happily ever after.]

421
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,430
[Luckily it's not too late.]

422
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,710
[Yes.]

423
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,030
[It's not too late.]

424
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,150
[Everything]

425
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,870
[will go smoothly.]

426
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,830
[You'll live happily as well.]

427
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,980
From now on,

428
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,830
we'll be merely

429
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,670
online friends.

430
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,990
Okay.

431
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,630
Maybe after a long time,

432
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,590
we won't get in touch.

433
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,870
Goodbye then.

434
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,710
Goodbye.

435
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,710
Sheng Sheng, come and eat.

436
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,030
All right.

437
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,950
Come, let's eat.

438
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,190
What do you apply

439
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,350
in this early morning?

440
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,990
I'm doing eye care.

441
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,590
Do you want to do it too?

442
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,790
My eyes

443
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,430
are good enough.

444
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,950
No need.

445
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,510
Sheng Sheng.

446
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,790
How much annual leave do you still have?

447
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,030
Three days.

448
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,350
When we go to work,

449
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,790
what do you plan to do at home?

450
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,390
I'll do the cleaning

451
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,430
and prepare dinner for you both.

452
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,830
Do you know how to make it?

453
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,830
I'm Chef Yu's daughter.

454
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,110
I can make

455
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,110
simple dishes.

456
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,630
All right.

457
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,910
Your mum and I

458
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,750
will taste it at night then.

459
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,270
No problem.

460
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,390
Dad, Mum.

461
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,470
I want to

462
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,710
tell you something.

463
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,310
I broke up with Jiang Yi.

464
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,630
Sheng Sheng.

465
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,430
It's your matter.

466
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,030
Just think about it clearly.

467
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,310
No matter what you've decided,

468
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,390
we'll support you.

469
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,870
Thank you, Dad and Mum.

470
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,980
Why are you so courteous?

471
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,180
I'm polite.

472
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,590
It's a good thing anyway.

473
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,230
Alright, let's eat.

474
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,150
I'll eat a corn cob.

475
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,110
Eat slowly. It's hot.

476
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,870
[Time never stops due to]

477
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,070
[one's pleasure, anger, sorrow]

478
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,110
[or joy.]

479
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,750
[We can only find direction]

480
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,830
[as life goes on.]

481
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,500
[We chose to]

482
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,110
[go on our own paths]

483
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,390
[and move forward.]

484
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,290
[How are you doing lately?]

485
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,060
[Great. Start filming the movie.]

486
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,060
[Congratulations.]

487
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,390
[How about you?]

488
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,050
[I'm doing fine too.]

489
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,810
[How are you doing lately?]

490
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,560
[Eveything's fine. How about you?]

491
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,150
[Eveything's fine.]

492
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,300
[We fondly keep our promises.]

493
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,310
[We pretend that everything's fine.]

494
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,630
[Pretend that we can]

495
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,580
[forget each other easily.]

496
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,430
[Even until]

497
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,990
[we're lied to by time.]

498
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,850
[One year later]

499
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,420
How about you answer it first?

500
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,300
I'll come back later.

501
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,590
Okay, thank you.

502
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:08,990
All right.

503
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,350
Hello, Mum.

504
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,190
There's someone else just now.

505
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,910
I can't answer the call.

506
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:17,990
What's the matter?

507
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,150
Really?

508
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,950
How great.

509
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,590
Okay, I got it.

510
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,030
Thank you, Mum.

511
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,630
Goodbye.

512
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,150
What's the good thing?

513
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,590
It's a very good thing.

514
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,820
But I can't say it now.

515
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,150
Alright then.

516
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,950
I won't ask again.

517
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,190
Thank you for

518
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,950
supporting my new show.

519
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,070
The producer

520
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,830
was surprised that

521
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,550
I managed to invite you.

522
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,230
This year,

523
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,150
you stopped updating Weibo

524
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,700
and went abroad to film a movie.

525
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,630
When you returned,

526
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,230
you shot a literary film of Director Chen.

527
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,190
Your solo album

528
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,350
will be released soon.

529
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,630
You didn't even go on

530
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,300
a variety show.

531
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,870
Everyone anticipates seeing you again.

532
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,210
If everything goes well,

533
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,700
it may be

534
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,310
my new norm.

535
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,870
Let's talk more

536
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,710
later on the show.

537
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,350
Okay.

538
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,030
I'll go and prepare.

539
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,350
Alright, see you later.

540
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:16,910
See you later.

541
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,230
Peng Ke, tell us

542
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,590
the topic of Lovers' Club.

543
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,990
There was a preview screening

544
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,870
for Director Stephen's new film.

545
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,230
Foreign film critics

546
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,030
gave Jiang Yi

547
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,150
a high review.

548
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,590
If we could

549
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,870
make an episode with Jiang Yi,

550
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,030
it'd be great.

551
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,550
But Jiang Yi

552
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,830
doesn't even go on a talk show.

553
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,270
Will he talk with

554
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,390
a public account like us?

555
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,710
You only join us for a month.

556
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,540
You have no idea.

557
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,590
Sheng Sheng and Jiang Yi are good friends.

558
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,230
Really? Sheng Sheng.

559
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,910
We haven't been in touch for a while.

560
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,310
What a shame to lose

561
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,550
such a good resource.

562
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,150
Did you forget what happened back then?

563
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:01,870
Oh!

564
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,350
I just recalled.

565
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,310
No wonder the name of Yu Sheng Sheng

566
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,190
sounds so familiar.

567
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,870
You've been on the trending topic

568
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,870
with Jiang Yi, right?

569
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,630
For a half year,

570
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,470
Jiang Yi didn't even wear a mask

571
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,590
when he went outside.

572
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,590
He went shopping with a female cousin

573
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,310
and had a meal with another female cousin.

574
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,190
He even went to play badminton

575
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,510
with female staff.

576
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,030
Paparazzi don't bother to shoot him.

577
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,550
At first,

578
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,750
he was on the trending topic.

579
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,670
Now the netizens get used to

580
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,030
him being so.

581
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,310
Even urge him to get a girlfriend

582
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,270
and get in a relationship.

583
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,980
Well, I think

584
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,910
you didn't

585
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,030
befriend him at the right time.

586
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,990
Alright, don't go off topic.

587
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,870
Let's discuss the topic.

588
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,030
Pardon me.

589
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,830
I'll answer a call.

590
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,230
Hello.

591
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,510
I'm free now. Go ahead.

592
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,750
Yes.

593
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,660
Yes.

594
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:11,830
Quickly.

595
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,630
What did you buy?

596
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,310
That's a lot.

597
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,590
Toilet rolls, tissue paper,

598
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,540
kitchen rolls

599
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,110
and some hair shampoo.

600
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,870
How virtuous.

601
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,270
When did our home essentials

602
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,710
get so well prepared?

603
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,870
That's how it should be.

604
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,420
I don't have to pay rental.

605
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,950
If I don't buy these,

606
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,910
wouldn't I be a parasite?

607
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,910
I'd love to.

608
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,190
You can rely on me as you wish.

609
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,220
I'm watching Jiang Yi's new interview.

610
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,990
Do you want to watch too?

611
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,230
When did you

612
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,310
start to mention Jiang Yi?

613
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,110
Weren't you afraid that

614
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,030
I'd recall the past

615
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,190
and so you never mention him?

616
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,990
Well, it's been a year.

617
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,590
He's a superstar, after all.

618
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,750
Others will mention him as well.

619
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,790
Our colleagues

620
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,990
keep mentioning him.

621
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,710
And there is news about him

622
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,310
on the internet.

623
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,030
Well, I don't follow the news.

624
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,470
Watch the interview by yourself.

625
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,510
I'm going to bathe.

626
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,150
Let's unbox these later.

627
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,270
You still have him in your mind.

628
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,390
Who told you?

629
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,390
Then why don't you dare

630
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,380
to watch his interview?

631
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,510
I'm not interested.

632
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,870
It's not because I don't dare to watch.

633
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,510
If you can feel nothing

634
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,630
when you look at him,

635
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,830
then you did forget the past.

636
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,270
Do you want to take the challenge?

637
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,030
Alright then.

638
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:37,710
It's just

639
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,030
an interview between Xu Shu Yi
and Jiang Yi.

640
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,230
You even know

641
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,630
it's Xu Shu Yi's show.

642
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,230
I saw it accidentally.

643
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,110
Jiang Yi agreed to

644
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,830
go on Xu Shu Yi's show.

645
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,430
They have a good relationship.

646
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,910
Yes, it's true.

647
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,190
Do you want to watch from this part

648
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,150
or from the beginning?

649
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,870
Just watch from this part.

650
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,750
After all, I'm not interested.

651
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,670
Okay.

652
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,950
[We just]

653
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,300
[talked about your experience abroad.]

654
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,550
[And some of your personal gains.]

655
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,470
[Next, I'll ask some questions that]

656
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,470
[the netizens concern about.]

657
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,550
[Our show is named "Comfortable Words".]

658
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,710
[If there's a question]

659
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,990
[that you don't want to answer,]

660
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,950
[you can voice out.]

661
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,670
[Okay.]

662
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,910
[After you returned from abroad,]

663
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,630
[you changed a lot.]

664
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,590
[You don't wear a mask
when you're outside.]

665
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,630
[You've been recognized by others.]

666
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,070
[Some want to take pictures with you]

667
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,830
[and ask for your signature.]

668
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,350
[You won't reject if you're free.]

669
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,030
[If you're not free, you'll apologize]

670
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,990
[and walk away.]

671
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,910
[Netizens wonder if]

672
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,550
[you're influenced by]

673
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,590
[some foreign stars.]

674
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,230
[Actually, I don't.]

675
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,390
[It's just]

676
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,190
[a coincidence in time.]

677
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,390
[If I didn't]

678
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,230
[work abroad,]

679
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,990
[maybe I'd be]

680
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,790
[how I used to be]

681
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,670
[half a year ago.]

682
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,310
[What do you consider]

683
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,910
[when you're]

684
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,910
[being so?]

685
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,060
[I want to live like normal people.]

686
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,390
[Celebrities are said]

687
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,710
[to be normal people.]

688
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,950
[But in public areas,]

689
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,030
[there's a big difference]

690
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,670
[in living style]

691
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,750
[between both.]

692
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,430
[Yes.]

693
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,060
[So]

694
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,550
[you have to make a decision.]

695
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,750
[Can you tell us]

696
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,070
[who or what made you]

697
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,110
[decide to do so?]

698
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,350
One of the reasons is my mum.

699
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,670
If I'm not mistaken,

700
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,150
you hardly

701
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,230
mention your mum

702
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,110
in any shows.

703
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,270
Yes. Because

704
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,790
I used to hate her.

705
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,580
Isn't that

706
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,590
too frank?

707
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,590
Aunty may

708
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,550
watch our show.

709
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,230
It's fine. She knew it.

710
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,950
Actually before

711
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,710
my parents divorced,

712
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,590
she had to conduct scientific research

713
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,390
as well as take care of our family.

714
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,910
She then got

715
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,390
a working opportunity abroad

716
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,230
at a top laboratory.

717
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,550
She grabbed

718
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,390
the chance.

719
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,470
I was left at home.

720
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,870
[We seldom met each other back then.]

721
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,310
[So]

722
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,510
[I didn't understand her well.]

723
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,630
[But after that,]

724
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,270
[I slowly understand her.]

725
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,230
[Because she]

726
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,030
[made a hard decision]

727
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,070
[as well.]

728
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,950
[We have to]

729
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,790
[pay the price for every decision.]

730
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,710
[We can't have it both ways.]

731
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:18,830
[You're right.]

732
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,590
[When we make a decision,]

733
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,270
[we have to]

734
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,260
[give up something.]

735
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,190
[When Little Galaxy just disbanded,]

736
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,710
[I started to]

737
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,590
[think about my decision.]

738
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,740
[Rather than being]

739
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,870
[a well-packaged]

740
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,430
[celebrity,]

741
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,270
[I'd love to]

742
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,350
[live like normal people.]

743
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:36,990
[For me,]

744
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,190
[celebrity is just an occupation.]

745
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,950
[I don't want to be trapped]

746
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,630
[by this identity.]

747
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,710
[Maybe my image]

748
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,550
[will be ruined]

749
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,710
[when fans see my true self.]

750
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,030
[Right.]

751
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,590
I may lose

752
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,340
commercial value.

753
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,670
But these are the prices

754
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,630
I have to pay for the decision made.

755
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,390
I choose to accept it.

756
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,750
And I won't regret.

757
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,310
I quite admire that

758
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,550
you can make such a decision.

759
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,510
You just said one of the reasons.

760
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,980
Are there other reasons?

761
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,270
There's someone actually

762
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,950
is the key to my decision.

763
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,630

764

[I love how]

765
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,710

[get a girlfriend?]

[You may say so.]

780
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,030
[Isn't being in a relationship]

781
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,270
