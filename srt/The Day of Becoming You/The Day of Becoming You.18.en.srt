Calm down.

30

Just simply wear something.

31
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,990
Is this too much?

32
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,230
Jiang Yi

33
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,030

Yu Sheng Sheng, the great detective?

37
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,060
Our public account

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,310
has discussed about a topic before.

39
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,630
How to avoid being found out

40
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,470
when you are in a relationship
with a superstar.

41
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,510
This is one of the safety measures.

42
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,470
If a paparazzi takes a photo of me,

43
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,670
they won't be able to tell who I am.

44
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,390
When you wear like this,

45
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,950
you are signalling the paparazzi

46
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,630
to take a photo of you.

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,310
Does this look familiar?

48
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,070
I'm curious.

49
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,790
When you were me,

50
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,110
what were you thinking

51
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,910
when you chose an outfit to wear?

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,700
In the beginning,

53
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,110
I just wore something comfortable.

54
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,950
After that,
I chose outfits that I looked good in.

55
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,950
Is it like cosplay?

56
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,430
What a strange analogy.

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,390
But I think so.

58
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,750
My guess is right then.

59
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,430
You like this one.

60
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:45,750
Yes.

61
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,910
The second safety measure.

62
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,950
Even if we are dating inside,

63
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,910
we have to close the curtains.

64
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,030
I'll close them.

65
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,110
That is a one-way glass.

66
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,790
They can't see anything from the outside.

67
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,630
Amazing.

68
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,910
Good.

69
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,030

70
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,230
Yes.

71
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,430
The third one is,

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,060
if we are being intimate,

73
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,870
make sure that there's no one around.

74

You said that Le Yi is here, right?

75
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,790
What were you doing just now?

76

First verbal warning to you.

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,830
This is entrapment.

78

Yes.

If only I were not an artist.

85
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,030

go to many places

87

to take photos of food and sceneries.

88
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,870
We could post photos in our social media.

89

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,390
We've officially posted this album too.

175
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,790
But I think what they showed
in the variety show

176
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,550
is just a small part of it.

177
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,870
You like Pei Jia Shu so much.

178
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,310
I'm sure you'll want to watch this.

179
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,390
You know me so well.

180
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,270
My boyfriend is helping me to
chase after my idol.

181
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,750
I'm so fortunate.

182
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,110
Don't worry.

183
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,950
Besides looking at Jia Shu,

184
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,670
I'll look at you too while I'm at it.

185
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,550
When you are at it?

186
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,790
Why did you give me

187
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,430
a video camera?

188
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,190
Me and Pei Jia Shu's

189
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,390
dance practice videos
before we were debuted

190
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,910
are recorded inside this.

191
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,430
You can just make me a copy.

192
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,190
I can't.

193
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,190
Why?

194
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,270
Because back then,

195
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,470
Pei Jia Shu always danced wrongly.

196
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,510
He was always throwing a tantrum.

197
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,230
He had a bad image.

198
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,830
He doesn't want anyone to see them,

199
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,710
but he can't bear to delete them.

200
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,350
So, he kept

201
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,110
the memory card

202
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,900
glued inside here.

203
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,350
So, you can only watch them
with the video camera.

204
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,710
Jia Shu is so cute.

205
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,390
Cute?

206
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,630
He's childish.

207
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,910
He's cute because he's childish.

208
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,110
This is the so-called

209
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,910
fan filter, right?

210
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,230
But, Jia Shu must be thinking that

211
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,750
I'm a fake fan.

212
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,910
When you had your period last time...

213
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,350
Wait.

214
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,230
When you had your period.

215
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,270
Okay.

216
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,110
When I had my period,

217
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,190
Jia Shu told you that

218
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,070
I was looking for excuses to come here

219
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,270
because I wanted to
fish for something big.

220
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,830
Now that we are together,

221
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,270
he must be thinking that

222
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,190
my tactics worked.

223
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,470
He's right.

224
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,950
You did manage to capture my heart.

225
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,550
Are you happy?

226
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,510
Yes.

227
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,990
I can only

228
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,350
explain it to him later if
I have the chance.

229
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,270
Actually I have a solution

230
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,180
to make sure that your idol

231
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,670
will never misunderstand you.

232
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,390
What solution is that?

233
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,350
Make me your idol.

234
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,590
So, you are giving me these presents

235
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,670
because you have an ulterior motive.

236
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,830
You look like you are helping me
to chase after my idol.

237
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,990
But actually, your ulterior motive

238
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,510
is to expose Jia Shu's bad traits

239
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,150
to show how good you are.

240
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,630
Are you

241
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,990
trying to lure me to you?

242
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,470
Do I need to lure you?

243
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,310
No, I...

244
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,270
I know it's not you.

245
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,030
It's me. I'm the one who wrote it.

246
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,230
To Pei Jia Shu.

247
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,950
Jia Shu, I'm not going unfollow you.

248
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,670
You are still my idol.

249
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,670
But I want

250
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,190
more from him.

251
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,140
What is it that you want?

252
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,110
Let me guess.

253
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,590
Is it...

254
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,950
No need to guess.

255
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,060
I want to be your girlfriend.

256
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,510
Back then, you left this wishing note

257
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,270
in my pocket.

258
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,180
Now, I'm going to

259
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:02,750
give this and me

260
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,550
to you.

261
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,630
How is it? Do you want to
come to my side now?

262
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,910
If I look carefully,

263
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,670
you are quite tempting.

264
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,190
Let me think about it then.

265
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,470
Do you want to take a closer look?

266
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,270
Okay. Watch the videos.

267
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,710
I'll cook for you.

268
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,830
Yay.

269
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,630
Finally, I'm done.

270
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,750
Let me relax by reading some gossips.

271
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,790
What did Sheng Sheng post?

272
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,350
Emergency.

273
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,030
I confessed to my prince charming
last night.

274
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,390
After that, he kissed me.

275
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,350
I was too drunk.

276
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,550
So, he sent me back to rest.

277
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,950
But he hasn't

278
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,990
contacted me since then.

279
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,670
Please answer me.

280
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,710
What is happening right now?

281
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,590
For example,
my prince charming is like a superstar

282
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,470
and I'm just

283
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,630
a normal fan.

284
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,710
Prince charming.

285
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,870
Fan?

286
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,910
Is this real?

287
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,590
You don't want to watch
the videos anymore?

288
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,790
My boyfriend is just beside me.

289
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,230
I don't need to look at other men.

290
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,190
I didn't know that

291
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,910
you are such a flirt.

292
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,630
Just like you said.

293
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,790
It's not about whether I know
how to do it or not.

294
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,830
It's about whether I'm willing or not.

295
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,900
I didn't watch those idol dramas

296
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,510
for nothing.

297
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,670
So, you are very willing now.

298
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,350
Not only I'm willing,

299
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,190
I'm going to go all out.

300
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,750
Go ahead then.

301
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,590
Lift up your hands.

302
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,990
How can you not wear an apron
when you cook?

303
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,070
I've learnt something new.

304
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,870
Okay. I'll cut the veggies.

305
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,790
Looks like they are

306
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,270
all my favourite food.

307
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,430
When I was at your home,

308
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,460
your dad often made them.

309
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,660
So, I guess that
they must be your favourite.

310
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,070
So attentive.

311
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,790
And smart.

312
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,870
I think

313
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,710
we should

314
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,510
observe and

315
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,110
interact with

316
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,070
each other's life more.

317
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,190
We should know more about each other.

318
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,350
What I mean is,

319
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,870
if we switch again,

320
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,070
we'll be well-prepared.

321
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,390
Understood.

322
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,230
It's better to be prepared.

323
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,390
You know how to cook.

324
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,630
Who taught you?

325
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,950
When I stayed

326
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,710
with my relatives in the past,

327
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,310
I didn't want them to dislike me.

328
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,750
So, I would always do some
house chores for them.

329
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,670
Sometimes, when my class

330
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,870
ended earlier before the adults came back,

331
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,910
I would cook the rice, cut the veggies

332
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,110
and wait for them to come back.

333
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,870
Your dad

334
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,270
treats Jiang Mo quite well.

335
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,630
How could he be so heartless

336
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,430
to leave you under others' care?

337
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,070
Maybe his mindset has changed

338
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,990
because he's getting older.

339
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,510
Do you think your mum has changed?

340
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,590
I don't know.

341
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,630
The memory that I have of her

342
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,710
is just from my childhood memory.

343
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,390
I don't really know her now.

344
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,620
If you want to say anything,

345
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,190
just say it.

346
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,630
Do you want to open those gifts

347
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,340
in your closet?

348
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:26,790
No.

349
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,710
But you can't bear to throw them away.

350
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,190
Actually, a gift contains

351
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,310
a person's regard for you.

352
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,390
How much that person cares for you

353
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,310
and how much effort she puts into you,

354
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,270
you'll know when you

355
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,310
open her gifts.

356
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,830
To be honest,

357
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,470
you are curious too, right?

358
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,710
I think you are more curious than me.

359
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,270
I am.

360
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,910
But I tried not to tell you.

361
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,910
Since

362
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,270
my girlfriend wants to open those gifts,

363
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,070
let's open them after

364
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,390
we eat.

365
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,670
Okay.

366
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,870
I'll cook some ribs first.

367
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:20,870
Okay.

368
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,470
How about you open them for me?

369
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,150
I think it's better if you do it yourself.

370
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,710
Yi, happy 16th birthday.

371
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,110
I hope that you'll be safe
and healthy in the future.

372
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,550
Your mum who misses you.

373
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,230
It's a woollen sweater.

374
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,190
Your mum

375
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,470
must have knitted it for you.

376
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,780
Knitting a sweater is too time-consuming.

377
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,310
But,

378
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,390
she has a good taste.

379
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,350
This sweater looks nice.

380
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:35,990
It's for someone who's 165 cm tall.

381
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,580
When I was 16,

382
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,830
I was already 175 cm tall.

383
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,270
Look at this one.

384
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,710
You are 17 now.

385
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,510
No matter

386
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,870
what career you choose,

387
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,260
I'll support you.

388
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,950
Your mum who misses you.

389
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,350
This is Beckham's autograph, right?

390
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,830
Is Beckham

391
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,310
the only one you know?

392
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,670
Yes.

393
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,510
Beckham is so handsome.

394
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,950
This is Kaka.

395
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,390
He's a famous footballer too.

396
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,950
I'm sure

397
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,390
you like this present.

398
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,150
I think

399
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,070
she heard from my uncle

400
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,070
about my liking for football.

401
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,070
But that was in middle school.

402
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,150
I was already into dancing

403
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,030
when I was 17.

404
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,550
All of your mum's presents

405
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,310
are here.

406
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,470
No matter you like them or not,

407
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,510
she put her effort into them.

408
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,590
Yes.

409
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:52,870
I needed them

410
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,710
in the past.

411
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,750
But when they were delivered,

412
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,350
I no longer needed them.

413
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,230
Just like a sweater in summer,

414
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,910
a cold drink in winter

415
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,510
and her belated maternal love.

416
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,270
Those are too untimely.

417
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,790
You said that

418
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,830
we can see someone's feelings
through their gifts.

419
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,150
But what I see

420
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,510
is her trying to comfort herself.

421
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,870
We have to move forward.

422
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,950
You have to let go of your past little by little.

423
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,270
Opening these gifts

424
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,590
is a part of the process.

425
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,150
Don't keep everything

426
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,950
inside your heart.

427
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,830
You'll get sick.

428
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,150
My heart will ache for you.

429
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:50,750
Thank you.

430
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,700
With you by my side,

431
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,780
I feel at peace.

432
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,150
It's so cooling outside.

433
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,710
Do you want to go out to take a breather?

434
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,630
Where can we go?

435
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,070
[Yu Sheng Sheng.]

436
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,670
Do you have no feelings

437
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,830
for Doctor Shen

438
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,030
because

439
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,270
you like Pei Jia Shu?

440
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,180
How is that possible?

441
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,150
Don't you think it's too over?

442
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,550
What do you mean?

443
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,830
I like Pei Jia Shu

444
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,830
just because

445
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,030
he gave me a bandage.

446
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,790
Doctor Shen.

447
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,750
I'm sorry

448
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,470
for making you wait.

449
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,670
It's okay. I just reached here too.

450
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,990
I ordered a latte for you.

451
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,430
Is that okay?

452
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,550
Yes. Thank you.

453
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,390
You asked me out to
talk about Sheng Sheng, right?

454
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,660
Why do you think so?

455
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,910
Because we've never messaged each other

456
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,830
after adding each other on WeChat.

457
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,190
You suddenly asked me out.

458
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,910
So, I think it must be
because of Sheng Sheng.

459
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,580
You are right.

460
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,910
It's about Sheng Sheng.

461
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,910
This question might sound

462
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,910
intrusive.

463
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,990
But I want to ask this.

464
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,430
When Sheng Sheng broke up with you,

465
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,310
did she say anything?

466
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,710
Can you tell me

467
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,430
why you want to know about that?

468
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,310
I think she's in a relationship.

469
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,710
So fast?

470
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,710
It's just my guess.

471
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,710
But I'm sure

472
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,110
she's in love with someone

473
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,750
or she has been tricked.

474
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,310
She has been tricked?

475
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,990
This thing is quite complicated.

476
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,910
I'm not sure.

477
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,510
Do you know something?

478
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,350
She told me that

479
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,910
she has someone she likes.

480
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,710
Who is it?

481
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,150
I promised her to keep it a secret.

482
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,180
Is that person Pei Jia Shu?

483
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,150
You know?

484
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,830
It's really him.

485
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,830
How is it?

486
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,430
Isn't this a good idea?

487
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,230
Not bad.

488
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,750
We can breathe in some fresh air.

489
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,910
And you don't have to expose yourself.

490
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,190
After this,

491
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,350
let's find somewhere similar

492
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:17,990
to have a date

493
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,550
every weekend.

494
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,350
Up to you.

495
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,550
By the way,

496
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,510
why did you tell

497
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,430
Jiang Da Chuan that

498
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,670
I won't like you?

499
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,870
That day,

500
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,430
he was reminiscing with you.

501
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,150
He said, he hopes that

502
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,430
you can think about your relationship

503
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,630
after your career has stabilised.

504
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,230
Besides, back then, I really thought that

505
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,390
you didn't like me.

506
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,950
There are so many

507
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,510
beautiful and great ladies
in your industry.

508
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,470
I'm too common.

509
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,150
For me,

510
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,150
you are not common at all.

511
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,990
We have exchanged our lives before.

512
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,550
Besides, you are a great woman.

513
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:55,910
And you are pretty too.

514
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,590
You are quite the sweet talker too.

515
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,270
That's because my girlfriend
is a good teacher.

516
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,950
Will Jiang Da Chuan be angry?

517
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,180
No.

518
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,990
He already told me.

519
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,110
From now on,

520
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,030
he'll only you treat you

521
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,710
as my girlfriend.

522
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:19,990
He won't

523
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,230
treat you as an entertainment reporter.

524
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,830
I also told him that

525
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,980
I'll get ready to go back to work soon.

526
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,310
I want to create an outstanding

527
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,390
personal album as soon as possible.

528
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,630
And I'll talk to some

529
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,750
good movie sponsors.

530
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,020
That way,

531
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,310
I can stabilise my career soon

532
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,910
and we won't

533
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,110
need to

534
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,830
hide anymore.

535
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,990
But before that,

536
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,270
we have to be careful.

537
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,510
I know.

538
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,110
You already did very well today.

539
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,350
I don't want to trouble you.

540
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,030
Hello?

541
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,510
[Yi, what are you doing?]

542
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,470
I am

543
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,230
looking for inspiration.

544
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,190
I'm writing a song.

545
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,190
[That day, I told Jia Shu that]

546
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,590
[we should find a time
to eat hotpot together.]

547
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,790
[When are you free?]

548
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,290
[Xu Shu Yi]

549
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,750
I'm getting ready to go back to work.

550
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,950
So, I'll be busy.

551
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,830
[Okay.]

552
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,670
[We'll talk when you are less busy.]

553
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,270
Okay. Bye.

554
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:23,990
[Bye.]

555
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,870
Are you jealous?

556
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,710
No, I'm not.

557
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,390
She is your best friend.

558
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,990
But I am the one you like.

559
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:42,980
Yes.

560
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,950
I love you.

561
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,030
Stop.

562
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,910
Why did you suddenly confess to me?

563
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,150
There is something that

564
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,830
I don't understand.

565
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,620
Why will you think that

566
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,630
I like Jia Shu?

567
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,670
You really want to know?

568
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,860
Because when I was you,

569
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,910
Tong Hua kept on emphasising on

570
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,710
how much you like

571
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,380
Pei Jia Shu.

572
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,580
And you even dreamt about marrying him.

573
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,190
I just like him as a fan.

574
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,790
That's different.

575
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,070
Do you think that

576
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,070
all of your fans

577
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,990
want to marry you?

578
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,430
It's just empty talk.

579
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,470
I know.

580
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,390
But you had a way

581
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,950
to get close to him.

582
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,540
And you were so eager.

583
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,950
You might have

584
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,230
fallen in love with him for real.

585
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,870
It was just a normal reaction

586
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,750
of a fan.

587
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,470
Besides, I was already
holding myself back.

588
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,830
I know that too.

589
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,870
But Shen Bo Qing

590
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,310
told me very seriously that

591
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,190
you like Pei Jia Shu.

592
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,510
Why will he think so?

593
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,990
Because you told him about

594
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,390
two people from different worlds and

595
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,230
a not-for-sale item in

596
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,710
the display cabinet.

597
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,430
I meant you.

598
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:54,590
I thought

599
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,270
you don't think of me as an artist

600
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,430
because we became friends.

601
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,870
But you are indeed a superstar.

602
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,870
Now that I think about it,

603
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,470
looks like I've been

604
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,460
jealous of myself.

605
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,870
I was so worried that

606
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,670
you'd fall in love with Pei Jia Shu.

607
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,350
And you would get hurt

608
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,310
because it's a one-sided love.

609
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,270
So, I wanted to switch back

610
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:18,990
so that you wouldn't get hurt.

611
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,910
Tong Hua and my senior

612
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,950
are bad teammates.

613
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,630
You can't blame them.

614
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,750
Let's see who is the one

615
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,910
that set Pei Jia Shu as

616
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,910
her phone's wallpaper.

617
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,590
I've changed it.

618
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,230
You've changed it?

619
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,460
Look. What do you think?

620
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,150
Great taste.

621
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,070
Of course.

622
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,550
I have such a great boyfriend.

623
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,430
You are not a not-for-sale item.

624
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,110
You are a necessity.

625
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,030
Do you want to come into this tent?

626
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,070
Why?

627
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,590
Your mouth is so sweet.

628
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,590
I want to taste it.

629
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,830
You should stop watching idol drama.

630
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,750
Your public persona has changed.

631
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,750
I can't keep up with you.

632
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,980
Are you going to come in or not?

633
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,820
I should've guessed.

634
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,670
After Sheng Sheng
becomes Jiang Yi's friend,

635
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,750
she will definitely ask Jiang Yi

636
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,830
to introduce her to Pei Jia Shu.

637
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,830
She has no

638
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,030
resistant against Pei Jia Shu.

639
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,510
She'll fall for him easily.

640
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,430
She's really foolish.

641
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,750
Why is she keeping it
a secret from you then?

642
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,150
Because she knows that

643
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,310
I hate Pei Jia Shu.

644
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,990
Besides, I've reminded her many times

645
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,510
not to be too attached to her idol.

646
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,820
I think

647
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,110
she's not confident in her relationship.

648
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,550
That's why she doesn't dare to tell me.

649
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,070
She said that

650
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,550
the person she likes

651
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,070
will never like her back.

652
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,590
But what do you mean by

653
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,230
her being tricked?

654
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,830
What if Pei Jia Shu doesn't like her

655
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,350
but wants to play with her?

656
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,030
What should we do then?

657
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,420
I won't forgive him.

658
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,270
Do you have a plan?

659
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,670
Doctor Shen.

660
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,390
Stay out of this

661
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,430
for now.

662
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,310
Trust me.

663
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,470
I won't let Sheng Sheng

664
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,150
get hurt.

665
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,310
By the way, Tong Hua.

666
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,430
I have something to ask you.

667
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,750
Tell me.

668
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,510
After Sheng Sheng
got into the lift accident,

669
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,740
did you notice her

670
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,150
acting any differently?

671
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,380
Acting differently?

672
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,790
For example,
she's not acting like herself.

673
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,230
After she discharged from the hospital,

674
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,950
she went back to her parents.

675
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,790
During that time,

676
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,590
besides keeping

677
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,750
some secrets from me,

678
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,670
she was acting fine.

679
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,110
Why?

680
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,430
Nothing.

681
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,390
I'm just worried that she has some

682
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,430
lingering side effects that
she's not aware about.

683
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,430
Usually, people around her will notice.

684
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,510
I'll keep an eye on her then.

685
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,350
I'll tell you if there's something wrong.

686
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,710
Okay.

687
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,910
[Did I think too much?]

688
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,510
[Xiao Mei.]

689
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,150
[Please send me Pei Jia Shu's]

690
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,030
[phone number.]

691
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,190
Please send the contract to my e-mail.

692
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,950
I'll reply you after I received it.

693
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:21,830
Thank you.

694
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,950
You are not going to do anything

695
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,190
about Jiang Yi's relationship?

696
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,950
That's his personal issue.

697
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,910
I don't have the rights.

698
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,070
But the thing is,

699
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,710
she's an entertainment reporter.

700
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,990
Do you want me to find you a house

701
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,750
so that you can move out?

702
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:42,910
He's the one in a relationship.

703
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,820
Why should I move out?

704
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:44,830
Or,

705
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,460
I can ask him to move out.

706
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,230
No.

707
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,270
Others might say that
we are not getting along.

708
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:50,990
What do you want then?

709
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,230
I've not decided on it yet.

710
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,990
Hello, who are you?

711
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,590
I am Tong Hua.

712
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,230
You remember me, right?

713
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,630
Ex-classmate.

714
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,630
Long time no see.

715
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,470
Yes. It has been a long time.

716
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,340
[Why did you leave early]

717
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,270
[in the last wedding?]

718
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,150
We talked about you after that.

719
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,110
To be honest, I miss our times together.

720
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,790
Are you free later?

721
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,830
I want to meet you.

722
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,260
Sure.

723
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,990
I want to meet you too.

724
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,190
I'm free now.

725
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,070
[I just finished with my work.]

726
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,070
Which place is more convenient for you?

727
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,630
Let me think about it.

728
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,470
Xiao Mei told me that

729
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,750
you are an entertainment reporter now,

730
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,150
right?

731
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,350
Come to my house then.

732
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,710
It's inconvenient for me

733
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,550
to be outside.

734
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,390
Aren't you staying with

735
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,270
other members?

736
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,430
Yes.

737
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,070
But they don't mind.

738
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,150
We see

739
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,830
an entertainment reporter every day.

740
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,870
Okay then.

741
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:51,990
See you later.

742
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,950
I'll send you my location.

743
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,150
You did it on purpose, right?

744
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,190
No.

745
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,150
It's just a coincidence.

746
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,950
But don't worry.

747
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,550
I can vouch for my ex-classmate.

748
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,030
Don't be biased.

749
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,630
Are you satisfied with our date today?

750
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,630
Yes.

751
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,110
You gave me presents.

752
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,190
You cooked for me.

753
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,470
We went out to breathe in fresh air.

754
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,310
And we resolved

755
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,110
the misunderstandings between us.

756
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,670
Do you realise now that

757
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,990
we had worried for nothing?

758
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,590
Wrong.

759
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,150
If we just confessed to each other,

760
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,430
you like me

761
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,390
you like me,

762
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,790
it wouldn't be interesting.

763
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,790
Interesting?

764
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,710
Do you really think that
we are in an idol drama?

765
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,230
Aren't we?

766
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,710
We can't finish our sentences.

767
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,190
Our confessions were disrupted.

768
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,950
And then, we have the supporters

769
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,830
and the foes.

770
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,510
This is really like a drama.

771
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,030
Yes.

772
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,430
You are right, girlfriend.

773
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,750
But,

774
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,390
in order to

775
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,390
make it easier for us,

776
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,710
I've made a decision.

777
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:13,990
Decision?

778
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,110
Yes.

779
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,510
[Please open the door.]

780
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,150
[This person in front of me]

781
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,220
[used to shine like a star.]

782
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,350
[But he became a nightmare in
my third year of high school.]

783
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,900
Be quiet!

784
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,910
He is a new student.

785
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,030
Introduce yourself.

786
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:54,750
Hello.

787
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,190
I am the new transfer student.

788
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,870
Pei Jia Shu.

789
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,470
I hope that we can become friends.

790
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,150
Please give him a round of applause.

791
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,870
Jia Shu.

792
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,910
You can sit over there.

793
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,670
Okay.

794
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,470
[Everyone likes good-looking people.]

795
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,110
[But for me,]

796
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,430
[that was the start of my demise.]

797
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,710
Hello.

798
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,590
Hello.

799
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,150
I heard that your bunny gave birth.

800
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,150
Give one to me.

801
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,940
I want a bunny too.

802
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,790
Yes.

803
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,630
They are small and white.

804
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,870
So cute.

805
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,470
Let me tell you.

806
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,670
You can't have bunny as pet.

807
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,030
Or else, your baby

808
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,830
will have a cleft lip.

809
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,430
Don't you know?

810
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,310
You are drinking hot water in summer?

811
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,510
Aren't you afraid that
you'll get a heatstroke?

812
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,390
[He has no common sense.]

813
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,070
I think that

814
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,310
the way you tie your shoes is very nice.

815
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,030
I want to give it a try.

816
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,430
[Fool.]

817
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,270
Jia Shu, this is for you.

818
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:56,630
Thank you.

819
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,140
I love you.

820
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,550
[Frivolous.]

821
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,070
Here are some chocolates for you.

822
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,990
[He stepped on every mine zone

823
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,750
[of mine.]

824

[The most agitating thing is...]

825
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,470
Do you know?

826
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,790
A lot of girls in our class

827
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,380
are jealous of you

828
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,700
because you are Pei Jia Shu's tablemate.

829
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,390
They say that you like him.

830
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,190
How is that possible?

831
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,950
I really hate him.

832
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,030
Good.

833
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,670
Help me out then.

834
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,310
My friend asked me to give this to you.

835
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,030
Why do all of you like to
use the same excuse?

836
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,630
I'm telling the truth.

837
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,830
Take a look for yourself.

838
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,750
There's no name.

839
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,660
If you don't believe me,

840
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,710
you...

841
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,590
You can compare our handwriting.

842
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,190
You've put too much effort into it.

843
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,870
You found someone to copy it?

844
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,430
Tong Hua.

845
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,190
What is it?

846
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,270
It's not embarrassing to like me.

847
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,310
It is.

848
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,230
Why can't you admit it?

849
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,790
Don't you speak the human language?

850
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,630
Of course I do.

851
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,590
A person in a favourable position
gains the advantages.

852
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,550
Wait for me.

853
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,100
Qi Qi.

854
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,630
I sent you a message.

855
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,390
Why didn't you reply me?

856
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,670
Tong Hua, you are a liar.

857
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,430
You told me that
you don't like Pei Jia Shu.

858
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
(Tong Hua, please don't pester Pei Jia Shu, OK?)

859
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,790
Pei Jia Shu.

860
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,500
Please make it clear to

861
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,190
your admirers.

862
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,270
I really don't like you.

863
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,670
You don't like me again?

864
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,110
I've never even liked you.

865
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,630
Then, why should I help you?

866
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,580
I'm sorry.

867
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,190
Although you like me,

868
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,630
I can't return your feelings.

869
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,300
I want to be a sun.

870
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,550
Warm

871
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:58,630
and bright.

872
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,470
So many stars

873
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,470
are attracted to the sun.

874
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,750
They run in circles around it.

875
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,550
I have to treat everyone equally.

876
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,310
[Obviously,]

877
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,030
[I underestimated his narcissism]

878
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,830
[and arrogance.]

879
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,350
[If I could,]

880
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,670
[I would turn into Hou Yi]

881
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,710
[to shoot down]

882
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,350
[this sun.]

883
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,540
Jia Shu.

884
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,230
Yes.

885
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,830
Let's play basketball.

886
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:19,870
Okay.

887
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,500
(Signs that Tong Hua likes me.)

888
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
(She helped me. She wrote me a love letter...)

889
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,470
What is this?

890
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,350
[From that moment onwards,]

891
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,630
[I made up my mind]

892
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,060
[not to see him anymore]

893
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,670
[and not to keep in contact with him]

894
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,020
[after we graduate.]
