00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,350
to interview Cheng Le Yi.

173
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,870
That's cool.

174
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,950
Sheng Sheng.

175
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,220
Your team is so amazing.

176
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,430
I need to learn from you.

177
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,470
Let's progress together.

178
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,070
What's wrong?

179
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,470
I saw something bad about me
in the toilet.

180
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,870
I became constipated.

181
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,230
Brother Yi, take a look.

182
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,070
What does this mean?

183
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,590
"If Little Galaxy is dismissed,"

184
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,910
"Cheng Le Yi may go disappear soon."

185
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,110
Reporter Yu,

186
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,950
weren't you in the room?

187
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,180
Mo Mo lost her button.

188
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,030
I'm here to look for the button.

189
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,260
It's here.

190
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,830
Don't be mad.

191
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,190
Public accounts like this

192
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,350
will write the most ridiculous thing

193
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,350
just to gain attention.

194
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,390
Their ultimate goal

195
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,910
is to make you reply to the post

196
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,150
so that they can earn more.

197
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,310
Yes, I really have the urge

198
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,350
to reply to the post.

199
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,270
Reporter Yu, you be the judge.

200
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,470
Little Galaxy

201
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,550
is a group of three.

202
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,070
It's stated in the article that

203
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,230
Brother Yi and Brother Jia Shu
is "The Galaxy"

204
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,590
while I'm just the "Little".

205
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,980
I worked so hard for so many years.

206
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,990
I even put them in trouble.

207
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,550
It's good to be the "Little".

208
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,710
It means

209
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,190
you're the spirit of the boy band.

210
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,310
Look.

211
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,390
Little cutie.

212
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,870
Little fool.

213
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,110
Little fairy.

214
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,910
Little...

215
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,790
Little mistress.

216
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,950
Shut up.

217
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,270
Yes, I admit it.

218
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,750
I'm not as talented as Brother Yi.

219
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,270
I'm not as handsome as Brother Jia Shu.

220
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,470
Jia Shu is the most handsome.

221
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,950
However, if weren't for me

222
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,470
who always lighten the atmosphere,

223
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,030
Little Galaxy would have broken up a long time ago.

224
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,270
I would have had
disappeared a long time ago.

225
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,910
Don't be upset.

226
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,790
You have another account, right?

227
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,630
Just reply to the post with that account.

228
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,950
I can do that if it's posted
on a normal Weibo account.

229
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,510
I can't do it to a public account.

230
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,420
How do you know that

231
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,350
I usually vent out on someone
with my alternate account?

232
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,190
I told her.

233
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,270
Brother Yi.

234
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,190
Nowadays,

235
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,350
you trust Reporter Yu so much.

236
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,310
Yes.

237
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,910
When I interviewed Jiang Yi,

238
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,230
he's really happy with the outcome.

239
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,190
Yes.

240
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,900
Do you need my help?

241
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,590
Are you in a bad mood?

242
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,870
Brother Curly.

243
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,750
Let's go for coffee when you're free.

244
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,220
You couldn't find me the last time.

245
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,870
I feel sorry for you.

246
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,750
Don't worry.

247
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,110
Isn't it normal?

248
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,270
However, I have some photos

249
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,310
fresh from the oven.

250
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,020
I can show it to you first.

251
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,990
Hey.

252
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,350
Why didn't you tell me that

253
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,590
Cheng Le Yi agreed to be interviewed?

254
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,550
Did I forget to tell you?

255
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,110
Have you lost your spirit?

256
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,710
You seem out of your mind since morning.

257
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,270
How did you get it?

258
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,990
When we were at the camping site,

259
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,180
I ran into Jiang Da Chuan.

260
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,510
I reminded him about it.

261
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,140
He decided to do me a favour.

262
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,310
It seems that Zhang Zhi Xiao's information

263
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,470
is quite accurate.

264
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,150
Exactly.

265
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,110
I need to get some water.

266
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,470
It's so troublesome.

267
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,750
When will

268
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,910
the lie come to an end?

269
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,030
Sure, give me some spoilers.

270
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,310
[It's still Jiang Yi.]

271
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,470
Really?

272
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,870
It's a deal.

273
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,150
See you tonight.

274
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,790
What's wrong?

275
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,220
Are you going to
forsake darkness for light?

276
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,950
I'm just viewing it for fun.

277
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,990
It's not updated for many days.

278
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,790
Even the management of the fan club

279
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,630
doesn't have his news.

280
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,230
God knows what is he doing.

281
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,670
What else can he do?

282
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,100
He must be hiding at home
playing games.

283
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,230
How do you know?

284
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,950
Though it's never been
officially verified,

285
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,390
it's the top tier secret

286
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,870
circulated only among the veteran fans.

287
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,950
Have you lost your mind?

288
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,750
Isn't that the secret

289
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,910
you shared with me a few days ago?

290
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,790
Is it?

291
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,230
Let me ask you a question.

292
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,270
If you knew that Jiang Yi was unhappy,

293
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,830
what would you do?

294
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,590
I wouldn't do anything.

295
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,590
Are you really his fan?

296
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,180
I can't wait to give him

297
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,430
a hug full of love.

298
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,830
However,
I need to meet him in person first.

299
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,830
Yes.

300
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,510
You're behaving strangely today.

301
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,950
In the past,
whenever I mentioned Jiang Yi,

302
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,020
you would counter mention Shu Shu

303
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,070
or my Shu Shu.

304
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,350
I'm just

305
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,630
preparing for Le Yi's interview.

306
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,390
I'm looking at it from more perspectives.

307
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,150
Le Yi?

308
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,230
Cheng Le Yi.

309
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,190
I have to make it clear.

310
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,790
My Shu Shu

311
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,430
doesn't need to be mentioned all the time.

312
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,990
That's because

313
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,030
he's already in my heart.

314
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:48,990
Brother Yi.

315
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,910
Yes?

316
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,740
Your meal is here.

317
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,950
Okay.

318
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,830
[Are you in a bad mood?]

319
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,830
[If you're not in a good mood,]

320
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,230
[you should go for a feast.]

321
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,950
[When I'm not in a good mood,]

322
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,710
[I always do that.]

323
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,790
[It definitely works.]

324
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,470
[My best friend and I]

325
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,710
[had mini hotpot for lunch]

326
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,740
[to celebrate getting permission
to interview Le Yi.]

327
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,750
[You should think]

328
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,380
[what do you crave.]

329
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,790
[Don't eat salad all the time.]

330
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,190
[You're not a rabbit.]

331
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,950
Something that I crave?

332
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,830
I do crave something.

333
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,590
Fatty.

334
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,070
Brother Yi, I'm coming.

335
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,950
Have you eaten?

336
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,390
I've eaten.

337
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,300
Have you taken dinner?

338
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,190
Brother Yi, you're so funny.

339
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,510
It's only 1pm.

340
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,230
Then this has become your dinner.

341
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,110
You should go on a diet.

342
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,310
[I've accepted your suggestion]

343
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,310
[to go for a feast.]

344
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,790
[Where do you plan to go?]

345
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,550
[I'll let you know when I reach there.]

346
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,870
Shake the wok.

347
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,510
Otherwise, the pork kidney
will be overcooked easily.

348
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,590
Yes.

349
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,870
A customer is attracted to the restaurant.

350
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,030
He wants to try your cooking.

351
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:40,870
Sure.

352
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,390
[Xu Sheng Sheng, the detective]

353
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,630
Find a place with no one.

354
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,310
Okay, you may speak now.

355
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,110
Turn on the camera.

356
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,030
Okay.

357
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,590
Okay.

358
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,100
Guess where am I?

359
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,430
I can't tell.

360
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,270
It's just a restaurant.

361
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,350
It seems that

362
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,310
you don't quite know the place

363
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,310
your dad works at.

364
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,750
You're at the restaurant
where my dad works?

365
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,510
I want to eat his cooking.

366
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,950
You can send your assistant
to get it for you,

367
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,670
can't you?

368
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,710
It's inconvenient for you to be in public.

369
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,580
I've been staying at home for a long time.

370
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,550
I wish to take a stroll.

371
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,230
I'm surprised that

372
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,150
you feel bored staying at home.

373
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,030
It's because of your bad influence.

374
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,750
How do you eat with a mask on?

375
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,460
I'm inside a room.

376
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,710
Later, I'll remove the mask

377
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,830
and eat in secret.

378
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,550
The next time you dine in,

379
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,950
you should put on a facekini.

380
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,110
It suits you better.

381
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,750
What is a facekini?

382
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,750
The dish is here. I have to go.

383
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,620
Hello, the dish is here.

384
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,750
It's steamed chicken
with truffle and desert cistanche.

385
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,900
Thank you.

386
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,190
You're here.

387
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,670
Yes.

388
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,550
You left in a rush
once you answered the phone call.

389
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,830
Is everything all right?

390
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,550
Everything is all right.

391
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,990
Was it a call from Dr Shen?

392
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,310
Are you sure you're not in love with him?

393
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,230
You don't have to hide it from me.

394
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,990
My fragile heart can take it.

395
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,990
It's not him.

396
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,590
It's a call from a friend.

397
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,030
It's something urgent.

398
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,390
Hi, another dish is here.

399
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,230
It's Jiang Yi!

400
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,710
I told you earlier.

401
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,180
He's just here to eat

402
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,230
but he's wearing mask and cap.

403
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,750
Jiang Yi!

404
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,070
It's Jiang Yi! Come here!

405
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,630
Jiang Yi, I'm your fan.

406
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,950
Can I take a photo with you?

407
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,510
Don't worry.

408
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,790
I won't post it on the internet.

409
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,590
Please take a few photos for me.

410
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,110
Hurry up, take more photos.

411
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:25,870
Hurry up, take more photos.

412
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,670
It's my turn.

413
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,510
Bai, it's time to serve the dish.

414
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,350
Bai, it's time to serve the dish.

415
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,710
What's wrong, master?

416
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,110
What is everyone looking at?

417
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,180
The person who wants to
try your cooking is a celebrity.

418
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,790
His fans recognized him
and he's now surrounded by the fans.

419
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,430
They're taking photographs with him.

420
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,550
I can't even bring the dish to him.

421
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,390
Please take a photo for me.

422
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,870
I want a photo too!

423
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,150
I want a photo too!

424
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,270
Who is him?

425
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,670
He's Jiang Yi.

426
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,790
Jiang Yi?

427
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,910
The pot is filled with boiling oil!

428
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,230
Watch out! Don't burn yourself.

429
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,390
I won't be responsible
if you burn yourself.

430
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,230
I've come to the wrong place.

431
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,110
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,390
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,990
Be careful.

434
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,070
It's burning.

435
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,590
Hurry up! Help!

436
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,750
Stop looking.

437
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,750
There's nothing to see.

438
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,190
You'd better be careful.

439
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,790
You have to be careful.

440
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,270
It's burning hot.

441
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,870
All right, let me show you the back door.

442
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,220
Let me take a look.

443
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,540
Stop looking!

444
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,830
Get back to work. Hurry up.

445
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,070
Let's get back to work.

446
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,550
Let's go.

447
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,630
Uncle Yu, thank you for the help.

448
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,710
No mention.

449
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,390
Did Sheng Sheng tell you

450
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,380
I work here?

451
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,710
Yes, we're friends.

452
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,630
She told me

453
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,590
your cooking is good.

454
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,660
That's why

455
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,470
I came here to try it.

456
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,230
Goodness.

457
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,950
Look at her.

458
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,180
She knows that you have a special job.

459
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,190
How could she

460
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,190
ask you to come to the restaurant?

461
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,110
Moving forward, if you crave anything,

462
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,910
just let me know.

463
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,870
I'll cook for you at home.

464
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,510
It's more at ease.

465
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,030
Sure, thank you.

466
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,030
Do you have any plan today?

467
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,870
I don't have any plan.

468
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,350
How about this?

469
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,030
Let's do it today
instead of choosing another date.

470
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,950
Come to my house tonight.

471
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,030
I'll cook for you.

472
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,310
I don't wish to trouble you.

473
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,260
Don't worry.

474
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,870
Sheng Sheng's mom

475
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,030
has invited Sheng Sheng's boyfriend

476
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,550
for dinner tonight.

477
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,030
Do you mean Shen Bo Qing?

478
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,270
It seems that you know Bo Qing too.

479
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,350
Yes.

480
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,700
I heard about him from Sheng Sheng.

481
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,950
Isn't it better?

482
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,270
Let's have dinner together.

483
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,190
I'll go inside

484
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,230
to give instruction to my disciples.

485
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:46,980
Wait for me.

486
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,950
Okay.

487
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,740
Sure.

488
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,750
I'll come out soon.

489
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,060
Sure.

490
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,390
Sure.

491
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,550
Things are really moving quickly
between them.

492
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,310
When are you moving back?

493
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,550
Do you plan to dump me?

494
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,150
What?

495
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,910
Who will be at an advantage in that case?

496
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,550
I'm go home tonight to pack up.

497
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,790
Then,
I'll move back to our place tomorrow.

498
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,310
That's about right.

499
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,590
I'll show you my love tomorrow night.

500
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

501
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,470
Dr Shen.

502
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,710
Bo Qing, why are you here?

503
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,990
I'm quite free today.

504
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,430
I'm here to carry out my duty
as a boyfriend.

505
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,230
I'm here to pick you up.

506
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,070
Don't you have to go on duty tonight?

507
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,630
No.

508
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,870
Mrs Cai invited me

509
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,870
to have dinner at her place.

510
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,420
She said that Uncle Yu
will be cooking a feast tonight.

511
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,030
Did you

512
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,350
tell my mom that we're trying

513
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,230
to date with each other?

514
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,140
Yes.

515
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,630
Mrs Cai is very happy.

516
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,790
Tong Tong, why don't you come along?

517
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,870
Come to my place tonight.

518
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,750
I'm not in dire need of food.

519
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,510
The future son in law
will be there tonight.

520
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,070
Why should I go there?

521
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,990
Don't talk nonsense.

522
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,590
It's still up in the air.

523
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,710
Anyway, I'm going home.

524
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,150
See you tomorrow.

525
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,310
Goobye, Dr Shen.

526
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,910
Bye.

527
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,710
Sheng Sheng, let's go.

528
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,110
Okay.

529
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,350
Jiang Yi, I heard that

530
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,830
celebrities are very busy.

531
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,590
Sheng Sheng's dad called me

532
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,870
and said that you're coming for dinner.

533
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,030
I couldn't believe that.

534
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,510
I'm taking a break.

535
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,470
I see.

536
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,380
You strike a proper balance
between work and rest.

537
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,550
It's not bad.

538
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,110
You must not only focus on work.

539
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,870
When you're free,

540
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,150
you should go pay your parents a visit.

541
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,270
Here, let me add some tea for you.

542
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,870
It's okay.

543
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,830
I can do it on my own.

544
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,030
That's right.

545
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,140
The last time you're here,

546
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,270
you didn't even have a sip of tea.

547
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,990
You're getting familiar
with this place now.

548
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,030
Now, you've become friends

549
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,870
with Sheng Sheng.

550
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:02,630
From now on,

551
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,790
you should make yourself at home.

552
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,710
Be casual.

553
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,390
Sure.

554
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,820
Mom, I'm back.

555
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,230
Sheng Sheng is back.

556
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,670
Mrs. Chai.

557
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,510
Bo Qing is here too.

558
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,950
We have a guest at home, is it?

559
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,230
Yes.

560
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,270
Who is it?

561
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:15,950
It's me.

562
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,630
Sheng Sheng, please introduce them
to each other.

563
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,350
I need to answer a phone call.

564
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,710
Sure.

565
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,070
Bo Qing, this is...

566
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:25,860
Jiang Yi.

567
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,550
I saw him on TV before.

568
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,270
Yes, that's him.

569
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,390
Let me introduce myself.

570
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,870
I'm Sheng Sheng's boyfriend.

571
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,670
My name is Shen Bo Qing.

572
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:40,910
Hello.

573
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,270
Not long ago,

574
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,750
you were trapped in a lift
with Sheng Sheng.

575
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,990
I heard that you protected her.

576
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,110
I thank you for her.

577
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,470
Back then,

578
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,150
you weren't her boyfriend yet, right?

579
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,020
I should introduce myself too.

580
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,190
I'm Yu Sheng Sheng's

581
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,950
close friend, Jiang Yi.

582
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,510
Hello.

583
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,020
Bo Qing, why don't

584
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,150
you bring it to the kitchen?

585
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,350
You may also

586
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,310
check on the progress of the dinner.

587
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,630
Sure.

588
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,070
Make yourself at home.

589
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,030
Don't worry.

590
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,830
I'll definitely

591
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,670
make myself at home.

592
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,670
Same goes to you.

593
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:18,750
Sure.

594
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,230
Why are you here?

595
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,030
I went to your dad's restaurant.

596
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,990
Someone recognized me

597
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:28,950
and your dad saved me from the situation.

598
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,990
Then, he invited me for dinner.

599
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,270
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

600
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,310
It was meant to be a surprise.

601
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,740
This is more like a shock, okay?

602
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,710
When did I become

603
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,990
your close friend?

604
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,190
Just a minute ago.

605
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,510
Or do you think that

606
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,310
it's too conservative

607
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,710
to say that we're close friends?

608
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,350
Time for dinner.

609
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,310
Tonight, we're going to have

610
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,590
some homemade herb infused wine.

611
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,270
Go wash your hands.

612
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:51,830
Okay.

613
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,550
I'm coming.

614
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:54,750
It's time for dinner.

615
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,310
I made the wine on my own.

616
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,580
I've included

617
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,510
many precious herbs.

618
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,430
The nutritional value is high.

619
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,230
I'm driving today.

620
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,830
I think I shall skip.

621
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,430
What?

622
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,180
It's okay.

623
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,230
Just get a designated driver later.

624
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,150
It's okay.

625
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,260
I worry that something
may come up in the hospital later.

626
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,510
I'll have fruit juice instead.

627
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,510
Mom, don't force him.

628
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,070
My goodness.

629
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,150
The relationship has just started

630
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,550
but you're already siding him.

631
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,310
No.

632
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,310
It seems that Sheng Sheng is shy.

633
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,510
Bo Qing

634
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,670
is your mom's favourite disciple.

635
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,950
Your mom is really happy that

636
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,590
you're dating him.

637
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,070
Here, Uncle Yu.

638
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,470
I'll drink with you.

639
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,550
Let's drink.

640
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,380
Thank you.

641
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:56,790
Here.

642
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,030
The taste of the wine is not bad.

643
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:04,870
It's indeed

644
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,870
infused with precious herbs.

645
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,230
It has a smooth mouth feel.

646
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,990
It's not astringent at all.

647
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,950
I'm glad that you like it.

648
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,110
Hey.

649
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,110
Jiang Yi is extraordinary.

650
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,270
In the afternoon, we had a discussion

651
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,110
on longevity preservation and herbs.

652
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,470
In this era,

653
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,710
youngsters

654
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,750
are no longer interested

655
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,750
in those things.

656
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,390
Yes.

657
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,430
Both of you must have
so many things to share.

658
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,590
Sheng Sheng.

659
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,950
You should have

660
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,870
brought Jiang Yi home sooner.

661
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,390
We have only known each other for a short while.

662
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,550
However,

663
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,470
both of you seem really close.

664
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,790
Bonding between two people
has nothing to do

665
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,390
with the length of time.

666
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,020
After all,
we survived an accident together.

667
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,550
Am I right, Sheng Sheng?

668
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:46,980
Yes.

669
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,150
You went out

670
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,140
without ensuring the security?

671
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,110
Why did you

672
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,710
get recognised so soon?

673
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,470
I couldn't help it. I'm too popular.

674
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,710
Then, you shouldn't go out so often.

675
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,110
Blame it on Uncle Yu.

676
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,820
His cooking is too good.

677
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,830
Here, Uncle Yu.

678
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,230
Thank you

679
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,230
for preparing the feast.

680
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,230
I propose a toast to you.

681
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,030
Moving forward,

682
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,070
come for dinner more often.

683
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:14,630
Sure.

684
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,030
Here, have a piece of meat.

685
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:19,790
Here.

686
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:20,910
Great.

687
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,380
Don't drink too much.

688
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,350
Have some food.

689
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:25,830
Sure.

690
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,990
Jiang Yi, this is
sauteed lamb slices with scallion.

691
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,750
I think you can't reach it.

692
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,350
Here, have some.

693
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,190
I'm good.

694
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:31,910
No way.

695
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,110
He can't eat lamb.
He has an allergy to lamb.

696
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,150
Allergy?

697
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,070
Do you often eat together with him?

698
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,870
How do you know that?

699
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,030
I interviewed him before.

700
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,390
I did some research.

701
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,110
You've worked hard.

702
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,950
Not only you have to work over time,
you have to stay up often.

703
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:50,990
Have more lamb slices.

704
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,030
It's good for your brain.

705
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,510
Thank you, Bo Qing

706
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,670
I can help myself.

707
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,030
Sheng Sheng.

708
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,990
Why are you still calling him Bo Qing?

709
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,790
It's become a habit.

710
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,550
I don't mind, Sheng Sheng
can call me whatever she likes.

711
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,870
She even said that

712
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,710
I'm her doctor before.

713
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,390
Look at Sheng Sheng.

714
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,870
Let's have more.

715
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,110
Let's do it.

716
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:12,710
Here.

717
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,590
Here.

718
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,910
Jiang Yi.

719
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,390
I'm really happy

720
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,630
because you specially named me
to cook for you.

721
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,500
My disciples said

722
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,270
I got verified by a celebrity.

723
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:35,750
Uncle Yu.

724
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,350
You don't have to be verified
by a celebrity.

725
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,710
You're a celebrity chef.

726
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,750
That's so touching.

727
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,750
I need to use the washroom.

728
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,550
Let's continue when I'm back.

729
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,190
Sure.

730
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,150
Hold on.

731
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,790
Let's finish it.

732
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,390
Let's finish it.

733
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:55,830
Here.

734
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,310
Slow down, dad.

735
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,030
Dear daughter,
take care of my best friend.

736
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,150
Sure.

737
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,420
Brother.

738
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,270
You've exposed your true colour today.

739
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:27,870
Do you know that?

740
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,470
Have I? Enlighten me.

741
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,670
Today, I found out that

742
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,510
you're so good at socialising.

743
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,550
Well...

744
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,550
I know

745
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,390
quite many things.

746
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,550
The thing is,
whether I want to do it or not.

747
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,870
Since Uncle Yu is so happy,

748
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,270
I don't want to be the wet blanket.

749
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,190
Based on the gossip on the internet,

750
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,430
many celebrities
will join many social events

751
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,950
in order to get sources.

752
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,950
It seems that the gossip is true.

753
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,310
What's wrong?

754
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,710
Are you trying to
trick me into telling the truth

755
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,710
while I'm tipsy?

756
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,670
Are you tipsy?

757
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,420
No.

758
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,190
Mrs Chai, I have to go.

759
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,670
You're leaving?

760
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,790
Be safe.

761
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,750
Sheng Sheng, Bo Qing is leaving.

762
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,470
Please see him out.

763
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,390
Sure.

764
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,870
Sure.

765
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,790
Don't drink too much.

766
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,140
Goodbye.

767
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,310
Come again.

768
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,350
I've been to your house so many times.

769
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,390
This is the first time you send me off.

770
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,030
The treatment for a boyfriend

771
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:45,990
is indeed different.

772
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,430
I need to get used to it.

773
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,340
Take it slowly.

774
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,230
You'll realise

775
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,980
I'm a good candidate as boyfriend.

776
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,550
You should go up now.

777
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,430
Goodnight.

778
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:00,580
Bo Qing.

779
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,630
Yes?

780
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,270
Jiang Yi came to my house

781
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:04,980
for dinner...

782
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,670
I know.

783
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,430
It's meant to be a secret.

784
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:08,550
Yes.

785
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,710
Well,

786
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,990
I'm not interested in

787
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,510
entertainment news,

788
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,990
but since it's related to your job,

789
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,590
I got an understanding of it on purpose.

790
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,980
Celebrities

791
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,990
have their respective public persona

792
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,110
which must be protected at all time.

793
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,630
Furthermore,
our private life may be affected

794
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,030
if we mingle with them.

795
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,510
It's better to keep things simple.

796
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,220
Thank you for your understanding.

797
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,710
You don't have to be so polite to me.

798
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,510
I'm leaving.

799
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,150
Mom, where is dad?

800
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,620
He had too much to drink.

801
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,550
He's taking a rest in the bedroom.

802
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,260
Where is Jiang Yi?

803
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,510
He cleaned up the table

804
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,150
with me not long ago.

805
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,630
When I was done doing the dishes,

806
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,190
he was already not there.

807
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,310
I think he's gone back.

808
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,990
He didn't even tell me that he'd left.

809
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,060
Perhaps it's because
he had too much to drink.

810
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,590
Fine, I'm going to take a shower.

811
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:07,790
Sheng Sheng.

812
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,590
Give him a call later

813
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,310
to see if he's reached home.

814
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,710
Okay, got it.

815
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,030
Dad.

816
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,590
Jiang Yi?

817
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,390
Hey.

818
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:56,870
Hey.

819
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,790
Wake up.

820
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,670
What are you doing here?

821
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,190
I'm sleeping.

822
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,390
Sleeping?

823
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,390
Yes.

824
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,510
Get up and take a look.

825
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,230
Where is this?

826
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,350
This is my room.

827
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,190
This is your room?

828
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,580
Get up!

829
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,470
Do you really think that

830
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,630
our body is swapped again?

831
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,550
Take a closer look.

832
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,430
I'm Yu Sheng Sheng.

833
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,550
Yes.

834
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,470
You're Yu Sheng Sheng.

835
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:52,950
Don't sleep in my bed.

836
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,740
Hurry up, let me send you back.

837
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,590
You've had too much to drink.

838
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,380
I've not had too much to drink.

839
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,670
Are you sure?

840
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,230
Yes.

841
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,830
What is this?

842
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,630
It's a good idea.

843
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,470
This is one.

844
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,150
Great.

845
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,190
Just go back to sleep.

846
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,630
I'll sleep at the living room.

847
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,190
Yu Sheng Sheng.

848
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,590
Yes?

849
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,030
Goodnight.

850
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,510
Goodnight.

851
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,350
You're awake.

852
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,670
Where are your parents?

853
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,350
The sun is out.

854
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,030
My parents have gone to work.

855
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,390
Clean yourself up.

856
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,910
It's time for breakfast.

857
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,870
Look at your messy hair.

858
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,470
Fine.

859
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:14,830
In front of me,

860
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,340
you need not to take care of your image.

861
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,430
I've prepared a toothbrush for you.

862
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,510
It's on the sink.

863
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,430
You're quite busy at work.

864
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,150
I'm always busy at work.

865
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,750
I was occupied with the body swap

866
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,550
and I had to take care
of your younger sister.

867
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,180
I didn't have time to work.

868
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,190
When I work less,

869
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,150
Tong Tong has to work more.

870
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,550
I need to catch up with her.

871
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,860
Things will be normal.

872
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,110
Yes.

873
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,990
Fortunately, everything is back on track.

874
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,870
Otherwise, I feel guilty

875
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,790
for hiding it from Tong Tong.

876
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,990
The more I talk to her,

877
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,390
the more mistakes I make.

878
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,790
In the period where our body was swapped,

879
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,150
we must have had left quite many bugs.

880
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,350
We need to discover them slowly.

881
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,270
I had to hide it from Tong Tong

882
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,430
to avoid more troubles.

883
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,710
That's the right thing to do.

884
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,350
Have you ever thought about it before?

885
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,990
What if we accidentally

886
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,910
swap our body again?

887
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,870
I've thought about it before.

888
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,710
However,

889
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,030
it's almost impossible

890
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,830
to be in a faulty lift

891
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,390
on a stormy day

892
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,070
or being kissed by force.

893
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,270
Please watch your language.

894
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,190
Firstly,
you need to set the subject straight.

895
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,630
Your body

896
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,270
kissed my body by force.

897
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,110
Secondly,

898
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,150
if this were a trendy drama,

899
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,670
what you just said

900
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,950
would turn out to truly happen for sure.

901
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,510
Please watch your mouth.

902
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,470
What's wrong? Are you scared?

903
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,870
Ridiculous.

904
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,150
I, Yu Sheng Sheng am fearless.

905
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,590
Let's do it again then.

906
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,900
Well, let's do it.

907
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,030
Fine, let's do it.

908
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,470
♫ The night is used to
the pitch-black darkness ♫
