00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
Matsuura Firm.

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,320
Park.

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,470
Hagia Sophia Church.

5
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
What have you found?

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,280
The servant who took the kid for a walk in the park

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,160
at our friend's house,

8
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,640
what's her name?

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,840
Li Ying.

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,720
A short-term worker?

11
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,160
I think so.

12
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,470
But I'm not sure.

13
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:52,960
Where do people here

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
usually hire short-term workers?

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,280
Here,

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,640
in the North Market.

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,920
Let's stay calm, okay?

18
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,200
The principal will come out later.

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,560
She will definitely give you a solution.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
Please trust me, okay?

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,640
Everyone stop arguing.

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,720
Everyone stop arguing.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
The principal is coming out. Move.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
We'll definitely give you a solution.

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,640
When is she coming?

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
When is she coming?

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
We have to see our children.

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,440
That's right.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,000
What are you doing?

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
We're taking the kids home.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,680
We must see our daughter today.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
You're all respectable people

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,840
and now you're here to embarrass a girl.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,720
How could you?

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,640
We have to take the child away today no matter what.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Yes.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,240
Yes.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,440
Yes.

39
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,160
This is a school,

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,720
not a prison.

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,240
No one is keeping you from taking your kids away.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,920
You're all educated.

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,070
Can't you talk properly?

44
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,520
Here comes the principal.

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,160
Here comes the principal.

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,760
Here comes the principal.

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,320
Here comes the principal.

48
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,560
On behalf of the school,

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
I apologize to you.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,920
What's the point of being sorry?

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
Now that there's been a murder at the school,

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,360
how can we trust you

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,600
with our kids?

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,400
That's right.

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,120
You can't even find the murderer

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,440
up till now.

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:50,960
That's right.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Guys,

60
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,480
we have now

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
handed over the case to the police.

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
As you can see,

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,400
Inspector Luo of the police department is here.

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,520
We believe in the police's ability to handle the case.

65
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,440
We also believe that the police

66
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,400
will be able to catch the murderer soon.

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,920
I, Luo Jinyan, can assure you

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
that there is absolutely no female ghost in our school.

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,680
I also believe

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,200
the police won't draw the conclusion

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,480
of a female ghosting killing.

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,480
Am I right?

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,200
Inspector Luo?

74
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
We've got something.

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
Actually, we just want to take the children home.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,480
We don't mean bad.

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:26,760
That's right.

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,240
That's right.

80
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,800
That's right.

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Yes, yes.

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
Of course, it's okay.

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920
Fill out an application form later

84
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,760
and sign it.

85
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,480
Then you can take your kids back.

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
But after that,

87
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,440
if the case is solved,

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,920
you don't have to send your children back again.

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,600
What?

90
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:41,800
What?

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,200
What does this mean?

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
How can this be?

93
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,360
It's settled then.

94
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,320
Principal Luo.

95
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,000
Actually,

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
we don't mean that.

97
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,720
That's right.

98
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,800
Let them fill out the application form.

99
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't leave anything out.

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,920
If anyone who wants to take his child away,

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,160
just ask Zhao Qiansun to do it.

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,960
What to do now?

103
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you think we should still take them away?

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know.

105
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:14,920
Please take your time.

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,440
Thank you.

107
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,920
I'll go find someone after lunch.

108
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,829
Let's meet up at the North Market this afternoon.

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,360
Let's eat our own food,

110
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,120
so you don't feel uncomfortable.

111
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
I can have someone come and help you

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,560
tomorrow.

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,960
Don't bother.

114
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,560
In fact, these parents

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
send their children here

116
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,840
more or less because of the background of the girls' school.

117
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,040
Those who are officials

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,160
in politics,

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,080
businessmen,

120
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,960
and many people's wives

121
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,400
also graduated from here.

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,480
In the end,

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,160
these parents

124
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
are just political opportunists,

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
bullying the weak and afraid of the tough.

126
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
It's a pity.

127
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Pity what?

128
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
It's a pity

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
of Principal Fan's educational ambitions.

130
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,360
Since Luo Jinyan is so capable,

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,440
why isn't she the principal?

132
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,920
Do you think she doesn't want to?

133
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
In her mind,

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,760
she is the principal.

135
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Principal Fan has been here for almost 20 years.

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
Vice Principal Luo

137
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
has only been here for seven or eight years.

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
Although the times have changed,

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,720
it doesn't seem to have completely changed.

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,880
The old things of the past have become obsolete.

141
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,560
But they've been picked up again.

142
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
What President Fan has always valued

143
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,760
are the Four Books and Five Classics,

144
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,800
righteousness and integrity.

145
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,960
Vice Principal Luo is different.

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,760
What she values

147
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,200
is the practicality of education.

148
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,760
In her mind,

149
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,400
whatever can make these female students

150
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,280
have a voice as soon as possible

151
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
after graduation

152
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,760
is a priority.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
So, shortly after Luo Jinyan arrived,

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
the girl committed suicide.

155
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,040
Qiming, there's someone at the door looking for you.

156
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Okay, thank you.

157
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,360
Situ.

158
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,560
Why are you here?

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,840
I wanted to consult you on something.

160
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,760
Don't say that.

161
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,880
Just tell me what you need.

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,240
I'll tell you what I know.

163
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,960
If I don't know, I'll ask around for you.

164
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,680
There was a consul named Boult in the Russian Consulate.

165
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
Do you know him?

166
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,360
Yeah.

167
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,280
Our newspaper knows

168
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
the several foreign consuls well.

169
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,480
Consul Boult has something to do

170
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,400
with the girls' school murder case?

171
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm working on another case.

172
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,840
The girl's school case has been closed?

173
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,320
Soon.

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
Consul Boult has a dog at home.

175
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Do you know that?

176
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,080
You're talking about the Pekingese, right?

177
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
You know?

178
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Of course.

179
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,920
Our president gave him that Pekingese.

180
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,150
Those rich ladies abroad

181
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,150
like to keep this kind of dog.

182
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,080
What about the Pekingese

183
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,040
after Consul Boult left?

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,160
Well, I don't know about that.

185
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,440
What is it?

186
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,520
You're helping someone find the dog?

187
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
Inspector Luo.

188
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,840
Don't always try to get me to say something.

189
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
How about this?

190
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
You change your job.

191
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,600
I'll find you a job that pays better

192
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
and has less work than here.

193
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,240
If there is an inside story,

194
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,920
just tell me.

195
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,080
Don't be afraid.

196
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,440
I won't let anyone hurt you.

197
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,360
It's not that I don't want to talk to you about it.

198
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,280
I just got here this semester.

199
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,360
The teacher who has been here the longest is Li Pei,

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,000
Ms. Li.

201
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,960
She's been here for six years.

202
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,720
What about the teachers from seven or eight years ago?

203
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,400
So that's the problem.

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,640
All right.

205
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,560
Secretary Xia.

206
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,920
I'll have to go to the newspaper office for work.

207
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,520
I'll talk to you later.

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,360
Take care.

209
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,640
Drive ahead.

210
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,120
Stop at the corner.

211
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,680
Okay.

212
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,520
I'd like to ask you one more favor.

213
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,080
Go ahead.

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,160
Find me a house.

215
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,030
Help me find a house centered here

216
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,720
with cheap rent

217
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,960
without stairs.

218
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,240
A woman lives in it who has difficulty with her legs

219
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,720
and takes handwork jobs.

220
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
She has a sister

221
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,240
who comes to visit her every Wednesday.

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,150
The two of them also have a Pekingese.

223
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,440
If there is a specific location,

224
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
let me know right away.

225
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,520
Sure, no problem.

226
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,440
Let's go.

227
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,600
Qiming.

228
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
Mr. Luo, why are you here too?

229
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,400
Situ just left.

230
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,960
Let me stop him.

231
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,360
Don't.

232
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,720
What did he want from you?

233
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
He asked me

234
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
about a dog.

235
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,680
A dog?

236
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,240
He put aside the girls' school case

237
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,480
to study a dog?

238
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,080
He's going too far.

239
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,280
Wait a minute.

240
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,880
I thought Situ said the girls' school case

241
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,960
is almost solved.

242
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
He really said that?

243
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,440
That's right.

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
How?

245
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,400
Mr. Luo, why don't you ask him directly?

246
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,120
Situ asked me to do something for him.

247
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,520
I'm in a hurry to get out.

248
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
What does he want you to do?

249
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
To find someone.

250
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,240
There's a woman with a dog

251
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,320
in this area

252
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,400
who lives in a cheap

253
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,920
rental house with no stairs.

254
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,600
Write it down.

255
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,880
Mr. Luo.

256
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,280
It's done.

257
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,200
Okay.

258
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,120
I see.

259
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,440
I have people here.

260
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,240
I'll help you find it.

261
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,040
It's quicker.

262
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
Since I'm helping,

263
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
I think you have to return the favor.

264
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,520
Help me find someone too.

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,840
Mr. Luo, don't say that.

266
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
Just tell me who you're looking for.

267
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,600
A female ghost.

268
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,280
How can I find it?

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,840
Do you have any

270
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,200
special method?

271
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,640
Here is the thing.

272
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,680
There's a girl student

273
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,320
who hanged herself in the music classroom.

274
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,800
It's a big deal.

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
You reporters must know about it.

276
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,640
Either you interviewed it and didn't write about it,

277
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,840
or you haven't released the script.

278
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,520
Anyway, there must be people who know the inside story.

279
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,200
You should

280
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,920
ask around at the paper.

281
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
Ask the older reporters.

282
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,960
Get the information for me.

283
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,040
You don't have to worry about

284
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
the rest.

285
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,480
Mr. Luo.

286
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,160
Are you sure the case is soon getting solved?

287
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,400
Why does it sound like it hasn't even started yet?

288
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,320
Are you questioning me?

289
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,280
No, I'm not.

290
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,120
That's not what I meant.

291
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,960
This case of the girls' school

292
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,480
is not that simple.

293
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,120
It's actually a revenge case.

294
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,880
Revenge?

295
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
It looks like the female ghost killed Lin Jie.

296
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,720
But in fact, someone

297
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,440
avenged the girl.

298
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
Lin Jie should be a student at the girls' school

299
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
seven or eight years ago.

300
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
She was a big bully.

301
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,720
The victim couldn't stand it and committed suicide.

302
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,320
Is that so?

303
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,080
That's not what Situ Yan said?

304
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,800
Situ didn't reveal the details.

305
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
Okay, I'll help you find the woman.

306
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Take care of my business.

307
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
You'll be credited by the police.

308
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,960
It's nothing.

309
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,800
Goodbye, Mr. Luo.

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,320
Liu.

311
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,040
What's up, boss?

312
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,880
Find me a woman with a dog

313
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,760
who lives in a cheap house with no stairs

314
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
and has a sister.

315
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Okay, don't worry.

316
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,840
Wait a minute.

317
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,800
Keep it quiet.

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,520
Don't make a big deal out of it,

319
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,880
in case the whole world knows.

320
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,960
Let me see your detective skills.

321
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,280
Don't worry.

322
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,920
You, you, and you.

323
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,640
Come with me to Dori.

324
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,760
Here.

325
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,360
You were really right.

326
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,560
I've asked Shen Huatang.

327
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,520
That's where

328
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,320
she hired a short-term worker.

329
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,600
Clean it.

330
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,160
I washed it.

331
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
When did you do it?

332
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,000
Wait.

333
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,880
This is not mine.

334
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,840
I just bought it on the way,

335
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,240
so you won't say I took your handkerchief.

336
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,840
You're so calculating.

337
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm not calculating.

338
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm just good at learning lessons.

339
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,520
Which store introduced Li Ying as a temporary worker?

340
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:53,840
That one.

341
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,480
Six months ago,

342
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,720
Shen Huatang said she was looking for

343
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
a helper who was familiar with dogs.

344
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,400
So the boss introduced her to them.

345
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,520
You mean Amy and Li Ying are in cahoots?

346
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,400
But one of them kidnapped a human

347
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
and the other kidnapped a dog.

348
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,240
Is the kidnapping of the dog just a test?

349
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,920
Let's go check it out.

350
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,560
Let me ask.

351
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,920
Have you seen a woman with a dog

352
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,840
around here?

353
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,440
No, I haven't.

354
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,320
Let me ask.

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,280
Have you seen a woman with a dog

356
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,040
around here?

357
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,440
No, I'm not.

358
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,080
How about you?

359
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,160
No, I haven't.

360
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,000
Give me the handkerchief.

361
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,040
I thought you just gave it back to me.

362
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
I'll give you another.

363
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,000
How are you?

364
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,520
You look unfamiliar.

365
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,840
We just arrived in Harbin.

366
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
We are looking for

367
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,440
a helper who can take care of the Pekingese.

368
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,920
Then you've come to the right place.

369
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,480
I have a few

370
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,040
suitable ones.

371
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,720
Li Ying, the helper of the bank owner

372
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
asked me to come here for a girl named Amy.

373
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,040
Amy?

374
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,880
That can't be.

375
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,720
Li Ying knows that Amy has an employer.

376
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Did you mishear?

377
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,880
Why don't you

378
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,960
take a second look?

379
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Maybe it's a mistake.

380
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,000
Have you seen her?

381
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,600
No.

382
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,040
Let me ask.

383
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,600
Have you seen...

384
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,240
Let me ask.

385
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,760
Have you seen

386
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,480
a crippled woman with a dog

387
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,800
around here?

388
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,520
No.

389
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,880
I haven't.

390
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,280
Thank you.

391
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,840
You're welcome.

392
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
What kind of world

393
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
is this?

394
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,040
In the past, dogs used to serve people.

395
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,640
But now,

396
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,320
people have to serve dogs.

397
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,840
This is the palace Pekingese.

398
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,320
Now the palace is gone,

399
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,640
we're allowed to have a dog.

400
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,520
Look at this.

401
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,480
Mr. Sun from Jing Yang Restaurant.

402
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,360
Amy.

403
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,240
She's working there.

404
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,320
Yao.

405
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,160
Sun.

406
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,080
How strange.

407
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,560
A group of police is looking for a dog on the Eighth Street.

408
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,000
This kind of case happens every day.

409
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,560
She's not home?

410
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,680
Let's go check around.

411
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,920
Have you seen that woman?

412
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,640
No, I'm not.

413
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,000
You can go.

414
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,160
Liu.

415
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,800
Mr. Situ.

416
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,960
Why are you here?

417
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,920
The boss told us to

418
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,480
look for a crippled woman with a dog in this area.

419
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,840
Do you know

420
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,520
you're chasing a kidnapper?

421
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,440
If you push her too far,

422
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,400
what if she kills the victim?

423
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,160
Tell your men to look for her.

424
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,280
A crippled woman

425
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,320
with a kid.

426
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
She can't have gone far.

427
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,880
Okay.

428
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,440
Wait a minute.

429
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,320
With a dog.

430
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
With a dog?

431
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,520
Yeah.

432
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,200
The crippled woman with a dog.

433
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,680
Give me the map.

434
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,520
Let's go.

435
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,320
Go now.

436
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,480
Is there a well or a river nearby?

437
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,760
Yes.

438
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,080
It's over there.

439
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,760
I'll take you there.

440
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,000
Can you bear it?

441
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,160
What exactly is going on?

442
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,680
It was my idea to kidnap the dog.

443
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,520
I did it all by myself.

444
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,760
I cut their leashes

445
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,800
and sent the blackmail letter.

446
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,120
You've all seen it.

447
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,040
I don't have a chance to live.

448
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,920
Just take me away.

449
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,480
Why did you kidnap a dog?

450
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,440
Wasn't it a girl?

451
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,829
When I met you at the church,

452
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,520
I knew I couldn't hide it.

453
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,960
How did you know?

454
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,200
I think the main character of this incident

455
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,349
is it.

456
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,640
It's named Aiya.

457
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,880
Aiya.

458
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,000
Even the name is so similar.

459
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,520
It should be a good helper for you.

460
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,960
Mrs. Sun goes to church every week.

461
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,080
You took Beibei to the park

462
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,080
while you were working,

463
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,480
and then took Aya out with you.

464
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
Even if someone saw you,

465
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
you would have been seen

466
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,040
walking with a Pekingese as usual.

467
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,800
And the person who talked to you,

468
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,280
if there really is such a person,

469
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,240
would have claimed

470
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,680
seeing you holding a Pekingese

471
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,800
while talking to you.

472
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
And you

473
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,240
cut the leash in between chatting.

474
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,320
And Aiya had been trained by you

475
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,600
who would run right back.

476
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,320
And in a few minutes,

477
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,760
you exclaimed that the dog had been stolen.

478
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
You really know everything.

479
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,240
I have nothing to say.

480
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
You really don't have anything to say?

481
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm not educated.

482
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm not trained either.

483
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,760
Now that I'm getting older and older,

484
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
it's getting harder to find employers.

485
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,040
When I'm even older and less useful,

486
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,560
I still have to feed myself.

487
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,720
So what can I do?

488
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Wait for death in this little shack?

489
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,200
So when Mrs. Boult

490
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,720
gave me Aiya,

491
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
we came up with this idea.

492
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,800
You?

493
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
It's all my fault.

494
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160
I got my sister into trouble.

495
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,000
If it wasn't for me,

496
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,320
Amy would have married long ago.

497
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,520
She was planning for me.

498
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,760
She just wants to save more money

499
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,880
before she gets old.

500
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
You can arrest me.

501
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,640
Sister.

502
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,040
Who are “we”

503
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,840
as you said?

504
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Who else do you think is there?

505
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,120
People like them

506
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
with no schooling,

507
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,480
no skills,

508
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
who work as short-time workers.

509
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
Some are even physically challenged

510
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,340
like my sister,

511
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
who can only do simple and repetitive work.

512
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
They don't even know

513
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,160
where to get their next meal

514
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,760
and where they should live next week.

515
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
So we all came up with this solution.

516
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,960
The money you want

517
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,120
is just pocket money to the rich ladies.

518
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,320
They wouldn't even make a big deal out of it,

519
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,560
nor did they dare to tell their husbands.

520
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
I did it all by myself.

521
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
No one else had anything to do with it.

522
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,760
How many times did you succeed?

523
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,400
About five or six times.

524
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,000
Mrs. Sun always lost money in mahjong.

525
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,080
When she ran out of money, she asked Mr. Sun for it.

526
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,440
And Mr. Sun suspected me as the thief.

527
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
I might as well really do it.

528
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,320
Although it's not a lot of money

529
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,280
to Mrs. Sun,

530
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,200
it's not yours either.

531
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,720
I'll give you all this money.

532
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,960
Please let my sister go.

533
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
I did it all by myself.

534
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,040
If you want to give those rich people an explanation,

535
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,440
just take me away.

536
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,320
It has nothing to do with her.

537
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,040
I'm begging you.

538
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,160
I'm the one who does the work.

539
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,680
Sister, don't beg him.

540
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,160
Take her away.

541
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,160
It's a misunderstanding.

542
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,800
Misunderstanding?

543
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,360
I'm sorry

544
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,720
for making you work for so long.

545
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,800
It's okay.

546
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,080
Go back.

547
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:21,840
Okay.

548
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,360
Let's go.

549
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Don't worry.

550
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,320
We'll return the dog to Shen Huatang.

551
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,840
Let's forget about it.

552
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,720
Thank you.

553
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,200
Thank you.

554
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,520
Move, move.

555
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Shen Huatang's daughter is actually a dog.

556
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,200
That's funny.

557
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,960
A person has a dog child.

558
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,920
This dog has a good life.

559
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,880
It was born

560
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,480
at a rich lady's house

561
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,200
and has a beautiful music teacher like you

562
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
playing the piano for it.

563
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm not in the mood for it.

564
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,200
Don't follow me.

565
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,040
No way, Lin Jie

566
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
should come from Harbin.

567
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,920
How did it become Fengtian?

568
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,080
Mr. Luo,

569
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,320
I got

570
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,120
the information you asked me to find out.

571
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,400
Tell me.

572
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,240
The girl who committed suicide seven years ago was the daughter of a prince.

573
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,640
The prince had to force her daughter to get married.

574
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,440
She was a princess?

575
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Shaochuan is a noble young master.

576
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,040
Why investigate the haunting?

577
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,120
If the princess is really a ghost,

578
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,600
Luo Jinyan

579
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,680
would have to

580
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,040
dig her out.

581
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,000
I thought she was forced to commit suicide by the school.

582
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,120
I heard that Luo Jinyan

583
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,160
helped the prince persuade the princess.

584
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
Not only did she fail to persuade the princess,

585
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,280
the latter even died after that.

586
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Who on earth is Luo Jinyan?

587
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,560
She's something.

588
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
Indeed.

589
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,600
At first, the Prince said

590
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,560
he wanted Luo Jinyan out of Harbin.

591
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,320
And?

592
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,440
He packed his own things

593
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,840
and ran away.

594
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,160
After the death of the princess,

595
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,280
the Prince left Harbin

596
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,080
and moved to Fengtian.

597
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
No news of him since then.

598
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,320
In that case,

599
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,640
Lin Jie is indeed a native of Fengtian.

600
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,160
Why didn't the princess want to get married?

601
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,440
I don't know.

602
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,640
Maybe she already had a lover.

603
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,160
After the princess was forced to die,

604
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,920
the lover would definitely hold a grudge.

605
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,720
And Lin Jie was from Fengtian.

606
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,760
She must have something to do with the Prince.

607
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
Is he still alive?

608
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
I'm sorry.

609
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,440
He's dead.

610
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,360
This Prince

611
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,800
must have been killed by the murderer too.

612
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,120
He wanted to avenge the death of the princess.

613
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,040
Bao.

614
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,480
There is a clue for the case of the girls' school.

615
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,800
Where is the murderer?

616
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
Get me a file from Fengtian first.

617
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,080
What file?

618
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,680
All murder cases

619
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,200
over the years.

620
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,400
There must be a prince in there.

621
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,080
I'd like to see

622
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,760
who else has been killed

623
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,520
apart from this prince.

624
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,080
What prince?

625
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,960
Don't worry about that.

626
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,200
Just wait for me

627
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,000
to solve this big Fengtian-Harbin

628
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,920
case of revenge.

629
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,040
Wait a minute.

630
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,320
You can't just transfer

631
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,040
the file.

632
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,880
There are many procedures here.

633
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,240
It's on me.

634
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,360
That's right.

635
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,560
Put me through Fengtian.

636
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,760
If Lin Jie wasn't related to the Prince,

637
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,320
the case wouldn't stand.

638
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,320
The female ghost

639
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
is just a bluff.

640
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,520
The more mysterious it seems,

641
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,440
the simpler the modus operandi is.

642
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,000
Once the file of Fengtian arrives,

643
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,480
this case will definitely be solved.

644
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,440
I see.

645
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
You're trying to surprise Situ.

646
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,440
Right?

647
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
You're clever.

648
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,040
But wait,

649
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
aren't they all female teachers?

650
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,960
Then the perpetrator

651
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,920
must be her lover.

652
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,920
It could also be

653
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,120
her girlfriend or

654
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,560
bestie.

655
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,920
Situ.

656
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,920
I'm looking for you.

657
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,520
Why didn't you help me

658
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,040
with the case of the girls' school?

659
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,680
Guess what?

660
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,440
What?

661
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,280
Boss.

662
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,720
One casserole.

663
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,560
Okay.

664
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,320
Boss.

665
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,840
Two more servings.

666
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,680
Okay.

667
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Enjoy your seats.

668
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,960
Did you send Liu to Dori?

669
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,360
That's right.

670
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,320
Did you know it was a kidnapping case?

671
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Of course, I knew.

672
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,280
Since you knew,

673
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,200
why did you have people search for the kidnapper?

674
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,040
Did the kidnapper kill the victim?

675
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,080
I don't think so.

676
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,040
Situ must have arrived in time.

677
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,480
Right?

678
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,440
Damn Liu.

679
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,560
I told him to do it quietly.

680
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,600
I'm begging you.

681
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,400
If you can't help,

682
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,560
please don't do it blindly.

683
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,960
That's right.

684
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,880
I can't help.

685
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,800
I just have nothing to do.

686
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,680
Mr. Luo.

687
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,800
Mr. Luo is also upset.

688
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,320
The lady said this is your payment.

689
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,600
It's not necessary.

690
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,320
My baby.

691
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,000
Come on.

692
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,920
Give mommy a hug.

693
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
Are you all right, baby?

694
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,000
Are you okay?

695
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,480
Come on.

696
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,720
Are you hurt?

697
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,840
Poor thing.

698
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,080
Thank you, Miss. Zhou.

699
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,040
You are so reliable.

700
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,520
Why did you say

701
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,160
your daughter was kidnapped?

702
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
This is my daughter.

703
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,080
What if it's killed?

704
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,640
Miss. Zhou.

705
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,840
You must not know.

706
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,080
Li Ying told me

707
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,040
there was a family over there

708
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,520
whose son got kidnapped.

709
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,160
The kidnapper wanted 100 yuan.

710
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,720
And then

711
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,960
they scraped together

712
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,920
but they just couldn't offer it.

713
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,000
As a result, the boy was killed.

714
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
My baby girl

715
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,040
is worth five of her sons, right?

716
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,840
Five of her sons?

717
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,480
Dogs and humans are different.

718
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,040
There's progress in the case of the girls' school?

719
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,040
They say it's related to the student's suicide by hanging.

720
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,560
The murderer killed Lin Jie for revenge.

721
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,120
How did Lin Jie die?

722
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,080
The murderer stood four feet away from the victim

723
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,920
and fired.

724
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,160
The bullet penetrated her heart.

725
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,040
What about the schoolgirl?

726
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,200
Hanged herself.

727
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,480
If it was revenge,

728
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,960
the murderer would have been more ritualistic.

729
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,680
He would have Lin Jie die

730
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,520
the same way as the schoolgirl did.

731
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,000
That's right.

732
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,280
But why did he kill her in the music room,

733
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,880
not somewhere else?

734
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Why?

735
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,760
Ask Luo Shaochuan to check

736
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,120
the new teachers this semester

737
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
besides the music room.

738
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
The murderer may be among them.

739
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,600
Lin Jie is dead?

740
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,960
What's going on?

741
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,760
That's too sudden.

742
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,760
How sad.

743
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,480
Then Miss. Zhou,

744
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,080
after this,

745
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,560
can you come to teach me?

746
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Miss. Zhou,

747
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,720
where did you find the dog?

748
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,800
Don't you know?

749
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,000
This time

750
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I will pretend nothing happened.

751
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,320
But don't let there be a next time.

752
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,760
Thank you, Miss. Zhou.

753
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,680
Thank you, Miss. Zhou.

754
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Miss. Zhou.

755
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,520
Why are you here?

756
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,520
I'm waiting for you.

757
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,240
Do you know how many people are doing things illegally

758
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
somewhere you can't see

759
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,160
just trying to survive?

760
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,400
They are wrong.

761
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,840
But they just want to survive.

762
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,640
What are you looking at?

763
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,320
I'm looking at a noble music teacher

764
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,160
who can even understand the hardships and misery

765
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,680
of people like us at the bottom.

766
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,320
What else?

767
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,640
It's not uncommon to see dogs living like humans

768
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,880
or you and the young master

769
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,360
talking nicely

770
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,320
who can do nothing right.

771
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
What are you laughing at?

772
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,880
Are you mocking me?

773
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,360
It's not mockery.

774
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,960
I admire you.

775
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,360
I was a lawyer.

776
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
I've seen too much injustice and darkness.

777
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,920
I wanted to subvert the darkness.

778
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,520
But in the end,

779
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,480
it's just like an ant shaking the tree.

780
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,920
So I settled for the second best

781
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,200
to be

782
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
a detective in pursuit of the truth.

783
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,440
But this is the problem of this era.

784
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,360
I believe that one day,

785
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,360
the darkness will pass.

786
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,800
The widowed, the lonely and the disabled

787
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,120
all will be provided for.

788
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,600
You already knew

789
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,640
Shen Huatang's baby girl was a dog?

790
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,120
Since when?

791
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,800
From the beginning.

792
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,840
To be more precise,

793
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
since the teacher's wife entered the door at night.

794
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,000
Why didn't you tell me?

795
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,760
Do you know that I didn't sleep the whole night,

796
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,960
worrying about the girl?

797
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,920
Because until all the facts are proven,

798
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,000
any details,

799
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,120
even if it's only one in 10,000 chances,

800
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,400
can't be ignored.

801
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,160
Unless I saw with my own eyes that it was a dog,

802
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,960
otherwise

803
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,720
there was a slight chance that it was a person.

804
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,240
You're pretty strict.

805
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,000
How did you find out?

806
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,200
I told you.

807
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
I relied on logic.

808
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,120
I relied on a unique solution.

809
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,160
First of all,

810
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,560
if the victim was a banker's granddaughter,

811
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,640
500-yuan ransom

812
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
would be a joke.

813
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,800
Secondly,

814
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,200
if they kidnapped a person,

815
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,560
it would be too hasty to do it

816
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,840
in full view of the public.

817
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,680
This case was so tightly knit.

818
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,480
They wouldn't take the risk.

819
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,200
Thirdly,

820
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,480
if Shen Huatang really had an illegitimate daughter,

821
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,640
it would be unlikely that no one had heard of it.

822
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,640
Good for you.

823
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,480
Very impressive.

824
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,200
So you came to see me

825
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
just to show off your logic skills.

826
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,720
I want to ask you for a favor.

827
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,560
The female ghost murder case at our school?

828
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,920
You're good at logic, too.

829
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
I promise you.

830
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,000
I'd also like to see

831
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,680
what's going on.

832
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,360
Mr. Luo?

833
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,040
Inspector Luo.

834
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,560
Come with me.

835
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,200
Sit.

836
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,600
What's going on?

837
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,120
Mr. Luo.

838
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,760
Inspector Luo.

839
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,400
Um...

840
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,560
After I left,

841
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,600
what did you say?

842
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:49,920
Who?

843
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,440
Situ Yan.

844
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,800
Didn't Situ just solve

845
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
a kidnapping case?

846
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
The banker's daughter.

847
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,440
Kidnapping for ransom.

848
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,600
A misunderstanding in the end.

849
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,520
All the ingredients for a big hit are there.

850
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,240
I'm working on it.

851
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,200
Why don't you take a look at it for me?

852
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,840
Sit.

853
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,160
I won't read it.

854
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,320
I mean,

855
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,600
did you tell him

856
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm about to

857
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,320
solve the girls' school case?

858
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,240
I did.

859
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,480
But Situ said

860
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,800
you were going the wrong way.

861
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
It's not revenge.

862
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,560
Bullshit.

863
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,960
He hadn't even been to the scene

864
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,240
before claiming I was wrong about the investigation.

865
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Did you say it wrong?

866
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,200
I wouldn't dare

867
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,240
whatsoever.

868
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,880
You go tell him

869
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,600
this case

870
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
must be a revenge killing case.

871
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
Mr. Luo, don't ask me to deliver the message,

872
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,280
in case I tell it wrongly.

873
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,600
You can go find him yourself.

874
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,280
I won't go.

875
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,520
One meal's time.

876
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Just give me one meal's time.

877
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
I will definitely solve the case.

878
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,560
At that time,

879
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,160
I'll make him come and confess his mistake.

880
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,680
You'll come too.

881
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,960
Write a good story for me.

882
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,720
No problem.

883
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,440
Please enjoy.

884
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,480
Inspector Luo.

885
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,160
What can't we talk about at school?

886
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,280
You've been very busy

887
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,480
and in a lot of fear lately.

888
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,840
So I'm inviting you to dinner

889
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,360
to relax.

890
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,320
I don't eat much Western food.

891
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,710
I really don't know anything about it.

892
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,600
Okay.

893
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,960
Then I'll make the decision.

894
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,670
Where's the music room?

895
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,000
Who said

896
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,560
he didn't need to be at the scene

897
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,190
to solve the case

898
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,230
and just need to find a unique solution?

899
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,000
You heard the description by Mr. Luo at home.

900
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Shouldn't the murderer be found out soon?

901
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You're such an arguer.

902
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,920
You should have been a lever in your past life,

903
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,670
and even the one with which Archimedes pried the earth.

904
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm begging you, okay?

905
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,840
Just come with me.

906
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,240
How do you like it?

907
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,920
I really don't know anything about this.

908
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,520
Inspector Luo.

909
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,080
If you have anything you want to ask,

910
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,600
please go.

911
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,200
We're not talking about work today.

912
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,800
Then, let me ask a question.

913
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,680
The murdered Lin Jie

914
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
only came to school this semester, right?

915
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:28,840
Yes.

916
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,800
Who else was there besides her?

917
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
There are me,

918
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,360
Tao Zhiling,

919
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,080
and Zhao Qiansun.

920
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,240
I think it's just the three of us.

921
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,040
One of them is insane.

922
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,080
One of them is crazy.

923
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,920
None of them are normal.

924
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,040
Zhao Qiansun is a little bit crazy.

925
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,080
But

926
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
I think Tao Zhiling is all right.

927
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,880
She told me she saw a female ghost kill someone with her own eyes.

928
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,440
She did?

929
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,520
Did you find

930
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,600
any useful clues?

931
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,120
What?

932
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,000
You're a fast learner.

933
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,080
I've been trained as a secretary.

934
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,400
I can learn anything quickly.

935
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,080
What did you do before?

936
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,600
Inspector Luo,

937
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,520
you seem to be curious about me.

938
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,400
Yes.

939
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,120
So curious.

940
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,960
I used to work at a magazine in Fengtian

941
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,760
as a proofreader and typesetter.

942
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,440
Fengtian?

943
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,760
You're from Fengtian too?

944
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,400
It was

945
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
almost a year ago.

946
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,920
My mother had very bad rheumatism.

947
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,520
Last winter was very cold.

948
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,360
So I quit my job early

949
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,480
and came back to take care of her.

950
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,320
How about

951
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,240
I help her find a nursing home

952
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
with a god environment?

953
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,320
This way you can relax a bit.

954
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,120
No need.

955
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,760
Nursing homes are too expensive.

956
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,080
I can't afford it.

957
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
You don't have to worry about that.

958
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,840
Inspector Luo,

959
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,080
thank you.

960
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,080
But

961
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,880
sorry, I can't use your money.

962
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,400
It's getting late.

963
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,040
I have to go.

964
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,400
Okay, I'll see you off.

965
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,600
Okay.

966
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,680
Take care.

967
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,000
This way, please.

968
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,560
These are...

969
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,720
The students keep their instruments here,

970
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,800
so that they don't have to move them around

971
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,920
during the lesson.

972
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,320
Aren't they afraid of losing them?

973
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,400
The girls who can come here for lessons

974
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,720
are either rich or famous.

975
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,360
They don't have to steal.

976
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,320
If the killer

977
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
was looking for something…

978
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,160
Who?

979
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,720
What are you doing here?

980
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,560
What do you think the killer was looking for?

981
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,880
A musical instrument.

982
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
But I don't think it's here anymore.

983
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,000
A musical instrument?

984
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,560
Something occurred to me.

985
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,400
Zhenzhen.

986
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,160
Ms. Lin isn't here, is he?

987
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,760
What's wrong?

988
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,960
I don't know what's wrong with

989
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,680
my violin.

990
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,040
The sound became dull

991
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,920
after I came back from vacation.

992
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,880
Ms. Lin has reminded me several times

993
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,440
during the rehearsal.

994
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Miss. Zhou,

995
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,440
help me tune it.

996
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,680
I really can't tune it.

997
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,040
Let me see.

998
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,120
The sound of the violin is indeed quite dull.

999
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,720
Well.

1000
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,440
You can leave it with me.

1001
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,040
Let me see.

1002
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,080
Maybe it's too old.

1003
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,960
My aunt said

1004
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,520
she would buy me a new one in a couple of days.

1005
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,480
But Miss. Zhou,

1006
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,360
you know Ms. Lin.

1007
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,320
If I don't have a violin in the next several days,

1008
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,160
she'll eat me up.

1009
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,840
Don't be anxious.

1010
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
I have another one

1011
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
that I don't need for now.

1012
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,120
I'll bring it over for you later.

1013
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,960
Thank you, Miss. Zhou.

1014
00:40:59,480 --> 00:40:59,960
No problem.

1015
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
It's not a big deal.

1016
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,720
It's not really easy to tune that violin.

1017
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,560
Since Zhenzhen didn't come to see me afterward,

1018
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,160
I thought she wasn't in a hurry.

1019
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I didn't expect

1020
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,960
something weird happened to her.

1021
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,000
Zhenzhen.

1022
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,840
What's wrong?

1023
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,680
Miss. Zhou.

1024
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,080
I was terrified.

1025
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,520
I thought the female ghost had followed me back.

1026
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
You guys always like to scare yourselves.

1027
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,520
No, Miss. Zhou.

1028
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,360
There's really a ghost.

1029
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
I've encountered it.

1030
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,600
Several days ago,

1031
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,720
you lent me your violin, right?

1032
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,640
And then

1033
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,400
after I left the classroom with the violin,

1034
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,760
I was called by someone.

1035
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,000
He said my aunt

1036
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,120
sent me a new violin to school

1037
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,600
and had to take the old one to be serviced.

1038
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,320
I was so happy

1039
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,640
that I forgot it wasn't mine.

1040
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,760
Then I went home for the weekend.

1041
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,800
My aunt brought me a new one.

1042
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,760
I was so confused.

1043
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,160
Didn't she

1044
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,520
give it to me already?

1045
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,840
My aunt was also confused.

1046
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,680
She didn't even ask the teacher to come to me.

1047
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,960
Don't worry, Miss. Zhou.

1048
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,720
Your violin is missing.

1049
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,080
I will definitely pay you a better one.

1050
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,080
It's okay.

1051
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,240
Could someone

1052
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,280
send the violin to the wrong person?

1053
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,720
No, it wasn't.

1054
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,640
She was calling my name.

1055
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,400
She said it was for me.

1056
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,320
Then do you remember

1057
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,760
who he is?

1058
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,440
Miss. Zhou, you know.

1059
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,560
I can't really tell who's who.

1060
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,760
She seemed familiar.

1061
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,600
But I can't remember who she is.

1062
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,920
Think about it.

1063
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,440
Has this person ever taught you a class?
