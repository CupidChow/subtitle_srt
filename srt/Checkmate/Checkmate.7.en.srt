1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,200
I know his husband

3
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,920
didn't die of drinks,

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
but poison.

5
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,880
How knows it better than me?

6
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,240
I did it. I did it all.

7
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,920
The person who blackmailed and killed Wei Minxi

8
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,920
wasn't you.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
What are you talking about?

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,800
One minute I'm the murderer,

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,760
the next I'm not.

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,800
I think you don't know

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,000
what's going on in this case.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,639
I said you're the murderer

15
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,440
because you did kill Chairman Luo.

16
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,640
I said you're not the murderer

17
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,800
because Wei Minxi wasn't killed by you.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
You couldn't have blackmailed Wei Minxi.

19
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
If she killed,

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
you would be derelict in your duty.

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,960
For you,

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,520
you two were in this together.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,920
So what if it's a dereliction of duty?

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,680
She killed, and she'd pay for it.

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
She was more scared than I was.

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,560
Who would know better than me

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,400
how her husband died?

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
Your son,

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,880
Xie Bozhou,

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,960
Dr. Xie.

31
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,480
We have investigated

32
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,000
the total amount of money Xie Bozhou owed over the years.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,240
That's exactly the amount of money Wei Minxi was extorted for.

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
You said it yourself.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,160
It's the time for men of this age

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,880
to have fun.

37
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,640
They love to drink.

38
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,600
If they get involved in opium and gambling too,

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,160
he'll be screwed.

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,320
As a parent,

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,360
wouldn't you

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
take that for your children?

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,080
The reason why Xie Bozhou knew about Wei Minxi's death

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
was because of Wen Yi.

45
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Me?

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,800
Dr. Xie said

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,080
if it was arsenic poisoning,

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
the person's liver and stomach would bleed.

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,360
The way he died would be the same as sudden death from drinking.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,079
The reason why Wei Minxi left the last letter

51
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,360
was because she wanted to kill Xie Bozhou

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,520
to eliminate future problems

53
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,800
and mentally prepared to die too.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,760
But after all, she was a woman.

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,400
Xie Bozhou killed her by mistake.

56
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,160
If he had turned himself in,

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,880
he wouldn't have to be sentenced to death.

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
But you were sure

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,120
Chairman Luo would not spare your son.

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,079
That's why you planned this murder.

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,560
What he said is pure fabrication.

62
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,040
Xie Bozhou has nothing to do with this.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,760
Everything was done by me.

64
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,800
Luo Shaochuan.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,079
I killed your father.

66
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,040
It's my fault to kill Wei Minxi.

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,240
I hope you won't kill my son.

68
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,920
I'll pay with my life.

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,280
Let's end your father's case

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,440
this way.

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
The evidence of Chairman Luo's case

72
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,400
is overwhelming.

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,360
is overwhelming.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. Situ is really something.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,440
You solved two cases in one go.

76
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,640
So let's end the case.

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,200
No way.

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,880
Wei Minxi's case is not like that.

79
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,200
Mr. Situ,

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,240
with the evidence we have now,

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
it's the perfect ending

82
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,240
to end this case now.

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,800
I have the accounts of Xie Bozhou's debts.

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,400
The amount

85
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,920
is highly consistent with

86
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,640
the one Wei Minxi was blackmailed for.

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,520
Although you have the accounts,

88
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,240
it's the Xie family after all.

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,280
We can't claim

90
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,200
Xie Bozhou is the murderer.

91
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,080
Besides, he is not in Harbin.

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
We can't

93
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,920
blame him.

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,320
I think

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,800
it's perfect for the case

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
to end now.

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Okay.

98
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,640
I believe that one day

99
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,560
he will come back.

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,640
Okay.

101
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,040
Then I'll leave now.

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Do you think it's strange

103
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,480
that I envy a murderer?

104
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,520
I've been envious of Xie Bozhou since I was a kid.

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
He went abroad to study at a young age.

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,200
Then he became a doctor.

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
But what I envied most about him

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
is that he has a father

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
who loved him

110
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,760
and was willing to listen to him.

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,640
But now his father killed

112
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,040
to protect him

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,280
and committed suicide.

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,760
I'm afraid Xie Bozhou has sentenced himself to death

115
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,120
in his future life.

116
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,280
Parents' love for their children

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,200
manifests as a far-reaching plan.

118
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Unprincipled love can't be called love.

119
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,920
But now that I think about it,

120
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,840
my father was never nice to me.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,840
When I was young, I didn't see him at all.

122
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
Later, when I grew up and wanted to join the army,

123
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,680
not only did he forbid it,

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,440
but he even locked me in the house.

125
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Thanks to Aunt Wei's help,

126
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
he reluctantly agreed.

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,840
Anyway,

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
he never seemed to care about me.

129
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Maybe

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,200
there are no absolute good guys and bad guys

131
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
in this world.

132
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,200
When I was organizing your father's will,

133
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,040
I found a recording.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,080
The will said

135
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,320
it was for Wei Minxi.

136
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,360
But Wei Minxi had been killed

137
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,560
before your father's will was executed.

138
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
Now,

139
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,400
it belongs to you.

140
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
What's that?

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,520
The truth.

142
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,000
Minxi.

143
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,360
I can finally tell you this.

144
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm the one who killed your husband.

146
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,400
It's my concession

147
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
that made you suffer.

148
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,320
But I ask you to

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
take care of my son,

151
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,760
dote on him

152
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,640
and indulge him like before.

153
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,400
These things I dare not do,

154
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,640
I'll leave it all to you.

155
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,040
Don't let him follow the same path I did when I was young.

156
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,520
I'm entrusting

157
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,640
him to you.

158
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm sorry, young master.

159
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,320
I apologize for him.

160
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,560
If he hadn't sent me back,

161
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,680
who knew what would have happened?

162
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
It's wrong to steal, after all.

163
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,400
And the money the master gave me.

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,720
And the family books.

165
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,640
My father was such a smart man.

166
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,720
Since he gave it to you,

167
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,640
just take it.

168
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
I'm sorry to the master and you.

169
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,000
I've corrected all these books.

170
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,640
I guarantee that the accounts

171
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,800
are all true.

172
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,720
Mrs. Wen,

173
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,400
I trust you.

174
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,160
Young master,

175
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
I wasn't

176
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,840
a good mother.

177
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,520
I owe him so much.

178
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,800
I didn't even give him companionship and love.

179
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,960
And I didn't even acknowledge him.

180
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,480
I regret it now.

181
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
I want to take him back to the countryside,

182
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,880
make him quit smoking

183
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,120
and then live a peaceful life.

184
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
Since you've said so,

185
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
it'll be improper for me

186
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,720
to keep you.

187
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,840
Mrs. Wen,

188
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,360
thank you.

189
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,640
Thank you for taking care of me and my father for so many years.

190
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
If you have a bad time outside,

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
I don't mean to curse you,

192
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,480
I mean,

193
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,280
you are always welcome to come back to the Luo family.

194
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,560
Thank you, young master.

195
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,480
What are you, a ghost?

196
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,880
You didn't make any sound.

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Where are the books?

198
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,720
What?

199
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,960
The family's books.

200
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,160
I'd like to see

201
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,840
whether there are any false accounts.

202
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,200
What is going on

203
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,400
with your father's inheritance?

204
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Why should I receive monthly living expenses?

205
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
This family also belongs to your uncle.

206
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,520
And your friend...

207
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
What's his name? That Situ guy.

208
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
Tell him to come and apologize to me in person.

209
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,280
Why should I be accused of murder?

210
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,400
You don't have to tell me that.

211
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,120
I was just about to give these to you.

212
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
You're grateful.

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm telling you, Shaochuan.

214
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,920
Your father was too hard-hearted.

215
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,200
You can't follow his example.

216
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,440
Besides,

217
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm the only senior

218
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,840
in the Luo family now.

219
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I've watched you grow up.

220
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,280
Besides this,

221
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,840
I have a big task for you.

222
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,280
What is it?

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,040
I want to give you this family.

224
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,040
What did you say?

225
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,960
From today onwards,

226
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,080
you

227
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,440
will be the owner

228
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,280
of our family.

229
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
I guess my love for you pays off.

230
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Madam,

231
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,880
madam.

232
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
please give me one more chance.

233
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,560
Go away.

234
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm begging you.

235
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,080
Please give me one more chance.

236
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
What are you looking at?

237
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
If you don't do your job properly, you'll be just like him.

238
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,960
Get out of here!

239
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,600
Madam... ma...

240
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,600
Money saved again.

241
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Thank you.

242
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
If you ever go out again,

243
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,840
send me a message

244
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,800
and I'll arrange it.

245
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,240
No need.

246
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,280
I can still do it.

247
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,640
Do you come to see Situ?

248
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,840
What are his plans for the future?

249
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,440
I don't know.

250
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,120
He's going back to Beijing?

251
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,720
He got the same temperament and nature

252
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,320
from his teacher.

253
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,680
He'll have to suffer a lot

254
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,320
when he gets to the capital.

255
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,880
I know.

256
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Persuade him

257
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,840
to stay.

258
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,920
He looks easy-going,

259
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
but is quite stubborn.

260
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,840
Now that his teacher passed away,

261
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,880
it must

262
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,680
hit him hard.

263
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
I can't ask him

264
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,120
to stay in Harbin.

265
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
Besides,

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,040
I can't keep dragging this child down.

267
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,440
Then let me ask you.

268
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,880
Do you want him to stay?

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Of course, I do.

270
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
Such a good child.

271
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,280
But I think

272
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,600
he must have his ideas and arrangements.

273
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,480
Okay.

274
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,400
As long as you feel the same way.

275
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,600
I'll figure out the rest.

276
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Where is he?

277
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,960
He's in his study.

278
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840
He's been sorting out his teacher's stuff

279
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,960
for the past several days.

280
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,920
I'll take the lead

281
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,800
later.

282
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,440
You can just go along with me.

283
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,600
Really?

284
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,920
Let's go.

285
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,320
Come on, have some.

286
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,240
Why are you here?

287
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,280
Mr. Luo.

288
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,880
I've written a newsletter

289
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,920
about the Ma Shiying assassination case.

290
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,200
Don't release it.

291
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
Who permitted you to write about the Orient Express case?

292
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,680
What?

293
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,160
You want to tell all of Harbin about

294
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,400
how my father was killed?

295
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,680
He didn't intend to publish the two cases of your family.

296
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,560
He also erased the background of the Orient Express

297
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,400
in the murder of Ma Shiying,

298
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Did he?

299
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,600
That's very clever.

300
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,360
Mr. Luo,

301
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,200
if you really don't think it's appropriate,

302
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I don't have to release it.

303
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,840
It's fine. Do it.

304
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,960
I'll take that as an ad.

305
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,080
What? What ad?

306
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,040
What are you going to do next?

307
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:42,960
I don't know.

308
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,520
I knew it.

309
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,960
You've already taken over the Luo family.

310
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,280
And you still have time

311
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,520
to meddle in my business?

312
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,960
I've arranged everything

313
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,640
in my family.

314
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,360
It's all in order

315
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,800
and everything.

316
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,680
Then

317
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,120
it's time to take care of your business.

318
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,920
Excuse me.

319
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,640
Mr. Situ, Mr. Luo.

320
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,800
I'm busy with the newspaper.

321
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,160
I gotta go.

322
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,360
After this is published,

323
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll send a piece to each of you.

324
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,440
I'll leave now.

325
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,040
Bring your camera

326
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,080
when you come over on Monday.

327
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,960
For what?

328
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,760
You know me well.

329
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,960
It must be a good thing.

330
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,560
I know you too well.

331
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,720
So I know it's not a good thing.

332
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,920
Letting go of power

333
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,520
is what I learned from my father.

334
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,640
My aunt always thought

335
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,000
I didn't give her enough money.

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
So I'll give her the whole family.

337
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,480
And guess what?

338
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,960
I saw

339
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,720
her bargaining

340
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,160
with a soy sauce vendor in the street.

341
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,120
She, Bai Shanshan,

342
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,600
the most famous middle-aged widowed woman in Harbin,

343
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,280
was bargaining with a soy sauce vendor.

344
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,920
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

345
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,520
I wouldn't have believed it.

346
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,920
They don't want me to be in charge of

347
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,840
the family company.

348
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,920
I don't want to care either.

349
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,160
It's good to get dividends.

350
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
The Luo family's money and my money

351
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,640
will go in the bank,

352
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,120
be put it in trusts,

353
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
or be used to buy property and land.

354
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,400
It's all well-organized

355
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,560
and profitable.

356
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,880
You're handing over the Luo family's business?

357
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,400
That's right.

358
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
Because I think you're right.

359
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,520
Bai Shanshan really wants what's best for the Luo family.

360
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Wait till

361
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,560
I break the engagement with Jingxuan,

362
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll be able to truly relax.

363
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,640
Wait a minute.

364
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,160
Zou Jingxuan has helped you a lot

365
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,280
with your family's case.

366
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,240
So?

367
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,320
So you ended up breaking off the marriage with her?

368
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,840
She is my sister.

369
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840
I hope she has a good home.

370
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,080
You still have your heart set on

371
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,120
that female student Bai Lu on the Oriental Express?

372
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,280
What?

373
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,160
Don't you know?

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,320
The Orient Express case

375
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,560
ended with Bai Lu as the murderer.

376
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,960
Why?

377
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,360
You have to hand over a murderer.

378
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,800
Wait.

379
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,240
So

380
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,680
you put the blame on her?

381
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,480
What is this?

382
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,400
Where is the law?

383
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,520
Calm down.

384
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,359
It's true

385
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,640
that Bai Lu wasn't innocent.

386
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,160
And she died to show her will.

387
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
What else could we do?

388
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,720
She's dead?

389
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,079
Not long after she got off the express,

390
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,960
she died of poison after turning herself in.

391
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
I really

392
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,359
couldn't do anything about it.

393
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,760
If I hesitated longer,

394
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,720
the whole carriage of people

395
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,920
would have been taken down.

396
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,720
But she didn't have to do that.

397
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
She did it

398
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,640
anyway, didn't she?

399
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,080
Besides, think about it.

400
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
Among the carriage of people,

401
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,680
who would take the blame for her?

402
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,880
That George Blair is a smart guy.

403
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,960
He stabbed

404
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,000
for his wife.

405
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,520
That makes sense.

406
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,200
Even if it came out,

407
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,440
George Blair

408
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
could still use his status as a diplomat

409
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,880
to keep himself and Fang Ting out of it.

410
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,160
These foreigners

411
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,720
always try to take advantage of us.

412
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,880
I say you should stop working as a lawyer.

413
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,240
It's not worth it to pay so much.

414
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
I've thought about it too.

415
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
But if I quit as a lawyer,

416
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,560
what else can I do?

417
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,160
Well,

418
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,440
take a break

419
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
in the next few days.

420
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,360
Read a book or something.

421
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,840
I'll

422
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,680
see you on Monday.

423
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,000
What good things have happened to you?

424
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,440
It's cold.

425
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,280
What are you doing out here?

426
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,640
I'm taking a stroll.

427
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,840
Let's go.

428
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,760
I have something good to tell you.

429
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,200
Sit down.

430
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
What is it?

431
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,880
Well,

432
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,360
my dad

433
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,600
has gone.

434
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,360
Don't be too sad.

435
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,760
After all, he can't come back from the dead.

436
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,880
If your father knew

437
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
you miss him so much,

438
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,120
he would be very happy.

439
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,720
Yeah.

440
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,440
What I mean is that now that my father is gone,

441
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm in charge of the Luo family.

442
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,560
The marriage contract between us before

443
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,800
was a tool by my father to keep me tied up.

444
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,360
I don't think that's fair to you.

445
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,640
Actually...

446
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,160
Actually, I don't mind.

447
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
But I do.

448
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,600
Jingxuan,

449
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,000
I've always considered you my sister

450
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
since I was a child.

451
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,120
So from today onwards,

452
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,000
our marriage contract will be broken.

453
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,760
You can

454
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,080
go find your happiness.

455
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,480
Jingxuan.

456
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,320
What's wrong with Jingxuan?

457
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't think I've said anything wrong.

458
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,040
Shaochuan, you're heartless.

459
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,440
If Jingxuan hadn't ruined her reputation and told the truth,

460
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,360
you'd still be in jail.

461
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,160
Auntie,

462
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,640
you're throwing the blame.

463
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,320
Didn't Jingxuan make a mistake for you?

464
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
I did this for her good.

465
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,440
You little bastard.

466
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,040
You deserve to stay single.

467
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,800
Miss,

468
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,040
Madam prepared

469
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,320
the purifying mud and a dress for you.

470
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,480
You have to go to

471
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
Shaochuan's big event in a few days.

472
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,880
I won't go.

473
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm a laughingstock now.

474
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,760
Let it go.

475
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
You have to go.

476
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,640
Not only do you have to go,

477
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,360
but you must dress up.

478
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,040
When you stand

479
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,760
next to Shaochuan,

480
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,720
people will know

481
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,760
you're the future mistress of the Luo family.

482
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,440
From then on,

483
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,680
the whole Harbin

484
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,160
wouldn't dare to mess with you.

485
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,440
I don't want to see Shaochuan

486
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
to break off the engagement again

487
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
in front of so many people.

488
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,360
Silly girl.

489
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,080
Shaochuan

490
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
is just young and playful.

491
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
It's not that he doesn't want to marry you.

492
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,040
He just doesn't want to get married.

493
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,280
In fact,

494
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
he likes you very much.

495
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,720
Don't lie to me.

496
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,760
Just let me stay away from him.

497
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,960
I don't want to be embarrassed anymore.

498
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,120
Listen.

499
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,680
Why should I lie to you?

500
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,360
I've met so many men.

501
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
Can't I see that?

502
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,240
Let me tell you this.

503
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,000
Look.

504
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,320
Shaochuan

505
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,280
only shows you his most intimate emotions, right?

506
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,080
When he got a big problem,

507
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
the first thing he thought of

508
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,240
was to ask Situ

509
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,920
to come to you for support.

510
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,800
You see?

511
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,200
How could he

512
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,480
not like you?

513
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,280
Really?

514
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,280
Of course.

515
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,480
So

516
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,680
you have to dress up and go there,

517
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,000
so that Shaochuan will know

518
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,960
the Luo family

519
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,200
needs a mistress like you.

520
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Good.

521
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,600
Go in.

522
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,600
Good, good.

523
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,240
Congratulations.

524
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,880
Thank you.

525
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
Come in.

526
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,400
How's that?

527
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,680
What do you mean?

528
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,400
It's a detective agency.

529
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,960
I've gone to a fortune-teller.

530
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,120
You're destined to attract murder cases

531
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,080
according to your horoscope.

532
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,480
So it's a good deal

533
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,640
to invest in you as a detective.

534
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,680
You see,

535
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,320
from the Orient Express murder case

536
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,920
to Aunt Wei and my father's case,

537
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,720
they were all cases

538
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,560
the police station couldn't solve.

539
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,200
On the contrary,

540
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,560
you solved them easily.

541
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,680
So you invest in me

542
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,640
because I'm a terror.

543
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,960
Everywhere I go, things go wrong.

544
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
I think Mr. Luo is right.

545
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,600
You may not be able to do justice

546
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,120
as a lawyer.

547
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
But it's up to you

548
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,440
to reveal the truth

549
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,520
as a detective.

550
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,240
That's right.

551
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,000
The main problem is

552
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
now that Mr. Shen is gone,

553
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,480
Madam Shen needs someone to take care of her.

554
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,360
How can you

555
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,920
leave her alone in Harbin?

556
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,920
Gentlemen.

557
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,000
Let's go to the plaque

558
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,920
and I'll take another picture for you.

559
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,240
Let's go.

560
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,600
This way.

561
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
You can stand on each side.

562
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,760
Come on.

563
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,440
Okay, look at me.

564
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,720
One, two, three.

565
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
Are you having some problems lately?

566
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
You've made a lot of mistakes.

567
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,920
Not really.

568
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,600
It's mainly because Ms. Lin taught too fast.

569
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
I didn't dare to ask her.

570
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,200
Miss. Zhou,

571
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
why don't you show me how to do it?

572
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,800
You see?

573
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,040
You have to pay attention to this accent.

574
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,800
When you played,

575
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,720
these two keys

576
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,800
were stuck together.

577
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,320
Why don't we wait

578
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,280
until you get better?

579
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
No, I'm good.

580
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,680
It's just Miss. Zhou,

581
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,160
can you teach me

582
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,440
in the future?

583
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,200
Why?

584
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
I'm just...

585
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm just a little afraid of Ms. Lin.

586
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Ms. Lin is actually very nice.

587
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,920
She's just a little bit impatient at times.

588
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,560
Miss.

589
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,080
Miss,

590
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,880
a letter has arrived.

591
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,080
It's from a self-assumed kidnapper.

592
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,000
Kidnapper?

593
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,800
The ransom is 500?

594
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,360
Please.

595
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,200
Congratulations.

596
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,600
Congratulations.

597
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,040
Barrister Situ.

598
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,880
How are you?

599
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,480
Madam Shen.

600
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,080
You two talk first.

601
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,400
I'll have to go over there.

602
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Congratulations.

603
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,600
The opening of the detective agency is a great success.

604
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,240
From now on,

605
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,640
I guess there will be no more cases

606
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
we can't solve, right?

607
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,480
Let me introduce to you.

608
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
Dr. Fang Jianqi of the police cooperation clinic.

609
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,640
If you need anything, just call him.

610
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,200
He'll be at your service.

611
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,280
How are you?

612
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,760
How are you?

613
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,240
I've heard of you from lawyer Shen before.

614
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,480
I'd like to get to know you.

615
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,040
Your teacher praised you

616
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,480
like nothing else in the world.

617
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,920
I didn't

618
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,240
believe it.

619
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,440
But then I do

620
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,600
after hearing your story from Sergeant Pao.

621
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,520
If you need anything in the future,

622
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,280
just ask me for it.

623
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,080
You are too kind.

624
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,320
All right, everyone.

625
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,280
In the future, your business

626
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,360
will be ours.

627
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,280
Our police's business

628
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,480
will be yours too.

629
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,640
What? Haven't you heard about it?

630
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,280
Barrister Situ.

631
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,720
What do you call him?

632
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,080
Call him Detective Situ.

633
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,640
How's that?

634
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,000
Does it look good?

635
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,200
Why are you wearing a police uniform?

636
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,160
From now on, I'll accept the cases

637
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,920
and you take care of them.

638
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,720
The two of us together

639
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
can dominate Harbin,

640
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,480
making criminals have no place to hide

641
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,240
and revealing

642
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,480
the truth.

643
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
From now on, both gang and cops

644
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,560
must be afraid of

645
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,080
our names.

646
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,040
This doesn't sound like

647
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,080
being a police officer.

648
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
What does it sound like?

649
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,240
It's like trying to start a gang.

650
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,120
Watch your language.

651
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,520
Come on.

652
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:36,960
Here.

653
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,560
Shaochuan.

654
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,200
Thank you, madam.

655
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
Your teacher always said

656
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,160
you were

657
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,360
thoughtful

658
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,040
and good at finding the truth.

659
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,680
And now you have a detective agency,

660
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,640
it's the best choice.

661
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,920
You guys keep talking.

662
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,480
Thank you.

663
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,080
Don't thank me.

664
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,440
I'm a capitalist.

665
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,480
I have to make money.

666
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,960
Work hard.

667
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,360
Madam Shen.

668
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,560
You must be reminded of

669
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,960
Mr. Shen, do you?

670
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,400
You police officers

671
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,280
have a keen eye.

672
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,000
Shen also had a drink like this

673
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,480
that day.

674
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
In fact, he should stop drinking

675
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,480
with a heart problem.

676
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,360
Right.

677
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
They had too much fun

678
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,040
that day.

679
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
He usually drank at home too.

680
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,040
It was never a problem.

681
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
But look how good his student has become now.

682
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,680
He's smart and capable.

683
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,320
And now he has a detective agency.

684
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
Even if Mr. Shen

685
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,960
had any grievances,

686
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,760
he would tell his student by a dream.

687
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,520
Thank you.

688
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,560
I'm sorry for your loss.

689
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,400
Mr. Luo.

690
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Situ.

691
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,560
Can we do an interview

692
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,240
in a quiet place?

693
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,880
I'd like to talk to you alone.

694
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,360
Sure.

695
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,680
Let's go upstairs.

696
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,800
Situ,

697
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,440
have you made up your mind

698
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,720
to become a detective?

699
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,200
I don't know.

700
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,840
I just learned about it today.

701
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,560
But when I think about it,

702
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,440
people like Ma Shiying can't be punished,

703
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,600
and people like Mrs. Xu can't seek redress.

704
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,200
This is certainly not the first time,

705
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,880
nor will it be the last time.

706
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,800
So as a lawyer,

707
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,680
I feel a bit powerless.

708
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,720
Can you tell me more about

709
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,960
the disappointment

710
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,120
as a lawyer?

711
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,240
The power of the law is too limited now.

712
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,920
In the face of many privileges,

713
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,800
it's as fragile as an ornament.

714
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,560
Take Ma Shiying, for example.

715
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,440
Everyone knows he's a murderer.

716
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,480
He killed someone.

717
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,760
Everyone even knows

718
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,840
there must be a mastermind behind him,

719
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,960
but we just can't

720
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,760
bring him to justice.

721
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,560
We can't even put him on trial.

722
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,840
We can't do the dead justice

723
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,480
and justify innocent people.

724
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,440
And so the line between right and wrong has been obscure.

725
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,880
Even if that's the case,

726
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
you are still an invaluable lawyer,

727
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,040
upholding the truth

728
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,120
and doing justice.

729
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,160
Have you ever thought of urging

730
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
to establish a bar association in Harbin,

731
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,040
work together with your peers

732
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,160
and realize your ambition

733
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,000
like your teacher did?

734
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,640
I have actually

735
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,720
thought about it.

736
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,440
That's why

737
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,800
I didn't reject Luo Shaochuan today.

738
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,840
Can you

739
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
tell me about it?

740
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,040
The system will not change.

741
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,080
We can't eliminate the problems.

742
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,960
These are not only the problems of the industry.

743
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,520
It's not just an ideal and ambition

744
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,560
I can achieve by calling for action.

745
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,000
To take a step back,

746
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
I am not Mr. Shen.

747
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,360
I don't have the influence he had.

748
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,560
But I won't be swayed by people

749
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,680
in the search for the truth.

750
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,520
The trial can be manipulated.

751
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,640
But the truth will not.

752
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,720
It's a shame.

753
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,560
The Orient Express case can only be ill finished

754
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,520
where you can't show your great insight.

755
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,040
The Luo family case is too widely involved

756
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,280
to be published either.

757
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,200
Situ,

758
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,720
make me follow the whole story

759
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
if there is any case in the future.

760
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,400
In less than a day,

761
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,280
you must get the most attention.

762
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,000
The murderer

763
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,240
fired, standing four feet from the victim.

764
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,800
The bullet went through the heart.

765
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,480
The murder weapon should be a small, tight-fitting pistol.

766
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,520
Judging by the way the victim was sitting,

767
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
she should be playing the piano before she died.

768
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,440
She was shot when she turned towards the murderer.

769
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,000
The time of death should be

770
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,120
12:00 last night

771
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
to early this morning.

772
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,400
Actually, it was last night.

773
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,520
We found the body at 2:00 in the night.

774
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,080
But since this is a girls' school,

775
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,120
the teachers and students are all women,

776
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,560
I was afraid of any further accidents.

777
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,160
So I didn't call the police

778
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,640
until morning.

779
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,160
I'm the vice principal here, Luo Jinyan.

780
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,800
The one with glasses

781
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,880
is Fan Lihua,

782
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,480
our school principal.

783
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
She's also the one who found Lin Jie's body.

784
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,000
The one next to her is my secretary, Xia Ru'an.

785
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,440
If you need anything,

786
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,960
we'll do our best to cooperate.

787
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,080
What is the identity of the deceased?

788
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,880
She was a music teacher at our school.

789
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,360
When did she come here?

790
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,880
She just joined this semester.

791
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,040
How did she get along with people around her?

792
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,280
I see.

793
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,400
I'll tell you what.

794
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,480
Show me around your school.

795
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,680
Take care.

796
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,480
Take care.

797
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Situ.

798
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,160
Miss Zou.

799
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,560
Just call me Jingxuan.

800
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,240
You don't have to be so polite.

801
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,600
You're looking for Luo Shaochuan?

802
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Isn't today the opening of the detective agency?

803
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,040
Yes.

804
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,040
But he seems to have left first.

805
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,960
Situ.

806
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,240
You've helped our family so much.

807
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,560
I'm grateful to you.

808
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,720
By the way,

809
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,840
this is the opening gift I picked out.

810
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,480
This is Volon nuts. They're very tasty.

811
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
I hope you will like it.

812
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,200
Thank you.

813
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,640
Have a seat inside.

814
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,080
Okay.

815
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,720
Situ,

816
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,920
I have a question for you.

817
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,320
It's about Luo Shaochuan?

818
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,080
Is he

819
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,440
in love with someone?

820
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,320
As far as I know,

821
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,440
no.

822
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,960
Then what kind of person does he like?

823
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,440
Is Madam Shen here?

824
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,760
It's you.

825
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,520
It's you.

826
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,840
As you can see,

827
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,800
the walls of our school are too high

828
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
and smooth

829
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,200
to climb easily.

830
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,600
In addition,

831
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,760
we have the strictest management here.

832
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,800
Strict registration is required to enter and leave.

833
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,720
Especially after nightfall,

834
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,040
not even the parents of the students can enter.

835
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,720
Good.

836
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,920
Then it's an inside job.

837
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,600
I guess you don't know

838
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,560
our students

839
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,800
are all the daughters of local officials and noblemen.

840
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,920
They're all delicate ladies.

841
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
They are not suspected.

842
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Since the students are innocent. Then teachers.

843
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
Call out the teachers.

844
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I want to take statements.

845
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,720
Mr. Luo.

846
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,280
Luo Shaochuan.

847
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,320
I thought you looked familiar just now.

848
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,320
Don't try to relate to me.

849
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,640
The teachers here are the best in their field.

850
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,080
They can't kill anyone.

851
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,560
No outsiders can get in.

852
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,640
The students aren't suspected.

853
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
And the teachers can't kill.

854
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,760
So Lin Jie killed herself?

855
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,080
Then maybe

856
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,680
the two principals did it.

857
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,920
You can't say that.

858
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,360
So hurry up and cooperate with our investigation.

859
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,680
Xia Ru'an.

860
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,960
Call out all the teachers.

861
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,080
Yes.

862
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
This is Zhou Mowan.

863
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,760
She's a music teacher at the Harbin Women's Normal University.

864
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,440
She also helps us play a lot.

865
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,639
This is

866
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,239
Situ Yan,

867
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,920
my husband's favorite student.

868
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,080
He's also a detective.

869
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,639
He should be able to help you

870
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,159
with the thing you say.

871
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,880
You are a detective?

872
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,639
You are a teacher?

873
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,320
I see.

874
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,480
You're a narrow-minded person,

875
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,639
good for a detective.

876
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,280
I see.

877
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,400
You're so serious,

878
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,560
suitable to be a teacher.

879
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,159
Mowan.

880
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,080
He's a lawyer.

881
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
Don't argue with him.

882
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,199
Mowan,

883
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,120
what exactly is the kidnapping you speak of?

884
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,040
I learned about it

885
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,840
when I was giving piano lessons to Shen Huatang.

886
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,200
She's one of my students.

887
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,800
What should I do?

888
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,160
They said they kidnapped my daughter.

889
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,680
They planned to kill her.

890
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,720
What should I do, Miss. Zhou?

891
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,440
Who can help me?

892
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,400
Now who in the end can help me?

893
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,920
My daughter.

894
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
The kidnapper has written to ask her

895
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,000
to pay ¥500 ransom

896
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,280
tomorrow afternoon,

897
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,280
or else he will kill the victim.

898
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,800
She had no adult with her

899
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,920
and cried all the time.

900
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,880
It occurred to me

901
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,760
that Madam Shen has a lot of contacts,

902
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
so I came to ask you.

903
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,600
My husband is no longer with us.

904
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,040
I'm just an ordinary person.

905
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,480
I don't have any contacts.

906
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,440
But Situ Yan

907
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
is very capable.

908
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,240
I'm sure

909
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,840
he can help you.

910
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,720
Mowan.

911
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,440
Situ

912
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,520
is really capable.

913
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,000
He's very reliable.

914
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,920
There's no need to tell her this.

915
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,400
I don't intend to help her yet.

916
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,200
What kind of attitude is this?

917
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,800
Someone's daughter was kidnapped.

918
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
Her life is at stake. Do you understand?

919
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,120
How can you be a lawyer and a detective like this?

920
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,360
There's a case, Situ Yan.

921
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,800
Shaochuan.

922
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,000
Why are you here, Jingxuan?

923
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,040
Let me introduce you.

924
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,320
Miss Zhou Mowan,

925
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,680
a teacher at the girls' school.

926
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,120
She loves to preach.

927
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,600
You're from Harbin Women's Normal University?

928
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,120
That's right.

929
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,280
Do you know Lin Jie?

930
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,160
Yes.

931
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,480
She is my colleague.

932
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,600
She's also a music teacher.

933
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,240
What happened?

934
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,240
She was murdered.

935
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,800
What?

936
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,480
How come there's no one alive in this stupid school?

937
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,520
Are you looking for the music classroom?

938
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
You scared me.

939
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,560
What are you doing here?

940
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,440
I'm the school's painter.

941
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,360
I was just painting the walls.

942
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,720
What's your name?

943
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Zhao Qiansun.

944
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,080
Where's the music room?

945
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,040
Straight ahead from here.

946
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,120
You're a cop, right?

947
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,040
Is there a problem?

948
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,400
No, no, no.

949
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,960
The music room is just a short walk away.

950
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,640
Over there, the principal's office.

951
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,200
Okay.

952
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,440
Go.

953
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,840
Well,

954
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
you guys search around,

955
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,160
see if there's anything suspicious.

956
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
Then come and report to me.

957
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,760
Okay.

958
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:48,920
Let's go.

959
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,920
The coroner said the time of death was last night.

960
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,800
Where?

961
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,280
In the music room at your school.

962
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,320
But I haven't heard anything about that.

963
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,240
Where's the killer?

964
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
We're investigating now.

965
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,080
It's confidential.

966
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
How could something like this happen?

967
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,440
What are you doing here?

968
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,320
Mowan's student, Shen Huatang,

969
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,040
her daughter has been kidnapped.

970
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,120
Shen Huatang?

971
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,000
The daughter of Yu Daren, the chairman of China International Bank?

972
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,520
I didn't hear that he had a granddaughter.

973
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,720
It's normal.

974
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,440
The big families have mysterious affairs.

975
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,320
So she called the police.

976
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,280
Then what are you doing here?

977
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,280
He doesn't have time.

978
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
He has to help me investigate the case.

979
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,200
The kidnapper said

980
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,640
if she called the police, he'd kill her.

981
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,760
Don't you still owe me a newspaper?

982
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,480
If you can find this person,

983
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,520
we'll call it even.

984
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,360
I'll pay

985
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
according to the price.

986
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,360
Wait a minute.

987
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,480
I already paid for the newspaper.

988
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,880
You want to use our Detective Situ

989
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,000
with a newspaper?

990
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,920
That's the price of my newspaper.

991
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,040
Besides,

992
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,600
the biggest beneficiary of my newspaper

993
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,320
is no one but you.

994
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,760
Okay.

995
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,440
How about this?

996
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,200
You each talk for 15 minutes.

997
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,640
I'll see who has a point

998
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,960
and decide after that.

999
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,040
Mowan was here first.

1000
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,800
She should speak first.

1001
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,160
I've already talked to Stu about this.

1002
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,360
Who are you helping?

1003
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,000
The music classroom at your school

1004
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,160
is really quite strange.

1005
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,480
More than one strange things

1006
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,240
have happened.

1007
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,240
Tong.

1008
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,880
I already knew something would happen to Ms. Lin Jie.

1009
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,640
Why?

1010
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,600
Think about it.

1011
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,160
Which one of our previous music teachers

1012
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,960
lasted a semester?

1013
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,760
They were all scared away.

1014
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,560
But why is Miss. Zhou okay?

1015
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,280
Miss. Zhou doesn't take night classes.

1016
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,960
And Miss. Zhou is so kind,

1017
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,120
unlike some teachers

1018
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,240
who scold us all the time.

1019
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,680
Did bad things always happen

1020
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,760
in our music classroom in the past?

1021
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,840
You don't know?

1022
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,960
What?

1023
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,600
What is it?

1024
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,120
I'd like to hear it too.

1025
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,600
Like my sister-in-law said,

1026
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,720
The music classroom was haunted

1027
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,240
in the past.

1028
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,440
Back then, there was an old janitor

1029
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,240
who found a woman in red

1030
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,400
hanging from the electric light

1031
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,920
when he was making his nightly rounds.

1032
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,120
The old janitor was so scared

1033
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,560
that he almost died.

1034
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,320
Don't

1035
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,040
make it sound so scary, okay?

1036
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,640
Besides, if you find the murderer,

1037
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,840
why don't you go arrest it?

1038
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,240
You don't understand.

1039
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,360
What we men want

1040
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,560
is prestige.

1041
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,800
Wait.

1042
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,560
You made me a detective

1043
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,000
and yourself a police officer

1044
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,160
all for prestige?

1045
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,240
Then you might as well take over the Luo family.

1046
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
The richest man in Harbin

1047
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,640
must be more respectable than you are now.

1048
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,360
The Luo family

1049
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,760
have to be the best.

1050
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,960
When we're in business, we have to be extremely rich.

1051
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,200
And as a police officer,

1052
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,360
we have to be the last.

1053
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,000
The last one to show up,

1054
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,200
but the first to solve the case.

1055
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,880
So you've been telling the truth

1056
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,160
all for your prestige in the end?

1057
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,680
What is prestige?

1058
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,560
Prestige is the right to speak.

1059
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
When you are a soldier in a war,

1060
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,280
whoever has the strongest fist and the most guns leads.

1061
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,760
And in business,

1062
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,120
whoever has the most ways and resources leads.

1063
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,960
Similarly,

1064
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,360
if you want to find out the truth,

1065
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,680
why should Bao listen to you?

1066
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,000
You have to be a big boss.

1067
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,880
I think

1068
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,040
Mr. Luo is right.

1069
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,960
It's one thing to have the ability.

1070
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
But making people believe in your ability

1071
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,160
is another thing.

1072
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,560
In the current situation,

1073
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,400
the police department recognizes you

1074
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,720
mainly because of Mr. Luo.

1075
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,560
You interfere with the investigation and evidence.

1076
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,640
They can tolerate it for now.

1077
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,320
But if you want to give your opinion

1078
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,640
and judge them,

1079
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,280
they must spit on you

1080
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,560
and kick you out of the police station, cursing and swearing.

1081
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,120
I think it's better to wait.

1082
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,400
When they can't find the truth

1083
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,440
and get tricked by the killer,

1084
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,400
you'll show up like a superhero.
