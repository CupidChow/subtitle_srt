[Episode 22]

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,400
Do you already know who the murderer is?

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,120
I really don't know.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,920
I think it's Dong Cixin.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,229
She has a good reason for killing.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,539
She always felt that Du Heng was not with her

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,590
because of Fang Jianqi.

22
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,240
So she had been holding a grudge.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,030
Du Heng

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
now likes Jingxuan very much.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,800
She couldn't stand it and that's why she did it.

26
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,740
Then how do you explain that she killed my teacher?

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,110
Don't worry.

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,050
The truth will soon come out.

29
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,800
I'm going to the kitchen now.

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,010
The other Bordeaux glass wasn't broken, was it?

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,040
What do you mean?

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,740
Dr. Fang hardly used that set of glasses before.

33
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,230
So you thought

34
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,450
no one would find out

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,730
even if you sold one quietly.

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,250
Mr. Situ,

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,220
don't slander me.

38
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,470
I'm not that kind of person.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,600
Really?

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,340
Does that bracelet you're wearing belong to you?

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,020
Yes.

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,000
It was a reward from Dr. Fang

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,829
for my hard work.

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,950
Really?

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,160
This is...

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,440
Don't slander me.

48
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,730
I'm not a pushover.

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,120
If it were a reward from Dr. Fang,

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,350
you should know that

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,630
it isn't a pendant on a bracelet,

52
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,990
but a cufflink.

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,600
And it's for men.

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,710
It came in a pair

55
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,800
just like those Bordeaux glasses.

56
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,070
When did you steal the other glass?

57
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,890
I didn't.

58
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,040
I really didn't.

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,500
Luo Shaochuan doesn't seem to like you.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,700
If you don't tell me...

61
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,950
-I'll have to ask him to ask you. -Please don't. Detective Situ.

62
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,420
I didn't steal the glass. I swear.

63
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,150
It's...

64
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,100
Dr. Fang would take that glass out

65
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,110
and admire it.

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,930
I did try to get that glass.

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,050
But I didn't

68
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,070
have the guts to do that.

69
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,180
When was the last time

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,070
you saw that pair of glasses?

71
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,780
About two days ago.

72
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,880
He showed them to Jin Mantang.

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,110
Detective Situ,

74
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,050
this pendant was given by Miss Zheng Bai.

75
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,760
Dr. Fang put it away and didn't take it out anymore.

76
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,370
So I thought

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,280
I could wear it.

78
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,380
I will return it to him.

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,550
I'll give it back to you now.

80
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,150
Please don't tell the police.

81
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,600
Detective Situ,

82
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,480
I'll listen to you.

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,590
I will do whatever you say.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,310
Go.

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,490
I hope you'll be

86
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,280
as serious as you were yesterday.

87
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,970
Don't worry, Detective Situ.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,510
I promise to do exactly what I did yesterday.

89
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,620
Fang Jianqi just died.

90
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,100
She just couldn't wait to

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,800
take someone else's things for herself,

92
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,160
causing her to bow down to you now.

93
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,050
I've seen a lot of people like that.

94
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,550
Is money

95
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,120
really that important in their eyes?

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,950
But they can live very well

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,700
without these things.

98
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,970
But they see their masters come from wealthy families

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,010
and wear extravagant clothes.

100
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,210
In their opinion,

101
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,950
that's how life should be.

102
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,820
After thinking about it,

103
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,909
they felt that they were no worse off than their masters.

104
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,270
It's just that they weren't born in a good family.

105
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,659
They should have

106
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,990
these things.

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,020
I'm the one who doesn't know the hardships of the world.

108
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,680
But you

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,040
are sticking to your heart

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,300
and struggling to survive.

111
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,750
Knock it off!

112
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,410
I'm praising you.

113
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,040
Dr. Fang said he wanted to give everyone a surprise.

114
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,020
Mr. Du,

115
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,840
please play the missing Jin Mantang

116
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,770
and distribute wine clockwise to everyone.

117
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,410
Okay.

118
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

119
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,690
What's wrong?

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,460
Nothing.

121
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,780
We haven't had a drink together for a long time.

122
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,980
-Du? -Du.

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,100
Du?

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,300
Du!

125
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,250
Du, what happened to you?

126
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,050
Du!

127
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,270
Wake up!

128
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,090
What's going on?

129
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,450
Du, don't scare me. Get up.

130
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,050
What are you doing?

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,730
He has fainted.

132
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,330
And you are still taking photos?

133
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,270
Give me the camera.

134
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,610
Du.

135
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,430
Did you take pictures?

136
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,270
Yes.

137
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,030
Du, wake up!

138
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,280
Du!

139
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr. Du.

140
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,610
Thank you.

141
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,210
It's okay, silly girl.

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,090
I was acting.

143
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,590
Silly girl.

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,760
I was just helping Detective Situ.

145
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,200
You scared me.

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,770
What do you think?

147
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,960
My acting skills are pretty good, right?

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,120
Very good.

149
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,120
Situ,

150
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,540
I need a dark room.

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,370
There's

152
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,980
a ready-made darkroom.

153
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,140
Dr. Fang has a special place for processing photos.

154
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,140
I'll take you there.

155
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,990
Do you want to know what Luo Shaochuan thinks?

156
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,190
Yes.

157
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,720
You didn't notice

158
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,680
the way he looked

159
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,840
when you cared about Du Heng just now.

160
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,590
He was absolutely jealous.

161
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,250
No way. He...

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,990
Where's the necklace?

163
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,740
It's so pretty.

164
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,810
Let me put it on for you.

165
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,020
What necklace is this?

166
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,360
Is it pretty?

167
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,480
Qiming,

168
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,800
I look so ugly in the photo.

169
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,190
You don't look ugly at all.

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,840
These photos are so real.

171
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,820
I strictly followed Situ's request

172
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,170
and photographed everyone's real reactions

173
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,780
when Mr. Du fell to the ground.

174
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,200
I will kill you

175
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,250
if these photos are leaked.

176
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,920
That won't happen.

177
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,000
Did you give that necklace

178
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,850
to Zou Jingxuan?

179
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,270
A necklace with a ruby inlaid.

180
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,400
No.

181
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,880
I got it.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,919
What?

183
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,270
That necklace was a gift from Mr. Du.

184
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,940
Du Heng gave it to her?

185
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,930
You're really here.

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,430
Are you looking for me?

187
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,930
I'll be straight with you.

188
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,430
You seem to know who the murderer is.

189
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,280
I don't.

190
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,190
Then...

191
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,780
Let me say it for you.

192
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,370
Go ahead.

193
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,290
In fact, you already told me who it is.

194
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,010
You don't have to test me.

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
This behavior of yours is stupid and pointless.

196
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,970
You must let me design your wedding dress for your wedding

197
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,790
in the future.

198
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,200
Getting married?

199
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,350
Who?

200
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,340
With whom?

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,730
I haven't agreed yet.

202
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,990
Why does she need your approval?

203
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,570
She is a member of our Luo family.

204
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,030
And I'm already engaged to her.

205
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,870
Miss Zhou and you are engaged?

206
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,090
Sorry.

207
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,010
I may be mistaken.

208
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,640
-I thought... -Who?

209
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,700
Miss Zhou?

210
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,440
It's not her.

211
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,280
Then who is it?

212
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,450
Come with me.

213
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,040
Just say what you have in mind.

214
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,780
Don't miss this opportunity.

215
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,240
Jingxuan,

216
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,480
you are the future mistress of the Lou family.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,570
So,

218
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,250
there will be a lot of people in the business world

219
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,210
who take the initiative to approach you

220
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,100
and get close to you.

221
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,390
Those are the people who try to protect their own interests.

222
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,390
So you don't need to be grateful

223
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,280
for these benefits.

224
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Why don't you

225
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,700
take it off?

226
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,150
What did you just say?

227
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,110
The Luo family's...

228
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,240
what?

229
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,960
What are you looking at?

230
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,290
We're watching Mr. Luo

231
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,590
getting his love back.

232
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,020
I am a sensible person.

233
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,640
Miss Zheng,

234
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,190
you can come to me at any time

235
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,900
if you need anything.

236
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,400
I am also a lawyer.

237
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,960
He used to be.

238
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,490
Thank you.

239
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,920
What are you looking at?

240
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:43,750
How's it going?

241
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,880
We were a little late.

242
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,050
She's dead?

243
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,250
This patient

244
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,490
received

245
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,170
a box of whisky heart chocolates

246
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,080
in the name of Fang Jianqi.

247
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,190
The nicotine

248
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,530
was hidden in the wine heart.

249
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,940
What a perfect ending.

250
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,030
What do you mean?

251
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,990
Where were the chocolates sent from?

252
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,100
I've looked into it.

253
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,920
It was sent from the post office this morning.

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,630
The post office?

255
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,670
But shouldn't the murderer be right here?

256
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,410
I heard them say

257
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,050
the murderer

258
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,830
killed the patient at the nursing home this morning.

259
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,520
Didn't they say

260
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,280
the murderer was here?

261
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,660
I just heard Sergeant Bao

262
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,720
say this to Detective Situ in the aisle.

263
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,250
So they can't find the murderer

264
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,980
and want us to blame, right?

265
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,410
You're back.

266
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,430
What's going on?

267
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,460
What are you doing?

268
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,850
You know

269
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,500
the murderer is not here.

270
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,990
What do you mean by keeping us here?

271
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,110
Who told you that?

272
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,100
Stop pretending.

273
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,170
Did the murderer

274
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,560
kill someone in the nursing home today?

275
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,530
You know exactly

276
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,690
what the murderer did.

277
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,810
You are trying to frame me?

278
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,720
I'll kill you!

279
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,970
Are you crazy?

280
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,110
Shoot me.

281
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,170
Shoot me here.

282
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,610
You think I don't dare, right?

283
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,410
Shaochuan, calm down.

284
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,650
There's a policeman trying to kill me.

285
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,440
Stop.

286
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,230
-Don't embarrass yourself. -Don't do that.

287
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,810
You bitch!

288
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,210
You arranged all this, didn't you?

289
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,190
Stop him!

290
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,060
Stop!

291
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,460
I know who the murderer is.

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,770
Call everyone back to the location where the dinner was held.

293
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,790
I will find the murderer.

294
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,560
Actually,

295
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,030
the target of the murderer

296
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,170
has been only one person since the beginning.

297
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,380
Lawyer Shen?

298
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,100
No.

299
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,430
Dr. Fang.

300
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,710
So he killed the wrong person the first time?

301
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,770
No.

302
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,350
That was the murderer's rehearsal.

303
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,780
Rehearsal?

304
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,350
Rehearsal for murder?

305
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,100
Because the murderer knew that

306
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,280
Fang Jianqi didn't drink cocktails.

307
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,890
So he didn't even think about

308
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,680
killing him at that wine party.

309
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,170
On the contrary,

310
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,530
he had to make sure that

311
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,600
Fang Jianqi must not die at that wine party.

312
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
Wasn't that superfluous?

313
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,670
Nope.

314
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,320
This rehearsal was necessary for the murderer.

315
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,610
Because he wanted to make sure that

316
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,570
his killing method was perfect

317
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,460
and that he could successfully

318
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,320
walk away after the crime.

319
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,170
Hope you will

320
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,260
never have to need that.

321
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,370
I am grateful for the help

322
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,190
you have given to

323
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
the lawyer association.

324
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,470
Okay.

325
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,710
But

326
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,620
everyone had the opportunity to touch that cocktail.

327
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,620
That's right.

328
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,160
And there was no toxic glass found at the scene.

329
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,900
That's the importance of this rehearsal.

330
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,140
In fact,

331
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,500
the rehearsal was an indiscriminate killing.

332
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,690
As long as he

333
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,850
and Dr. Fang don't drink it,

334
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,820
it doesn't matter who drinks it.

335
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,170
Actually,

336
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,210
everyone here who had attended the wine party

337
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,030
were close to death that day.

338
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,500
It's just that Mr. Shen was the unlucky one.

339
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,820
As for the glass.

340
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,570
The murderer's purpose was to verify that

341
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,570
replacing the poisoned glass

342
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,850
in the midst of the chaos

343
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,110
would not be noticed.

344
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,730
I've done experiments

345
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,650
when we were reappearing banquet.

346
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,350
I replaced the poisoned glass

347
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,820
while Du Heng was pretending to be dead.

348
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,710
Du! Du!

349
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,200
Du!

350
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,080
Du, what's going on?

351
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,010
Du, wake up!

352
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,850
What happened?

353
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,560
What are you doing?

354
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,100
He has fainted.

355
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,810
-And you are still taking photos? -Don't scare me.

356
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,800
Give me the camera.

357
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,590
What should we do?

358
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,540
And none of you

359
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,140
had noticed it.

360
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,040
So no one could find the poisoned glass

361
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,710
after that.

362
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,530
Go get Dong Cixin and Zheng Bai over here.

363
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,930
Do you know that

364
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,820
women

365
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,320
are different now than they used to be.

366
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,130
Lawyer Shen.

367
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,720
Lawyer Shen!

368
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,330
Shen.

369
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,840
-Lawyer Shen. -Shen.

370
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,360
Shen.

371
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,290
Therefore the police could not file a case

372
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,390
if they could not find the poisoned glass.

373
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,070
Even if they find it.

374
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,000
For the reason that the relationship between the murderer and the victim is so far,

375
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,820
and that it was even the first time they met that day,

376
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,100
no one would suspect him at all.

377
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,850
Only a few months later.

378
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,090
Last night,

379
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,740
he handed the poisoned wine to Dr. Fang,

380
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,080
and then took advantage of the chaos

381
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,850
to replace the Bordeaux glass.

382
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,050
Master.

383
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:50,690
Master!

384
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,090
Master, what's going on?

385
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,530
Master! Master! Master!

386
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,130
Move!

387
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,160
Dr. Fang! Dr. Fang!

388
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,950
I'm going to call the police.

389
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,550
Stop!

390
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,569
No one is leaving

391
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,510
without my permission.

392
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,260
You mean

393
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,780
Jin Mantang?

394
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,150
I've never heard of him.

395
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,869
Who? I don't know him.

396
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,349
Didn't you say Jin Mantang went missing?

397
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,140
Could he have been killed by the murderer?

398
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,530
I never said anything like that.

399
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,080
Detective Situ,

400
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,850
If you thought my previous analysis was incorrect,

401
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,250
you can tell me then.

402
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,330
We are not professionals.

403
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,060
You don't need to care about this now, right?

404
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,690
Who would know that

405
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,730
Fang Jianqi had a pair of Bordeaux glasses?

406
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,570
And in front of what kind of people

407
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,270
would Fang Jianqi take out this pair of glasses.

408
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,010
This set of glasses

409
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,150
was brought back from abroad by Du Heng and given to him.

410
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,500
He had always treasured them.

411
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,950
Unless Du Heng came,

412
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,370
he would not take out the cups.

413
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,230
How could one of the glasses be dropped?

414
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,820
When was the last time

415
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,620
you saw that pair of glasses?

416
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
About two days ago.

417
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,890
He showed them to Jin Mantang.

418
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,650
The murderer created

419
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,570
such an image of Jin Mantang

420
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,110
and successfully deceived everyone.

421
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,640
Even Dr. Fang admired Jin Mantang very much.

422
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,690
He thought

423
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,050
it was his acting-addicted old friend

424
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,000
who brought a little surprise to the wine party

425
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,960
and was ready to accept it.

426
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,490
But the performance was a performance.

427
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
There would be evidence eventually.

428
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,010
Jin Mantang's handwriting

429
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,570
should be crooked when he was new to writing.

430
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,920
But his writing was extraordinarily neat.

431
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,990
That's contradictory.

432
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,010
Your imagination is really wonderful.

433
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,000
Stop denying it.

434
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,220
Jin Mantang,

435
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,380
You don't have to test me.

436
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,800
This behavior of yours is stupid and pointless.

437
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,020
Dr. Fang had adored you for over twenty years,

438
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,600
seen countless corpses in his life

439
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,370
and uncovered the unspeakable regrets

440
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,200
of countless deceased people.

441
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,280
Now it's his turn.

442
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,510
Could you watch him die unjustly?

443
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,320
So what?

444
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,970
Do I have to

445
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,530
respond to everyone who loves me?

446
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,490
In fact, Dr. Fang was quite manly.

447
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,360
He would rather be blamed by you

448
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,760
than tell you the truth that

449
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,790
Du Heng just doesn't love you at all.

450
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,070
There are too many despicable characters like you

451
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,370
in my book.

452
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,490
You think too much.

453
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,870
I'm just here to tell you a secret that

454
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,890
everyone in this manor knows

455
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,740
except you.

456
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,830
You are actually trying to scam a novelist,

457
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,390
young man?

458
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,090
Where did you get this inexplicable confidence from?

459
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,240
Du Heng didn't refuse you

460
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,330
for his brotherhood.

461
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,080
He had a family long ago.

462
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,360
What did you say?

463
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,750
Du Heng had never loved you.

464
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,560
He didn't help you with your novel

465
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,800
because of you.

466
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,660
He did it because his wife liked the story.

467
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,040
He was merely taking this opportunity

468
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,170
to make confession to his wife.

469
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,170
Fang Jianqi knew that.

470
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,320
But he took the blame for these mistakes

471
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,950
in order to preserve your status

472
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,310
as a budding novelist.

473
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,940
Nonsense.

474
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,010
What do you know

475
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,640
about our relationship?

476
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,850
These words were told by Fang Jianqi himself to Zheng Bai,

477
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,580
and then by Du Heng to Zou Jingxuan.

478
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,770
Even his wife has been dead for years.

479
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,560
And Dr. Fang is dead too.

480
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,050
He still doesn't care much about you now, right?

481
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,850
He has been pursuing the young and beautiful Zou Jingxuan.

482
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,920
You know this.

483
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,220
Just now,

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,850
he gave Zou Jingxuan

485
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,720
a pricey necklace.

486
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,640
There is no need for me to lie to you.

487
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,020
You can ask anyone

488
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,950
if you don't believe me.

489
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,690
But of course,

490
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,750
there is no need for you to hate anyone.

491
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,600
Just like you said earlier.

492
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,050
You don't have to give a response

493
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,840
to anyone who loves you.

494
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,130
You think

495
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,050
you are a standout novelist.

496
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,860
But in the end,

497
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,600
you are just a joke to them.

498
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,440
Enough.

499
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,710
Stop it.

500
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,970
What do you want to know?

501
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,980
It's not about me.

502
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,600
It's for Dr. Fang.

503
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,990
The expressions of others are all panic and fear.

504
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,210
But you look surprised.

505
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,500
It's as if you're saying

506
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,600
how could you possibly be poisoned and fall to the ground?

507
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,700
Why?

508
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,120
He is

509
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,040
Jin Mantang.

510
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,610
Recently, I have developed moles

511
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,430
on the back of my hand from time to time,

512
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,840
so I am used to looking at other people's wrists.

513
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,840
When Jin Mantang was passing me the wine,

514
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,390
I subconsciously took a look on his wrist.

515
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,930
When we were reappearing the banquet,

516
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,250
Du Heng brought me wine.

517
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,250
I also saw his wrist.

518
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,110
They are exactly the same.

519
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,370
There is no way I could have misidentified that wrist.

520
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,320
At that time, I knew that

521
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,060
Jin Mantang was played by Du Heng.

522
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,250
So I simply didn't believe it

523
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,300
when he fell to the ground in poison.

524
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't think you need to listen to her.

525
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,480
She just couldn't get her beloved one and is resentful.

526
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,250
This is known to many people.

527
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,360
Detective Situ,

528
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,610
I think I need to remind you that

529
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,810
I was brought here by you

530
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,470
from the road this morning.

531
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,210
That brings us to the third murder.

532
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,450
The box of whisky heart chocolates sent to the nursing home

533
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,620
was sent from the Harbin Post Office.

534
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,890
That's too reckless.

535
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,330
Yes.

536
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,040
You're right.

537
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,350
I'm glad you're fine.

538
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,590
What's going on?

539
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,170
Are you okay?

540
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,710
The driver was driving too fast.

541
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,250
It's okay.

542
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,810
Mr. Du.

543
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,440
Miss. Zhou?

544
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,270
Why would Fang Jianqi let Jin Mantang sit here?

545
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,170
And why would he say that

546
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,790
happy things keep happening?

547
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,690
Because Du Heng's performance

548
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,740
was a surprise prepared for everyone.

549
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,050
A servant suddenly turned into an old friend

550
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,350
would definitely be the climax of a party.

551
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,420
But what he didn't know was that

552
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,790
the surprise Du Heng was talking about

553
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,510
was a murder against him.

554
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,280
How could that be?

555
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,390
Even if he is Jin Mantang,

556
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,810
how could he know that

557
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,420
there would be another identical banquet?

558
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,700
Du, say something.

559
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,590
He just could.

560
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,900
Because this banquet was also planned by him.

561
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,870
I just sent someone to search his apartment.

562
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,840
I guess

563
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,350
there would still be some nicotine there.

564
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:14,870
That's true.

565
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,340
There really is.

566
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,100
Impossible.

567
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,960
That's impossible.

568
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,940
He...

569
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,930
There's no reason for him to kill his old friend.

570
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,470
You...

571
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,940
Sit down and listen.

572
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,280
I guess

573
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,840
it was for someone else.

574
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:42,820
Stop it.

575
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,270
I killed him.

576
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,840
I confess.

577
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,310
Stop talking

578
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,640
if you want to know more.

579
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,250
Wait.

580
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
I still have something to ask him.

581
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,070
Go ahead.

582
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,530
I want to speak to Situ Yan alone.

583
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,770
Is that okay?

584
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,280
Yep.

585
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,880
You guys just leave now.

586
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,440
I don't think so.

587
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,130
He's so cunning.

588
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,540
What if he...

589
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,140
Don't worry.

590
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Take care of Jingxuan.

591
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,770
She should be pretty upset right now.

592
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,430
Call me if something happens.

593
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,740
I'll wait for you downstairs.

594
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,410
Behave yourself.

595
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:48,920
By the way,

596
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,680
give this back to him.

597
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,040
Jingxuan

598
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,400
doesn't like old stuff.

599
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,120
You're working for the Oracle, right?

600
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,120
How did you know?

601
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,810
You shouldn't give her the necklace,

602
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,600
if you really want to protect Jingxuan.

603
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,030
When did you know my relationship with Jingxuan?

604
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,670
Now.

605
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,890
You killed Fang Jianqi

606
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,940
because he knew your secret.

607
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,220
You were married twenty years ago.

608
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,340
Your wife was a local celebrity.

609
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,960
I thought you were pursuing Zou Jingxuan.

610
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,180
So you couldn't let people know that you were married.

611
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,510
Until I saw this necklace.

612
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,730
There must be some special commemorative meaning

613
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,850
to give someone an old gift.

614
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,240
This necklace belonged to her mother.

615
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,040
You want to get out of the Oracle.

616
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,680
I came to Harbin this time to quit.

617
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,270
But before I leave,

618
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,770
I want everyone who knows the secret to shut up forever.

619
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,990
This will ensure Jingxuan's safety.

620
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
Did you kill Zhao Qiansun?

621
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,180
Yep.

622
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,430
So my teacher didn't die at that that wine party

623
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,080
because of bad luck.

624
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,280
He was going to  die sooner or later.

625
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,730
My teacher,

626
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,170
Chairman Luo,

627
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,440
Fang Jianqi

628
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,170
and Xie Hua

629
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,470
were all going to die sooner or later.

630
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,490
Yes.

631
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,290
Including Zheng Bai and Dong Cixin.

632
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,890
Maybe they will die too.

633
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,160
Why did you leave?

634
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,930
You also know that

635
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,170
my wife comes from a prestigious family.

636
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:46,970
Her family

637
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,750
would never allow her to marry an actor.

638
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,710
We secretly had a wedding ceremony.

639
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,680
She was then locked up.

640
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,750
In order to get ahead,

641
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,410
I had to travel far away to Japan.

642
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,990
So that one day

643
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,810
I could take her away formally.

644
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,780
But who would have thought that

645
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,800
the year after I left,

646
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,620
my wife died of illness.

647
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,210
What I didn't expect was that

648
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,760
she gave birth to my child.

649
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,800
I didn't know that

650
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,430
until I went back to Harbin two years ago

651
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,170
and met Fang.

652
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,450
Jingxuan is my daughter.

653
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,670
She has been fostered in the Luo family.

654
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,370
I can tell she has not suffered a single bit of hardship

655
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,550
since she was a child.

656
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,150
I was really grateful to Luo Wensheng.

657
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,080
But at that time,

658
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,860
I was already a man of the Oracle.

659
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,260
Your way of being grateful was to kill him?

660
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,400
I didn't kill him.

661
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,140
It was my leader, X.

662
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,990
He is in charge of the layout and operations in Northeast China.

663
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,520
What do you want?

664
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,000
The Japanese have been planning

665
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,320
to invade China from the northeast.

666
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,470
They are now making arrangements in terms of public opinion,

667
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,900
culture, education, and business.

668
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,530
The first group of people they want to get rid of

669
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,090
are hard-line reformers.

670
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,040
There will be larger operations in the future.

671
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,840
I no longer wanted to do anything for them

672
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,630
after I learned that I had Jingxuan as my daughter.

673
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,500
But I knew they wouldn't let me go.

674
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,370
So I could only try to

675
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,210
take the money that Zhao Qiansun recovered

676
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,040
as my own.

677
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,610
I thought I was doing it flawlessly.

678
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,130
But X still knew it.

679
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,460
The money was never mentioned in the newspapers.

680
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,880
No one at the police station even knew about it.

681
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,180
How would X know?

682
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,360
Maybe he's right next to me?

683
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:57,910
Sergeant Bao.

684
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,180
Sergeant Bao!

685
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,090
Bad news.

686
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,290
Now the snow outside is getting heavier and heavier.

687
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,300
The drawbridge was crushed.

688
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,160
We can't leave.

689
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,940
What?

690
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,260
Go check it out.

691
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,100
Okay.

692
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,690
What happened?

693
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,070
All I can tell you is that

694
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,480
he wants you to bet your life

695
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,890
on playing one last game with him.

696
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,160
Your deal with X

697
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,470
was that he'd let you go

698
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,650
if you brought us here?

699
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,500
You're right.

700
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,740
What about this?

701
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,280
This is what he allowed me to keep for personal use.

702
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,200
I worked for him for so many years

703
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,690
and paid a lot.

704
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,170
This is a token of affection between my wife and me.

705
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,520
I want to leave it to Jingxuan.

706
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,180
I hope you can pass it on to her.

707
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,690
If you really care about her,

708
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,170
you shouldn't let her get involved.

709
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,450
I have no other chance to say goodbye to her.

710
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,960
What's your deal?

711
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,190
There will be three more murders here.

712
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,730
You win

713
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,440
if you can stop him

714
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,510
before the third murder.

715
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,840
But then you will also be a dead man.

716
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
What makes him so sure he'll be able to kill me?

717
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,530
I don't know.

718
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,090
Wouldn't he

719
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,700
do it himself?

720
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,210
Same as in the past.

721
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,600
Who is he?

722
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,400
Don't you want to know

723
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,680
what will happen if you lose?

724
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,140
This is a dilemma.

725
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,220
Whether I win or lose,

726
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,710
I'll be cornered.

727
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,450
It's comfortable to talk to smart people.

728
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,090
Three murders would indicate at least three murderers

729
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,050
and three victims.

730
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,950
Six people.

731
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,600
The probability of each person getting involved is nearly half.

732
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,370
Didn't you think that Jingxuan would be involved?

733
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
Jingxuan is your friend.

734
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,480
You won't leave her alone.

735
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,110
It seems that

736
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,710
you still think I have a better chance of winning.

737
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,120
The murderer was caught.

738
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,050
Why don't you let us go?

739
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,710
This place is cursed.

740
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,360
I still don't understand

741
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,470
why Mr. Du killed Dr. Fang.

742
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,130
Didn't Situ just say?

743
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,000
Did he?

744
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,650
He indeed didn't say.

745
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,920
I remember Situ just said that

746
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,180
Mr. Du did this for someone.

747
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,430
Then he looked at Miss Zou.

748
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,020
After that, Mr. Du suddenly admitted his guilt.

749
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,350
Me?

750
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,270
What are you talking about?

751
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,730
Maybe it was because of her?

752
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,820
What's wrong with our Jingxuan's youth and beauty?

753
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
What do you mean?

754
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,090
Why do you

755
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,750
blame her?

756
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,630
That's right.

757
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,410
Of course your daughter

758
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,080
cannot marry someone else as a concubine.

759
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,260
Du Heng wanted to marry Miss Zou?

760
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,930
So of course he couldn't let anyone know that

761
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,180
he has been married.

762
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,640
Du told me he had a wife.

763
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,840
We are just friends.

764
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,060
Du?

765
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,240
Such an intimate name.

766
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,640
If Jingxuan says they are friends, then they are.

767
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,240
Why are you leaving?

768
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,530
You're so evil.

769
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,070
Make it clear before you leave.

770
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,630
Aunt.

771
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,360
Save your words until you go out.

772
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,220
What a ridiculous person.

773
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,390
Boss!

774
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,630
Something happened to the drawbridge.

775
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,020
We can't leave for now.

776
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,870
What should we do?

777
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,990
It's weird.

778
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,280
In the past, Situ would

779
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,910
make the murderer's motive very clear

780
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,760
when closing a case.

781
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,010
But why he didn't this time?

782
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,220
I think it's because Mr. Du quickly confessed to the crime.

783
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,890
Miss. Zhou,

784
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,690
you know Situ well.

785
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:54,630
What do you think?

786
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,540
Just ask Situ

787
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,980
when he comes out.

788
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,400
Do you really think X will let you go?

789
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,280
If Jingxuan can get away safely this time,

790
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,980
how do you think

791
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,929
she will think of you in the future?

792
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,920
In the future?

793
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,909
There should be no future for someone like me.

794
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,080
I can't let Jingxuan know that I'm her father.

795
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,290
And you absolutely cannot let other people know

796
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
about my relationship with Jingxuan.

797
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,400
I give you my word.

798
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,250
Thank you.

799
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,120
It's not that I don't want to tell you who X is.

800
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,400
I really don't know.

801
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,199
Our rule has always been that

802
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,969
the superiors contact the subordinates.

803
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,820
Every contact leaves a trace.

804
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,690
As long as he takes action,

805
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,070
he will definitely leave traces.

806
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,640
Tell me what you know,

807
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,130
and I'll be sure to find him.

808
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,540
You must keep Jingxuan alive.

809
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,330
Even if she is the murderer,

810
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
you can't expose her.

811
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,030
You don't know Jingxuan.

812
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,800
Promise me first.

813
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,110
Could

814
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,010
Situ also have no idea

815
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,280
why Du Heng actually killed them?

816
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,520
How is that possible?

817
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,930
You know Du the best here.

818
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,080
Think carefully about

819
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,100
if he has any reason to kill them.

820
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,340
Actually,

821
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,000
I have not known him

822
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,120
for too long.

823
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,380
Miss,

824
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,810
is this your bag?

825
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,480
Yes.

826
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,160
Thank you.

827
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,640
Why are you here?

828
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,540
You are Jingxuan, right?

829
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,650
You know me?

830
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,370
Everyone in Harbin knows

831
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,610
the Luo family's daughter.

832
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,950
I forgot to introduce myself.

833
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,840
I am your uncle's friend,

834
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,140
named Du Heng.

835
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,320
After that,

836
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,350
at Lawyer Shen's banquet.

837
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,360
Lawyer Shen and my uncle were friends

838
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,630
and he has always been very kind to me.

839
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,280
At that time,

840
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,110
I watched him being carried out

841
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,210
and I just couldn't believe he had died like that.

842
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,340
Then Du proposed to me

843
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,600
to investigate it.

844
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,930
He said that maybe there was something behind this.

845
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,720
And I agreed.

846
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,430
We have to investigate

847
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,880
these people.

848
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,840
You proved everyone's innocence,

849
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,350
right?

850
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,440
Maybe the reason why Situ didn't say anything

851
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,020
was to take care of your emotions.

852
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,980
You and Mr. Du are friends.

853
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,520
Mr. Du may…

854
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,820
Sorry.

855
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,440
He may have some adoration for you.

856
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,710
So he must have

857
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,370
tried to make a good impression on you

858
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,700
by confessing so quickly.

859
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,480
Well,

860
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,910
don't be too sad.

861
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,350
I need to sort out the documents.

862
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,550
I'll leave now.

863
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,430
Jingxuan investigated the death of my teacher with you.

864
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,350
But she didn't know the real murderer was right in front of her.

865
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,090
You abandoned your family

866
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,600
and killed your friends for the sake of the Oracle.

867
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,850
You also killed

868
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,690
Chairman Luo, who raised her.

869
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,050
And now you've put her in trouble.

870
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,610
You simply don't deserve a daughter like her.

871
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,480
You're right.

872
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,420
I don't deserve a daughter like her.

873
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,290
Jingxuan grew up in the Luo family.

874
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,150
So she can be so perfect.

875
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,260
But I don't regret for a second that I left.

876
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,190
The time I spend with Jingxuan

877
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,670
is enough to soothe me for the past 20 years.

878
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,140
You can renew the contract,

879
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,730
but your Luo family

880
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,030
has to make compromise.

881
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,760
Mr. Li,

882
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,570
the profit

883
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,040
is already enough

884
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
for you.

885
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,270
Let me put it straight.

886
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,120
Miss Zou,

887
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,550
I signed this contract before

888
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,930
because of Mr. Luo.

889
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,570
If you want to renew the contract...

890
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,450
Mr. Li,

891
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,650
I can take you there

892
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,690
if you want to have some fun.

893
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,830
Don't make it difficult for the girl.

894
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,020
Du,

895
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,370
now prices are skyrocketing.

896
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,180
I will lose money,

897
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,520
if I sign this agreement.

898
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,940
Anyway, you can't do this to this girl.

899
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,420
Do me a favor.

900
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,040
I'll lose money

901
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,690
if I do so.

902
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,210
I won't let you lose money.

903
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,910
I'll make up the gap for you.

904
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,080
Shakespeare's book is so well-written.

905
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,180
I read it

906
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,380
when I'm free.

907
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,120
I really envy him

908
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,560
He made so many wrong choices.

909
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,730
And in the end, his wife and daughter still

910
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,760
came back to him.

911
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,060
Because he's a father.

912
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,900
No matter what kind of person he is,

913
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,400
or what he did,

914
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,310
I always think

915
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,270
I can meet him

916
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,950
and know who he is,

917
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,010
where

918
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,320
he is now.

919
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,950
I really want to see him.

920
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,730
I'm sorry.

921
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,550
I just think of myself.

922
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,090
It's okay.

923
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,190
It's human nature.

924
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,440
Du,

925
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,540
I've known you for so long.

926
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,540
How come I haven't met Mrs. Du yet?

927
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,680
She passed away a long time ago.

928
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,560
I'm sorry.

929
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,120
It's okay.

930
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,260
Beijing mutton hotpot is all about

931
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,380
the lamb being cooked without blood bubbles. You know that?

932
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:25,880
Without blood bubbles?

933
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:26,440
Yes.

934
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,270
Look, the soup is clear.

935
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,140
Sugar-coated berry!

936
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,720
Be careful when you eat.

937
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,430
The sugar coating is hard. Don't hurt your mouth.

938
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:02,810
Let's go.

939
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,370
Let's go.

940
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,540
Did you go to Beijing to prepare for the assassination?
