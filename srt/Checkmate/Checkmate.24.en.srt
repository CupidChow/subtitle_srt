[Episode 24]

16
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,090
Bai Shanshan said alcohol can fortify us against the cold.

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,520
Maybe Jingxuan heard that.

18
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,210
That's why she gave that bottle of wine to Du Heng.

19
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,050
Wait.

20
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,770
Let me piece together the facts.

21
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,270
Jingxuan gave the wine to Du Heng.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,310
Luo Shaochuan handed the glass of wine to Dai Liming.

23
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,500
You're saying,

24
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,930
Bai Shanshan is the culprit?

25
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,860
I don’t know.

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
I really don't know.

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,920
Have some water.

28
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,100
What's wrong?

29
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,820
Don't drink it.

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,200
X will kill another person.

31
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,240
We have to be careful.

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Who do you think

33
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,280
will be the next victim?

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,550
If it wasn’t me,

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,900
it must be Luo Shaochuan.

36
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,530
If I don't come back,

37
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,840
you just wait.

38
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,250
Open the door after the police enter the manor.

39
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
If I were X,

40
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,540
to set this trap,

41
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,180
there are several conditions must be met.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,590
First,

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,560
the right time.

44
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,020
He has to wait until the snowstorm comes.

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,270
It's not hard to predict.

46
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,790
Second,

47
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,140
the right place.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,740
He has to destroy the suspension bridge

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,240
and trap us here.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,030
Third,

51
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,520
the right people.

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,230
He must guarantee that

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,180
he and I

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,850
are both in the manor.

55
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,520
The suspension bridge?

56
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,829
The suspension bridge was damaged by Luo Shaochuan's car, wasn't it?

57
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,579
He asked you to come here.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,460
Research on the toxicity of nicotine.

59
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,860
No.

60
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,510
Luo Shaochuan can't be the murderer.

61
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,330
Du Heng had no reason

62
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,340
to put the clipping into Luo Shaochuan's pocket.

63
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,560
Then why did he care about this?

64
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,760
Maybe this is exactly the murderer's intention.

65
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,280
He wants you to suspect Luo Shaochuan.

66
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,320
Boss.

67
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,210
She was trying to kill you.

68
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,850
She wasn't.

69
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,540
She was trying to protect me.

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,210
In case I have a death wish.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,240
Take her.

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,190
Give me the stick.

73
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:53,880
Come here.

74
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,180
How can I hold it here?

75
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,110
It's easy, boss.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,810
How should I get out?

77
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,770
Just take it away.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,350
The door can be opened now.

79
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,560
Right.

80
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,630
Well...

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,950
You stay here and watch them.

82
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,240
If they lose a hair,

83
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,230
you will be punished.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,900
Don't worry.

85
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,580
Qiming.

86
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,240
Mr. Luo.

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,770
Give it to me.

88
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,659
I haven't shown it to Situ yet.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,810
Give it to me.

90
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,590
Give me

91
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,980
all the photos.

92
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,750
Where is Bao?

93
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,930
In the study.

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,490
Situ said,

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,700
X is going to kill two more people.

96
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,530
Sergeant Bao is anxious now.

97
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,650
There's no X at all.

98
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,950
Situ Yan made it up.

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,820
What do you mean?

100
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,250
Do you know Situ Yan well?

101
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,120
You...

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,040
Don't scream.

103
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,140
I know you won't scream.

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,490
Otherwise, we'll all die.

105
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,990
You don't want that, do you?

106
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,150
Now.

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,870
You will do

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,100
as I say.

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,030
Mr. Luo.

110
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,410
Are you okay?

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,400
He brought Du Heng back.

112
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,330
He also said X would kill three more people.

113
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,760
What did Du Heng really confess?

114
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,270
No one knows.

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,190
Right after he came to Harbin,

116
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,300
Shen Jianxian died.

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
He just met my dad,

118
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,870
my dad got killed.

119
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,950
He said Xie Hua killed someone,

120
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,810
and forced him to shoot himself.

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,980
If he didn't insist on investigating the dog,

122
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,409
Fan Lihua and Luo Jinyan would still be alive.

123
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,330
The girls' school

124
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,300
wouldn't have a principal who is obedient to the Japanese.

125
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,540
Du Heng was a murderer too.

126
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,730
Why

127
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,880
is he dead?

128
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,980
Mr. Du is also...

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,180
How could it be Situ?

130
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,050
He solved all those

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,090
complicated cases.

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,210
How could he be the murderer?

133
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,370
What if

134
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
Situ Yan planned all of it?

135
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,330
He planned those murders,

136
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,410
so that he could catch the killers himself.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,870
That's how

138
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,050
he built up his prestige.

139
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,490
Where is Jingxuan?

140
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,260
Miss Zou...

141
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,840
She's in a safe place.

142
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,070
Is Sergeant Bao still in the study?

143
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,020
He is.

144
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
It's been an hour.

145
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,280
Can you tell me

146
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,010
who killed Dai Liming?

147
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,169
-It's clear that Dai Liming... -I don't know.

148
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,020
I knew it.

149
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,230
You can't be trusted.

150
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,210
Are you staying here to be the third person?

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,750
You never suspected Luo Shaochuan.

152
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,890
What about him?

153
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,800
He's been making mischief between you and everyone.

154
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,790
When did he ever be so close to Jin Qiming?

155
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,310
I know who X is.

156
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,630
Who?

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,730
Luo Shaochuan left with Zou Jingxuan

158
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,740
and Bai Shanshan.

159
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,470
But he's the only one who came back.

160
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,190
Luo Shaochuan couldn't have killed Jingxuan and Bai Shanshan.

161
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,060
Maybe,

162
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,020
X deliberately alienated you and Luo Shaochuan

163
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,840
so that

164
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,240
Jingxuan and Bai Shanshan would be alone.

165
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,470
Is Situ Yan going out?

166
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,060
Is he going to find you?

167
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,120
Do you know

168
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,710
there's a wine cellar outside?

169
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,870
I remember

170
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,600
Ding Meng told Situ

171
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,100
that Dr. Fang put some wine

172
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,840
in the wine cellar.

173
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,850
Situ Yan asked Ding Meng about the wine cellar?

174
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,800
I heard something about it.

175
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,370
The only place to hide someone outside is the wine cellar.

176
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,450
Do me a favor.

177
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,840
Find Zou Jingxuan and Bai Shanshan,

178
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,100
and take them to the study.

179
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,890
You want Sergeant Bao to...

180
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,690
I'll go back and distract them.

181
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,440
X wouldn't have figured that they were hiding there.

182
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,130
Okay.

183
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,290
I'll go.

184
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,310
Situ Yan

185
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,790
is the X.

186
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,110
Who do you think

187
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,640
will be the third person he wants to kill?

188
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,510
I don't know.

189
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,980
It must be me.

190
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,790
So, Qiming, could you do me a favor?

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,300
Mr. Luo, anything for you.

192
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,290
You're making me nervous.

193
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,990
Jingxuan,

194
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,910
my aunt,

195
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,510
and Liu are very unsafe.

196
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,160
Please go out there,

197
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,730
bring them out of the wine cellar,

198
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,360
and hide them in your darkroom.

199
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,690
No one will think of that place.

200
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,330
Situ Yan

201
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,040
will find a way to get to them.

202
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,010
He has already used Zou Jingxuan

203
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,880
to get rid of Du Heng.

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,670
I can't let another tragedy happen.

205
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,980
Here.

206
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,180
Take it.

207
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,960
Take it.

208
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,070
I don't know how to use a gun.

209
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,500
It's easy.

210
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,500
Load, aim and shoot.

211
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,550
What...

212
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,480
What about you?

213
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,630
I...

214
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,310
I can get another one from Bao.

215
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,010
Okay.

216
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,560
Miss Zou.

217
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,690
Madam.

218
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,950
Miss Zou.

219
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,170
Situ.

220
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,850
Jingxuan and Bai Shanshan are not in the wine cellar.

221
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,940
They are not?

222
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,510
They must have been there.

223
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,450
And

224
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,440
Luo Shaochuan probably had an argument with them.

225
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,090
When I was there,

226
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,870
Jin Qiming went down there.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,020
What was he doing down there?

228
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,720
I didn't dare to let him know

229
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,130
that I went to the wine cellar as well.

230
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,670
No one is there.

231
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,680
Help me look for them.

232
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,410
We can't let X have them.

233
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,710
Okay.

234
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,240
Mowan.

235
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,050
If we can

236
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,430
both get out alive this time...

237
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,140
Never mind.

238
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,900
Let's survive first.

239
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,030
Sure.

240
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
You don't even know what I'm going to say.

241
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,710
Anything you want.

242
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,270
Are you kidding me?

243
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,820
You want me to arrest Situ Yan?

244
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,040
My goodness.

245
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,630
If I arrest Situ Yan today,

246
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,440
I'll lose my job tomorrow.

247
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,130
It's quite probable.

248
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,670
He is almost exalted to the skies

249
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,420
by those people out there.

250
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,660
Unless you have evidence.

251
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,450
Otherwise,

252
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,590
I won't arrest Situ Yan.

253
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,250
Bao,

254
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,770
my family built the police station.

255
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,670
To put it bluntly,

256
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,360
your family is also supported by my family.

257
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,850
Mr. Luo.

258
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,700
Get out.

259
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,260
Miss Zou and Madam are missing.

260
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:07,920
What?

261
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,120
I went to the wine cellar.

262
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,450
There was a broken bottle of wine on the ground.

263
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,790
But no one was there.

264
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,140
What are you doing?

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,370
No, no.

266
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,940
Mr. Luo.

267
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,360
If you don't let me kill Situ Yan,

268
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,370
you must be his accomplice.

269
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,690
How can I be?

270
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,630
Fine.

271
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,140
My gun is your gun.

272
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,870
Sergeant Bao...

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,680
He's crazy.

274
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,000
Go after him!

275
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,130
Mr. Luo.

276
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,360
Situ Yan.

277
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,610
Situ Yan.

278
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,240
What kind of man are you?

279
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,110
You kidnapped two women?

280
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,120
You son of a bitch!

281
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,300
What's wrong with you?

282
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,360
If you have a problem, come at me.

283
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,130
Stay away from them.

284
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,120
Didn't you hide them?

285
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,630
Come off it.

286
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,910
Who else could it be?

287
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,290
What's wrong with you?

288
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,930
When Situ asked me to find them,

289
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,910
they were already gone.

290
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,760
You are admitting it.

291
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,740
From the beginning,

292
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,440
your purpose has been Zou Jingxuan.

293
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,010
Are you out of your mind?

294
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,690
What do you want?

295
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,250
The Luo family?

296
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,570
I'll give you my life.

297
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,920
Calm down.

298
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,740
I have nothing to do with Jingxuan's disappearance.

299
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,470
You have fallen into X's trap.

300
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
X's trap?

301
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,560
You are X!

302
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,650
Let them go.

303
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,270
I'll die. You can have me.

304
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,950
Luo Shaochuan!

305
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,550
Don’t be insane.

306
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,470
Put the gun down.

307
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,110
Put it down.

308
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,320
If you shoot,

309
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,990
you'll be the third person.

310
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,630
If you don't go with me,

311
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,660
you'll be the third person.

312
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,240
What you are going to do

313
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,400
is useless.

314
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,240
Even if you kill me,

315
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,300
you can't find Zou Jingxuan and Bai Shanshan.

316
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,550
You are Situ Yan.

317
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,440
You'll still lose

318
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,000
if you kill three or four people.

319
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,610
I’ll kill you now.

320
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,150
Bai Shanshan,

321
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,610
Jingxuan, I'll find them myself.

322
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,370
Who does X want to be killed here most?

323
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,280
Shut up!

324
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,590
It's me.

325
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,250
Shut up!

326
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,790
He just wants to enjoy the show.

327
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,730
Shut up!

328
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,740
Mr. Luo.

329
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,390
Mr. Luo, what have you done?

330
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,250
Situ is not the X.

331
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,120
It's him.

332
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,590
He killed Du Heng and poisoned Dai Liming.

333
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,920
Who else could it be?

334
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,460
Dai Liming died because of you.

335
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,130
You're lying!

336
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,080
Dai Liming knew three people were going to die.

337
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,840
So he poisoned Zheng Bai’s wine.

338
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,960
Zheng Bai didn’t drink it.

339
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,650
He gave her another cup of coffee.

340
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,890
When you were confronting Dong Cixin,

341
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,000
you hit the table.

342
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,369
Dai Liming accidentally

343
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,450
drank the poisonous wine.

344
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,490
That's why he died.

345
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,710
That's not true! You're lying!

346
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,550
Situ didn't say anything,

347
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,040
because he wanted to protect you.

348
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,569
But what have you done?

349
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,880
You killed him.

350
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,490
That's not true!

351
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,609
That's not true!

352
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:30,940
That's not true!

353
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,960
Turn yourself in.

354
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,080
Mr. Jin,

355
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,210
you're too impatient.

356
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,160
If I were you,

357
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,000
I would check

358
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,750
if Situ Yan is really dead.

359
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,300
I didn't expect

360
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,960
Mr. Jin is also good at reasoning out cases.

361
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,580
Miss Zhou told me.

362
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,250
She said you told her about it.

363
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,250
I didn't.

364
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,740
I just said that

365
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,370
Luo Shaochuan handed the wine to Dai Lianming.

366
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,610
But why was there a glass of poisonous wine?

367
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,790
I never mentioned.

368
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,740
How could you know all about it?

369
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,240
So,

370
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,490
it was you who deliberately took the nicotine

371
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,690
and put it back in the wine cabinet.

372
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,220
You're the X.

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,320
I didn't do anything.

374
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,060
Why are you suspecting me?

375
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,820
X mounted three challenges to me through Du Heng.

376
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,970
This person must meet three conditions.

377
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,160
First,

378
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,480
the right time.

379
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,000
He has to wait until the snowstorm comes.

380
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,210
Second,

381
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,350
the right place.

382
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,130
He has to destroy the suspension bridge

383
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,870
so that all of us will be trapped here.

384
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,300
Third,

385
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,460
the right people.

386
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,890
He must guarantee that

387
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,170
he and I are both in that manor.

388
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,810
The first thing is not difficult.

389
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,250
The second thing will identify the killer,

390
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,640
and increase Luo Shaochuan’s suspicion.

391
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,900
But after a second thought,

392
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,210
it wouldn't be difficult

393
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,400
if Du Heng helped you on the inside.

394
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,570
The third thing,

395
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,740
as long as you know a little about me,

396
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,240
it won't be difficult to set this trap.

397
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,980
Based on all the conditions,

398
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,820
X knows me well.

399
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,010
And he knows about

400
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,000
every case I investigated in Harbin.

401
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,140
The only people who know about the cases

402
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,820
are Luo Shaochuan,

403
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,060
Sergeant Bao,

404
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,620
Zou Jingxuan, Bai Shanshan, Zhou Mowan,

405
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,870
and you.

406
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,470
Then why me?

407
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,970
When I was testifying against Du Heng,

408
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,440
Liu brought over that bottle of nicotine.

409
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,820
It's real!

410
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,330
There really is nicotine

411
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,900
in his apartment.

412
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,210
After the incident,

413
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,290
Luo Shaochuan, Sergeant Bao and I

414
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,400
were interrogating Du Heng in the study.

415
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,860
The only people who had the chance to steal the medicine

416
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,650
were Zou Jingxuan, Bai Shanshan, Zhou Mowan,

417
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,400
and you.

418
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,170
You suspect me

419
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,830
just because they are women?

420
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,190
There's another thing.

421
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,590
Who could have taken the book

422
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,950
from the study to the living room

423
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,220
and placed it for Zou Jingxuan to see?

424
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,930
The corner of the key page was even folded.

425
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,700
Bai Shanshan never went to the study.

426
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,490
And Zou Jingxuan

427
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,540
wouldn't do such a thing.

428
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,480
What about Miss Zhou?

429
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,360
Right.

430
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,830
With your relationship,

431
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,380
of course you won't suspect her.

432
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:07,750
No.

433
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,700
I sounded her out.

434
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,540
X has a clear purpose.

435
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,570
From the beginning,

436
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,220
X has been trying to make mischief between Luo Shaochuan and I.

437
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,570
Why did Du Heng

438
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,680
tell me about it in private?

439
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,730
As long as he's dead,

440
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,280
X doesn't exist.

441
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,070
Three murders will happen here.

442
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,910
But to outsiders,

443
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,290
there is no X,

444
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,790
I'm making it all up.

445
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,850
So if I lose

446
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,600
this gamble,

447
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,570
I’ll be deserted immediately.

448
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,080
The most important part is Luo Shaochuan.

449
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,400
Unfortunately,

450
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,970
you misjudged him

451
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,840
and me.

452
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,740
Zhou Mowan suspected Luo Shaochuan several times

453
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,420
and dispelled her suspicion several times.

454
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,230
If she was the X,

455
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,690
she wouldn't be as impatient as you.

456
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,860
You took so many photos

457
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,940
of me telling Du Heng about the cases,

458
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,140
only to make Luo Shaochuan think

459
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,230
I’m the X?

460
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,770
And you put the clipping

461
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,380
about the nicotine into his clothes

462
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,450
to make me think

463
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,440
he's the X.

464
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,290
In that case,

465
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,490
we played along

466
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,680
and fought back.

467
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,330
I have made him believe that I suspect you.

468
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,970
Where are Jingxuan and your aunt?

469
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,840
I asked Liu to send them to a safe place.

470
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,840
But,

471
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,980
why are you keeping it from Zhou Mowan?

472
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,980
They don’t know either.

473
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,270
The photos he gave me.

474
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,450
Many photos of me.

475
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,510
Why did Dai Liming kill Zheng Bai?

476
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,430
That's because you emphasized over and over again that

477
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,480
three murders would happen here.

478
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,080
No one knows who will die.

479
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,430
So, under your hint,

480
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,310
he realized that

481
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,180
if he killed Zheng Bai,

482
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,730
he could impute the murder

483
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,310
to the X that nobody knew.

484
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,980
So he pretended to be nice.

485
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,100
In fact,

486
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,060
he wanted to kill Zheng Bai.

487
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,160
This is just your conjecture.

488
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,080
Do you have any evidence?

489
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,220
Can you arrest me?

490
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,800
Did Xie Hua kill Chairman Luo

491
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,010
because of you?

492
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,420
Xie.

493
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,840
Xie.

494
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,520
No wonder Xie Hua thought his son's name

495
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,940
was in that letter.

496
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,410
People like to

497
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,920
discover clues themselves.

498
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,790
They trust what they see

499
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,670
with their own eyes.

500
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,070
It's a pity.

501
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,480
Xie Hua could have been useful to me.

502
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,990
You ruined this part of my plan.

503
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,780
But it doesn't matter.

504
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,740
Luo Wensheng and Xie Hua

505
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,120
would have objected in the end.

506
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,940
Because we have different positions.

507
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,440
But I still want to thank you

508
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,890
for helping me get rid of a strong rival.

509
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,870
You are Chinese.

510
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,770
But you are helping another country overturn us.

511
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,560
Once the war begins,

512
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,830
the fighting will happen in your hometown.

513
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,750
Your compatriots will be murdered and suffer from pillage.

514
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,840
Why are you doing it?

515
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,030
My home is not here.

516
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,870
I don't have a home.

517
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,320
I'm just an orphan.

518
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,610
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

519
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,490
I don’t drink because of my dad.

520
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,090
When I was young,

521
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,070
my dad drunk and gambled heavily.

522
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,530
He lost everything we had.

523
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,850
I swore

524
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,890
I would never gamble

525
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,550
nor drink.

526
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,740
You were adopted by the Japanese.

527
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,510
I lied to you.

528
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,850
My dad was not an alcoholic.

529
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,300
My parents died more than ten years ago.

530
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,710
I was raised by the Japanese.

531
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,810
Shouldn't I

532
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
repay their kindness for raising me?

533
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,150
Mr. Zhang

534
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,480
raised me up.

535
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,630
He taught me how to read and write.

536
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,590
He taught me how to fight and be a man.

537
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,940
If it weren't for him,

538
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,000
I would have been taken away by a wild dog

539
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,570
without anyone knowing.

540
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,540
I had no father

541
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,550
and no mother.

542
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,700
It's the Japanese.

543
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,220
It's them.

544
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
They are my second parents.

545
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,500
I grew up in Japan.

546
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,980
Until two years ago,

547
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,680
I came back and made my plan of action.

548
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,930
Councilor Xu!

549
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,830
Catch the assassin!

550
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,960
Besides,

551
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,600
there was only the defendant's fingerprint on the gun.

552
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,410
-It can surely prove that the pistol belongs to the defendant only. -Bailiff. Bailiff.

553
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,950
Pull him out.

554
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,480
Yes sir.

555
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,620
I'm not qualified to be a lawyer?

556
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,710
Are you qualified to be a Chinese?

557
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,100
How dare you tie me up?

558
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,340
Let go of me!

559
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,050
What are you doing here?

560
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,710
Leave.

561
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,670
But

562
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,160
it doesn't matter how Xu Huaichang died.

563
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,720
There's one more thing

564
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,400
you might want to know about the Xu family.

565
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,250
By the way,

566
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,740
there's a person on this train

567
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
who has relations with the Xu family.

568
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,490
Who?

569
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,630
Princess Rong Xiang.

570
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,420
She's Madam Xu's godmother.

571
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,990
There's something strange.

572
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,840
What is it?

573
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,580
Master Luo was killed right after that.

574
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,170
I don’t think it’s a coincidence.

575
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,250
So I looked into it.

576
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,410
Help me investigate a few people.

577
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,130
The background of these teachers in the girls' school.

578
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,550
I've investigated

579
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,580
Li Pei.

580
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Situ asked me to do something for him.

581
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,960
I have to go out in a hurry.

582
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,090
What is it?

583
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,810
To find someone.

584
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,650
Did you send Liu and the others to Daoli?

585
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,640
Yes.

586
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,450
Do you know it was a kidnapping?

587
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,730
Of course I know.

588
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,860
You know it was a kidnapping,

589
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,730
and yet you ordered a hunt near the kidnapper.

590
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,490
If you can't be helpful,

591
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,790
please don't help at all.

592
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,150
I'm not helpful.

593
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,900
I'm just nosy.

594
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,710
Mr. Luo.

595
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,180
Mr. Luo is angry too.

596
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,590
Qiming.

597
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,590
Situ.

598
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,850
I found something.

599
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,810
I don't know if it's useful.

600
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,520
Take a look later.

601
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,610
It's pretty much what Mr. Luo said.

602
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,080
Mrs. Feng seldom went out.

603
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,040
Every time the neighbors saw her, it was usually Wednesday.

604
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,970
As for Mr. Feng, no one had seen him.

605
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,770
Do you have any specific description

606
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,990
of Mrs. Feng?

607
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,110
I drew a portrait.

608
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,020
Has Lawyer Shen's body been dissected?

609
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,510
You have to ask Dr. Fang.

610
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,480
It's his job.

611
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,390
Fang Jianqi?

612
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,340
Okay.

613
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:50,970
Let's go.

614
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:53,930
Where are we going?

615
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,890
To see Dr. Fang.

616
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,590
Hold it for me.

617
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,330
I have nothing to do with Jingxuan's disappearance.

618
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,960
You have fallen into X's trap.

619
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,760
X's trap?

620
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,100
You are X!

621
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,960
If you shoot,

622
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,660
you'll be the third person.

623
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,170
If you don't go with me,

624
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,170
you'll be the third person.

625
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,880
I never thought

626
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,500
I couldn't beat you.

627
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,540
You lose

628
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,380
because you want to win too badly.

629
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,580
If it weren't for this gamble,

630
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,510
I would have never suspected you.

631
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,120
Fine.

632
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,720
You two worked together

633
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,450
to set me up.

634
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,570
Don't say that.

635
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,700
We wanted to set up the X.

636
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,170
The gun Mr. Luo gave me

637
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,060
must be broken.

638
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,960
Situ said

639
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,660
you won't shoot.

640
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,130
So the gun is very safe with you.

641
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,510
If I gave you a fake one,

642
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,290
we might have been exposed.

643
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,700
Situ Yan,

644
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,130
don't ever think you know someone very well.

645
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,140
Of course I'll shoot.

646
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,050
It depends.

647
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,900
Why are you so stupid?

648
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,190
Why are you so stupid?

649
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,730
Why are you using yourself as a bait?

650
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,740
It doesn't matter

651
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,670
if we can't catch him.

652
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,460
What should I do if you die?

653
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,240
Have you ever thought

654
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,570
what should I do if you die?

655
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,260
Do you really care?

656
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,560
If you really care,

657
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,290
you wouldn't have kept it from me since the beginning.

658
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,990
All this time,

659
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,610
I'm just

660
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,080
a suspect to you.

661
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,340
Even now,

662
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,050
you haven't completely dispelled your suspicion of me.

663
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,940
Because only in this way,

664
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,720
even if I die,

665
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,770
you won’t be so sad.

666
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,460
Luo Shaochuan will tell you later

667
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,130
that I’m the X.

668
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,970
And you will forget me.

669
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,570
You lose.

670
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,140
Didn't I tell you three people will die here?

671
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,230
I won't lose.

672
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,110
The mask you gave me is quite good.

673
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,020
Do I look wonderful now?

674
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,989
You're all dressed up.

675
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,670
Are you going to steal Jingxuan's thunder?

676
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,370
I didn't know you have a glib tongue.

677
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,980
I'm just telling the truth.

678
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,670
Fine.

679
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,889
I'll go change.

680
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,020
It's almost time.

681
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:47,830
Don't go change.

682
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,810
What's the rush?

683
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,080
I'll take the telegram first.

684
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,620
You can come with Madam later.

685
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,050
A telegram from Fengtian?

686
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:55,840
Zhang sent it.

687
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,880
Li Yuanpu was strangled in the prison.

688
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,530
The killer was hired.

689
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,380
The man who hired him

690
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,470
is over 20 years old.

691
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,770
He looks gentle,

692
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,170
wears black-rimmed glasses.

693
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,520
Do you have any clue?

694
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,940
Jin Qiming.

695
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,070
Why did Jin Qiming kill Li Yuanpu?

696
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,400
There will be three more murders.

697
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,980
If we can stop him

698
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,610
before the third murder,

699
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,690
you'll win.

700
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,950
But you will also be dead.

701
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,270
Why is he so sure that he can kill me?

702
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,740
I don't know.

703
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:17,900
-You're here. -Madam.

704
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:18,980
Where is Zhou Mowan?

705
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,180
I don’t know.

706
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,310
Shouldn't she have come with you?

707
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,210
What's wrong?

708
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,160
Why aren't you helping?

709
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm looking for Zhou Mowan.

710
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,190
You can't be apart for one minute?

711
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,430
She works for the Oracle.

712
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,030
Where are you going?

713
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,530
Something came up.

714
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,690
Why is he leaving?

715
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,290
How would I know?

716
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,730
Go ask him. Hurry.

717
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,050
Are you running away again?

718
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm not.

719
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,370
We'll get engaged next time.

720
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,810
When will be the next time?

721
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,010
The dishes will get cold.

722
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,780
We can order another table if the dishes get cold.

723
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,330
We'll treat those people again if they leave.

724
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,670
This case is tricky.

725
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,730
Situ can't handle it.

726
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,750
We didn't get engaged last time.

727
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,710
Now you're leaving me again.

728
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,200
How should we get engaged next time?

729
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,670
Then we won't.

730
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,490
We'll get married.

731
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,420
Why did you come with me?

732
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,760
Go back and get engaged.

733
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,330
How can I get engaged

734
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,170
when you are having such a big problem?

735
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,760
Are you saying that Jin Qiming killed Li Yuanpu?

736
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,660
Is Jin Qiming making mischief?

737
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,470
When I was at Dr. Fang’s house,

738
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,180
I asked Zhou Mowan to find Jingxuan and your aunt.

739
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,840
She hid herself when she saw Jin Qiming coming.

740
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,130
What's wrong with that?

741
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,970
If she didn't know Jin Qiming was the X,

742
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,020
why would she hide?

743
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,930
It's too farfetched.

744
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,400
Du Heng killed Zhao Qiansun

745
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,210
and took the jewelry as his own.

746
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,520
He didn't hand in everything.

747
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,570
Oracle found out.

748
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,480
So?

749
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,010
Jin Qiming has never seen those jewels.

750
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,330
How could he know how much there was?

751
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,510
I sounded her out.

752
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,490
I think,

753
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,440
if she works for the Oracle,

754
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,210
she would desperately

755
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,510
make people suspect you.

756
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,940
But she didn't.

757
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,310
She always changed the subject.

758
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,720
Maybe this is the murderer’s purpose.

759
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,450
He wants you to suspect Luo Shaochuan.

760
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,340
[Thank you for your gift.]

761
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,170
We are good,

762
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,060
they are better.

763
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,730
Why did you let Situ Yan live?

764
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,900
Did you become emotionally involved?

765
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,570
The superiors ordered me

766
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,420
to keep Situ Yan alive.

767
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,210
He will be useful in the future.

768
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,260
I hope you're not deluding yourself.

769
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,080
Where am I going next?

770
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,760
Beijing.

771
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,180
Put it on for me.

772
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,200
Okay.

773
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,260
I'll draw it for you.

774
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,150
On one condition.

775
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,680
What is it?

776
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,630
I haven't decided yet.

777
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,080
When I've made up my mind,

778
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,260
no matter what it is,

779
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,130
you have to satisfy me.

780
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,580
-Even if... -I promise.

781
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,400
Mowan.

782
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,470
If we can

783
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,080
both get out alive this time...

784
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,610
Never mind.

785
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,390
Let's survive first.

786
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,550
Sure.

787
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,090
You don't even know what I'm going to say.

788
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,240
Anything you want.

789
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,900
Beijing.

790
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,760
Are you really going back to Beijing?

791
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,860
Wang asked me to go back.

792
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,070
I think something came up.

793
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,930
Are you going to find Zhou Mowan?

794
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,840
They can't stay in Harbin.

795
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,130
They should have gone to Beijing.

796
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,100
Fine.

797
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,770
Since you're leaving,

798
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,990
I won't keep you.

799
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,390
When you were coming to Harbin,

800
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,140
I brought you to the train.

801
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,330
Now you're leaving,

802
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,520
I'm here to see you off.

803
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,790
Orient Express again.

804
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,460
First-class carriage.

805
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,390
I will gladly take it this time.

806
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,040
Come to Beijing when you have time.

807
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,570
Situ,

808
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,740
have a safe journey.

809
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,840
Take care of yourself.

810
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,600
Remember,

811
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,740
you'll always have a home in Harbin.
