1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,280
Being capable is one thing.

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,080
But it's another thing

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,479
to make people trust you.

5
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,920
In this situation,

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,720
the police let you get involved

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,039
because of Mr. Luo.

8
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,880
They can bear it for you

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,000
investigating.

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,640
But if you want to say something,

11
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,960
and make some comments on them,

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
they would jump up and scold you.

13
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,880
Then they will kick you out.

14
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,440
I think we should wait.

15
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,720
When they can't find the truth

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,760
and be fooled by the murderer,

17
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,200
you show up like a superhero.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,280
By then,

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,800
no matter what you want,

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,199
they can only be at your service.

21
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,720
Right?

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,480
You're pretty smart as a journalist.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,760
I like you.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,440
No.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
You spoke for five minutes.

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,960
Only three seconds for the business.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
More than one people died in the music classroom.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm describing the crime environment.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,600
It's very important.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,600
Jingxuan,

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,880
cover you ears

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,800
if you are scared.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,040
This is a rumor from our school.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,800
You're a police officer.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,440
Let me tell you.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,320
There is no groundless rumor in this world.

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,760
That female student

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
wore a red ribbon, a red dress

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,400
and red heels.

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,520
The place she hung herself

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
was right above

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
where Lin Jin died.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
Next,

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm going to tell you

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,640
another weird thing in your music classroom.

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
Go.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Stop. Stop.

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Ms. Lin.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,840
What now?

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,120
Ms. Lin.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm not feeling well.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,280
Can I take a leave and go back to rest?

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,040
Cut it off.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,040
Don't pretend to be sick like a weak princess.

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,680
How could you ask for a leave

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,920
when you play it so terribly?

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,240
Sit down.

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Don't try to fool me

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,960
with your little tricks.

60
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,480
Listen carefully.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,720
No one can take leave.

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,920
You can't rest

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,800
until you play it well.

64
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,320
That night,

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,240
Lin Jie didn't believe it

66
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,320
and even kept the girls in detention.

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,640
You are beautiful

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,160
and stupid.

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,200
How many times have I told you?

70
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,120
Don't only use your hands to practice.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,520
After that,

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,320
Lin Jie sent her back to the dorm

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,720
and had a fight with the dorm supervisor.

74
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,280
What happened?

75
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,320
She has fainted.

76
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Fainted?

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,440
You don't look like a music teacher.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,040
You're just a dorm supervisor.

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,840
Mind your own business.

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,800
It has nothing to do with you.

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm the dorm supervisor.

82
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,960
You send these girls back

83
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
at midnight everyday.

84
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,880
Now she is like this.

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,960
Of course it's my business.

86
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,640
Enough.

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Stop arguing.

88
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,400
What time is it now?

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,360
What time?

90
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
Ask her.

91
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
She sends these girls back

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,960
at midnight.

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,200
Look, she has fainted.

94
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,400
It's ridiculous.

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,360
Do you think learning music

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
is that easy?

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
She'll be fine after a sleep.

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
Don't make a fuss.

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,600
You two take her to the room.

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,560
Come to me

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
if you need anything.

102
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,520
Yes, principal.

103
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Be careful.

104
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,720
Principal.

105
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,880
Are you going to do nothing about Lin Jie?

106
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,160
These girls are delicate

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,320
and they are all from rich families.

108
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,640
They can't bear it.

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,840
Enough.

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
She was recruited by Luo Jinyan.

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,159
There's nothing I can do.

112
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,920
Hurry.

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,840
Lock the door.

114
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,800
Although we should respect the deceased,

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,440
I have to say,

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,159
your colleague

117
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,000
was not popular, right?

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,800
I might know something

119
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
about this women's school case.

120
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,600
The school's music classroom is haunted.

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,560
It's an old story in Harbin.

122
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,040
It is said that seven or eight years ago,

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,200
a girl hung herself

124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,520
in the music classroom.

125
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,120
Since then,

126
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,080
there is a rumor that the school is haunted.

127
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,960
This classroom is old

128
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,720
and dim.

129
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
I heard there is women's crying

130
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,280
at night.

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
Why did she commit suicide?

132
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
I don't know.

133
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
The school suppressed the news.

134
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Her parents let it go.

135
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,760
Nonsense.

136
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,320
Girls who could go to this school

137
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,360
are all from

138
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
rich and powerful families.

139
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
That girl hung herself.

140
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,280
How could her parents just let it go?

141
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,560
I heard that the school had a powerful supporter.

142
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,400
I'd like to see

143
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,800
how powerful they are

144
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,760
to kill a girl in broad daylight?

145
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,360
Get to the point.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,520
Go on.

147
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
What's wrong?

148
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,200
Hurry.

149
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,880
Come with me to the music classroom.

150
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,520
Hurry up.

151
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,400
Did you hear something in the classroom?

152
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
Yes, there was a light just now.

153
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
Who's inside?

154
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,600
Be careful, principal.

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,840
I'm fine.

156
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
Be careful.

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,280
Slow down.

158
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
The door is open.

159
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,520
Lin Jie.

160
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,520
Is that Ms. Lin?

161
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Ms. Lin.

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Ms. Lin.

163
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,040
Ms. Lin.

164
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,480
After that,

165
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,240
we gathered teachers and students

166
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,880
for questioning.

167
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,000
They said...

168
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,720
You weren't at school last night.

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,679
Then

170
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,200
you don't have time to commit the crime.

171
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,320
You suspect I killed her?

172
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm the principal.

173
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,360
I killed my teacher

174
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,760
in my school?

175
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,560
Why did I do that?

176
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,560
I just want you to tell me

177
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,480
what you were doing at the time of the murder.

178
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,520
Don't waste your time on me.

179
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,920
You won't tell me?

180
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,960
Fine.

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,080
Then explain

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,600
why the school is haunted.

183
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Haunted?

184
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,280
We were like this when we were in school.

185
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,040
We liked to make up stories

186
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,520
and spread it.

187
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,600
Why?

188
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,120
Just for fun.

189
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,200
Do you police believe that?

190
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,280
I don't think we can count on you.

191
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,400
I'm not your student.

192
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
What I should believe

193
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,000
or what I shouldn't believe

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,160
is not what you could teach me.

195
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,960
My name is Li Pei.

196
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,440
I teach Mandarin.

197
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
I've been teaching here for seven years.

198
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,640
What were you doing

199
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,840
at 2 p.m. last night?

200
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,640
I was preparing for class.

201
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,360
At 2 p.m.?

202
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
I took a year off.

203
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,800
I suddenly came back to teach the kids

204
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,920
and I couldn't keep up.

205
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
I remember

206
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
Lin Jie was quarreling with the dorm supervisor.

207
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,240
They often quarrel.

208
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
I didn't care much.

209
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,120
Have you heard that

210
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,160
the school is haunted?

211
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,320
Yes.

212
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
It's groundless.

213
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
People talk it more in this semester.

214
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,080
Maybe it's because of Lin Jie.

215
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,320
Wasn't Lin Jie a new teacher this semester?

216
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,280
Yes.

217
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,040
But the students

218
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,320
don't like her classes.

219
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,200
So they spread

220
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,440
the story

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,080
all over the school.

222
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,280
Name?

223
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,800
Zhao Qiansun.

224
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,000
On the night of the murder,

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,360
I wasn't at school.

226
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,360
I don't care.

227
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,600
What were you doing at 2 p.m. last night?

228
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,360
Tell me.

229
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
I was not at school.

230
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,200
Do I have to tell?

231
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
Our school got the record

232
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,680
for people coming and going.

233
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,960
I don't think it's necessary.

234
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,880
Hui.

235
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,960
Hui, Hui, Huifangli.

236
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,960
I saw it.

237
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,800
The ghost killed her.

238
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
She was in the music classroom.

239
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,000
She was looking for someone to pay with her life.

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,880
If anyone was still in the music classroom

241
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
after 12 o'clock at night,

242
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,120
she would...

243
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,160
she would stand

244
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,120
behind you.

245
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,560
Liu.

246
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,800
Take her away.

247
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,400
Excuse me.

248
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,600
Please cooperate.

249
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,040
Behind you.

250
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,080
Why are these teachers

251
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,960
so weird?

252
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,800
I fell asleep

253
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
at the time of murder.

254
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,040
I don't have an alibi.

255
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,320
Xia Ru'an.

256
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,760
Principal's secretary.

257
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,160
You still remember me?

258
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,480
Of course.

259
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,480
There's nothing weird about the students.

260
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,400
They live in the dorm

261
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,720
and can prove it to each other.

262
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,760
As for the teachers,

263
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,640
Principal Fan Lihua

264
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,080
and Auntie Lan

265
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,640
both have an alibi.

266
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,760
The rest...

267
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
The rest of the teachers have time to commit the crime.

268
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,080
That's all for now.

269
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,480
Are you done?

270
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,880
You used the time of two people.

271
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Five minutes left.

272
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,120
I told you.

273
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,200
Shen Huatang's daughter

274
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
was kidnapped this morning.

275
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,440
They received a letter from the kidnapper

276
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,160
saying they'll kill her if they don't get the money tomorrow.

277
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,440
That's it?

278
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,800
Okay.

279
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,320
Find the girl first.

280
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
You don't look for the ghost?

281
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,200
She has a point.

282
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,160
And it's a matter of life and death.

283
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,840
I can't just let her die.

284
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,920
Besides,

285
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,280
I don't care about the ghost and stuff.

286
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,080
It's none of my business.

287
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
And there is nothing I can do.

288
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,080
The ghost is just bluffing.

289
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,440
I think it's just a cover-up.

290
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,640
I don't believe there's a ghost.

291
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,320
Shut up.

292
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,280
Miss Zhou is right.

293
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,880
As long as you know the tricks inside,

294
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,720
that case is very simple.

295
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,760
If you can't find out the truth,

296
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,280
it means you're not suitable to be a cop.

297
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,240
Everyone is against me.

298
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,200
Situ Yan,

299
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,120
I think you are the kind of guy who chooses a girl over his friend.

300
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,480
You are so ungrateful.

301
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
You're not going?

302
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
Fine.

303
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
I'll go by myself.

304
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,200
I'll find that female ghost

305
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
and get her to you.

306
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,120
Where are you going?

307
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,880
The police station will be off work soon.

308
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,000
Get someone to catch the ghost.

309
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,320
Jingxuan,

310
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,520
do you want to stay

311
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,800
and have a dinner with them?

312
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,840
Please enjoy.

313
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,640
Thank you.

314
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,280
At around 10 a.m. yesterday,

315
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,000
Shen Huatang went to Matsuura Firm in the Dori.

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,760
Her servant took her daughter

317
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,160
to take a walk in the park.

318
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,400
During that time, someone asked this servant for directions.

319
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,560
A moment later,

320
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,920
the child disappeared.

321
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,240
The servant was looking for her in the park.

322
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
Many people around her saw it.

323
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
But no one saw

324
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
what this kidnapper looked like.

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,880
However,

326
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,040
they received a blackmail letter soon.

327
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,200
How old is the child?

328
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,800
Five years old.

329
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,360
How much is the ransom?

330
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
500 yuan.

331
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,760
They asked Shen Huatang

332
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
to mail 50 notes

333
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
to Songjiang Hotel

334
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,440
by the registered letter

335
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
to Mr. Sato.

336
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,160
The kidnapper made such an effort

337
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,200
to kidnap a bank's granddaughter

338
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,360
just for 500 yuan.

339
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,440
Actually, this is not a small sum of money.

340
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,800
It's enough for an ordinary family to spend a year.

341
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,040
And I think

342
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,920
the kidnapper doesn't want to make a big deal out of it

343
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,720
and just wants Mr. Yu to settle it with some money.

344
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,640
After all, Shen Huatang is unmarried.

345
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,640
Her daughter

346
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,920
could be an illegitimate daughter.

347
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,240
Did she tell you who the father is?

348
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
No.

349
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,240
I don't think she wants to tell us.

350
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,760
So I didn't ask further.

351
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,760
The owner of Zhongji Bank is surnamed Yu.

352
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,160
How come is his daughter surnamed Shen?

353
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,240
You are not from Harbin, right?

354
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,400
No, I just came here this month.

355
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,000
Seven years ago,

356
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,240
Yu Dabian married Shen Huatang's mother.

357
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,280
Later, Shen Huatang's mother passed away.

358
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,120
He inherited the bank.

359
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,400
In legal relationship,

360
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,520
they are father and daughter.

361
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,560
But in fact,

362
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,400
they are not related by blood.

363
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
But Yu Dahua is very nice to Shen Huatang.

364
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,280
He treats her as his daughter.

365
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,400
Besides, he has no intention

366
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
to get married again.

367
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,840
Does Mr. Yu know about this?

368
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
Mr. Yu is not in Harbin now.

369
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
That's why Shen Huatang is so worried.

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
She couldn't get the money.

371
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,520
But

372
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,920
when Yu Daren is back,

373
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,680
for those can help her find the child,

374
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,040
she's willing to pay the 500 yuan as a reward.

375
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,760
What about the blackmail letter?

376
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,920
Did you find anything?

377
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,880
The characters were cut from

378
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,280
the newspaper.

379
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,480
Except the fingerprints of Shen Huatang and the servant,

380
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
we found nothing else.

381
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,360
And the letter

382
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
was put into Shen Huatang's mailbox.

383
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,560
It didn't be sent through the post office.

384
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
What about the servants?

385
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,600
Have you checked?

386
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
Yes.

387
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,800
Nothing suspicious.

388
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
A bank's granddaughter could be kidnapped

389
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,840
so quietly.

390
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,240
I thought there must be more than one people.

391
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,520
But actually,

392
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,320
Shen Huatang went to Matsuura Firm on a whim.

393
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
She was going to Qiulin Bank.

394
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
Qiulin Bank is in Xinshi Street.

395
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,400
Matsuura Firm is in Dori.

396
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,280
They are quite far apart.

397
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,640
It's impossible to set up

398
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,000
in advance.

399
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,880
You're quite thoughtful.

400
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,200
Which side are you on?

401
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,440
Who are you defending?

402
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,720
Do you know

403
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,680
who she is?

404
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
What if the kidnapper really kill the girl?

405
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,920
She didn't come earlier or later.

406
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,360
The women' school is haunted and she's here.

407
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,240
I think she is suspicious.

408
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,400
She made up an excuse to stall Situ Yan.

409
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,440
It has been more than a year

410
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
for the haunting stuff.

411
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,520
Why are you yelling at Jingxuan?

412
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
You sound like she's the one who brought the ghost here.

413
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
You know that too.

414
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
Of course.

415
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Is there anything I don't know

416
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,000
in Harbin?

417
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,319
I heard that

418
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,560
that female student

419
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,240
was forced to death

420
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,280
by their principal and vice principal.

421
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,079
I knew it.

422
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,240
What do you know?

423
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,760
Where are you going?

424
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,560
Doing my thing.

425
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,319
I saw you here.

426
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,560
Have a taste.

427
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,960
This is the dish I've been preparing recently.

428
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,680
What is this?

429
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,320
Bean juice.

430
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,200
How is it?

431
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,960
Isn't it special?

432
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,360
It tastes weird.

433
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,280
This is made of

434
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,880
mung bean.

435
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,080
People made it by filtering out the starch

436
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,600
and fermenting it with the remaining materials.

437
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,480
In Beijing,

438
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
a bowl of bean juice

439
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,760
and some delicate pickles

440
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,800
are a good start of the day.

441
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,640
You are an expert.

442
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Go get a bowl of bean juice

443
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,320
for Mr. Situ.

444
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,960
Get some pickles.

445
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,560
Okay. The spoon for bean juice

446
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
is in the second bowl on the left.

447
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,720
Put it back

448
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,520
after use.

449
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,440
Okay.

450
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,080
Do you have a handkerchief?

451
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,960
Don't get me wrong.

452
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,600
Personal habit.

453
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
You two are really the same.

454
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,280
The rags in the kitchen are all white.

455
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,640
One is to wash the pot, another is to wash the dishes and the third one is to wipe the stove.

456
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,400
They are placed separately.

457
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,600
One time, I mixed them up.

458
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,640
I thought

459
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
they were all white.

460
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,880
People can't see it, right?

461
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,640
The boss was furious

462
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,160
and exploded.

463
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
He kept scolding me all afternoon.

464
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,680
The rag for the dishes is different from

465
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,520
the one for the stove.

466
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,080
We are running a restaurant.

467
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,400
If you mix them up,

468
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
how do we serve the food?

469
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,560
We both

470
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,640
know that

471
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,200
Right?

472
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,760
Isn't he a weirdo?

473
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,320
It's better to be careful.

474
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
But your bean juice

475
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,040
doesn't taste right.

476
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Right?

477
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,000
I always feel

478
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,240
it tastes different.

479
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,800
I don't know what the difference is.

480
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,280
It must be the beans.

481
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,560
The bean juice usually

482
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,160
uses mung beans.

483
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,600
This kind of mung bean is not bright,

484
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,840
but it contains a lot of starch.

485
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,800
It's easy to get mushy.

486
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,400
This

487
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,880
is made of the ordinary beans.

488
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,320
It's suitable for making bean sprouts.

489
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,440
That's the problem.

490
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
It must be He.

491
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,920
He is good at making pickled cabbage.

492
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,800
But his beans

493
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,040
are not good.

494
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,960
He?

495
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,880
He?

496
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,720
He lives in No. 52 yard on the South 6th Street.

497
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,360
He?

498
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,040
48?

499
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,840
He is my neighbor.

500
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,560
You're in bad luck.

501
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,560
When spring comes,

502
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,320
he will make

503
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,600
a lot of trouble.

504
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,920
It's getting late.

505
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,720
Pack me two dishes.

506
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,400
I will take these to go.

507
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Okay.

508
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,040
Open the door.

509
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,240
Come in.

510
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,640
If they keep investigating,

511
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,520
that case

512
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,920
will be exposed.

513
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,960
What are you afraid of?

514
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,600
When that case happened,

515
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,040
Lin Jie didn't come.

516
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,720
Besides,

517
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,080
if the police could relate this case

518
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
to the girl who committed suicide,

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
they will look incompetent.

520
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,000
We can't gamble it

521
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
with the reputation of our school.

522
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,120
Don't let the police

523
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,240
to investigate that girl.

524
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,680
Fan Lihua.

525
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,680
That girl committed suicide.

526
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,280
You are so scared.

527
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,360
Did you

528
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,640
force her to die?

529
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

530
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,640
Look at you.

531
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,040
Why are you so scared?

532
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,240
You don't look like

533
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,960
a principal.

534
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,960
When I have a PE class,

535
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,000
go to class.

536
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Alright.

537
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,400
Now,

538
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,640
it's not the time to worry about those useless police.

539
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,200
We need to think about

540
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
how to deal with those parents.

541
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,240
Where is Mr. Luo?

542
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,960
I wanted

543
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,040
to cook a meal for you.

544
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,960
Madam,

545
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,560
you've been busy during this time.

546
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,200
You need to have a rest.

547
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,120
Otherwise, you will be too tired.

548
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,680
You're staying.

549
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,160
I don't feel tired.

550
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,000
All right.

551
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,720
Don't worry about me.

552
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,960
Have you found the girl?

553
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,880
Not yet.

554
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,160
Let's go to the scene.

555
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,800
If I have to see something,

556
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,840
I want to meet the person involved first.

557
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,080
I hope you can understand.

558
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,160
Shen Huatang is unmarried woman.

559
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,360
She doesn't want to see anyone.

560
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,240
She asked me

561
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,480
to handle it for her.

562
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,360
So,

563
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
if you have any questions,

564
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
you can ask me first.

565
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,520
Bad news!

566
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,000
What are you doing here?

567
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,680
Get out.

568
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,880
Something happened.

569
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,680
The policeman surnamed Luo

570
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,600
brought a group of people

571
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,280
to perform rituals in our school.

572
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,880
He said he wanted to comfort the ghost.

573
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,080
Dance.

574
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,400
Bring out

575
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,360
those evil spirits!

576
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,560
Stop dancing.

577
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,320
What are you doing here?

578
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,760
Solving a case.

579
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
You're holding a rattle drum.

580
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,240
You call this solving a case?

581
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,280
The police station raises a bunch of losers.

582
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,920
Solve the case if you could.

583
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,480
If you could not,

584
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,040
stop playing tricks.

585
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,480
Get lost!

586
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,800
I paid them.

587
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,960
How can you stop them?

588
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,680
Keep dancing.

589
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,040
How dare you?

590
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,840
Stop dancing.

591
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,720
What are these?

592
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,680
What are these?

593
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,600
Stop.

594
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,800
Stop dancing.

595
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,480
Stop dancing.

596
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,320
Let's go over now.

597
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,240
You've checked everything.

598
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,480
I'm not a professional detective.

599
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,000
What if the murderer

600
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,240
left any trails

601
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,480
that I didn't see?

602
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,080
Like what?

603
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,040
Like

604
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,360
the murderer's footprints.

605
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,600
The marks

606
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,000
when the child was taken away.

607
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,640
Anyway,

608
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,680
there are trails everywhere.

609
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,280
You're a professional detective.

610
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
You don't need me to teach you that, do you?

611
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,120
This is my first day as a detective.

612
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,640
Are you serious?

613
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,760
Mowan.

614
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,600
He is joking.

615
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,920
I never solve the case

616
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,960
by clues.

617
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,000
But these are the fundamentals of solving the case.

618
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,560
What else can you rely on?

619
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,760
Fortune telling?

620
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,040
Unique solution.

621
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Unique solution?

622
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,880
Are you solving a linear equation?

623
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,840
In my opinion,

624
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,160
finding the truth

625
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,960
is like playing jigsaw puzzle.

626
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,320
The information in each person's hand

627
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,840
is like a piece of the puzzle.

628
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,880
There are tens of thousands of pieces.

629
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,680
But there is only one way

630
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,400
to put them together.

631
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
I think you are lazy.

632
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,400
You even made up such nonsense.

633
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,000
Madam,

634
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,240
go to bed early after dinner.

635
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,280
We'll talk in the study.

636
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,840
Go away.

637
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,760
Get lost!

638
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,800
Get out of school.

639
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,040
Don't look back.

640
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,920
Get out!

641
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,880
Get out!

642
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Get out!

643
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,960
Get out!

644
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,160
Get out! Get out!

645
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,960
Alright.

646
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,960
Inspector Luo.

647
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,800
This is the school.

648
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,240
You can't do this.

649
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,080
When I ask you,

650
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,560
you all keep shut.

651
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,280
Is there a female ghost?

652
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,840
We are expelling it for you.

653
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,240
Even if there is a female ghost,

654
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,720
she wouldn't kill Lin Jie.

655
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Lin Jie was a new teacher.

656
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,160
She was a new teacher.

657
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,440
Who should be killed by the ghost?

658
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,040
Is it the principal or the vice principal?

659
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,920
Why can't you stop?

660
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,960
Why can't you stop?

661
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,320
Principal Luo.

662
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm here.

663
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,360
I'm here.

664
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,760
I'm here.

665
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,240
Inspector Luo,

666
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,840
what you said is wrong.

667
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,720
Let go of me!

668
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,440
Principal Luo.

669
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,760
I'm here.

670
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,280
Hello, teachers.

671
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,080
Mr. Luo is eager to solve the case.

672
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,400
So,

673
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,920
although the method is simple and crude,

674
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
he, he has a good heart.

675
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,400
He has a good heart.

676
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,880
You know?

677
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,840
So please forgive him.

678
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,440
Please forgive him.

679
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,560
We'll leave right away.

680
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,320
Let's go.

681
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,240
Let them go now!

682
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,600
Let's go.

683
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,200
I paid.

684
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,080
Why should they go?

685
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,880
Mr. Bao, look.

686
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
That is the subordinate you have?

687
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,480
No.

688
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,240
Take him and get lost.

689
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,800
Principal!

690
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Calm down.

691
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Stop causing me trouble.

692
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,600
Hurry up.

693
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,080
Come with me.

694
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,880
Go! Go!

695
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,200
Take them all away!

696
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,120
Get out!

697
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,280
Principals,

698
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,560
we will go back and discuss it.

699
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,400
Don't be angry.

700
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,040
Please don't mind.

701
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,680
Go. Go.

702
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,840
Hurry up. Go.

703
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,520
Who are you?

704
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,400
A bunch of losers.

705
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,560
We can't offend them too much.

706
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,440
This is bad for our school.

707
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,040
You are too weak.

708
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,880
Principal Fan.

709
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,680
Principal Fan.

710
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,480
Although the ghost didn't kill Lin Jie,

711
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
it's not bad

712
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,840
to call her out.

713
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,480
What if she knows something?

714
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,080
Right?

715
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,600
Why don't we look for her together?

716
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Maybe

717
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,120
she has something to tell us.

718
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
Don't make trouble.

719
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,200
From now on,

720
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,760
don't talk about this anymore.

721
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
Seal the music classroom.

722
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,440
No one will get in

723
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
without my permission.

724
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Not even the police.

725
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,680
Now I understand.

726
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,920
You're just like Luo.

727
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,400
He's hunting ghosts outside

728
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
and you're telling fortune at home.

729
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,480
What a perfect match!

730
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,440
Let me tell you.

731
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
If you just want money

732
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,080
and wait for it,

733
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,800
you bark on the wrong tree.

734
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,360
If you can't solve this case,

735
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,160
tell me as soon as possible.

736
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,800
So that I can find someone reliable.

737
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,880
I don't need you to pay me.

738
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,760
What do you mean?

739
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,800
I'll help you find the girl.

740
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,160
You help me solve the ghost case.

741
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,880
I don't know how to solve cases.

742
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,800
You don't have to know.

743
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
Come on.

744
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,240
Can you let me know

745
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,920
next time you make a fuss?

746
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,680
If you were a little late,

747
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,440
I would have solved the case.

748
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,680
Can't you see they're guilty?

749
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,480
Luckily I came there as soon as possible.

750
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,600
If I were a little late,

751
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,960
I wouldn't have to

752
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,200
work tomorrow.

753
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,560
You're really unbelievable.

754
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,200
I was playing mahjong at the director's house.

755
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
I had a complete sequence

756
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,720
and almost won.

757
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,920
The chief called me

758
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
and asked me to go there.

759
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,160
Can't you just

760
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,080
let me retire

761
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,400
in peace?

762
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,320
It's just a Women's Normal University.

763
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,400
Just?

764
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,200
You really know nothing.

765
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,760
Do you know how many officers' wives

766
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,320
graduated from that school?

767
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,680
You don't care

768
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,080
and you are not afraid of offending others.

769
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,920
But there are lots of men

770
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,200
working and running errands

771
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
rely on that.

772
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,320
Fine.

773
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
I won't offend this school.

774
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,560
I only catch Luo Jinyan, okay?

775
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,600
Especially that Luo Jinyan.

776
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,760
You can't touch her.

777
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,320
She has so many strings.

778
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,480
If you arrest her today,

779
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
I will be stripped

780
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,520
tomorrow.

781
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,480
Believe it or not.

782
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,440
I was solving a case

783
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,760
and she was putting me off.

784
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,480
I was questioning

785
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,600
and she was talking nonsense.

786
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,200
I went there today

787
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,280
and she refused to cooperate.

788
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,880
I think

789
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,000
she is the murderer.

790
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,520
Why can't I arrest her?

791
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,560
You can.

792
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,400
Just show me the evidence.

793
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,280
If you have evidence,

794
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,600
I'll dig out the ground

795
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,680
and bring her to you

796
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,720
as you like.

797
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,720
If I have evidence,

798
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,760
I won't let her go.

799
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,440
Look how she scratched me.

800
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,280
Look.

801
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,960
It's the scratch.

802
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,960
It's not the evidence.

803
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,880
Do you have evidence?

804
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,520
Do you?

805
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,600
If not,

806
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,960
stop messing around.

807
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Or you can go

808
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,440
and talk to the chief directly.

809
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,880
The vice principal of a women's school

810
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,360
is bossing us around.

811
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,760
And we can do nothing about it.

812
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,280
The police

813
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,720
is nothing.

814
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,400
Isn't this a ready-made way

815
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,120
right in front of you?

816
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,640
You're done playing.

817
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,840
You've vented your anger.

818
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,000
Why don't you ask some advice

819
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,280
from your friend, Situ Yan?

820
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,760
You think I'm playing?

821
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm a police officer.

822
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
Why can't I solve the case?

823
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,000
Fine.

824
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,680
You're not playing.

825
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,120
You are solving the case.

826
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,680
Fine.

827
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,160
Go back to your business.

828
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,560
I have to go back to the director now.

829
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,080
They are waiting for me.

830
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,480
I need to do my business.

831
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,120
I didn't win

832
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,000
the complete sequence.

833
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,280
Don't make trouble.

834
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,000
I don't believe I can't solve the case

835
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,480
without Situ Yan.

836
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,280
You said she went to Matsuura Firm?

837
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,000
Yes.

838
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,440
The child was lost in the Street Park.

839
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,880
Yes.

840
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,840
I remember the kidnapper asked them

841
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,600
to take the money to Songjiang Hotel.

842
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,960
It's near this area, right?

843
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,120
Songjiang Hotel

844
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,560
is right here.

845
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,280
Have you been there?

846
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,840
Yes.

847
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,800
And I've investigated

848
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,600
Mr. Sato.

849
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,160
Hello.

850
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,160
How can I help you?

851
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,200
Hello.

852
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm looking for someone.

853
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,520
Who are you looking for?

854
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,040
Mr. Sato.

855
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,000
Sato?

856
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,880
Which Sato?

857
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,760
I don't know.

858
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,360
My boss

859
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,960
asked me to find Mr. Sato

860
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,680
to get a document.

861
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,160
There are three Mr. Satos

862
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,320
living here.

863
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,080
Who are you looking for?

864
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,720
Please follow me.

865
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,360
Three?

866
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,600
It should be the one

867
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,640
who speaks fluent Chinese.

868
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,120
Mr. Satos who live here

869
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,800
are all not good in Chinese.

870
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,840
My boss wrote him a letter,

871
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,280
but he didn't reply.

872
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,680
I looked over there just now.

873
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,200
The letter is not on the shelf.

874
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
He must have taken it.

875
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,480
Please help me look for

876
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,680
the one who left here recently,

877
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,240
or the one who just booked the room.

878
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,520
Is there anyone named Sato?

879
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,880
The letters we received

880
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,040
will be put on the shelf for guests to take.

881
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,800
If no one takes it for a long time,

882
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,280
we will return the letter to the post office.

883
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,960
Please tell your boss to wait.

884
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
Okay, thank you.

885
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,560
Hello.

886
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,080
These three Mr. Satos

887
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,560
don't look like a kidnapper.

888
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,360
Also,

889
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,200
the shelf

890
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,360
is quite hidden.

891
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,200
It can't be seen from the reception.

892
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
So the kidnapper

893
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,920
knows Shen Huatang's movements very well.

894
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,720
And the kidnapper is familiar with this hotel.

895
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,120
Do you mean

896
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,240
it is someone of her family?

897
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,640
It was a thorough plan

898
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,560
and it should be prepared in advance.

899
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,160
Have you checked the servant?

900
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,680
I don't think it is the servant.

901
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,160
No one knew

902
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,560
she was going to Matsuura Firm

903
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,400
before she went out.

904
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,760
She planned to go to Qiulin Bank.

905
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,800
Then she went to Matsuura Firm on a whim.

906
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,360
When she arrived at the entrance of the bank,

907
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
she didn't want to bring the child.

908
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,280
So she asked the servant to take the child to the park.

909
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,560
Nice drawing.

910
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,480
Have you learned it?

911
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,880
No.

912
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,360
You are talented.

913
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,680
You are flattering.

914
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,280
I just draw casually.

915
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,800
Situ, Mowan, come here.

916
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Have some tea

917
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,360
and some nuts.

918
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,600
Thank you, Madam Shen.

919
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,680
But I can't eat anything

920
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,960
before the case is solved.

921
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,720
You need to replenish your energy.

922
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,560
Then you may find something.

923
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,760
You know me well.

924
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,280
As long as you like it.

925
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,000
The park in Dori is not peaceful lately.

926
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,800
What's wrong?

927
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,880
Two days ago,

928
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,120
I met Mrs. Sun of Jingyang Restaurant.

929
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,880
Her servant

930
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,280
went to the park to walk the dog.

931
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,360
The dog ran away.

932
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,160
She said she spent 200 yuan

933
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,080
to bring the dog back.

934
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,640
It's so expensive. What kind of the dog is?

935
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,280
A Pekingese.

936
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,520
It's a kind of palace dog.

937
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,720
It's expensive.

938
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,560
Do they often walk the dog in the park?

939
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,040
Mrs. Sun went to

940
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,320
Saint Sophia Cathedral every week.

941
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,960
It's not convenient to bring the dog in.

942
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,880
So she asked the servant

943
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,240
to walk the dog in the park.

944
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,120
The servant happened to meet someone with a child.

945
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,480
She looked at them for a moment.

946
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,560
Later,

947
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,199
someone cut the leash.

948
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,320
How did the dog come back?

949
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,880
I didn’t ask that much.

950
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,280
Where's Saint Sophia Cathedral?

951
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,520
Saint Sophia Cathedral.

952
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,960
Here.

953
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,800
Mowan.

954
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,760
Stay here tonight.

955
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,040
I heard something happened to your school.

956
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,199
It's haunted.

957
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,520
It's okay, Madam Shen.

958
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,239
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

959
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,920
Ghosts are not scary.

960
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,760
But people

961
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,600
pretending to be a ghost is scary.

962
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,400
I've cleaned up the guest room for you anyway.

963
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,760
You can chat with me.

964
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,720
I want to stay and chat with you.

965
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
But the room I lived in...

966
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm afraid Mr. Situ

967
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,760
will have to renovate it.

968
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,440
Fine.

969
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,760
I was wrong.

970
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,000
Stay here

971
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,560
and talk to Madam Shen.

972
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,520
Tomorrow morning,

973
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,360
we will go to the church.

974
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,600
For what?

975
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,000
Worshipping.

976
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,440
Mrs. Sun.

977
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,680
You are?

978
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,600
I'm Shen Jianxian's student.

979
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,880
Mrs. Shen is your friend.

980
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,200
Mrs. Sun.

981
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,600
Madam told me

982
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,280
your dog was lost recently.

983
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,640
Mrs. Shen told you about it?

984
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,360
Beibei was stolen.

985
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,000
I paid the ransom to the kidnapper.

986
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,000
What happened?

987
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,240
Do you usually bring it with you?

988
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,040
My husband is busy.

989
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,360
He doesn't have time for me.

990
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,920
My child is out of town.

991
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Beibei and I

992
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
are inseparable.

993
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,040
I only ask the servant to walk it

994
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,560
when I go to church.

995
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,800
After I go to church,

996
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,120
she'll bring it back.

997
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,440
Everything was fine before.

998
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,400
But something happened last month.

999
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,600
My baby.

1000
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,120
I miss you so much.

1001
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,600
Can you tell me

1002
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,720
how it was lost?

1003
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,800
It's all Amy's fault.

1004
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,840
I asked her

1005
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,480
to walk Beibei for a while.

1006
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,120
However,

1007
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,200
she was careless.

1008
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,680
Someone cut the leash

1009
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,120
and Beibei was taken away.

1010
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,800
The kidnapper

1011
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,400
is very arrogant.

1012
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
He even sent a blackmail letter

1013
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,720
asking me to give him 200 yuan.

1014
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,880
Or he would cook Beibei.

1015
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm sorry, Madam.

1016
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,600
It's all my fault.

1017
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,840
Just deduct the money from my salary.

1018
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,520
I'm not blaming you.

1019
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
How much money do you have

1020
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,960
as a servant?

1021
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,320
Just be more careful in the future.

1022
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,360
Why are you called Amy?

1023
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,680
Are you a foreigner?

1024
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,760
She is Chinese.

1025
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,880
She used to

1026
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,000
work for the Russian Consulate.

1027
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,640
The consul's wife

1028
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,120
gave her a nice name.

1029
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,160
It's very fashionable.

1030
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,600
What about the broken leash?

1031
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,400
I didn't throw it away.

1032
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,080
It's in the car.

1033
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,560
I keep it

1034
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,000
to remind her.

1035
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,120
Can I have a look?

1036
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,680
Go ahead.

1037
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,120
Bring the leash.

1038
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,920
There are obvious cutting marks.

1039
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,280
Mrs. Sun,

1040
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
I'm sorry

1041
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,640
for disturbing you.

1042
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,440
I'm fine.

1043
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,760
Send my greetings to Mrs. Shen.

1044
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Let her meet us when she's free.

1045
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,640
Okay.

1046
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,080
If you have any legal problems,

1047
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,600
you can come to me anytime.

1048
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,520
Okay.

1049
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,400
We should go now.

1050
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,960
It's time for my baby

1051
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,160
to eat.

1052
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,120
Mrs. Sun.

1053
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,600
Amy used to work in the Russian Consulate.

1054
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,280
Why is she working for you?

1055
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,040
Let us in!

1056
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,400
Let us in!

1057
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,640
Let us in!

1058
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,880
Clam down.

1059
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,680
Please calm down.

1060
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,000
Here's the thing.

1061
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,800
I've told the principal.

1062
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,600
When the principal comes...

1063
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,480
What's the point for the principal to come?

1064
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,600
I want to take my kid away.

1065
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,000
No.

1066
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
Now, people died in the school.

1067
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,000
My daughter is in the school.

1068
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,640
I don't know if she's in danger.

1069
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,120
Get out of the way!

1070
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,920
Let us in!

1071
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,120
I can't let you in!

1072
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,520
Listen to me.

1073
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,120
Let me finish.

1074
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,280
Let me finish.

1075
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,640
If...

1076
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,600
If there is a murderer among you

1077
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,320
and the murderer will get into the school like this.

1078
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,920
Isn't your child more dangerous?

1079
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,480
You're right.

1080
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,360
She's right.

1081
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,080
Yes.

1082
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,680
That makes sense.

1083
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,520
Yes.

1084
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,360
She is a casual worker.

1085
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,680
The consul went back to Russia

1086
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,560
and someone introduced her to me.

1087
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,120
Since she's a casual worker,

1088
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,280
why don't you find a smart one?

1089
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,400
What if she loses Beibei again?

1090
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,560
You don't know.

1091
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,120
The consul has a same dog

1092
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
like Beibei.

1093
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,720
Amy took a good care

1094
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,200
of Beibei.

1095
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,400
Besides,

1096
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,800
her family

1097
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,280
is very poor.

1098
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,240
She has a crippled sister

1099
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,680
who could only do some stitches.

1100
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,160
Her family all relies on her to make money.

1101
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,000
I thought

1102
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,120
since Beibei has been found,

1103
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,280
I'll take it as a good deed.

1104
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,960
What day does she usually take off?

1105
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,920
Wednesdays.

1106
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,920
I play mahjong with Mrs. Zhang on Wednesday.

1107
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,600
So I let her take off to visit her sister.

1108
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,320
Mrs. Sun,

1109
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,440
I have one last question.

1110
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,880
How did you pay?

1111
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,600
Did someone go over

1112
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,160
or did you send it to somewhere?

1113
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,320
200 yuan.

1114
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,880
The kidnaper asked me to send it to Star Hotel.

1115
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,920
Star Hotel?

1116
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,760
Yes.

1117
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,800
Star Hotel.

1118
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,480
But

1119
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,120
they kept their words.

1120
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,480
Once the envelop was sent out,

1121
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,520
someone carried the dog back to me at night.

1122
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,920
Didn't you go to the hotel?

1123
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,720
I did.

1124
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,160
The envelop

1125
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,840
was on the shelf.

1126
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
It was thick.

1127
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,320
But...

1128
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,720
But

1129
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
all the money inside was replaced with waste paper.

1130
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,320
Yes.

1131
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,640
How did you know

1132
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,120
the money became waster paper?

1133
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,720
I guessed it.

1134
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,920
The kidnapper took out the money

1135
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,800
and put the waste paper in,

1136
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,360
so that no one would find out

1137
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,400
the envelope was gone.

1138
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,680
You're so smart.

1139
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,640
No wonder you are Mr. Shen's student.

1140
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,280
Madam.

1141
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,440
I really have to go.

1142
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
The dog must be hungry.

1143
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,640
Let's go.

1144
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,280
Let's go eat.

1145
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,760
But now...

1146
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,640
Everything will be fine.

1147
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,240
Trust me.

1148
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,360
Please enjoy.

1149
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,240
Have you noticed Amy?

1150
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,280
Yes.

1151
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,880
Whenever we talked about losing the dog,

1152
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,240
she looked nervous.

1153
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,120
Is she afraid that Mrs. Sun will punish her?

1154
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,120
But...

1155
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,800
what does losing a child have to do with losing a dog?

1156
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,320
Can you give me...

1157
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
Don't you want this?

1158
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,520
Yes.

1159
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,160
Where is Star Hotel?

1160
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,800
Here.

1161
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,080
Star Hotel.

1162
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,080
It is near North Market.
