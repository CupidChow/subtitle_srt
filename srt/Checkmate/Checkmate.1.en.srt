00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,039
Councilor Xu,

3
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,080
shall we go grab some food

4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,320
or go straight to the hotel?

5
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,600
Go to the hotel.

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,080
Councilor Xu,

7
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,880
nine senators in Harbin

8
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,920
support us.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
It can be said that

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,680
we are sure to win the election.

11
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,280
You don't need to worry too much.

12
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,560
What I am worried about is

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,639
whether you can save your breath on this occasion.

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,160
Councilor Xu.

15
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,680
Run!

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,160
Councilor Xu.

17
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
Murder!

18
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,960
Councilor Xu.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,600
Help!

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
Murder!

21
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,760
Help!

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,000
Murder!

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,320
Catch the assassin!

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,200
Catch the assassin!

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,600
It's him!

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,440
Don't run!

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,160
Stand there. Stand there.

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:35,920
Go!

29
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,400
Don't run!

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,960
Don't run!

31
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Stop!

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,240
Stop!

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,079
Stop!

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,360
Don't run!

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,120
Don't run!

36
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,040
Stop!

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
According to the autopsy report,

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,720
the bullet entered the victim's back

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,800
and exited through his abdomen,

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
which caused a perforating wound.

41
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,600
The angle formed by the trajectory and the ground

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
agrees with that formed by

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,800
the gunman's forearm and the ground.

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,360
Based on the distance

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,480
between the murderer and the victim,

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,960
the murderer's arm is about 0.75 meters

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
and he's about 1.8 meters in height.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
Among all the people here,

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,680
only the defendant fits the result.

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,560
Do you have anything

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,520
to say about that?

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
You go ahead.

53
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
I have nothing to say.

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,440
The defendant candidly confessed his crime.

55
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,520
So as he has murdered someone...

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,120
Wait.

57
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,720
We got new evidence.

58
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,720
Since there're many questionable points in the case

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
and new evidence is submitted,

60
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,760
I hereby announce the court is adjourned.

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,800
The case will come to trial another day.

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,640
Your Honor,

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
you may release the new evidence.

64
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,760
Ma Shiying's committed murder and was caught in the act.

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,280
Why are there many questionable points?

66
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,800
We should

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,560
settle a lawsuit with evidence.

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,400
The evidence chain is now still broken.

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,640
Ma Shiying shot someone on the railway platform

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,880
and there were so many witnesses.

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,720
Through comparative analysis of the bullet on the scene,

72
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,200
it was the 0.38-inch Colt revolver

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
that was used by the murderer.

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,160
The evidence is solid.

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Ma Shiying has been naturalized Russian nationality.

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
The evidence now

77
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,880
is not enough to convict a Russian.

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,280
Isn't my evidence sufficient?

79
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,200
Your evidence

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,640
is not in line with the procedure.

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,960
Not in line with the procedure?

82
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,280
Then what about his?

83
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,360
Yes, that's unfair.

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,840
It's unfair. It's unfair.

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,120
Silence!

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Silence! Silence!

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,560
Situ Yan,

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,520
you ignored the law with full knowledge of it.

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,159
And you took the lead to disrupt the order of the court.

90
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,520
Do you still want to be a lawyer or not?

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,840
Even if I would lose my job,

92
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,600
I have to say it today.

93
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,320
When the trigger was pulled,

94
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,160
the firing pin would leave a trace on the bullet.

95
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
After comparison,

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,640
both the model and the trace of the bullet

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,160
used by the defendant

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
are the same as those of the bullet that killed Xu Shiren.

99
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,240
Besides,

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,560
there was only the defendant's fingerprint on the pistol.

101
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,080
It can surely prove that...

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,240
Bailiff.

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,880
this pistol belongs to the defendant only.

104
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
Bailiff. Bailiff, take him away.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,320
Yes.

106
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,080
He killed a Chinese officer

107
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,320
in China.

108
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,080
Just because he's a Russian,

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,320
you dare not to convict him.

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,600
I am not qualified as a lawyer.

111
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
How could he do this?

112
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,800
But are you qualified as a Chinese?

113
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,120
Are you qualified?

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Why don't you convict him?

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
How can you restrict me?

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,520
The court adjourned.

117
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,200
Uncle. Uncle. Sir.

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
Please have mercy on us.

119
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,840
Help us please.

120
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
give us some food.

121
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,640
Auntie,

122
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,920
help.

123
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
Please have mercy on us.

124
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,240
Uncle, could you give us some money?

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,920
Uncle.

126
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,520
Give us some food.

127
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,920
Everyone in Beijing now knows

128
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
it was you who let Ma Shiying go.

129
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,480
You have early known that.

130
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
You wronged me.

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,320
Here.

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,240
There's an editorial.

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
Which course should justice follow?

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,480
Did anyone teach you

135
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
what justice meant?

136
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,520
I've talked with them.

137
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,560
Go to the court and apologize

138
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,840
for the sake of your prospect.

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
Apologize?

140
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Am I crazy?

141
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,640
Yes.

142
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,160
You did that for justice

143
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
and the truth.

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,280
But whether the newspaper or every Beijing citizen

145
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,320
thought you were wrong.

146
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,240
You have no excuses.

147
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,960
Apologize and admit your mistake.

148
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,760
Fame or prospect,

149
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,240
we should at least keep one of them.

150
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,640
I don't think it

151
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,160
a good prospect.

152
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,840
What about you?

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
Division chief as you are,

154
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,039
you can't even deal with a judge who confused right and wrong.

155
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,440
Brother,

156
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,960
can you use your loaf?

157
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,159
This is a really big case.

158
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,120
They didn't turn to a prosecutor.

159
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
But they found you instead.

160
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,880
Didn't you know

161
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
if there was any inside information?

162
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
Don't think too highly of yourself and try to stop the chariot.

163
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,280
If the darkness is covering up the truth,

164
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm willing to be the mantis.

165
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,600
Forget it.

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,000
I

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
am too weak to fight with people like you.

168
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,280
What kind of people am I?

169
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
Brat, make it clear.

170
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,800
Situ Yan.

171
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
How are you doing?

172
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,280
Since our national system is independent,

173
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,800
we should have independent legal institution.

174
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,480
The legal institution is always in effect in territory.

175
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,040
Only in our country,

176
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,880
they were given extraterritoriality

177
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,080
in excuse of our incomplete judicial system.

178
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,520
Britain first put it forward

179
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,760
and Germany followed.

180
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,560
Japan even set courts where our ancestors prospered.

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,880
The state sovereignty was stripped day by day.

182
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
There would be no end of trouble for the future.

183
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,000
We're afraid that we could hardly change the situation.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Therefore, those who share the same goal

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,520
will establish a trade union in Harbin

186
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,280
in order to withdraw extraterritoriality as soon as possible.

187
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,480
This is the crux of our revolution and self-improvement.

188
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,080
We await you here

189
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,480
to discuss the thing with us.

190
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,400
Best wishes.

191
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,240
Shen Jianxian.

192
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
Are you really leaving for Harbin?

193
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,440
You always had your own ideas.

194
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,840
But now you were moved by only a letter from the teacher.

195
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,680
Not moved.

196
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,080
What the letter said is near my thought.

197
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,320
The teacher is forming a lawyer association in Harbin.

198
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
Why do you get yourself involved?

199
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,160
Your legal principle

200
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,360
is here.

201
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,920
And mine

202
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,520
is there.

203
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,000
Fine. Fine.

204
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,720
You win.

205
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I surrender, okay?

206
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,280
When you arrive in Harbin,

207
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,200
greet the teacher for me.

208
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,080
I won't do that for free.

209
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,720
What else do you want?

210
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,800
Boss.

211
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,600
Soy juice and fired rings

212
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,200
for two.

213
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,280
Okay.

214
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,480
Do they really taste good?

215
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm leaving soon.

216
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,840
After this meal,

217
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
I have no idea about the next.

218
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,480
Guys,

219
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,040
fried rings will be here soon.

220
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,480
If I had known how he was,

221
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,200
I would have shot him at that moment.

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
That's right.

223
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,440
This is doubtlessly a murder case.

224
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
But they still said the evidence was incomplete.

225
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Even you can bear witness.

226
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,440
Keep an eye

227
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,400
on Situ Yan.

228
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
If I did something wrong,

229
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,840
you should ask him to be the prosecutor.

230
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
Even a criminal can protest his innocence.

231
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,440
What is this?

232
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,880
What's wrong?

233
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,080
This

234
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,400
is even worse than Situ Yan.

235
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,360
What is this?

236
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,840
Eat fast.

237
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,440
Look.

238
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,040
You're made a fool of, one way and another.

239
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,240
Situ.

240
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,560
Let's go.

241
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,600
Go.

242
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,680
Do you need a ride?

243
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
Do you need a ride, sir?

244
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,200
Alright.

245
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,000
When you are in Harbin,

246
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
you should be somehow slick and sly.

247
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,920
Don't offend others

248
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,560
if you can.

249
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,200
The teacher is aged.

250
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,960
Although you are close like a father and son,

251
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,680
he

252
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,720
can't clear up mess for you every day.

253
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,120
Right?

254
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,640
You're bearing a heavy load in Beijing.

255
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,400
When you become a high-ranking official someday

256
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,760
and I can no longer to carry on,

257
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
you can invite me back

258
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
to assist you.

259
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,080
Just wait for that day.

260
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,680
You actually dared to steal my pistol.

261
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
Brother, I didn't.

262
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
I've never stolen your pistol.

263
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,160
Where is the pistol?

264
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,200
I really didn't steal your pistol.

265
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,120
I didn't.

266
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,760
The last time. Where is the pistol?

267
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
Brother, I didn't steal your pistol.

268
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,280
I really didn't steal your pistol.

269
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,000
In public,

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,280
are you going to kill him?

271
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,240
He has broken the military law.

272
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
And this has nothing to do with you.

273
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,520
I didn't.

274
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,040
I didn't.

275
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
I'm innocent, barrister.

276
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,840
I didn't steal boss's pistol.

277
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,720
Help me!

278
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,280
Help me.

279
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,800
Tell me

280
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,520
what happened.

281
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,320
After the breakfast,

282
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,800
the boss found his pistol was gone the moment we got in the car

283
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,520
but a button of mine took place.

284
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,960
But I didn't steal his pistol.

285
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,880
Then the button ran into my pocket by itself.

286
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,800
I didn't, boss.

287
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,200
I didn't steal your pistol.

288
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,240
Can I take a look at this button?

289
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,120
Let me have a look.

290
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,680
Maybe I can find the truth.

291
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,120
Alright.

292
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,640
Brother.

293
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:34,920
Situ.

294
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,920
Wait.

295
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,800
Just follow him.

296
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,080
Yes.

297
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,120
Sir,

298
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,680
where is that vendor?

299
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
He might have shut the stall and left.

300
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,760
He left early today.

301
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Where did he go?

302
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,240
That way.

303
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,560
Just follow him.

304
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,880
Okay.

305
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,440
Have you put the bet?

306
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Yes.

307
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,440
Three fives. I win.

308
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,120
Stop!

309
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,400
Don't come over!

310
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,839
Don't move!

311
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,440
Don't come over!

312
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,520
It's you.

313
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,839
Calm down.

314
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,200
Put the pistol down first.

315
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
No.

316
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,440
Don't push me.

317
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,760
Or I will shoot.

318
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,200
How dared you shoot?

319
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,760
Don't shoot!

320
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,960
Calm down.

321
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,200
And you.

322
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,240
If you shoot again,

323
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,560
you're sure to die.

324
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Besides, you should think it twice.

325
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,720
Are we the ones you want to kill?

326
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,640
No matter how wronged you feel,

327
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
you can't steal an officer's pistol.

328
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,240
Is there justice?

329
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,640
Is there justice?

330
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,040
Those who did all kinds of evil things

331
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,160
live peacefully.

332
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,400
But we who never went beyond moral bounds

333
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,080
lost our families.

334
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,800
There is justice.

335
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,240
Come on.

336
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,760
Give me the pistol.

337
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,360
And I'll find justice for you.

338
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,160
Wang San, the bastard,

339
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,120
raped my daughter

340
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,160
while my wife and I got up early to open the stall.

341
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,720
The poor kid hung herself.

342
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,120
And her mom fell ill.

343
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm going to kill that bastard.

344
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,360
If you keeps pushing me,

345
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,120
I'll...

346
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
Who shot?

347
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,720
Situ.

348
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,080
It's okay.

349
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,080
It's a misunderstanding.

350
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,240
It's late.

351
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,160
You should go first.

352
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,040
Leave it to me.

353
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,200
Okay.

354
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
Don't worry, sir.

355
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
With Director Wang of the Ministry of Justice,

356
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,200
no one can make trouble here.

357
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
But nothing

358
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,600
can be an excuse for crime.

359
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,240
Why can't I see through you?

360
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,080
If you have such capacity,

361
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,280
it's a pity

362
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,120
that you only use it to handle a vendor.

363
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,880
It's fair of the law.

364
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,280
It can not only punish the vendor who stole the pistol

365
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,880
but also the local ruffian who did evil.

366
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
If I hadn't found the vendor's having stolen the pistol,

367
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,760
the ruffian would have been killed.

368
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Trace to its source.

369
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,480
That pistol belongs to you.

370
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,360
Your man would die because of the slander.

371
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,560
Do you think whether you're responsible for that?

372
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,440
So,

373
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:48,920
you helped me.

374
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,240
And I have to thank you.

375
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,840
Otherwise?

376
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,520
Alright.

377
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,680
Then I might thank you.

378
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,960
Just thank me.

379
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,520
Why did it sound strange?

380
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,400
How many years will he be sentenced as he stole the pistol?

381
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,040
What should his wife and daughter do?

382
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,920
If you're worried,

383
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
you can take care of them these two days.

384
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,720
Two days?

385
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,200
Only for two days?

386
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
No witness or physical evidence.

387
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,720
What pistol did he steal?

388
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,320
Who saw it?

389
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,200
But why did you realize the thief

390
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,720
by a glance at the button?

391
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,760
There was oil on the button.

392
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,560
The vendor's hands were oily when making breakfast.

393
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,280
So he made my man a scapegoat

394
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,000
with this button.

395
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,720
No.

396
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,320
The button and oil are double clues.

397
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,760
The pistol should still be there when you were eating breakfast.

398
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,000
You'd been looking for trouble

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,160
only after drinking fermented bean juice.

400
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,840
What is this?

401
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,440
What's wrong?

402
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,200
So you and your man didn't eat the fried rings.

403
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,840
There was no oil on your fingers.

404
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,960
He should have

405
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,720
dropped his button by accident.

406
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,120
is even worse than Situ Yan.

407
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,800
Someone picked up that button

408
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,960
and put it in your pocket.

409
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,800
Then, he smoothly took the pistol.

410
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,720
Only three people there got their hands oily.

411
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,520
Wang Mingzheng, the vendor

412
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
and I.

413
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,120
Situ Yan.

414
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,280
My name is Luo Shaochuan.

415
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
You can come to me if in need.

416
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,520
It works.

417
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,760
You can remember my name after a glance at the newspaper.

418
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
Your brain

419
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,080
worked too.

420
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,560
The last question.

421
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,040
How did you know the vendor was killing someone

422
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,480
with the pistol?

423
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
Otherwise?

424
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,120
Light a fire with the pistol

425
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,400
and make breakfast?

426
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,760
He could take it to protect someone.

427
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,320
What did you do?

428
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,440
We're at the train station.

429
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
But you told me you forgot the luggage.

430
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

431
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,920
I'll go fetch it now.

432
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,600
Do you know how important the things in it are?

433
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,760
Yes, I'll get it right away.

434
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,240
Go.

435
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,000
Don't push!

436
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,520
Don't push.

437
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,960
Thank you.

438
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,400
You look particular about your look.

439
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
But why are you so careless about the train you take?

440
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,360
I...

441
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,000
What about this?

442
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,040
You have

443
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,920
helped me.

444
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,280
And I hate to owe others.

445
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,320
Now I'll return the favor.

446
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,360
Go to the first-class carriage with me.

447
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,320
No need.

448
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,880
It's nice here.

449
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,240
The first-class carriage of this train

450
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
is the most luxurious one in Asia.

451
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,360
People call it Orient Express.

452
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,200
Let me show you.

453
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,240
Go.

454
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,280
Excuse me.

455
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,080
Let me take it.

456
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,560
It's okay.

457
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,480
You just walk.

458
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,840
If I had known that place was so far,

459
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,360
I wouldn't have brought so much luggage.

460
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,680
If I hadn't met you,

461
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,320
I might still have been weeping outside.

462
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,120
My box is heavy, isn't it?

463
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,520
Not really.

464
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,840
I'll treat you to coffee

465
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,680
after we get in.

466
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,600
No need.

467
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,680
Only women

468
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,720
would feel it heavy.

469
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,160
Sir,

470
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,880
if you are tired,

471
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,840
you can take a rest first.

472
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,160
No need.

473
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,640
It's a piece of cake.

474
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,800
It doesn't matter.

475
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,080
We are here.

476
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm Zong Yan.

477
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,280
Mr. Zong, please.

478
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,880
Miss, please show your ticket.

479
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,920
Qi Hong of the third room.

480
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,520
OK. Miss, please.

481
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,560
Mr. Luo.

482
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Arrange a seat for my friend.

483
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,400
This...

484
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,800
Can't you?

485
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,800
No, it's not that I can't.

486
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,240
The first-class carriage is full.

487
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,400
Impossible.

488
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,440
It's a usual day.

489
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,520
Young Master,

490
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,680
Orient Express is famous now.

491
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,240
Many gentlemen and ladies are queuing up for it.

492
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,720
What about the second-class carriage?

493
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,720
How about

494
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,560
forgetting it?

495
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,200
Forget what?

496
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,760
Give it to me.

497
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
There's an empty seat, isn't there?

498
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,160
He might haven't arrived.

499
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,560
The train will go in a minute.

500
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,000
He has missed it.

501
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,320
You just get in.

502
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,440
Is it okay?

503
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,400
Why not?

504
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,840
Just go and sit there.

505
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,680
You helped me

506
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,160
and I've returned the favor. Liu.

507
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Go. Go. Go.

508
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,400
Go.

509
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,960
Young Master, don't worry.

510
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,360
Take care.

511
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,400
Sir,

512
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
your ticket.

513
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,240
I almost forgot it.

514
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,120
Thank you for today.

515
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
You're welcome.

516
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,760
I will help anyone in need.

517
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,800
Let's have a drink in your room tonight.

518
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,000
No need.

519
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I don't like this either.

520
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,000
Sir,

521
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,640
you look familiar.

522
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,760
Have we met somewhere before?

523
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,160
Really?

524
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,680
No.

525
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,920
I have a bad memory.

526
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,400
Sir.

527
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,240
What do you do?

528
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,640
Jobless?

529
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,880
Jobless?

530
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,280
Are you applying for a job in Harbin, either?

531
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,200
A jobless man actually dares to take Orient Express.

532
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,640
You must come from a rich family.

533
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
My friend brought me here.

534
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,040
Then your friend is capable.

535
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,280
What did you do before?

536
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,920
There's no need to feel embarrassed about that.

537
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,040
I

538
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,440
used to live near the Qin Huai River.

539
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,840
It's really dry.

540
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,040
I bet it is.

541
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,440
I heard wealthy men in Harbin are...

542
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,160
Hold on.

543
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
What a psycho.

544
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,360
Excuse me.

545
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,240
Do you bring cough medicine?

546
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,080
No.

547
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,920
Sorry to disturb you.

548
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,440
Madam,

549
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,400
your photo.

550
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,280
Thank you.

551
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,920
This is my daughter and my grandson.

552
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
I'm going to Harbin to visit them.

553
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,280
Is my young grandson

554
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
lovely?

555
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,560
Yes, he's really lovely.

556
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,040
You're so lucky.

557
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,880
Two more portions of rice.

558
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,000
Send them to my room when ready.

559
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,960
Yes, sir.

560
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,600
A man should

561
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,640
behave like this.

562
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,920
Unlike me...

563
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,640
What are you saying?

564
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,080
Back then in Weirong,

565
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,880
we surrendered without fighting.

566
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,160
We should submit when necessary.

567
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,920
From Guangzhou to Beijing

568
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,080
and then to Harbin,

569
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,560
no one can do anything to me.

570
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,040
It's Situ, the barrister who was eager to

571
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,200
send me upon the scaffold but finally lost his job.

572
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,760
So what?

573
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,320
You're following me.

574
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,640
Come and kill me.

575
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,560
Come on.

576
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,520
Mr. Ma.

577
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,680
Mr. Ma.

578
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,920
Mr. Ma.

579
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,600
Mr. Ma. Mr. Ma.

580
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,760
Isn't the trial adjourned?

581
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,040
Why did you leave Beijing?

582
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,920
Were you released, Mr. Ma?

583
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,440
Please answer our questions.

584
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,800
Mr. Ma.

585
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,360
Which newspaper office are you from?

586
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:40,760
Are you crazy?

587
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,120
Mr. Ma.

588
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,240
Mr. Ma.

589
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,080
Are you leaving for Harbin

590
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,200
to escape to Russia?

591
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,440
What are you saying?

592
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,120
Say it again.

593
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,800
Say it again!

594
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,560
Calm down.

595
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Please answer our questions.

596
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,160
Enough. Enough.

597
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,640
Don't ask anymore.

598
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
Please answer our questions.

599
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,040
Please answer.

600
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,360
Stop asking.

601
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,640
Why did you leave Beijing early?

602
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,320
No photography.

603
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,080
You! Stop shooting.

604
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,400
What are you shooting?

605
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,560
Are you fleeing abroad?

606
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,280
Mr. Ma.

607
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,440
Why are you on the train?

608
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,240
You come over. Come here.

609
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,000
Answer our questions.

610
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,440
Mr. Ma.

611
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,160
Have you been released?

612
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,240
What questions?

613
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,960
Alright. Alright.

614
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,000
Stop asking, okay?

615
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Stop asking.

616
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,920
Stop it. Stop it.

617
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,120
It's dining time.

618
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,440
You should leave as you are not dining.

619
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,520
Do not disturb our guests anymore.

620
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,080
Stop them.

621
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,680
What are you doing?

622
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,640
I said no photography.

623
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,400
What's wrong with you?

624
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Stop arguing.

625
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,120
Stop arguing!

626
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,880
Go back!

627
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,920
Go. Go. Go.

628
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,160
Go.

629
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,440
You always forget the lesson.

630
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Behave yourself.

631
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
What can you do to me?

632
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,360
You wretch!

633
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,640
Fortunately, it didn't get out of hand.

634
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,840
He has a gun.

635
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,240
With so many people in broad daylight,

636
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,120
he dared not to do anything.

637
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,040
Sir,

638
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,720
what can I do for you?

639
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,800
Go away.

640
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,920
There seem to be a man in my room.

641
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,280
Please take a look.

642
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,920
Don't worry.

643
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,040
I'll take a look now.

644
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,080
Hello, Mr. Situ.

645
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,160
Did you drink?

646
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,320
Just a few drinks.

647
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,240
It's okay, sir.

648
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,040
Sorry to keep you waiting.

649
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,120
The lady in Room Three

650
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,680
suddenly told me

651
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,040
there was a man in her room.

652
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,120
It should be not strange

653
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,800
to have a few men in her room.

654
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,120
What can I do for you?

655
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm a little thirsty.

656
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,000
Okay, sir.

657
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,840
Hot water or tea?

658
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Hot water is okay.

659
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,480
OK. Please wait a moment.

660
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,960
Young master.

661
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,520
There's a murder.

662
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,160
Where?

663
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,880
In first-class carriage.

664
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,800
No way.

665
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,560
Situ.

666
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,200
This...

667
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,600
You can't die, Situ.

668
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,120
What's wrong?

669
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,159
Why are they shouting in the early morning?

670
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,880
Oh my god.

671
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,920
It's great that you're fine.

672
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,080
Someone died. I thought it was you.

673
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,800
Someone died? What happened?

674
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,280
Here.

675
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,920
Young Master.

676
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,400
This way.

677
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,239
Here.

678
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,040
Here.

679
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,800
Liu.

680
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,360
Blockade the scene.

681
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,520
No one is allowed to go in or out.

682
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,719
Yes.

683
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,920
Please cooperate with our work.

684
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,639
Come with me.

685
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,120
Get out.

686
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,560
Please cooperate.

687
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,360
No photography.

688
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,760
This...

689
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,120
No.

690
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,520
I backed the wrong horse.

691
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
I didn't expect you had followed him onto the train and killed him.

692
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,320
Like this.

693
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,400
You go out in this way

694
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,480
and go straight to the north.

695
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,760
Someone will pick you up there.

696
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,199
And you take the money.

697
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,199
Leave the rest to me. You just forget it.

698
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:49,560
I'll take care of it.

699
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:49,960
No, no.

700
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,400
Wait.

701
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,159
Why should I leave?

702
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Didn't you kill Ma Shiying?

703
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,440
No.

704
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,120
I really didn't.

705
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,160
What?

706
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,000
The train has always stopped there.

707
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,000
Yes.

708
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,600
The two brothers of the Li made war ahead

709
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,880
and have destroyed a section of railway.

710
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,080
They're doing rush repairs.

711
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
The train seemed

712
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,160
to have stopped last night.

713
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,200
If it wasn't you,

714
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,880
who did this?

715
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,720
I don't know.

716
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,360
But

717
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,400
I want to know it too.

718
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,000
What are you doing here?

719
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,440
Go.

720
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,320
Come here.

721
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,880
Young Master.

722
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,120
What happened?

723
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,960
Yesterday,

724
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,080
the secretary of Ma Shiying,

725
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
Mr. Wan Jixiang

726
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,480
reserved the breakfast for him.

727
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,320
But he didn't come.

728
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,960
So I went to ask him if he still needed that.

729
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
I came to knock on the door

730
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,880
but no one answered.

731
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
Then I told Wan Jixiang about that.

732
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,480
Mr. Wan said

733
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,920
he didn't see him either.

734
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,360
Yes. Yes.

735
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,600
We were worried about him,

736
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,920
so we came together and took a look.

737
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,600
Yes.

738
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,720
We knocked on the door

739
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,640
but no one answered.

740
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,240
At the time, the door was locked inside.

741
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,920
Through the crack of the door,

742
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,880
I thought Mr. Ma must have had an accident.

743
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,560
So I asked Mr. Wan to open the door

744
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,480
and I hurried to turn to you.

745
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,720
Yes.

746
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,960
When was the last time you saw Ma Shiying?

747
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,320
This morning.

748
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,800
The alive one. The alive Ma Shiying.

749
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,760
Then it should be

750
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,360
around 1 a.m.

751
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,800
He rang the bell, so I answered the door.

752
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,240
But he asked me to leave.

753
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,280
He might pressed the wrong button.

754
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,320
He spoke Russian.

755
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,000
I could only catch a little.

756
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,640
In other words,

757
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,080
he should be killed

758
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,600
from last midnight to this morning.

759
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,120
Yes.

760
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,720
Excuse me.

761
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,520
I think

762
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,560
a doctor would

763
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,200
offer you a more accurate answer

764
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,560
if you can find one.

765
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,920
Liu.

766
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,640
Go find a doctor.

767
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,480
Yes.

768
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,520
Young Master.

769
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,400
Have a seat.

770
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,200
Last night,

771
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,360
who did you see?

772
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,680
A lot.

773
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,600
Basically,

774
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
I've seen

775
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,360
all people in the first-class carriage.

776
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,040
Did you lock the communicating doors last night?

777
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,040
Of course.

778
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,320
There are rules.

779
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,720
After dinner,

780
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,440
all the communicating doors

781
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,880
should be locked.

782
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,840
The next morning,

783
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,520
we would open them again.

784
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,960
Then did anyone go in or out

785
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,160
after doors were open this morning?

786
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,280
No one went out.

787
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,320
Only Mr. Luo came in.

788
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,360
And a reporter.

789
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,840
He wanted to

790
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
write something here as it was quiet.

791
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,280
I let him in as there were

792
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,800
few people in the dining carriage.

793
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,480
Are you sure no one else has gone in or our?

794
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm sure.

795
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,520
I opened the door myself this morning.

796
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
That reporter

797
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,320
has been sitting there since he came in.

798
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,480
He didn't even move

799
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,400
before the accident.

800
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,480
By the way,

801
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,920
when did the train stop last night?

802
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,000
Last night, at around 0:30.

803
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,440
It's stopped till now.

804
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,200
It hasn't moved.

805
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,320
Brother.

806
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,360
The doctor is here.

807
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
How's that?

808
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,680
He should be killed

809
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,960
between 0 A.M. to 2 A.M.

810
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,600
His watch was broken.

811
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,480
And it told a quarter past one.

812
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,240
I think this should be the exact time of death.

813
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,400
The victim was stabbed nine times.

814
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,480
And the wounds are of different shades.

815
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,120
Some wounds were caused by the right hand,

816
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,360
and the other by the left hand.

817
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,080
The wounds caused by the left hand are deeper,

818
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,760
including two fatal wounds,

819
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,600
a single stab wound to the heart

820
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,880
and the other that pierced his lung.

821
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,680
That is the general situation.

822
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,600
Okay, Liu.

823
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,080
Send him back.

824
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,680
We'll inform you if in need.

825
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:19,720
Okay.

826
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,360
The train has stopped for a night

827
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,000
and no one has left.

828
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,080
The murderer should still be on the train

829
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,560
or even in this carriage.

830
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,880
Barrister,

831
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,880
you should be the one on the train

832
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,080
who wished most that Ma Shiying would die

833
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,600
as I think.

834
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,120
Of course I wanted to bring the criminal to justice

835
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,680
but not illegal punishment without trial.

836
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,400
Don't, don't look at me.

837
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,880
His secretary as I am,

838
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,720
I was drinking with Brother Zong

839
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,160
last night.

840
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Right, Brother Zong?

841
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,200
I was with you.

842
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,240
But I was drinking tea.

843
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,960
I know who the murderer is.

844
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,480
It's him.

845
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,720
It must be him.

846
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,520
He knew I saw him.

847
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,920
He will kill me.

848
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,960
You must find him.

849
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,360
Last night,

850
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,840
he hid himself in my room.

851
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,880
He saw him too.

852
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,840
I called you last night.

853
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,680
You must find him.

854
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,920
He will kill me to silence me.

855
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,800
Then what

856
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,840
does the murderer look like?

857
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,080
He's a man.

858
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,040
He must be a man.

859
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,760
Beyond that,

860
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,120
I have no idea.

861
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,400
I didn't see him clearly.

862
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
Then what are you worried about?

863
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,800
You want to find him so badly.

864
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,720
Is it because you've missed a client?

865
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,280
I think you are the murderer.

866
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,720
I?

867
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,520
You might have something

868
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,360
to do with some organization.

869
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,040
He killed Xu Shiren.

870
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,840
And you came to take revenge.

871
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,400
Bullshit!

872
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,080
Enough, stop arguing.

873
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,720
Now,

874
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,880
go back to your own room.

875
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
Without my permission,

876
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
you can't go out

877
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,280
or even visit each other.

878
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,600
Go.

879
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,960
Mr. Luo.

880
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,920
Ma Shiying has been released.

881
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,480
He fled north by Orient Express

882
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,880
and was killed on the train.

883
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,320
The murderer was the prosecution counsel of the case, Si...

884
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,000
Who told you to fake it up?

885
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,000
You said that

886
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,640
this morning in the first-class carriage.

887
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,760
When did I say that?

888
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,440
Why do I think you look like the murderer?

889
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Have you always hidden yourself

890
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,120
in the dining carriage?

891
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,320
Mr. Luo, you asked me to leave yesterday.

892
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,640
And I went in only after

893
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,840
the conductor opened the door.

894
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,760
Fine, stop quibbling.

895
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,600
I think you are the murderer.

896
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,240
Mr. Luo, don't  get mad.

897
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,840
I haven't written the murderer down.

898
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,480
I just finished the fact that Ma Shiying was killed.

899
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,280
Come on.

900
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,440
Keep writing.

901
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,600
Just write that you killed him.

902
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,800
No. No.

903
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,640
That's enough.

904
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,080
You too.

905
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,200
Don't look on and desire to stir up trouble.

906
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,480
You might arouse suspicion instead.

907
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,520
I see.
