[Episode 21]

16
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,950
When can we leave?

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,910
Now all the people at the scene

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,990
are suspected of killing Shen Jianxian and Fang Jianqi.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,190
So until the murderer is found,

20
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,410
no one can leave.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,670
We are only suspects, not criminals.

22
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,410
How can you detain us?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,770
And if the murderer escapes,

24
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,160
can you afford to take responsibility?

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,740
The people here are

26
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,210
all respectable people in Harbin.

27
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,510
Can you be responsible for

28
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,460
the damage caused by the detention?

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,530
I will be.

30
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,830
Here is the case.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,160
We're not just respectable people.

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,330
More importantly, we're friends of Lawyer Shen

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,390
and Dr. Fang.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,020
I think it's understandable

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,900
to work with the police.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,150
Okay, we can work with you.

37
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,650
But I don't trust you.

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,960
I want to investigate it myself.

39
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:26,940
Mr. Du,

40
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,640
can you tell me more about

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,040
what happened at that time?

42
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,870
A lot of people came to the banquet that day.

43
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,410
You don't often go to parties, do you?

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,730
Uncle Du.

45
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,190
Although I'm a friend of your uncle,

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,870
I'm much younger than him.

47
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,480
Don't call me uncle.

48
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,540
Just call me Du.

49
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,690
Six dots.

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,320
Do I want it?

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,990
Do you want it?

52
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,330
Yes.

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,300
I can't believe it.

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,720
You haven't changed your mahjong for so long.

55
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,540
No.

56
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,680
Right?

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,030
Yes.

58
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,310
Uncle.

59
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,310
Mr. Luo.

60
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,540
Director Xie.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,590
Thank you for your hard work.

62
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,320
This is my duty.

63
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,790
Uncle, you guys talk.

64
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,240
I'll go over there.

65
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,540
I'll go somewhere else.

66
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,980
The small study is empty.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
You can go there.

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,250
Six dots.

69
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,220
Six dots.

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,230
Nine of bamboo.

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,370
All of the same color. A complete sequence from 1 to 9.

72
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,190
Sorry.

73
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,560
Why is he so lucky?

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,590
He won and ran.

75
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,560
I feel great today.

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,010
A complete sequence from 1 to 9.

77
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,010
Lawyer Shen is inside.

78
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,840
Let's go over there.

79
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,459
Take a break.

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,310
Shen.

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,130
Let me introduce you.

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,070
Du Heng.

83
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,140
This was a famous young man's role

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,250
in our traditional opera circles.

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,659
He's recently taken up Western theater.

86
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,680
He also writes his own plays.

87
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,470
He's well known.

88
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,190
Mr. Du.

89
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,260
It's a pleasure to meet you.

90
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,090
You flattered me, Mr. Luo.

91
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,409
I'm just an idle person.

92
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,090
Don't be so modest.

93
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,320
I'm introducing you

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,070
to Mr. Shen.

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,120
And this one.

96
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,710
This is our famous forensic pathologist in Harbin.

97
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,150
If a person dies here,

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,430
no one shall be buried

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,020
without his approval.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,410
You'd better never have to use me.

101
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm grateful to you all

102
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,250
for your help with the lawyer association.

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,670
Okay.

104
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,630
Go and get Dong Cixin and Zheng Bai over here.

105
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,130
Let me tell you something.

106
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,650
Women nowadays are not like in the old days.

107
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,130
Lawyer Shen! Lawyer Shen!

108
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,130
Shen.

109
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,490
Lawyer Shen.

110
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,000
Lawyer Shen.

111
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,850
What's going on?

112
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,380
What's going on?

113
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:38,950
Lawyer Shen.

114
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,750
I don't know.

115
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,220
He seems to have fainted.

116
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,590
He's not dead, is he?

117
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,130
Shen.

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,980
Lawyer Shen.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,180
-We have to call a doctor. - Shen.

120
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,240
It's so sudden.

121
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,990
Mr. Shen is such a good person.

122
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,330
This is not murder, right?

123
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,230
We've checked the drinks and food at the scene.

124
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,200
It's clean.

125
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,410
I'll find someone to help Mrs. Shen.

126
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,570
First, her son passes away and now her husband is dead.

127
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,040
What did Fang say?

128
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,580
It's probably a myocardial infarction.

129
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,600
If Mrs. Shen doesn't suspect anything,

130
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,360
the police have no right to dissect.

131
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,740
It was probably like this.

132
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,620
My teacher was poisoned after drinking.

133
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,630
So did Dr. Fang.

134
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,710
The nicotine was probably in the wine.

135
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,080
What do you mean?

136
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,930
Before Mr. Shen and Dr. Fang got their glasses,

137
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,340
you seemed to be around the table.

138
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,360
You can't say that.

139
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,650
How did I know which glass they'd take?

140
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,340
Besides, it was a wine party.

141
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,880
Isn't it normal for me to wander around there?

142
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:59,840
You were there, weren't you?

143
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,180
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,810
You're like a dog with a bone.

145
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,060
How could I poison them?

146
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,200
Then why do you think he would poison them?

147
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm just saying who was at the table.

148
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,570
Maybe the murderer had

149
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,540
a good reason to wash the glasses.

150
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,240
Are you talking about me?

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,910
No, I didn't.

152
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm not the only servant in the house.

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,260
The drink was prepared by Jin Mantang.

154
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,750
Why don't you suspect him?

155
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,550
Jin Mantang?

156
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,970
This servant can read and write.

157
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,180
But he just learned to read and write.

158
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
He's still copying the Thousand Character Classic.

159
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,540
He is also short of money.

160
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,260
Or maybe he wants to make a lot of money.

161
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,440
What I said is not true?

162
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,340
No.

163
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,650
I mean,

164
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,790
I haven't found anything yet.

165
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,350
Isn't this obvious?

166
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,390
What have you found?

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,480
You've found nothing about nicotine

168
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,040
or personal information?

169
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,410
You're a cop.

170
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,970
You should ask yourself.

171
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,040
You... you... you...

172
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,080
Luo Shaochuan.

173
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,120
How is it?

174
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,059
He's gone.

175
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,900
He's gone?

176
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,679
Do you remember what this man looks like?

177
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,690
What do you want?

178
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,520
If you do,

179
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,559
describe it,

180
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,549
I'll draw it

181
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,770
and post it in the city.

182
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,020
We can definitely find this person.

183
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,040
Good.

184
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,650
Are those ink marks?

185
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,930
It's not dry yet.

186
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,540
I think the pen fell here.

187
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,710
Could it be that he wanted to write something?

188
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
Is this pen important?

189
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,310
Could he have hidden nicotine

190
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,540
in the ink capsule?

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,710
I think it's a very important clue.

192
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,890
Maybe he wrote something after the murder

193
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,000
before he disappeared.

194
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,290
The timing is right.

195
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,580
But under what circumstances

196
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,580
would the pen fall here?

197
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,570
For example, he was trying to write.

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,700
The ink didn't come out smoothly.

199
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,990
So he tried to shake the pen,

200
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,580
and it fell out of his hand.

201
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,780
It's too far away.

202
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,560
It's impossible.

203
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,090
That's not right either.

204
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,690
Maybe he was burning what he wrote.

205
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,520
Nice.

206
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,430
Could he think the police were coming at this point

207
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,980
or that Mr. Luo was looking for him,

208
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,950
so he hid what he wrote?

209
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,480
Where could he have hidden it?

210
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,050
Where could he have hidden it?

211
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,040
Well.

212
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,170
There's no way to hide it here.

213
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,400
There's no place to hide here.

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,910
There's no way to fit in these cracks.

215
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,050
Could it be that it turned out to be a false alarm

216
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,150
and he took it away again?

217
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,830
There's something here.

218
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,220
I can't get my hand in here.

219
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,470
I'll do it.

220
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,160
Yes, you have smaller hands.

221
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,990
Here it is.

222
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,140
There's really a paper ball.

223
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,010
You're really good.

224
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,780
I know how Dr. Fang died.

225
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,140
You can meet with me.

226
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,950
Before I see the police,

227
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,050
I think we can…

228
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,480
Talk about it.

229
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,690
Talk about it.

230
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,670
I saw everything that happened tonight.

231
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,120
I don't want it to end…

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,360
On a low note.

233
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,670
I don't want it to end on a low note.

234
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Even if Jin Mantang

235
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,190
is not a murderer, he's a scoundrel.

236
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,480
Dr. Fang couldn't judge people right.

237
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,560
How can he recruit him to the family?

238
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,440
If he was trying to extort money,

239
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,270
I guess he would be dangerous now.

240
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,260
We thought he was a murderer.

241
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,020
But he turned out to be a witness.

242
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,930
There are ravines all around here.

243
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,970
Maybe he's already been thrown down

244
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,090
and become a victim.

245
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,910
Now one thing can be confirmed.

246
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,420
The murderer

247
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,940
is among us.

248
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,780
Take a look. Does he look like this?

249
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,690
Quite alike.

250
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,610
Mowan.

251
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,020
How come you can do everything?

252
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,270
I don't know how to solve crimes.

253
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,530
Miss Zhou,

254
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,070
can I take a picture?

255
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,440
Yes, come on.

256
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,280
Situ, the picture is ready.

257
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,930
It's good.

258
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,720
But we don't need it.

259
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,790
I don't think Jin Mantang absconded from the crime.

260
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,150
He must have found the murderer

261
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,410
and was silenced

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,540
Du.

263
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,520
This is too dangerous.

264
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,500
Leave it.

265
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,830
Let the police do the thing.

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,120
The police are already on it.

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Sergeant Bao,

268
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,220
can I take them back

269
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,230
for investigation?

270
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,250
Mr. Luo,

271
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,120
what are you talking about?

272
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,020
That's right.

273
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,700
We're all big names in Dori and Nangang.

274
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,800
The murderer went to great lengths to

275
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,070
plan such an elaborate murder case.

276
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,530
He won't show himself easily.

277
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,050
We're in no danger.

278
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,580
But why did he use the same method

279
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,320
to kill Dr. Fang and my teacher?

280
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,560
I have an idea.

281
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,950
Could it be that Fang knew

282
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,730
who the murderer of Lawyer Shen was?

283
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,000
Think about it.

284
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,050
Nicotine was in the wine.

285
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,540
And who had the opportunity to poison it?

286
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,060
This brings us back to the topic just now.

287
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,570
Who was Mr. Shen with before he drank?

288
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,690
Lawyer Shen is inside.

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,590
Let's go over there.

290
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,450
Take a break.

291
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,150
Don't look at me.

292
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,550
I've already told you.

293
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,470
It's normal for me to wander around the table.

294
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,190
I was looking for alcohol.

295
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,370
At the previous party held by Mr. Shen, there was beer, red wine,

296
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,460
and cocktails.

297
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,770
This one was even worse.

298
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,860
Only wine and champagne.

299
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,250
I just want to find a glass of vodka.

300
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,360
That's it.

301
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,120
What did you say to Shen Jianxian?

302
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,290
It's private.

303
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,030
It's none of your business.

304
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,540
Don't play the fool with me.

305
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,370
Don't play the young master's temper on me.

306
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,720
Who's not a young master anyway?

307
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,750
I'm telling you.

308
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,350
I can't be bothered to kill them.

309
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,010
It was you who killed Dr. Fang.

310
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
You were cuckolded by him.

311
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,180
What did you say?

312
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,610
What are you talking about?

313
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,490
Dr. Fang treated you well.

314
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,700
You can't slander him like this.

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,920
I'm not talking nonsense.

316
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,210
I heard what they said.

317
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,830
I'm a doctor.

318
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,400
Even if I know what kind of medicine

319
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,410
could kill people without realizing it,

320
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,880
I can't give it to you.

321
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,600
Not to mention that death is painful.

322
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,850
Do I have to

323
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,000
live my whole life

324
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,349
with that bastard?

325
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
Why can't you be braver?

326
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,160
I'll stand by your side.

327
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,540
How dare you try to kill me!

328
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,970
I'll send you to reunite with your lover now.

329
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,050
Stop it!

330
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,560
Hit me if you can!

331
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,099
You hit a woman.

332
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,819
You've beaten me so much over the years.

333
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,630
I didn't want to talk about it.

334
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,750
Since I married their family,

335
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,090
I've been living like this every day.

336
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,490
Let me tell you.

337
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,200
I beat you for not behaving well.

338
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,090
I'll break your hand.

339
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,210
Let go of her!

340
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,490
Come on.

341
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,420
Let go of her!

342
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,930
Dai Liming.

343
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,640
Do you think you're so manly to beat a woman?

344
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,180
What do you know?

345
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,050
She's always fooling around with other men.

346
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,980
How can I not beat her up?

347
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,580
I went out for the company, didn't I?

348
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,800
If you could do something decent,

349
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,820
why would I need to go out to earn money?

350
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,290
You don't care about the company.

351
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,700
You only take money.

352
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,550
You take the company's money

353
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,030
and go to New World and Huifangli.

354
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,530
I'm a man.

355
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,490
What's wrong with me spending my time outside?

356
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,180
Every man is like this.

357
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,810
Zheng Bai, let me ask you.

358
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Our family treats you well, right?

359
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,040
You always bitch about me.

360
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,900
What do you mean?

361
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,310
You'll be better off if I'm killed and replaced by another man, right?

362
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,240
When did I ever bitch about you?

363
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,810
If it wasn't for your mother

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,560
who was out there saying you're a loser,

365
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
who would know these things?

366
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,920
Since I married into your family,

367
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,810
I've been busy with the company every day.

368
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,110
And I have to go home in fear.

369
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,630
Your family

370
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,200
know this.

371
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,900
You said they treated me well.

372
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,950
How?

373
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,510
I see.

374
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,310
I see.

375
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,620
I know how Lawyer Shen died.

376
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,900
She asked for the poison to kill me.

377
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,870
But the first time she missed

378
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,500
and poisoned Mr. Shen.

379
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,250
The second time, she missed again

380
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,530
and poisoned Fang Jianqi.

381
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,250
What is this?

382
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,840
This is called self-inflicted evil cannot live.

383
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,960
She's the murderer.

384
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,570
-Arrest her. Arrest her. -It's not like this.

385
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,580
It's not.

386
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,880
Arrest her!

387
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,980
Stop fooling around.

388
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,650
Your wife asked for the medicine.

389
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,810
that can make people die without realizing it.

390
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,660
It's not for you.

391
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,190
It's for herself.

392
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
If she wanted to poison you,

393
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,950
she wouldn't care if you'd be in pain.

394
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,240
But you shouldn't be the murderer.

395
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,640
Because you're not capable of

396
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,020
planning such a murder.

397
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,840
If I'm right,

398
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,410
you're planning a divorce.

399
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,550
You want to get your wife out of the house.

400
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,170
Your company?

401
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,300
Zheng Bai has worked day and night

402
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,410
for this company.

403
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,470
You want to divorce to get a money tree for nothing?

404
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,020
Let me tell you this.

405
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,270
It's impossible with me on it.

406
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,550
Shen, don't say that.

407
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll raise your lawyer's fee.

408
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,560
Okay?

409
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,980
Why shouldn't I divorce you?

410
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,900
Do I have to bear your cheating?

411
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,710
Dai Liming.

412
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,010
I'm innocent with Dr. Fang.

413
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,460
Don't slander me!

414
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,010
Innocent?

415
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,480
Someone has heard you.

416
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,650
Innocent?

417
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,900
You always went to his house.

418
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,210
Innocent?

419
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,450
He called you whenever he had a wine party.

420
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,050
Innocent?

421
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,900
When he died, you acted as if your husband had died.

422
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,170
You're innocent?

423
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,710
I think Dai Liming killed Shen Xian first

424
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,470
and then Fang Jianqi.

425
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,240
The motive is reasonable.

426
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,570
If that's the case,

427
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,260
why didn't he do it

428
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,190
a few months ago?

429
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,370
What if the murderer was only coming for Fang Jianqi?

430
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,430
What do you mean?

431
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,860
The only person the murderer wanted to kill was Fang Jianqi.

432
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,740
Lawyer Shen drank the alcohol by mistake.

433
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,210
That's not possible.

434
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,120
Fang never drank cocktails.

435
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,980
He only drank red wine.

436
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,440
Anyone who knew about him knew this.

437
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,050
Reasonable, reasonable.

438
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,320
Treat the head when it wounds.

439
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,850
Treat the foot when it injures.

440
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,240
It'll be weird if you can solve the case.

441
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,320
Wait a minute.

442
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,670
Did Dr. Fang catch a cold?

443
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,270
How do you know?

444
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,920
Nicotine has a pungent smell.

445
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,520
If it's mixed into the red wine,

446
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,690
people normally can detect it.

447
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,250
I'm sorry.

448
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,600
I was just eavesdropping.

449
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,010
I'd like to report something to you.

450
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,960
I've had a cold for the past two days.

451
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,140
Zheng Bai knows about it.

452
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,690
She just wanted to kill me

453
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,850
and eloped with Fang.

454
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,990
Trust me, really.

455
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,840
Go over.

456
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,970
I want to check out Dr. Fang's glass again.

457
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,000
We've checked.

458
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,640
There's no nicotine in the glass.

459
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,500
I didn't say nicotine was in the glass.

460
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,580
This is a very nice glass.

461
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,090
This is a birthday gift from Mr. Du two years ago

462
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,590
for Dr. Fang.

463
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,470
He kept it well

464
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,360
and didn't use it much.

465
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,740
Is the box still here?

466
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,340
Yes.

467
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,020
It's in the study.

468
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,430
What are you doing here?

469
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,720
Looking for something.

470
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,000
Here.

471
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,710
A pair of glasses?

472
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,710
Where's the other one?

473
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,880
Maybe Dr. Fang broke it.

474
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,450
Du Heng brought this set of glasses

475
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,590
from abroad and gave it to him.

476
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,810
He kept them as a treasure.

477
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,540
Unless Du Hyung came,

478
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,770
he wouldn't even take the glasses out.

479
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,660
How could he break it?

480
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,860
I don't know.

481
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,910
Anything else?

482
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,800
I have to go to work.

483
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,680
Okay.

484
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,970
That's a nice bracelet you have there.

485
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,710
Thank you.

486
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,490
I can't even keep a glass now.

487
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,990
You like Mr. Du?

488
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,380
What do you want to ask?

489
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,600
Thank you.

490
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,680
I want to be alone for a while.

491
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,770
I know Dr. Fang was nice

492
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,940
and considerate.

493
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,770
He was your last refuge.

494
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,340
But now it's gone.

495
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,890
I hope you understand

496
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,280
you can't run away from your problems.

497
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,080
Time brings a great change.

498
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,990
We all know it doesn't work to disregard the changing circumstances.

499
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,660
But you have to stay where you were.

500
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,010
What does Zou Jingxuan have compared with me?

501
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,740
Juts youth.

502
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,940
A man doesn't like a woman.

503
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,450
It's a matter between the two.

504
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,320
It has nothing to do with a third person.

505
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,060
You're wrong.

506
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,300
He loved me.

507
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,800
Is it because of Dr. Fang

508
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,580
that you didn't get together?

509
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,110
Du Heng, Fang Jianqi, and I

510
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,350
met 20 years ago.

511
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,330
Du Heng was a very talented young man in traditional opera.

512
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,510
He even helped me revise

513
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,580
the book you just read.

514
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,880
It was my debut novel.

515
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,870
It was very popular after it was serialized.

516
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,720
I became a famous writer.

517
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,930
On the day of the finale,

518
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,560
I confessed my love to him.

519
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,630
He rejected me,

520
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,610
saying Fang Jianqi was his best friend.

521
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,510
After that,

522
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,980
Du Heng has never acted in an opera again.

523
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,530
And I haven't seen him for a long time.

524
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,910
It was only in the past several years that he reappeared.

525
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,510
I've made some inquiries.

526
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,250
Dai Liming

527
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,700
did know that Zheng Bai and Dr. Fang were very close.

528
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,300
Do you think

529
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,370
he is playing dumb?

530
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,370
No way.

531
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,750
Why?

532
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,300
Because Fang Jianqi didn't love Zheng Bai.

533
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,720
He loved Dong Cixin.

534
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,510
You all know that?

535
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,300
I also know that Du Heng also loved Dong Cixin.

536
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,830
He just gave up due to brotherly love.

537
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,660
I suspect that he is still in love

538
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,640
with that woman.

539
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,780
Otherwise, why hasn't he married?

540
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,620
Because he has a wife.

541
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,270
Du Heng doesn't love Dong Cixin?

542
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,900
So he has a wife and he's still...

543
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,650
He's still what?

544
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,620
Mr. Luo means

545
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
since he's already married,

546
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,970
he should keep his distance from you.

547
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,650
I'm afraid

548
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,300
you'd be easily fooled.

549
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,230
Don't worry about that.

550
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,360
Mrs. Du has been dead for so long.

551
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,160
Even if Jingxuan marries him,

552
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,350
it'll still be a proper marriage.

553
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,170
It's better than being held up by some people.

554
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,850
He's not good enough for her.

555
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,080
Jingxuan deserves better.

556
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,380
Stop it.

557
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,110
I don't have that kind of relationship with Du.

558
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,850
We are just friends.

559
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,480
That's the best.

560
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,830
Don't trust men so easily.

561
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,390
When I was in Beijing,

562
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,850
he took good care of me.

563
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,800
He did that for nothing.

564
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,160
That means there is something wrong.

565
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,950
Ever since I was a kid,

566
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,470
no one has ever treated me so well.

567
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,560
You mean Du Heng

568
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,490
has never been in love with Dong Cixin?

569
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,110
He was afraid of hurting Dong Cixin,

570
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,280
so Fang Jianqi never told her.

571
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,500
In fact, Du Heng had a lover at that time.

572
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,280
This has later become Fang Jianqi's biggest concern.

573
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,620
So instead of Dr. Fang treating Zheng Bai,

574
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,050
it's more like them telling each other their feelings.

575
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,950
If that's what you said,

576
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,490
why did Du Heng

577
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,770
help Dong Cixin like this?

578
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,470
I think it's because

579
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,030
their friendship.

580
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,480
Not to mention

581
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,210
it was Du Heng's lover who liked the story.

582
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,560
"No one lives".

583
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,340
You don't worry about anything.

584
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,440
You're still drinking.

585
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,830
Watch out you'll get arrested.

586
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,040
Why not?

587
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,640
I just like this.

588
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,600
Sorry to make you laugh today.

589
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,620
Do you think I'm funny?

590
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,530
You know that?

591
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,710
I just think

592
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,690
if you really don't want to live off someone else,

593
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,130
you can just get a divorce.

594
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,700
You are the first lady in Harbin.

595
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,300
Do you know what it means to live off someone else?

596
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,630
I really don't.

597
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,570
After the death of our master,

598
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,660
the whole Luo family is counting on me.

599
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,760
I just don't understand men like you.

600
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,050
You live off a woman a hard way.

601
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,450
Why did you have the courage to hit her?

602
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:50,110
Zheng Bai had been with Fang Jianqi for a long time.

603
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,790
I knew it all along.

604
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,780
Understand?

605
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,560
"No one lives", Dong Cixin.

606
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,880
Is this the book, Mr. Zhou?

607
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,460
"No one lives"?

608
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
Du recommended this book to me.

609
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,330
I haven't read it yet.

610
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,170
Dong Cixin is a representative of

611
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,060
the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School.

612
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,110
You're getting off-topic.

613
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,280
What else did you and Zheng Bai talk about?

614
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,170
The Zheng family married their daughter there,

615
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,350
hoping to depend on the Dai family.

616
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,420
But then the Dai family collapsed.

617
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,680
Zheng Bai is now caught in the middle of two sides.

618
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,560
She has been suffering for a long time

619
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,310
and relied on sleeping pills.

620
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,860
The more prescriptions she got,

621
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,410
the more familiar she became with Dr. Fang.

622
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,210
I've just talked to Dong Cixin.

623
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,500
She didn't seem to know that Du Heng had been married.

624
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,630
Once Dr. Fang drank too much

625
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,770
and told Zheng Bai about it.

626
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,410
He also said it was a secret.

627
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,560
He told Zheng Bai not to tell anyone.

628
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,140
Men really don't have secrets with you.

629
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,570
You can stop being jealous now.

630
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,130
When did I get jealous?

631
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,570
I'm sorry.

632
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,390
I'm sorry to bother you all.

633
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,450
Jingxuan,

634
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,770
I need to talk to you.

635
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,660
Can you come out for a moment?

636
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,410
Du, what's wrong?

637
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,590
Jingxuan,

638
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,070
I'm going to Moscow.

639
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,390
I planned to have dinner and tea together with you and your mother

640
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,410
these days.

641
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,570
But something like this happened.

642
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,060
It's okay.

643
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,230
We'll talk when you get back.

644
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,940
I may be gone for a long, long time.

645
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,860
I've brought you a little present.

646
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,630
It's too expensive.

647
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,350
I can't accept it.

648
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,650
It's worthless.

649
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,560
Take it as a plaything.

650
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,680
That won't do either.

651
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,330
It's okay, Jingxuan. You…

652
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,200
If it's worthless, don't wear it.

653
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,150
Shaochuan.

654
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,240
We don't know each other well.

655
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,320
Just call me by my full name.

656
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,230
Our Jingxuan

657
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,750
has seen the world.

658
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,870
You're fooling her with an old thing.

659
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,610
It'll make me think you don't respect her.

660
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,580
The gift is for Jingxuan.

661
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,250
It's up to Jingxuan to decide

662
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,780
whether to accept or not.

663
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,400
Jingxuan, give it back.

664
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,040
You can like or marry

665
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,130
whoever you want.

666
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,950
But except for him,

667
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,930
anyone can do.

668
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,000
Anyone can do?

669
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,080
Du,

670
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,700
thank you.

671
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,910
I accept this gift.

672
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,050
It's snowing again.

673
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,520
Snowy day.

674
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,540
Drinking day.

675
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,470
Want to have a drink together?

676
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,910
It depends on the mood.

677
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,740
Only people like you

678
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,700
have an interest in drinking

679
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,410
in such a situation.

680
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,770
What if the nicotine was not in the wine,

681
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,380
but in the food,

682
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,950
and the alcohol made it kick in faster,

683
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,410
so that it looked like he died of poisonous drinking?

684
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,910
In the food?

685
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,270
Put nicotine in food?

686
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
If you say so,

687
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,570
we should send all the people in Harbin

688
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,030
to the hospital to test

689
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,240
whether there are signs of poisoning?

690
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,320
If this person could easily put the poison

691
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,880
into Shen Jianxian's mouth

692
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,910
with no one suspecting him…

693
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,550
Who exactly are you talking about?

694
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,020
Mrs. Shen.

695
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,260
Who else could it be?

696
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,010
You've been talking nonsense since the beginning of the investigation.

697
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,460
One minute you want us to release you,

698
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,750
and then you say we can't be trusted.

699
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,850
If you keep doing this,

700
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,800
I'll cuff you right now.

701
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,910
Cuff me?

702
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,330
What did I say?

703
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,380
She said it was Mrs. Shen who poisoned.

704
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,130
Bullshit. Did I say that?

705
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,510
Pretty much.

706
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,350
Life and death are one mistake away.

707
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,770
Can you say they're pretty much similar?

708
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,160
I don't care what you mean.

709
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,860
If you keep talking nonsense,

710
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,840
I shall not be kind to you.

711
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,190
I remember now.

712
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Dr. Fang seemed to have visited Mrs. Shen yesterday.

713
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,300
That makes sense.

714
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,450
Fang Jianqi found out about the murder of her husband.

715
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,970
So she didn't stop there

716
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,630
and killed the forensic pathologist too.

717
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,070
Wait a minute.

718
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,590
Who do you mean by her?

719
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,010
That depends on how you interpret it.

720
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,450
You're clearly

721
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,850
insinuating Mrs. Shen.

722
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,350
Did Mrs. Shen murder Dr. Fang,

723
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,280
sitting at home with her mind?

724
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,590
I don't know.

725
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,390
I'm just thinking about the relationship of the characters in the novel.

726
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,450
According to your theory,

727
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,470
you also had the motive to kill.

728
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,590
Me?

729
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,220
The author of the novel

730
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,020
tried herself

731
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,840
a sensational murder.

732
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,410
It's ridiculous.

733
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,280
That's ridiculous.

734
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,230
What proof do you have?

735
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,680
Aren't you being ridiculous?

736
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,360
What evidence do you have to say that about Mrs. Shen?

737
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,280
Let me tell you.

738
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,570
I think Dong Cixin's analysis

739
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,800
somewhat makes sense.

740
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,850
It's impossible.

741
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,400
Mrs. Shen is so kind.

742
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,110
How could she kill people?

743
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,350
It's not at all impossible, right?

744
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,770
It was Shen Jianxian who sent his son to fight in the war.

745
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,850
And the whole army was lost.

746
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,199
It's like Shen Jianxian killed his son.

747
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,300
Mrs. Shen lost her son in her old age,

748
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,120
always blaming Lawyer Shen.

749
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,409
I remember hearing your uncle say

750
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,810
Lawyer Shen slept in his office

751
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,830
all year long.

752
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,719
Mom, let's not get involved.

753
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,889
Let them investigate.

754
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,139
Well,

755
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,380
what do you mean?

756
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,060
I'm providing clues.

757
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,389
It's okay.

758
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:56,960
There's no making without breaking.

759
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,060
We can't clear the suspect without suspicion.

760
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,400
Mr. Du,

761
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,570
don't worry about that.

762
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,810
Situ won't wrong any good person.

763
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,380
Of course, he won't let any bad guy off the hook either.

764
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
She had a motive for the crime.

765
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,490
Plus Shen Jianxian wouldn't guard his wife.

766
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,390
She also had the time to commit the crime.

767
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,680
After eliminating all possibilities,

768
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,290
the remaining one, however implausible it seems,

769
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,020
is still the truth.

770
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,120
It's me.

771
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,080
It's all because of me.

772
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,990
I'm the one who killed him.

773
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,160
Madam,

774
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,890
this has nothing to do with you.

775
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,260
You don't have to blame yourself anymore.

776
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,080
Back then,

777
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,170
he sent Siqi to join the army.

778
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,160
Who would've thought the army was annihilated?

779
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,330
I blamed him.

780
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,650
I hated him.

781
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,940
Not a day went by that I didn't blame him.

782
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,080
Because…

783
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,530
Because that's the only way I could feel better.

784
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,900
But in fact…

785
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,430
In fact, he was as sad as I was.

786
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,870
But he

787
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,660
didn't say anything.

788
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,130
He just didn't come back.

789
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,810
They left me alone

790
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,010
in this world.

791
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,330
Madam,

792
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,030
I'm an orphan.

793
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,960
I haven't had

794
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,940
home-cooked meals for a long time.

795
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,530
It's because I met you

796
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,390
that I remembered the taste of home.

797
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,490
You are such a good person.

798
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,860
Don't worry.

799
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,780
We will always be by your side.

800
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,630
Why don't we vote on it?

801
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,810
The minority obeys the majority.

802
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,180
I think Miss Dong has a point.

803
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,350
Are you messing with me?

804
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,090
How about this?

805
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,940
I'll arrest you to close the case.

806
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,170
One minute you accuse this,

807
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,280
and then you accuse that.

808
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,590
I think you might have killed him, Luo Shaochuan.

809
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,090
And you're playing a show.

810
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
You called

811
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,590
Detective Situ and Sergeant Bao here, right?

812
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,730
We can't get out.

813
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,220
How do we know what they do?

814
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,950
That's right.

815
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,180
Dr. Fang asked you to come here many times.

816
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:39,780
You didn't come.

817
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,950
Why should I be at his call?

818
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,810
Was I that free?

819
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,710
Then why did you come yesterday when you had time to spare?

820
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,030
Besides, our master died when you came.

821
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
What are you talking about?

822
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,300
Mr. Luo had been on the train before he came yesterday.

823
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,800
Who are you?

824
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,090
You have no right to talk.

825
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,110
I can also testify.

826
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,440
You don't believe me?

827
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,000
I'll show you the ticket.

828
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,230
[“Toxicological study of nicotine”]

829
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,090
"Toxicological study of nicotine".

830
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,910
You are exposed.

831
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,080
Why do I have this?

832
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Mr. Luo, let me see.

833
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,740
This is a week-old issue of "Orient Morning".

834
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,440
A week ago, Mr. Luo was in Fengtian.

835
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,530
How could he cut a newspaper from Harbin

836
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,550
in Fengtian?

837
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,550
How is that possible?

838
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,210
My master

839
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,220
just gave me an order.

840
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,650
He's the young master of Luo.

841
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,850
Would he need to cut his own newspaper?

842
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:43,850
-You... -Fine.

843
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,000
I'll take that as mine.

844
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,970
You admit it?

845
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,930
You admit it?

846
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,870
You admit it?

847
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,130
Look, I told you…

848
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:53,930
Be quiet.

849
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,960
I just found out the toxicity of nicotine

850
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,910
a week ago from the newspaper clipping.

851
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,650
How did I kill Lawyer Shen from a thousand miles away

852
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,100
a few months ago

853
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,120
while I was still on the train?

854
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,680
Does that make sense?

855
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,450
At the time of Lawyer. Shen's death,

856
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,810
Mr. Luo was not in Harbin.

857
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,690
I know you weren't in Harbin.

858
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,050
But you could instruct others.

859
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,730
And he...

860
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,440
After listening to your argument,

861
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,000
I've organized my thoughts.

862
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,490
I discussed it with Sergeant Bao.

863
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,250
Since all the parties involved are here,

864
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,500
how about

865
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,600
we recreate the scene?

866
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,960
Recreate?

867
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,630
We're playing house.

868
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,250
Or do you want to cover up Luo Shaochuan?

869
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,050
Kid,

870
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,130
who dares not to go

871
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,620
may be the murderer.

872
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,300
Recreate.

873
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,030
I'll do it.

874
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,450
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

875
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,840
Okay.

876
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,730
Everyone get ready.

877
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,740
Jin Mantang is not here?

878
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,450
I'll do it.

879
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,350
I've always hosted receptions.

880
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,430
I have some experience.

881
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,960
The key is I can act, right?

882
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,640
You all think Jin Mantang found the murderer.

883
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,940
I can put myself in his shoes

884
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,740
and see

885
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,100
if there are any clues.

886
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,380
Thank you, Mr. Du.

887
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,780
Come here.

888
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,300
Don't walk around.

889
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,290
Reporter Jin, what are you doing?

890
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,890
Sit down.

891
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,910
You're so stalling.

892
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,500
We're just playing mahjong. I won't win your money.

893
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,410
Second Lady.

894
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,260
We're just acting without really playing, right?

895
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,250
You have to act for real.

896
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,500
I need to do something.

897
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,240
Mr. Du,

898
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,600
just come to my side.

899
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,810
Tell me that Mr. Luo is here

900
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,000
and give me a telegram.

901
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,340
I open the telegram and say

902
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,710
"Today is a good day.

903
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,460
Good news keeps coming."

904
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,400
I see.

905
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,170
Wait a minute.

906
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,660
Good news?

907
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,240
What is it?

908
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,580
I don't really know.

909
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,980
An old friend's admission telegram.

910
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,180
You know him too?

911
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,800
A senior schoolmate of Fang Jianqi's.

912
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,210
You mean Zhao?

913
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,090
He got old

914
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,790
and couldn't remember things.

915
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,150
So Fang put him in a sanatorium.

916
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,430
A telegram from the sanatorium.

917
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,540
He couldn't remember things?

918
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,230
I think he has dementia.

919
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,400
Is the sanatorium short of places

920
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,910
that he needed to go to such great lengths

921
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,980
to place a patient?

922
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,590
I've never heard of it.

923
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,910
Could he remember

924
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,390
something later?

925
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,680
Let's say,

926
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,010
he knew how Lawyer Shen died.

927
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,810
He had forgotten about it.

928
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,050
Now he suddenly remembered

929
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,130
and was to tell Dr. Fang.

930
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,150
Wait a minute.

931
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,210
If that's the case,

932
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,410
this person is also in danger now.

933
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:37,950
Someone come.

934
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,540
Three people are coming with me to the sanatorium

935
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,320
to check out someone.

936
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,200
Yes, sir.

937
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,970
Do you already know who the murderer is?

938
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,540
I really don't know.

939
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,340
I think it's Dong Cixin.

940
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,680
Why?

941
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,140
The nicotine clipping in my pocket.

942
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,110
Only she had the chance to touch my clothes.

943
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,520
She has a good reason to kill.

944
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,820
She always thought it was Fang Jianqi's fault

945
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,790
that Du Heng wasn't with her.

946
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,570
So she had a grudge.

947
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,590
Du Heng is in love with Jingxuan now.

948
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,190
She couldn't stand it, so she did it.

949
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,370
How do you explain her killing my teacher?

950
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,140
I haven't thought of that yet.

951
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,400
But there must be a story between them.

952
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,310
Don't worry.

953
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,160
The truth will soon be revealed.
