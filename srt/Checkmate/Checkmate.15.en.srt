[Episode 15]

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,259
What was it that your mother hid?

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,680
A love letter.

18
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,900
I heard from my sister-in-law that

19
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,350
the love letter seemed to say,

20
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,200
"As long as two people love each other forever,

21
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,470
why do they have to be with each other every day?"

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,020
It was probably written by my brother

23
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,630
to his lover.

24
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,200
Then my mother saw it

25
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
and wanted to hide it

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,130
from my sister-in-law.

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,630
But she didn't expect it

28
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,310
to be discovered by my sister-in-law.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,160
Didn't your mother show her the letter?

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,030
She didn't.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
Then how did she know?

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,479
How did she know?

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,210
When did she mention the letter?

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
When she divorced my brother.

35
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,760
It was my brother who filed for divorce.

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,600
At that time,

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,310
my mother had just passed away.

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,440
And in fact, my brother had a girlfriend before,

39
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,530
but they were mercilessly separated by my mother.

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,340
But your brother rarely appeared

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
after he divorced Jiang Ning.

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,470
He didn't even go to Huifangli and New World much anymore.

43
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,550
I would believe you even if you told me he became a monk at that time.

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,180
There was a communicating door

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,450
between your room and your mother's master bedroom.

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,990
Did you sleep with your sister-in-law

47
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,730
that night?

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,610
Yeah.

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,180
How did you know?

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,680
That day... My sister-in-law seemed to have figured out that

51
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,890
she thought she might have gone too far.

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,080
So that night

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,680
she tried to make amends by pouring tea for my mother.

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,400
Mother, I was wrong about what happened during the day.

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,680
I shouldn't have contradicted you.

56
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,420
Please have some tea.

57
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,430
It wasn't you I was talking to Yantong about in the morning.

58
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,700
So don't think too much about it.

59
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,980
I know.

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,329
It's good that you're not angry anymore, mother.

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
That night,

62
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,950
I don't know why I slept so soundly.

63
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,490
So I didn't hear anything

64
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,760
about what was going on in my mother's room.

65
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,960
So your mother drank the tea your sister-in-law poured for her

66
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,570
before taking the tonic?

67
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,460
Yes.

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
I actually thought about it.

69
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,310
But it was my mother who chose the tea cups,

70
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,480
so I don't think the tea could have been poisoned.

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,380
Have you tested it?

72
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,300
That day...

73
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,040
On that morning, because the police were coming,

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,050
and my sister-in-law felt that the house was too messy,

75
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,190
so she put those tea cups...

76
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,300
It was her.

77
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,440
She killed my mother, right?

78
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,970
And then she destroyed the evidence

79
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,850
in front of me, didn't she?

80
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,870
That's why my brother closed the case in a hurry.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,360
Yes.

82
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:38,990
No.

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,610
I have to go find my brother.

84
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,200
Wait.

85
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,780
Your sister-in-law probably put sleeping pills in the tea.

86
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,780
Sleeping pills?

87
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,030
You said you slept soundly that night?

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,960
Yeah.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,070
And your sister-in-law has read that letter?

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,820
Yes.

91
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,490
So her purpose in preparing the tea

92
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,180
should be to drug you,

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,730
so that she could sneak into your mother's room

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
to find the letter.

95
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,270
So after all this,

96
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,050
you still haven't found out who the murderer is, have you?

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,840
Miss Shen,

98
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,530
may I visit your house?

99
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,950
You know who the murderer is?

100
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm not sure yet.

101
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,650
Okay then.

102
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,600
I'll wait for you at home.

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,320
I think Shen Huatang

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,630
is like a different person now.

105
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,310
Whoever marries her will be able to live a rich life.

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,700
It's nice

107
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,960
to be in charge of such a big bank.

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,330
You're interested in banks?

109
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,300
I thought you only wanted to manage a musical instrument store.

110
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,340
Why are you becoming more and more similar to your mother?

111
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,430
You don't have to go to Shen Huatang later.

112
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,920
Zhao Xiaoling will arrive today.

113
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,870
Please pick her up for me.

114
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,160
She's coming back?

115
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,760
He Wannian told her that Mo died,

116
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,040
so she insisted on coming back.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,050
She'll be here soon.

118
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,150
Help me bring her here.

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,160
Okay.

120
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,170
Let's go.

121
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,630
Are you suspecting that

122
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,220
the murderer deliberately sent Xiaoling away?

123
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,490
She knows the restaurant too well.

124
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,880
If she was there at the time,

125
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,130
she would definitely remember

126
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,330
what time the bowl of noodles for Li Chengyan

127
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,590
arrived at the pick-up counter.

128
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,490
And she could even tell

129
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,740
whether the bowl of noodles was made by Moly.

130
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,850
Anyway, let's just wait for her.

131
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,690
First, let's go to the telegraph office

132
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,170
and see if there are any telegrams from Beijing.

133
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,480
With Mingzheng's efficiency,

134
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,890
there should have been a reply by now.

135
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,000
What if not?

136
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,130
Then let's send another telegram

137
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,900
to remind him.

138
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,520
Why do I feel that you are deliberately sending everyone away

139
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,430
so that you can go to Shen Huatang's house alone?

140
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,060
Bao gave me three days,

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,570
and now two days have passed.

142
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,250
What I have to solve is a poisonous murder case

143
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,380
that no one has solved in three years.

144
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,940
And I have to save the life of an ardent youth.

145
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,140
You still have time to joke with me?

146
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,870
How much more do you know about

147
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,890
the details before and after your mother and your sister-in-law quarreled?

148
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,880
I vaguely heard some things.

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,970
My mother seemed to have said something

150
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,659
to Ms. Li about cheating.

151
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,820
She also said

152
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,090
she could absolutely not let us kids know.

153
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,180
Then she had Ms. Li to hire a lawyer.

154
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,180
She said she was going to be ready for a divorce.

155
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,700
Then Ms. Li tried to persuade my mother

156
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,320
that this matter still needed to be discussed with my brother.

157
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,550
But my sister-in-law heard it.

158
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,190
She came in and started to make a scene.

159
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,670
But my mother certainly could not say that my brother did anything wrong,

160
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,180
so she kept denying it.

161
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,450
Did the lawyer come that day?

162
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,890
How could my mother hire a lawyer

163
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,120
when my sister-in-law was in such a state?

164
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,870
Is Ms. Li here?

165
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,390
I don't think she's here today.

166
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,810
She usually takes Wednesday off.

167
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,430
She probably has something to do today,

168
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,310
so she's taking the day off.

169
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,560
Is that so?

170
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,240
Yes.

171
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,430
Your mother seemed to trust her.

172
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,320
Ms. Li is very capable

173
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,790
and knows my mother very well.

174
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,250
So my mother would always discuss with her

175
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,520
about everything.

176
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Does she often take off work?

177
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,600
Not really.

178
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,260
But after my mother passed away,

179
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,840
she does take off a lot.

180
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,960
I can understand.

181
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,409
After all she is still single.

182
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,050
So it's not surprising that she goes out a lot.

183
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,410
She always takes off at night?

184
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,930
She has to take care of our family during the day.

185
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,690
As for the night,

186
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,900
we are all asleep,

187
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,010
so she can do whatever she likes.

188
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,560
Was she there the day your mother was killed?

189
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,570
I don't think so.

190
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
It was a Thursday.

191
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,840
No, she wasn't here.

192
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,840
If she was here,

193
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,450
those teacups shouldn't have been left

194
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,570
until my sister-in-law washed them the next day.

195
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,520
Could you show me your mother's bedroom?

196
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,670
Sure.

197
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,290
After my mother passed away,

198
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,240
this room has been used by Yu.

199
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,990
He said he wanted to preserve my mother's traces,

200
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,180
so he basically did not change this room.

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
I feel quite touched about this.

202
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,010
Did your mother drink anything

203
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,630
but that cup of tea

204
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,910
before going back to the room?

205
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,670
No.

206
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,110
After we talked for a few minutes,

207
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,430
my mother said she was tired

208
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,340
and then she went to her room.

209
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,210
The onset of strychnine poisoning

210
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
is only ten to twenty minutes.

211
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,420
So you're saying that

212
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,190
my mother actually died from that poison?

213
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,680
I've checked the prescription.

214
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,570
Based on the concentration of this drug,

215
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,250
one would have to drink a course of it all at once

216
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,160
to reach a lethal dose.

217
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,180
A course?

218
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,110
The medicine was sitting there at the time.

219
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,860
My mom would drink a cup every night before bed.

220
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,360
That cup was about this big.

221
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,130
But my mother

222
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,890
had to go get a new prescription

223
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,500
almost every two weeks.

224
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Who else was in your house at the time?

225
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,650
My mother, me, and my sister-in-law.

226
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,350
But Yu was not here.

227
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,330
He was at the bank all night that day

228
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
to reconcile accounts and did not return.

229
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,030
Ms. Li wasn't here either.

230
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,310
She came back the next morning.

231
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,530
Moreover, she was the one who came back

232
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,020
and found out that my mother had died.

233
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,200
Then she went to the police.

234
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
The door was still locked at that time.

235
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,090
Really?

236
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,130
Yes.

237
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
I remember you said

238
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,240
there was a communicating door between those two rooms.

239
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,230
Yep.

240
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,350
My sister-in-law slept with me that day.

241
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,020
Could it be that my sister-in-law went in

242
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,320
and gave my mother something to drink?

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,760
Where is the door?

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,520
In Yu's room.

245
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,560
We removed that door

246
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,600
because it is Yu who lives there now.

247
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,170
It's right behind the dresser.

248
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,760
Ms. Li went back to her room to find your mother

249
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,330
and found her dead in the room.

250
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,730
After that, you all thought that Yu Daren was the murderer,

251
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,760
so the police...

252
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,630
No, it was Ms. Li who said that.

253
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,290
She said the murderer must be Yu.

254
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,690
And she also said that Yu must have had another lover.

255
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,690
He was afraid that my mother would find out.

256
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,450
So he killed my mother

257
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,410
first.

258
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,900
But I don't think so.

259
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,680
He didn't have time to commit the crime at all,

260
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
because he wasn't home at all in those days.

261
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,210
Why would Ms. Li think that

262
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,520
Yu Daren was the murderer?

263
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,140
They couldn't get along at all.

264
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,550
I saw them arguing

265
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,080
just two days before the murder.

266
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,350
You'd better stay away from her.

267
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,440
Remember who you are.

268
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,910
Keep your distance from her.

269
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,320
You...

270
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't understand.

271
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,590
What are you... What are you worried about?

272
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,480
Ms. Li used to tell us to watch out for Yu.

273
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,100
But if he really had a lover,

274
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,990
he would have brought her back in the past few years.

275
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,940
But he did put all his heart

276
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,080
into running the bank.

277
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,000
So I think what happened back then

278
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,820
might really be a misunderstanding.

279
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,360
Ms. Li has been with your mother since she was a child?

280
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,380
Nope.

281
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,910
She has been in my family for almost ten years.

282
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,560
But she knew my mother very well,

283
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
and they

284
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,540
often thought the same way.

285
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,780
So my mom would ask her

286
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,870
about everything.

287
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,330
Do you know where she usually goes

288
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,950
when she's on vacation?

289
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,790
I don't know.

290
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,770
And it isn't appropriate for me to ask her that.

291
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,480
After all, it's impolite.

292
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,240
Mr. Situ,

293
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,990
wasn't my mother's death really an accident?

294
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,440
I need to do some more research on this.

295
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,910
Okay. Regardless of the outcome,

296
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
I would like to thank you.

297
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,240
Thank you for caring about a case that

298
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,210
has been ignored for three years.

299
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,770
It will be a great kindness to our family

300
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,880
if you really find out the truth

301
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,740
in the end.

302
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,810
You're welcome, Miss Shen.

303
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,240
Finding the truth is the duty of a detective.

304
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,380
It is a duty to you,

305
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,590
but a favor to me.

306
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,930
I've heard that Mr. Yu is very busy.

307
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,880
He counts everything in minutes.

308
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,330
Anyone who needs to see him has to make an appointment.

309
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,830
He's a workaholic.

310
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,930
Please tell him

311
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,070
to set aside an hour later today

312
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,360
no matter what.

313
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,730
I'll visit you again.

314
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,550
OK. Bye.

315
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,010
Situ,

316
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,160
I'll wait for your good news.

317
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,520
Go back to the bank.

318
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,250
You really sent us away

319
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,920
to spend time with her alone?

320
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,010
That's good.

321
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,850
Looks like I have to

322
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,950
congratulate you in advance.

323
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,150
Originally, I was going to be a matrilocal son-in-law,

324
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,850
but Shen Baifeng has left the entire bank

325
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,900
to Yu Daren.

326
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,450
You think it's a pity?

327
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,790
Not really.

328
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,900
I actually like the ones who are a bit older than me.

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,610
What did you say?

330
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,430
Any news from Wang Mingzheng?

331
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,380
How are you doing? I hope this letter finds you well.

332
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,670
I heard that our teacher passed away.

333
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,800
You can return at any time if you don't have a place to stay in Harbin.

334
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,690
I'll keep your house

335
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,040
in Beijing for you.

336
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,400
I already have news of the incident you asked me to inquire about.

337
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,560
But I'm afraid I can't go into details by telegram,

338
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,410
so I'm sending you an expedited letter.

339
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,070
I hope I won't delay your business.

340
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,550
Cheng Xiangjun and Li Yantong are classmates?

341
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,010
Mr. Yu.

342
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,170
It's me, Cheng Xiangjun.

343
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,350
Ms. Li?

344
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,530
I'm here to close the case.

345
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,520
The Cheng Xiangjun I met before is Li Yantong.

346
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,530
Do me a favor.

347
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,700
Go find Shen Baifeng's dossier.

348
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,270
I want to confirm one other thing.

349
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,750
But I still can't figure out

350
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,040
why they wanted to kill Li Chengyan

351
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,050
and pretend that it was Moly who did this?

352
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,880
Li Chengyan was not just a tavern owner.

353
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,410
He had a criminal record of fraud.

354
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
He had been running the tavern for a few years

355
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,270
and not been able to make ends meet.

356
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,410
But he still kept it open.

357
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,480
Why do you think he did this?

358
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,870
I'll go find Sergeant Bao now.

359
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,950
I only need one thing,

360
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,790
and that is Shen Baifeng's prescription.

361
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,250
I need its specific prescribing time.

362
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:44,600
Doctor.

363
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,760
Sir, what can I do for you?

364
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,460
I want to find a good pharmacist

365
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,910
and I have questions to consult.

366
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,500
I'll pay.

367
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,430
Qiming.

368
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,230
Situ.

369
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,609
I found out something

370
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,569
and I don't know if it's useful.

371
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,210
Please take a look at it later.

372
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,730
Situ, why are you back alone?

373
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,630
They all have something to do.

374
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,470
Who cares.

375
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,200
I made Stewed Chick with Mushroom today

376
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,560
and you all have to come back for dinner.

377
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,720
Jin,

378
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,630
stay for dinner.

379
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,569
That' s very kind of you,

380
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,359
thanks.

381
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,380
I haven't had home made Stewed Chick with Mushroom

382
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,630
for a long time.

383
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,060
Then please have more later.

384
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I checked with the seller and he said

385
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,380
the house in Plain Lane was bought by

386
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,000
the Feng family eight years ago.

387
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,310
Mr. Feng has never shown up since the beginning,

388
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,840
and it was always Mrs. Feng who communicated with him at that time.

389
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,050
According to him,

390
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,940
Mrs. Feng looked well-born,

391
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,920
tall, beautiful,

392
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,060
and quite generous.

393
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,930
Is there any more specific whereabouts of them?

394
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,650
It's similar to what Mr. Luo said.

395
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,130
Mrs. Feng rarely goes out,

396
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,080
and every time neighbors see her is basically on Wednesdays.

397
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,950
As for Mr. Feng,

398
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,040
no one has seen him.

399
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,140
It is said that he comes home every time in the middle of the night,

400
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,140
and then leaves before dawn.

401
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,570
Wednesday?

402
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,210
So is there any specific description

403
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,380
of Mrs. Feng's appearance?

404
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,590
I drew a picture.

405
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,040
-Hi, Qiming. -Hi, Miss Zhou.

406
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,960
I've got the prescription.

407
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,930
She took this medicine for a total of about four months.

408
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,870
And she would pick it up every two weeks.

409
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,620
There was a slip each fourteen days.

410
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,130
The latest one is for October 26th.

411
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,710
From October 26th to November 9th,

412
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,820
there was a fifteen-day interval.

413
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,810
Then Shen Baifeng died of poisoning.

414
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,290
As I expected.

415
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,860
[Harbin]

416
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,030
Mr. Luo.

417
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,690
Zhao Xiaoling?

418
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,040
Follow me.

419
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:40,950
Wait.

420
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,610
There's a payment slip missing here.

421
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,740
Aren't these all here?

422
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,710
Whose is missing?

423
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,480
Cheng Xiangjun's.

424
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,560
You're right.

425
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,020
She was the one who packed the medicine.

426
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
We forgot about that.

427
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,690
The payment slip for the takeaway

428
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,730
should have been packed away in the bag with it.

429
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,310
I'm home.

430
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,700
Here.

431
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,540
Mo

432
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,870
really dead?

433
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,040
Do I have a chance to see him one last time?

434
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,630
He wasn't a man who would kill himself.

435
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,580
I know.

436
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,590
Who is the murderer?

437
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,820
That's why I asked you to come.

438
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,970
There's something

439
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,750
I need to confirm with you.

440
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
Why did you go to Manzhouli?

441
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,740
Yunfeng, my fiance,

442
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,100
found a well-paying job

443
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,300
in Manzhouli.

444
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,280
He had to let me come over.

445
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,510
When I arrived, I found out that

446
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,170
they were looking for a driver

447
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,120
and a nanny.

448
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,600
But... They wanted a couple.

449
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
They said it was for safety

450
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,790
and the pay was extraordinarily high.

451
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,670
He kept persuading me that

452
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,410
it was a good opportunity,

453
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,370
so I agreed.

454
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,800
What is the name of your employer?

455
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,450
It seems to be...

456
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,790
There's a food factory...

457
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,210
The name is...

458
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,520
Yuxin Food Factory?

459
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,120
How did you know?

460
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,760
Baifeng has an industry in Manzhouli?

461
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,040
Yes, Yuxin Food Factory.

462
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,670
It's a partnership between her and the Sun family.

463
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,250
Yu Daren's

464
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,880
distant relative

465
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,750
is managing the factory there.

466
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,870
Look at this.

467
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,640
He brought good luck to his whole family.

468
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,830
That's it.

469
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,910
Do me a favor.

470
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,400
Go to Shen's house to find Shen Huatang,

471
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,670
and ask her to invite Yu Daren and Li Yantong

472
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,130
to come to the Jasmine Restaurant.

473
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,280
I'll make sure they come.

474
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,940
Mr. Yu, what a coincidence.

475
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,240
Just say what you want to say.

476
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,700
My time is precious.

477
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,550
Of course I know that, Mr. Yu.

478
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
But don't worry.

479
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
I won't let you waste your time today.

480
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,010
Guys,

481
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,990
I have invited you here because of a homicide

482
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,900
that took place here on the 16th of this month.

483
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,980
Moly, the owner and chef of this restaurant,

484
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,960
was shot dead.

485
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,920
All of you were here at the scene.

486
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,380
Now, I would like to ask you to go back to the details

487
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,590
before and after the crime.

488
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,910
Is it true that Mo did not die from suicide?

489
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,420
No.

490
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,780
He was shot

491
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,240
and then disguised as a suicide.

492
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,030
On that day, the murderer came to the Jasmine Restaurant for dinner.

493
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,590
After ordering, he went to the back kitchen

494
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,020
and killed Moly.

495
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,100
Then he returned to his place

496
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,840
to continue his meal.

497
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,160
That's not right.

498
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,180
I didn't see

499
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,900
anyone go into the back kitchen and then come out.

500
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,640
It's normal that you didn't see it.

501
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,060
Because the murderer's excuse was to go to the bathroom.

502
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,690
But someone saw the murderer.

503
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,130
That person came because of him,

504
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,350
so paid extra attention to him.

505
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,640
Unfortunately,

506
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,550
this witness couldn't come to the scene today.

507
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
Because he is now covered in bruises and is still being locked up.

508
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,290
He will be shot tomorrow

509
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,030
if I can't catch the real killer today.

510
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,070
So I'll speak for him.

511
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,880
He saw the man go to the bathroom

512
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,000
and came out soon after.

513
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,130
We all thought he went to the bathroom.

514
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,040
But in fact,

515
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,520
he went to the kitchen opposite the bathroom.

516
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,650
Mr. Yu, why are you in the kitchen?

517
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,550
I want to order a side of mashed potato.

518
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,390
Just tell the waiter.

519
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,710
You don't have to come to the kitchen yourself.

520
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,110
I am here to see you.

521
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,930
Then he quickly shot Moly.

522
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,320
I was actually misled by the murderer at first,

523
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,720
and I thought they were targeting Moly.

524
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,800
So I never suspected them.

525
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,560
That was a brilliant move.

526
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,060
Their target was actually Li Chengyan,

527
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,320
and Moly

528
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,360
was just someone they used to get out of the suspicion.

529
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,840
Wait.

530
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,540
If Moly had been killed at that time,

531
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,920
then how was the bowl of noodles

532
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,590
that poisoned Li Chengyan

533
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,920
at 12:30 made?

534
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm really not interested in

535
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,130
listening to your analysis of a case

536
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,840
that has been closed here.

537
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,680
There is one more thing I don't understand.

538
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,240
What exactly do you mean

539
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,030
by wasting everyone's time

540
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,040
for a death row inmate?

541
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,600
Chen Qingshan had no chance to approach that bowl of noodles at all.

542
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,070
How could he be the murderer?

543
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,330
You're asking me?

544
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,700
How would I know how he did it.

545
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,220
And I have no interest in knowing it.

546
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,360
All I know is that I ate my own bowl of noodles,

547
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,720
which gave me a feeling of escaping from dead.

548
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,920
Mr. Yu, do you remember that

549
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,080
I said "they"?

550
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:02,930
What do you mean?

551
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:04,930
Mr. He,

552
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,800
how many servings of meat sauce spaghetti did you sell that day?

553
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,340
I think it was two?

554
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,280
Two?

555
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,800
Think about it.

556
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,760
How many did the customers order?

557
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,730
I have been to more than a dozen restaurants

558
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
around here,

559
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,690
and yours is the one that suits me the most.

560
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,430
After I had...

561
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,730
There was a female customer before, Cheng Xiangjun,

562
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,790
who seemed to have ordered meat sauce spaghetti as well.

563
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,340
She packed it up and took it away.

564
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,880
The payment slip... The payment slip was inside the bag.

565
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,720
Before Li Chengyan ordered,

566
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,510
there were already two servings of meat sauce spaghetti.

567
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,660
The other one

568
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,600
was Cheng Xiangjun’s, right?

569
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,720
Mr. Yu,

570
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,240
you just killed Moly,

571
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,070
and you left the rest

572
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:52,770
to your partner.

573
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,420
How about I get you some medicine?

574
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,990
Don't worry. I sell medicine myself.

575
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,980
It's not a big deal.

576
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,180
I'm leaving now.

577
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,650
Your partner quickly entered the back kitchen.

578
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,830
She immediately put down the takeaway

579
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,150
and hid Moly's body

580
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,670
after putting on her gloves.

581
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,320
Then she shoved the gun into his hand.

582
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,410
After that, she adjusted his body into a suicide position

583
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,050
and quickly dealt with the dragging marks.

584
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,330
Then

585
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,660
she poured out the packaged spaghetti

586
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,340
disguised as Moly's work

587
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,970
and put it at the food pick-up counter.

588
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,970
At that time,

589
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,700
Li Chengyan also arrived at the restaurant.

590
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,400
Next, you just

591
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,730
had to wait for

592
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,050
the bowl of meat sauce spaghetti with rat poison

593
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,500
to be brought to his table.

594
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,650
Cheng Xiangjun, who finished her task,

595
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
left the place very quickly.

596
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,130
And Chen Qingshan also

597
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,860
sneaked out of Jasmine Restaurant

598
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,020
from the back kitchen a few moments later.

599
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,980
This is the origin

600
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,140
of the bowl of poison noodles at 12:30

601
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,500
and the reason why Chen Qingshan saw no one in the back kitchen

602
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,410
when he left.

603
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,760
No wonder I didn't hear the bell.

604
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,600
I thought I was distracted again.

605
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,650
What a great story.

606
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,590
I can't help but applaud you.

607
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,800
Mr. Situ,

608
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,040
you slandered me

609
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,280
for that death row inmate,

610
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,460
and went so far as to fabricate an accomplice for me.

611
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,400
Fine.

612
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,520
Then why don't you call that accomplice here now

613
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,100
and let her identify me in person?

614
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,440
Cheng Xiangjun couldn't come.

615
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,790
You are worthy of being

616
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,810
a scheming banker.

617
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Cheng Xiangjun

618
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,360
will never be able to identify you.

619
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,120
Why?

620
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,500
Yu.

621
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,840
Finding this person can also prove your innocence.

622
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,720
She has been dead for half a month.

623
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,160
What?

624
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,220
Another dead person?

625
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,250
Your witness is either a dead person

626
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,480
or someone about to be executed.

627
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,500
Sergeant Bao,

628
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,510
I believe

629
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,290
this is an organized conspiracy

630
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,480
against me.

631
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,440
I demand that you

632
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,200
immediately arrest this nonsense person

633
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
who has tarnished my reputation.

634
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,800
Well.

635
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,430
Then I will go to your chief now.

636
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,520
No, I'm going to the mayor.

637
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I will make you

638
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,150
pay for this.

639
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
Stop right there!

640
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,400
None of you will be allowed to leave today

641
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
until you hear him out.

642
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:33,980
You...

643
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,900
I'll be responsible for these.

644
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,640
This...

645
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,810
Take it easy, Mr. Yu.

646
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,730
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

647
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,520
That's right,

648
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
Cheng Xiangjun can't come.

649
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,960
But the person in charge of packing and poisoning can come.

650
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,660
And she is here.

651
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,480
Am I right,

652
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,380
Ms. Li Yantong?

653
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,720
Why did you kill Li Chengyan?

654
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,420
Who?

655
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,200
Me?

656
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,990
Did you forget that

657
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,990
we met at the front gate of the restaurant?

658
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,480
Are you insane?

659
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,200
I haven't seen you.

660
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,680
Right, it was definitely Cheng Xiangjun who came that day.

661
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,170
She has been coming to us to pack food

662
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,310
since she came to Harbin.

663
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,160
I couldn't be wrong.

664
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,230
What if it was Li Yantong

665
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,370
who came from the beginning?

666
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,980
Don't be ridiculous.

667
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,820
They don't look alike.

668
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,830
They seem... kind of alike.

669
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,690
Situ,

670
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,850
are you saying that Cheng Xiangjun

671
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,270
has always been played by Li Yantong?

672
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,700
I don't care if you are crazy or mentally ill.

673
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,410
But you should stop making up

674
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,110
this kind of plot.

675
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,070
How about I recommend you to work at the newspaper?

676
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,010
You will earn a lot by making up stories there.

677
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,450
Enough. Shut up.

678
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
Let me ask you.

679
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,220
If it was Ms. Li who came that day,

680
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,520
then what about Cheng Xiangjun?

681
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,630
Or is there no such person at all?

682
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,480
Of course there is.

683
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,220
She is in the box you found on Plain Lane.

684
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,210
Wait...

685
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,040
Didn't you say that the body in that box

686
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,400
wasn't Cheng Xiangjun?

687
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,240
That was not the Cheng Xiangjun you saw on the day of the murder,

688
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,860
but the real

689
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,020
Cheng Xiangjun.

690
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,120
Who killed her?

691
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,910
Mr. Feng and Mrs. Feng.

692
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,810
Well...

693
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,390
My mind is a little messed up right now.

694
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
One moment you said that the corpse was Mrs. Feng,

695
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,880
and the next moment you said it was Cheng Xiangjun.

696
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,480
Then who is she?

697
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,880
That's how brilliant this murderer is.

698
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,140
In order to make me think that the corpse was not the Cheng Xiangjun of that day,

699
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,840
she did not leave any wounds

700
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,060
on the wrist of the body.

701
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,160
And she deliberately wore a pair of new shoes

702
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,700
of the same style that would drop bows

703
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,250
in front of me.

704
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,330
But anything can go wrong.

705
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,060
Mrs. Feng has size five feet,

706
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,380
while the real Cheng Xiangjun was wearing a size four shoe.

707
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,000
The shoes on the body happened to be a size four.

708
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,640
Even if that's the case,

709
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,920
what does the killing of Cheng Xiangjun by Mr. Feng and Mrs. Feng

710
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,930
have anything to do with Mr. Yu, Ms. Li

711
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
and Li Chengyan?

712
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,770
Well. I think you're messing this up

713
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,650
more and more now.

714
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,030
Li Chengyan was related to Cheng Xiangjun.

715
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,060
When I searched their belongings,

716
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,030
I found that they both took the Orient Express to Harbin

717
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,240
on December 8.

718
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,600
One says No.2 room in first-class compartment,

719
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,490
And the other one says No.3 room in first-class compartment.

720
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,270
As I recall, these two rooms were connected.

721
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,530
And I found this pair of stockings

722
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,770
in Li Chengyan's room.

723
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,270
The size and style

724
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,660
were exactly the same as Cheng Xiangjun’s.

725
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,480
That means they have known each other for a long time?

726
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,610
Since they didn't book the same hotel

727
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,070
in Harbin,

728
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,940
I guess they met on the train.

729
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,040
May I sit here?

730
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,470
Sure.

731
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,050
What else would you like to eat?

732
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,160
This meal is on me.

733
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,210
Would you like a glass of whisky?

734
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,639
It's Irish whiskey.

735
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,920
It's not a good time to do business.

736
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,760
I don't have much chance in Harbin.

737
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,250
I have a friend in Harbin

738
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,139
who is the chairman of Zhongji Bank,

739
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,420
named Yu Daren.

740
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,980
How did you meet him?

741
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,770
His wife is my best friend,

742
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,159
a classmate I met when I was studying medicine.

743
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,989
They must be very well-connected.

744
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,870
Mr. Yu.

745
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,300
It's me, Cheng Xiangjun.

746
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,880
Your wife and I used to be classmates.

747
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,070
We had dinner together.

748
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,950
So the one I saw that day was the real Cheng Xiangjun?

749
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,720
But she said that your wife was her classmate,

750
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,830
so how could my mother be her classmate?

751
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,800
Yu, what's going on here?

752
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,670
How would I know?

753
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,570
I don't even know her.

754
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,160
Really?

755
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,360
Look at this.

756
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,200
Isn't that Li Yantong?

757
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,200
Yu, have you ever been with Ms. Li?

758
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,040
Yes, we were together.

759
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,360
But we broke up ten years ago.

760
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,220
It was a coincidence that we met at Shen's house.

761
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,800
I know that he is a heartless person

762
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,660
who only has career in his heart.

763
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,170
That's why I opposed to Madam's marriage with him.

764
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,510
It's not easy to find a good job.

765
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,780
So we both didn't mention the past

766
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,690
and just wanted to get on with our lives.

767
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,830
Is there a problem with that?

768
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,910
Enough.

769
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
These are all private matters.

770
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,860
What does this have to do with

771
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,890
Mr. and Mrs. Feng killing Cheng Xiangjun?

772
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Of course the two things are related.

773
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,800
I told you

774
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,250
I would tell you

775
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,790
the connection between these two cases.

776
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,980
Mr. Feng and Mrs. Feng

777
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,780
are Yu Daren and Li Yantong.

778
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,380
They have never been separated.

779
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,930
The house on Plain Lane

780
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,640
was their usual dating place.

781
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,720
Mr. Yu is so famous

782
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,600
that he only dares to go there at night.

783
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,470
So no one has ever seen him.

784
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,050
And Ms. Li would go there every Wednesday.

785
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,470
That's why

786
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,150
those people only got to see Mrs. Feng on Wednesdays.

787
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,460
Mrs. Feng has been living with us for three years.

788
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,620
And I haven't seen Mr. Feng once.

789
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,770
Is Ms. Li here?

790
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,840
She usually takes Wednesday off.

791
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,410
She probably has something to do today,

792
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,370
so she's taking the day off.

793
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,000
She always takes off at night?

794
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
She has to take care of our family during the day.

795
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,050
As for the night,

796
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,200
we are all asleep,

797
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,430
so she can do whatever she likes.

798
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,920
She was deliberately trying to dress plainly.

799
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,330
She was trying to conceal her other identity,

800
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,170
but refused to condescend to use the cheap stuff.

801
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,720
Mrs. Feng, your shoes are also size five, right?

802
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Nonsense.

803
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,250
There are thousands of people in Harbin with five-yard feet.

804
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,370
Are all of them Mrs. Feng?

805
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,160
And what reason do I have to kill Cheng Xiangjun?

806
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,450
This is related to

807
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,330
another case of the Shen family,

808
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,460
the death of Shen Baifeng.

809
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,730
Cheng Xiangjun must have felt very strange

810
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,280
after meeting Yu Daren.

811
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,130
In fact, as long as she investigated it,

812
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,510
it would be not difficult to find out how Shen Baifeng died.

813
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,000
Others might think it was an accident,

814
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,760
but she studied medicine like you.

815
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,660
This case has been closed.

816
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,790
That was an accident.

817
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,480
On Wednesday, November 8, 1922,

818
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Ms. Li was on vacation.

819
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,660
And Yu Daren, the banker, reconciled all night at the end of the season.

820
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,470
The power went out at Shen's house at this time.

821
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,570
Everything would have been perfect

822
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,520
if Mrs. Shen had been killed at this time.

823
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
So someone deliberately cut the cable,

824
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,240
in order to let Shen Baifeng drink

825
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,040
the tonic that killed her unknowingly

826
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,020
in the dark.

827
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,800
Wait.

828
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,600
Both of them were not at home that day,

829
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,410
then how did they put poison into the tonic?

830
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,810
No one dropped poison.

831
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,570
They just had to use the strychnine

832
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,300
that was already in the cosmetic pills.

833
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,090
This was prepared

834
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,470
according to the recipe of cosmetic pills back then.

835
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,690
Strychnine will react with bromine

836
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
to form precipitates.

837
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,310
This is why Shen Baifeng drank the lethal amount of

838
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,730
strychnine at one time

839
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,290
when she took the medicine for the last time.

840
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,870
That night was the night when power went off in the Shen family.

841
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,280
The cycle for Shen Baifeng to drink a bottle of medicine was fourteen days.

842
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,560
You had already put the bromide in,

843
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,970
and then waited for

844
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,040
the day when she finally drank the concentrated strychnine

845
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,240
to create an alibi for both of you.

846
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,600
Then,

847
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,620
you pretended to fight.

848
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm telling you,

849
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,610
stay away from Shen Huatang.

850
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,620
Remember who you are.

851
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,210
Keep your distance from her.

852
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:30,560
You...

853
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,790
I don't understand.

854
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,810
What are you... What are you worried about?

855
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,720
It was him, but it seemed not.

856
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,240
Li Yantong pretended to be Yu Daren

857
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,490
and went to the hospital to buy strychnine

858
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,360
to make him a suspect.

859
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,240
Then the witness cleared the suspicion for the suspect.

860
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,680
You determined that

861
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,610
the police would not suspect the same person twice.

862
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,610
Your mother actually lived one more day

863
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,840
than planned.

864
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,450
Because she went to her daughter's birthday party

865
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,780
and was so tired that she had forgot to take her medicine.

866
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,640
The quarrel you heard the next day

867
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,130
had nothing to do with your brother either.

868
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,850
Because your mother found a love letter written by Yu Daren

869
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,970
to another woman.

870
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,120
But what she didn't know was that

871
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,440
the recipient

872
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,330
was none other than her most trusted Ms. Li.

873
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,410
She even told Ms. Li to get a lawyer

874
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,490
to amend the will.

875
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,670
And this lawyer

876
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
certainly didn't get to come.

877
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,290
Li Yantong...

878
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,970
You are lying.

879
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,850
Do you have evidence?

880
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,600
No.

881
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,910
In fact, neither did Cheng Xiangjun.

882
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,940
She didn't have to die.

883
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,080
Unfortunately,

884
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,760
the new friend she met

885
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,000
is a gentleman on the surface,

886
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,500
but a habitual fraudster

887
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,350
in fact.

888
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,880
I broke up with Yu Daren long ago.

889
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,440
You will make people misunderstand

890
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,110
if you go to him like this.

891
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,610
I didn't think so much about it.

892
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,050
You were both engaged back then.

893
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,190
I thought you were married.

894
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,410
Why did you two break up?

895
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,140
I've been busy these days.

896
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,050
How about this?

897
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,210
Why don't you wait until I'm done?

898
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,500
Then I'll show you around.

899
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,020
Where are you working now?

900
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,270
I'll come find you.

901
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,570
It's not convenient.

902
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,110
I'm working as a housekeeper in someone else's house.

903
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,260
I'll come to you when I'm free,

904
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,160
okay?

905
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,480
Okay.

906
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,410
Do you know

907
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,790
how Yu Daren became the chairman?

908
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,160
He used to be an employee,

909
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,120
and then married the major shareholder of Zhongji Bank.

910
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,480
After his wife died a few years ago,

911
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,280
he inherited that bank.

912
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,900
How did she die?

913
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,160
The tonic she drank contained strychnine.

914
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,970
She drank too much and was poisoned.

915
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,790
How was that possible?

916
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,730
And Li Yantong

917
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,560
is working as a housekeeper in his house.

918
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,430
I'd like to investigate them.

919
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,550
Look at your friends.

920
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,720
[I know what you have done to Shen Baifeng, prepare me a hundred thousand cash.]

921
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,560
It must be Cheng Xiangjun.

922
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,970
This happened as soon as she came.

923
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I'll go talk to her.

924
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,550
We must put an end to this kind of matter once and for all.
