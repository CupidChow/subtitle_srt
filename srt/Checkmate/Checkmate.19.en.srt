1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,680
The morphine was in the pocket of the clothes

3
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,840
while the clothes were in the closet.

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,680
I want to check out An Qiuzi's room again.

5
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,080
Okay.

6
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,600
I see.

7
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,079
What?

8
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,760
Nothing.

9
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,680
I'd like to see your father's old painting again.

10
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,800
Okay.

11
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,440
This is my father's studio.

12
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
And this is...

13
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,240
This should be the foreign woman he painted.

14
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,120
There is something

15
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,040
I think is true.

16
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,079
What?

17
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,360
Your father never really wanted

18
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
to abandon you.

19
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,040
He actually loved you very much.

20
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,120
Yes, he did.

21
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,480
He loved his child,

22
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,600
but not her mother.

23
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
He wouldn't abandon his kid.

24
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,640
But he wanted to abandon his whole family.

25
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,160
He's a scumbag.

26
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,040
In fact, his biggest fault is selfishness,

27
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,520
not betrayal.

28
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,600
That's right.

29
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
Just like men always say,

30
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
"Die for a beauty".

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,760
That's your biggest wish.

32
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,720
I don't mean that.

33
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,200
We are entrusted by

34
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,920
the descendant of the Zhou family.

35
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,480
And I'd like to thank you for

36
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,440
coming back for the reinvestigation of the case.

37
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,560
Thank you for coming all the way from Russia

38
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
to this

39
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,240
sad place.

40
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,600
That woman

41
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,280
has ruined my life.

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,920
I'll never forget her.

43
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,520
I'd like to see

44
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,480
how unfortunate she and her descendants are.

45
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,440
Well, you may get disappointed.

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,280
You know this place well, don't you?

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,880
Yes, I do.

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,760
I've never forgotten it.

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
In the world of love, there is no third party.

50
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,400
The unloved is the outsider.

51
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
A smart person should learn to

52
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,120
leave with dignity.

53
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,640
You…

54
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,360
But the way you left was not decent either.

55
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm not the one who should leave.

56
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,720
It was known in Fengtian

57
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,960
that I should be the lady of the house.

58
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,200
On the morning of the murder,

59
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,480
Li Yuanpu heard the two of them arguing.

60
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,120
But he only heard the last few words.

61
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
I think you should have heard the whole thing.

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,760
What else could it be?

63
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,520
It was just Zhou Ze asking for a divorce

64
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
and Fang Huaijin trying to make excuses

65
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,640
to refuse it.

66
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,400
She mentioned their kid

67
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,080
and An Qiuzi who depended on them for living.

68
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,400
Zhou Ze didn't want to argue with Fang Huaijin

69
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,160
about this anymore.

70
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
While we were painting,

71
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,520
she came to fight again.

72
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,040
What's wrong?

73
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,440
What do you want me to do?

74
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,200
I want it to be more intense,

75
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
more creative,

76
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,280
and hotter.

77
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,760
But there is always

78
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,840
something missing.

79
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,120
Is this hot enough?

80
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,320
Excuse me.

81
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,680
I still want to talk to you.

82
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,600
I feel cold.

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,440
I'll go back and get a shawl.

84
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,480
When I came back,

85
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,560
their fight was over.

86
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,200
How long did they fight?

87
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,240
A long time.

88
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,440
Zhou Ze asked her to get a drink.

89
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I asked her to get me a drink too.

90
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,400
She gave me a vicious glare.

91
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,760
After she fetched the alcohol,

92
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,360
Zhou Ze taunted her.

93
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,840
Here.

94
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:06,960
Take it away.

95
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,600
I'll do it.

96
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,120
Come on.

97
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,680
How come everything I drank is sour?

98
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,520
Fang Huaijin was so angry that she stood there shivering

99
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,679
when hearing this.

100
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,320
After that, was there something wrong

101
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,400
with Zhou Ze?

102
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,040
No.

103
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,640
He found inspiration

104
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,400
because of me.

105
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,280
He lost interest in everything else.

106
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
He didn't even eat.

107
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,280
He just wanted to enjoy his painting.

108
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
I see.

109
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,040
So I thought

110
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,800
Fang Huaijin might have wanted to kill me.

111
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,760
But by mistake,

112
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
I survived.

113
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,560
But I might as well be dead.

114
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,080
Why can they be a ghost couple?

115
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,200
There was

116
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,280
no room for you between them.

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
You know what?

118
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,280
Actually, Zhou Ze never wanted to divorce Fang Huaijin

119
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,200
from the beginning to the end.

120
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,640
He dealt with you

121
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,360
just to finish the painting.

122
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
You're lying.

123
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
In fact, you know

124
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,080
what I said is the truth.

125
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,200
Everyone knew that Zhou Ze was in love with me.

126
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,720
Only I could inspire him.

127
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,320
It's ridiculous.

128
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,080
All third parties are the same.

129
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,520
You know you're in love with a scumbag.

130
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,080
But you always think you're the exception

131
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,680
and fantasize about being his only one, right?

132
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
Uncle Li asked me to pick you up.

133
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,520
The lab is ready.

134
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,640
I've made an arrangement.

135
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,960
Let's talk in the lab.

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
I invited you all here today

137
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,920
to restore

138
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,000
the events of the day of the crime and the day before

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,320
so that we can find out

140
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,840
the real murderer who has been hiding for years.

141
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,880
The murderer is Fang Huaijin.

142
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,640
There is no doubt.

143
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,480
What did you hear

144
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
the morning

145
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
when Zhou Ze and Fang Huaijin were fighting?

146
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,400
I've already told you.

147
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,480
It's the same thing.

148
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,960
They were arguing about who was right and who was wrong.

149
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,240
No.

150
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,280
It's more than that.

151
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,600
Does it matter?

152
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,880
The murderer will not change

153
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,200
because of what they fought about.

154
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,880
What if Zhou Ze didn't want to divorce Fang Huaijin

155
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,360
and Fang Huaijin was defending Ge Ai?

156
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,440
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,240
Do I need her to defend me?

158
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,080
Did she know what art is?

159
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,800
Did she know what schools of painting there are?

160
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,400
Could she match Zhou Ze's aesthetics?

161
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,360
She couldn't even buy the right paint.

162
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,560
Zhou Ze had been fed up with her for a long time.

163
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,160
Yes.

164
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,120
Compared to you,

165
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,600
Fang Huaijin was ordinary.

166
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,400
Her life was all about her family.

167
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,720
You could bring Zhou Ze passion and inspiration.

168
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,760
She couldn't.

169
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,400
But you couldn't take care of

170
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Zhou Ze's life and living.

171
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,280
So it's impossible for Zhou Ze to

172
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,600
divorce Fang Huaijin.

173
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,600
If I'm right,

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,760
they were talking about

175
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,800
kicking you out

176
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,000
when Zhou Ze finished that picture.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
No way.

178
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,360
Zhou Ze said he'd divorce Fang Huaijin.

179
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,560
We all heard that.

180
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,640
Think carefully about what he said.

181
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,160
I told you there's no such thing.

182
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,240
What do you want?

183
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Divorce, right?

184
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Fine, I'll do it.

185
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Why are you always surrounded by

186
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,840
so many women?

187
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,000
One after another.

188
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,040
How can you be so cruel?

189
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,800
I don't want to talk about it now.

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Let's talk about it later.

191
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,720
But we're already talking about it.

192
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,600
Will you stop fooling around?

193
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,440
You always think nonsense.

194
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,520
Can't you just leave me alone?

195
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,640
I'm serious.

196
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,160
What are you going to do again?

197
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,240
Let's go to the backyard.

198
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
I've been thinking about something.

199
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,320
Emotions.

200
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,920
If

201
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
Zhou Ze wanted to divorce Fang Huaijin,

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,480
they couldn't have had

203
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,760
these emotions.

204
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,520
What happened that morning can only make sense

205
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,680
with the following speculation.

206
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,160
Zhou Ze didn't want to divorce Fang Huaijin at all.

207
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,560
He also didn't want to waste time

208
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,720
for this.

209
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,480
He was angry with you

210
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,920
because you upset Fang Huaijin

211
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,520
and thus prevented the finishing of the painting.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,440
In Chinese,

213
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,080
it's called taking things out of context.

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
You're making up the story.

215
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,040
Situ Yan.

216
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
I know you are capable.

217
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,520
But I have to say,

218
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,240
this is absurd.

219
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
It's not absurd at all.

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,440
Later, Zhou Ze left the living room to paint in the backyard.

221
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,840
Fang Huaijin got uneasy.

222
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,480
She was unsure of Zhou Ze's thoughts.

223
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
So she decided to confront Zhou Ze

224
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,640
face to face.

225
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
Only then did Zhou Ze say that.

226
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,200
How many times have I told you?

227
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
I'll pack her bags

228
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,560
and send her away now, okay?

229
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,440
That's how you treat her?

230
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,560
Then how should I treat her?

231
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,200
You tell me how I should treat her.

232
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,800
I can't do this.

233
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,280
I can't do that.

234
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,480
She can't stay here, nor can she be sent away.

235
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Tell me.

236
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,320
How many more people are you going to hurt?

237
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,400
Okay.

238
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,680
I... I don't want to discuss this with you anymore.

239
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
I don't want to waste any more time, okay?

240
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,720
Zhou Ze had claimed to send An Qiuzi away many times

241
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,920
in the heat of the moment.

242
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Of course, Fang Huaijin knew he didn't mean it.

243
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,840
So she wouldn't even take it seriously.

244
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
If that's the case,

245
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
why would she repeatedly

246
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,240
fight with Zhou Ze about this?

247
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,480
If the person who was to be sent away

248
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,920
wasn't An Qiuzi,

249
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,240
the only person who could be sent away in this family would be…

250
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,240
Why did Fang Huaijin bring you alcohol

251
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,160
and poured you the drink?

252
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
She wanted to make it up to you for Zhou Ze.

253
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,640
She gave you a meaningful look

254
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,840
not out of disgust

255
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,560
or hatred,

256
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
but sympathy.

257
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
Who needs her sympathy?

258
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,960
I was prettier,

259
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,560
younger,

260
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,760
and more attractive than she was to men.

261
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,200
Do I need her sympathy?

262
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
It's true.

263
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,680
I did hear those words.

264
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,120
I knew the man didn't love me at all.

265
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
So what?

266
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,760
Did I have to kill him?

267
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,080
When Fang Huaijin was fighting with Zhou Ze,

268
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,800
you left.

269
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,640
Why did you go?

270
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,720
I felt cold.

271
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,920
So I went to get a shawl.

272
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,000
You're lying.

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Because it wasn't even cold that day.

274
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,880
I just need a glass of alcohol right now.

275
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,640
I'll go get it for you.

276
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
The beer just came in and it's still cold.

277
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I'll have vodka.

278
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,360
Pure.

279
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,200
A woman can need a shawl to cover her

280
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,320
whenever she wants.

281
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,440
If you were just to get a shawl,

282
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,680
it'd cost you too long.

283
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,280
Not very long.

284
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,560
I took the shawl and came downstairs.

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,440
You told us.

286
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
You said they argued for a long time.

287
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
How long did they fight?

288
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,480
A long time.

289
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,640
Why did you lie to me about it?

290
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,880
You lied because you wanted to cover up the fact

291
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,120
that you didn't go to your room.

292
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,880
You didn't go to your room,

293
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,040
but Fang Huaijin's master bedroom.

294
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,480
It wasn't the shawl you wanted to take either.

295
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,760
It was the morphine in the pocket of her clothes.

296
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,200
Because you knew it was there the whole time.

297
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,320
You saw it

298
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
when you were talking with Li Yuanshun at the door.

299
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,200
You were

300
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,000
on Mr. Li's right-hand side.

301
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,320
You were facing the inside

302
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,800
at that time.

303
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,000
Ge Ai, let me talk to you formally.

304
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,440
I know

305
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,000
you think you're young, pretty and sexy.

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,560
So you went to seduce Zhou Ze

307
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
to make him fall for you.

308
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,200
But

309
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,480
Zhou Ze has a wife.

310
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,040
Right?

311
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,120
Huaijin is his wife

312
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,480
and he can divorce her because of you.

313
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,560
What does that mean?

314
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,840
I feel cold.

315
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,640
I'll go back and get a shawl.

316
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,960
Then you went to Fang Huaijin's master bedroom

317
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
and took out the bottle of morphine from the closet.

318
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,080
And the reason you stole the morphine

319
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,800
was to kill Zhou Ze,

320
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
get back at him

321
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,320
and then frame Fang Huaijin.

322
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
You came back with the morphine

323
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
and heard Zhou Ze wanted a vodka.

324
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
That's your best chance to kill him.

325
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,119
So you asked for one too.

326
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,599
I'll have vodka.

327
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,280
Pure.

328
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,160
I'll have a drink too.

329
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
I'll do it.

330
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,000
Zhou Ze said everything he drank was sour.

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
That's proof that you put morphine in the drink.

332
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,040
Morphine is purified with acetic acid.

333
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,120
It tastes like vinegar.

334
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,480
Didn't he deserve to die?

335
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,320
I gave him all my heart.

336
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,120
And all he wanted was the painting.

337
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,640
He said he'd marry me.

338
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,200
He said he'd get a divorce.

339
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,280
But when we got home, everything changed.

340
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,360
He had ruined me

341
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
and my feelings.

342
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,480
I wanted to make his love

343
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,280
a specimen in my memory,

344
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
keeping the most beautiful moments.

345
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
You chose a married man.

346
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,560
You should have known

347
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,840
you were destined to be abandoned.

348
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,360
Even my sister

349
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
who didn't know anything about art

350
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,000
was clear of this.

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,840
So what?

352
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
You can never win here in this family.

353
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,040
They're all dead.

354
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,720
Only I'm still alive.

355
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,400
I came here to see

356
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,240
these two dead lovebirds.

357
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,280
You are shameless!

358
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,280
You killed my parents.

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,880
How can you do that?

360
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,920
Tell me! Tell me!

361
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,600
Wait a minute.

362
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,600
How could this happen?

363
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,840
This is the morphine I purified with acetic acid.

364
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,080
Morphine acetate is soluble in water

365
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,120
and slightly soluble in alcohol.

366
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,360
How much of that drink did he have?

367
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,480
How much?

368
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,720
Are you okay?

369
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm Van Gogh, Picasso.

370
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm Monet.

371
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,760
Darling,

372
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
come and see.

373
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,880
This is Mona Lisa.

374
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
It's going to be

375
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,720
the greatest work in the world.

376
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,080
It's not me?

377
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
She is not the murderer.

378
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,480
So Zhou Ze killed himself.

379
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,720
Or... the murderer is someone else?

380
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,640
How could this happen?

381
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,680
Wait, what's wrong?

382
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Where is the poison?

383
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,920
In the glass of wine.

384
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,200
The police found it

385
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,560
in her jacket in the closet.

386
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,640
It's the most addictive thing in opium.

387
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,280
It can be deadly.

388
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,080
But who would have thought

389
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,120
she stole the morphine from my brother's lab?

390
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,480
Huaijin.

391
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,920
I've been waiting for years.

392
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
Huaijin, give me a chance.

393
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,080
After she fetched the alcohol,

394
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,960
Zhou Ze taunted her.

395
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
Fang Huaijin was so angry that she stood there shivering

396
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,720
when hearing this.

397
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,720
How come everything I drank is sour?

398
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,640
Zhou Ze said everything was sour.

399
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,760
What else did he drink?

400
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
What else did he drink?

401
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,560
What did he drink?

402
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
He said everything he drank was sour.

403
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I don't think he was being sarcastic.

404
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,400
He did drink something else that was sour.

405
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,600
Li Yuanpu.

406
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,760
He had a glass of water you gave him.

407
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,560
He did.

408
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,640
What's the problem?

409
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,080
The murderer must meet three conditions to kill him.

410
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,000
First,

411
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,200
he knew Fang Huaijin had morphine.

412
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,920
Second,

413
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,080
he had the opportunity to steal the morphine.

414
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,440
Third,

415
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,680
he had the opportunity to give Zhou Ze a glass of water.

416
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,280
You also meet the three conditions at the same time

417
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,520
in addition to Ge Ai.

418
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,600
Nonsense.

419
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,880
You said

420
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,360
the day at the lab,

421
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,800
you moved sideways to talk to Zhou Ze.

422
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,640
You should not think you're young and beautiful.

423
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,400
Let me talk to you for a second.

424
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,560
Zhou Ze has a wife.

425
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,160
You went to Fang Huaijin's room to confess your love.

426
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,960
Fang Huaijin ran away.

427
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,040
And you were left alone in the room.

428
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
What? What?

429
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Why would you confess your love to Huaijin?

430
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,280
Yes.

431
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,040
I thought I was the only one

432
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,240
who could save her from the mire.

433
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
Yuanpu.

434
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,600
When did you fall in love with Huaijin?

435
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,560
How come I didn't know?

436
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,960
I didn't want to tell you.

437
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,920
Because you're my brother.

438
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,240
You liked Fang Huaijin too.

439
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,600
I thought only Ge Ai knew

440
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,000
Fang Huaijin took the morphine.

441
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,360
But you saw it when you moved sideways.

442
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,520
If she knew when to stop,

443
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,160
she wouldn't be so annoying.

444
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,440
Why can't she wait

445
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,600
until I finish this painting?

446
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,400
Huaijin, Huaijin.

447
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,440
I'll pretend

448
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,320
nothing happened.

449
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,440
Won't you feel sorry for

450
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,600
your best buddy?

451
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,720
You pissed Fang Huaijin off.

452
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,400
Then you got the morphine from her jacket.

453
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,480
Then, the next morning,

454
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,160
you tricked him into drinking the poisonous water

455
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
that killed him

456
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,760
when Fang Huaijin and Zhou Ze were fighting.

457
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,200
That's ridiculous.

458
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,120
Why would I do that?

459
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,440
I killed Zhou Ze

460
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,480
to be with Fang Huaijin?

461
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,320
If that's the case,

462
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I just had to

463
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,840
wait for their divorce.

464
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,280
Since I love Fang Huaijin,

465
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
why would I do such a thing to frame her?

466
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,760
You are an outsider.

467
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,360
You fabricated our relationship

468
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,280
with wishful thinking,

469
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,360
making up stories from years ago

470
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,600
to slander your senior.

471
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,040
What are your intentions?

472
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,920
That's right.

473
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,560
Lawyer Li loves my sister.

474
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,680
I've been wondering from the beginning

475
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,760
why you'd obey Fang Huaijin's wishes

476
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,560
and go for a defense of innocence

477
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,640
instead of abatement from penalty?

478
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,320
You knew it would anger the judge

479
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,560
to sentence her to death.

480
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,440
If you really loved her,

481
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,920
would you give her a chance to live

482
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,040
or let her die?

483
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,080
You're a lawyer.

484
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,440
You weighed the pros and cons.

485
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,400
But after that,

486
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,880
you still pushed her to the guillotine.

487
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,520
Why?

488
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,240
Because you planned to kill Zhou Ze

489
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,760
and then blame it on Fang Huaijin

490
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,200
from the beginning.

491
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,160
But killing Zhou Ze was to help Fang Huaijin.

492
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,200
So now...

493
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,640
He didn't realize any of his intentions, did he?

494
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
That's right.

495
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,280
Why?

496
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,440
He said your mother was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.

497
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,240
Do you remember what he said?

498
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,120
He said

499
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,400
he saw my mother drinking tea in the sun.

500
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,240
It was the most beautiful painting in his heart.

501
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,120
No, no.

502
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
Your mother was allergic to UV rays.

503
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
She never sunbathed.

504
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,080
She even came to me to get her medicine.

505
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,840
And madam

506
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,000
didn't like to wear brightly colored cheongsams.

507
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,040
She preferred lighter colors.

508
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,960
I just need a glass of alcohol right now.

509
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,080
I'll go get it for you.

510
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,320
This is the scene I've imagined a million times.

511
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,040
The golden sunlight

512
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,760
shines on her snow-white skin.

513
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,760
But too much time has passed.

514
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,440
I can't remember if it really happened

515
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,840
or I imagined it.

516
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,560
You said

517
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,720
you kept looking at her sideways

518
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,400
in the lab.

519
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
Now look sideways.

520
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,280
Who can you see?

521
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,200
When you were describing your love for Fang Huaijin,

522
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,240
you unconsciously replaced the image in your head

523
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,360
with hers.

524
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,600
So the person you love was not Fang Huaijin,

525
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,640
but Ge Ai.

526
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,880
And throw away this thick and stupid curtain

527
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,280
so that the sunset would shine through

528
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,640
the big window in the west.

529
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,880
Wouldn't it be more beautiful?

530
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,200
You took Fang Huaijin as the main character.

531
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,360
Gradually, you even fooled yourself.

532
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,520
For so many years,

533
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
you really think

534
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,040
you like Fang Huaijin.

535
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,120
Even when you first met Zhou Mowan,

536
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,560
you showed your true feelings.

537
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,360
From now on, shut up.

538
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,640
You thought my brother-in-law would marry Ge Ai.

539
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,400
So you killed him.

540
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,320
You killed my sister.

541
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,920
Yuanpu.

542
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,360
He was our best friend!

543
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,800
You...

544
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,760
You treated Ge Ai as a treasure,

545
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,640
a moon to be seen from afar but not to be played with.

546
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,800
But she was easily played with by Zhou Ze

547
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,320
like sixpence.

548
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,760
Anything he said seemed to be

549
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,440
mockery and bragging to you

550
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,560
because of jealousy.

551
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,240
So you could not help

552
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,280
but kill him.

553
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,760
You don't love Ge Ai.

554
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,720
Why would you marry her?

555
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,160
Go ask her

556
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,960
why she acts like a slug

557
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,520
that I can't get rid of.

558
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,920
So you're lying to them?

559
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,600
Why don't you understand?

560
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,400
Lies are what women want most.

561
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,680
You're not good at this.

562
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,760
That's why you're still single.

563
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,200
You have no proof.

564
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,000
This is the painting of Zhou Ze.

565
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,480
The sudden change in color and light and shadow

566
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,360
is not the mark of some breakthrough.

567
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,080
It's because of the morphine.

568
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,080
If we go back to the scene of the crime,

569
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,120
we can easily find

570
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,720
the actual deadly glass of water.

571
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,040
That's not evidence either.

572
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,240
Your brother said

573
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,920
morphine acetate is soluble in water

574
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,000
and slightly soluble in alcohol.

575
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,520
Li Yuanpu.

576
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,880
My parents treated you so well.

577
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,000
And you did this to them?

578
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
I can only say I'm sorry.

579
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,960
This is a case that has been closed for a long time.

580
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,520
You can't overturn it.

581
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,800
And you can't do anything to me.

582
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,400
It can't be overturned?

583
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,680
We can't do anything to you?

584
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,160
OK.

585
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,520
I'll show you

586
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,640
that good prevails over evil.

587
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,680
Someone come!

588
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,680
Take him away.

589
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,880
Yes. Yes.

590
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,040
Go!

591
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,880
Thank you.

592
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,080
Actually, you don't have to thank me.

593
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,040
Technically you're a criminal too.

594
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,680
We will take your actions to the law.

595
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,240
But I think

596
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,200
you've already been punished.

597
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,640
I've already gotten my comeuppance.

598
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,960
My life is ruined.

599
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,600
I'll give you this painting.

600
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,360
I don't want to accept favors from the Zhou family.

601
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,760
I want to buy this painting.

602
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,920
Just name the price.

603
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,560
No matter how much unhappiness there is

604
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,560
between us,

605
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,720
it belongs to you after all.

606
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,920
I envy you.

607
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,120
You won't repeat your mother's mistakes.

608
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,360
But I still don't understand

609
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,120
why Madam wiped the fingerprints off the bottle.

610
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,200
It was because of me.

611
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,320
I brought that bottle of alcohol.

612
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,960
My sister gave it to my brother-in-law.

613
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,280
She wouldn't say anything.

614
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,720
She thought I was the murderer.

615
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,920
I can't remember

616
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,120
what I wanted to do with that drink.

617
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,160
I don't remember if I did it or not.

618
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,560
Maybe...

619
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,280
Maybe I stole the morphine too.

620
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,520
I was stopped by my sister's presence.

621
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,639
You didn't.

622
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
You just wanted to put magnesium sulfate

623
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,120
into your brother-in-law's glass

624
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
to make him diarrhea.

625
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,120
I don't know

626
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,719
who came to my place and opened the window that day.

627
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,159
I only found out the next day at noon.

628
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,719
I'm still scared.

629
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,440
Here, here.

630
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,120
There was a pile of powder.

631
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,760
Luckily it wasn't on this floor.

632
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,720
No wonder dad said

633
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,680
An Qiuzi was always

634
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,240
up to lame pranks.

635
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,120
My sister did it for me.

636
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,400
Auntie,

637
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I miss her so much.

638
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,640
Me too.

639
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,640
I miss you too.

640
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,640
I'm sorry.

641
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,520
I'm sorry.

642
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,280
It's okay.

643
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,520
It's okay.

644
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,040
Thank you.

645
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
It's okay.

646
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,560
It's not heavy.

647
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm not talking about this.

648
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,040
Are you sure you won't take something else?

649
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,400
That's enough.

650
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,000
Are you really going to

651
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,680
sell this house full of memories?

652
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,320
If it were before,

653
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
I wouldn't have sold it.

654
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,800
But now,

655
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,000
my mother is no longer a murderer.

656
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,240
I love my father despite the affairs.

657
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,600
My childhood here

658
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
is the happiest

659
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,840
and the warmest time of my life.

660
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,720
I finally don't have to run from this memory anymore.

661
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,680
Don't sell it.

662
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,120
A house can't hold memories.

663
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,560
My heart

664
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,520
can.

665
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
I thought about

666
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,800
asking you to investigate this old case before.

667
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,480
But I just couldn't make up my mind

668
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,280
because I know the truth you find out

669
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,520
must be the fact.

670
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,280
I was afraid.

671
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,080
Thank you for giving me a push.

672
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
You should thank me.

673
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
I dragged him onto the train.

674
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,040
Of course.

675
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,880
You have to thank him even more.

676
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,720
If he's going to investigate something,

677
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,360
no one can stop him.

678
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,680
Let's go.

679
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,960
Which one of you?

680
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,880
Who has offended someone again?

681
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,320
Lu?

682
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,160
What do you mean by this?

683
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,920
If you want to find me,

684
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,160
just ask someone to give me a message.

685
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,320
Don't get close to me.

686
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,320
I heard that you guys have been in the spotlight

687
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,520
in Harbin.

688
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,400
If you talk to me like this,

689
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,680
send me back intact

690
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,600
the way you brought me over.

691
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,720
What?

692
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,800
You're playing this little game with me?

693
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,960
Dismantle this damn thing now.

694
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,520
A bomb.

695
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,600
This is a good thing

696
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,360
my lab just invented.

697
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,920
It's called a timer.

698
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
I can set up a time.

699
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,440
If you don't behave,

700
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,400
you're gonna be bombed

701
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,800
into pieces.

702
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,200
Into pieces?

703
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,440
I'm gonna bomb you with it.

704
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,640
I'm telling you, Lu.

705
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
Our family treats you well.

706
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,040
Your family's relatives

707
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,240
are raised by my family.

708
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,880
Your two sons

709
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,400
dawdle in our company.

710
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,000
I can tear them up, do you believe it?

711
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,880
Shut his mouth!

712
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,440
Get lost!

713
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,080
Fine.

714
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,080
I'll put up with you for another 3 hours and 50 minutes.

715
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,560
Then I'll reunite your family.

716
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,480
General, I'm sure

717
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,200
you want to see us about something.

718
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,920
I'll do it.

719
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,640
Don't hurt anyone.

720
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,880
Don't, Situ.

721
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,920
They have no good intentions.

722
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,520
I can't joke with his life.

723
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,240
Good.

724
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,760
As expected of a great detective,

725
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,000
you're really smart.

726
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,000
Then I'll be frank.

727
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,400
Consul Kondokawa of the Japanese Consulate in Fengtian

728
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,800
disappeared today after arriving in Harbin.

729
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,360
The Japanese asked me to hand him over immediately.

730
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,440
Otherwise, it may lead to a military confrontation.

731
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,120
I wanted to go to Harbin to look for you.

732
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,000
But I heard you were in Fengtian,

733
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,400
so I came to invite you.

734
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,480
You know the situation.

735
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,320
So, I should see him alive

736
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,280
or dead with the murderer caught.

737
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,480
I understand.

738
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,920
Dismantle Luo Shaochuan's bomb first.

739
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,120
I'll help you find him.

740
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,600
You're not helping me.

741
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,080
You're trying to save yourselves.

742
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,600
General, if you don't feel assured,

743
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,120
you can put the bomb on me.

744
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
What are you talking about?

745
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,960
Situ, ignore him.

746
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,080
Just put it on me.

747
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,840
I don't believe you dare to blow me up.

748
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,040
Mr. Detective,

749
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,440
we don't have much time.

750
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,080
Where was Kondo kidnapped?

751
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,840
This way, please.

752
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,520
My men met with an assassination

753
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
when escorting Consul Kondo

754
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,520
on their way to the train station yesterday.

755
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,960
Kondo barely escaped his life and went to Harbin.

756
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,160
I didn't expect

757
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,640
the murderer to have people there.

758
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,280
As soon as Kondo got off the train,

759
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,560
they disguised as my men

760
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,000
and picked him up.

761
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Now we've only found

762
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,440
his personal interpreter, Wang Chaowei.

763
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
But he's under anesthesia

764
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,840
and in a state of confusion.

765
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,440
He can't communicate properly.

766
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Did they assassinate during your escort?

767
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,360
It was his driver, Jin Yanping,

768
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,400
who suddenly drove off the set route.

769
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,880
By the time we found him,

770
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,720
Consul Kondo was already wounded.

771
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,840
Where was he assassinated?

772
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,560
On the way to the train station.
