[Episode 18]

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,850
An Qiuzi said

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,840
Zhou Ze wouldn't really kick her out.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,700
Miss An grew up without a mother,

19
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,860
so she lacked discipline.

20
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,920
She only recognized her ladyship as her sister.

21
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,539
Sometimes she played pranks on

22
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,990
his lordship.

23
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,340
His lordship let her go

24
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,630
when he was in a good mood.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,720
When his lordship was in a bad mood, he said he would send her away.

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,490
It happened every other day.

27
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,730
But no one took it seriously.

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,700
Miss An

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,770
always made his lordship suffer

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,840
on this matter.

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,830
And then?

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,350
Later,

33
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,940
Miss An insisted on going back to the kitchen with me.

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,240
Looks like she was moving liquor in the liquor cabinet.

35
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,750
And I was busy scaling a fish,

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,850
so I left her alone.

37
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,220
In a moment

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,110
her ladyship came in.

39
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:42,910
Qiuzi,

40
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,630
what are you playing at?

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,170
Where have you been all morning?

42
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,230
No,

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,360
I was just playing in the backyard.

44
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,520
Go back to your room.

45
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,930
If your brother-in-law sees you, he'll blame you.

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,920
I get it.

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,150
Be good.

48
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,910
You mean my aunt

49
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,050
brought out that bottle of wine?

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,140
Yes.

51
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,670
Miss An took it out of the liquor cabinet.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,130
Her ladyship came in for the wine,

53
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,150
and it happened to be that bottle.

54
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,750
I see.

55
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,940
So the fingerprints your mother wanted to wipe off

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,230
was An Qiuzi's,

57
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,500
not hers.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,020
I remember now.

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,020
The day her ladyship was taken away, she told me

60
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,410
to sell all her valuable jewelry

61
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,840
and send you and Miss An away overnight.

62
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,680
I thought

63
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,360
maybe her ladyship didn't want you

64
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,680
to know she killed someone.

65
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,120
Mr. Li and I discussed

66
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,500
sending you two to my hometown in the country.

67
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,400
But who knew

68
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,100
my careless countryman

69
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,890
had lost you.

70
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,200
Mowan,

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,610
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,470
If I had taken you there myself,

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,580
things would have been different.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,950
Well, it's in the past.

75
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm here in front of you now.

76
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,570
An Qiuzi wasn't there

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
the day before when Li Yuanshun was talking about morphine.

78
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,270
So she had no access to morphine.

79
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,170
This was all probably just a misunderstanding.

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,650
You are...

81
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,220
What are you looking at?

82
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,180
Mowan.

83
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,810
Uncle Li Yuanshun.

84
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,230
It's really you.

85
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,490
You're a big girl now,

86
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,200
just like your mother.

87
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,720
Great.

88
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,500
We came to see you at the hospital today.

89
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,370
I was outside at a meeting.

90
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,460
I heard from my brother that

91
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,080
you were looking into your mother's case,

92
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,670
so I came here.

93
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,200
Your mother wouldn't have killed anyone.

94
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,010
I've been holding that in for years.

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,790
But no one believes me.

96
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,970
Doctor Li,

97
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,990
let's go to another place.

98
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,130
To my place.

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,300
I can't tell you anything

100
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,330
until

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
we get there.

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,520
Okay.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,659
Here we are.

104
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,170
Okay.

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,300
Thank you.

106
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,170
Doctor Li.

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,220
You two used to be neighbors?

108
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,010
Yes.

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,530
Follow me.

110
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,800
I've lived here

111
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,950
all these years.

112
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,910
I haven't moved anywhere.

113
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,600
I always wondered,

114
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,990
when would they be back.

115
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,730
I waited and I waited.

116
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,160
No one came back.

117
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,500
What about my auntie?

118
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,950
She had a good life in Shanghai.

119
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
Why would she come back here?

120
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,970
Last time I saw her

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
was when I went to Shanghai on business.

122
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,930
She said she was going abroad with her family.

123
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,980
Going abroad?

124
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,100
Looks like

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,830
she did have a good life over the years.

126
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,920
Yes.

127
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,659
After that incident,

128
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,159
she went to a popular girls' school.

129
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,170
Then she went to college in Shanghai.

130
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,500
After graduation,

131
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,340
she married into a good family in Shanghai.

132
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,659
Now she's going to France with her family.

133
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,870
Here.

134
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,040
Be careful.

135
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,610
Has it always been like this?

136
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,340
You have no idea

137
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,720
how hard it is for me to put these bottles and cans together.

138
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,460
Don't mess with them.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,510
There's a lot to look out for.

140
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,980
You know, a very small part of the motion will affect the overall situation.

141
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,110
Can I have a look?

142
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,830
Well...

143
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,110
Be careful.

144
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,100
It's sour?

145
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,020
I purified this with acetic acid.

146
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,110
You need to get morphine acetate first,

147
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,550
-and then you can put this... -Uncle Li,

148
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,580
what was everyone doing in your lab

149
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,790
the day before the murder?

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,260
How much do you remember?

151
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,350
Well...

152
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,770
You know what? If you want to know anything,

153
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,570
just ask me.

154
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,010
If I remember,

155
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,110
I'll tell you.

156
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,480
If I can't remember,

157
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,670
I'll ask my brother.

158
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
He's a lawyer. He must have a better memory than I do.

159
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,970
Did you see Fang Huaijin take the morphine

160
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,250
the day of the murder?

161
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,590
If I had seen her, would I have let her go?

162
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,420
Well,

163
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,530
Zhou Ze deserved to die.

164
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,200
But he didn't deserve to lose his life

165
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,060
over something like that.

166
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,470
Such people sooner or later

167
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,500
would die in the arms of beautiful women.

168
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,230
As the ancients say,

169
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,900
the peony...

170
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,630
Uncle Li.

171
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,210
Well.

172
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,930
Do you remember

173
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,730
the order

174
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,720
in which everyone left the lab that day?

175
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,650
No.

176
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,490
Think it over.

177
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,550
It was

178
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,240
in this position

179
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,880
that I spoke to that foreign woman.

180
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,690
Ge Ai,

181
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,120
I'll talk to you formally.

182
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,080
I know you think you're young and pretty.

183
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,540
I was gonna vent your mother's anger on her behalf.

184
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,550
I didn't want that woman to feel good.

185
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,470
So I called her in here.

186
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,610
I told her

187
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,630
Zhou Ze divorced Fang Huaijin for you.

188
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,830
Huaijin was his first wife.

189
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,680
One day,

190
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,560
he would leave you for someone else.

191
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,230
Fang Huaijin had the support of friends like us.

192
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,360
What about you?

193
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,810
You're gonna be worse off than she was.

194
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,230
I just wanted her to know that

195
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,370
what she's doing was wrong.

196
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,070
Uncle Li.

197
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,430
Well.

198
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:45,890
Do you remember

199
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,470
what the others were doing

200
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,860
when you were talking to Ge Ai?

201
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,390
I had my back to them.

202
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,540
I can't remember.

203
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,930
You can't open this window.

204
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,390
You can't open this window.

205
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,100
They are sensitive and vulnerable.

206
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,030
If anything is a little off,

207
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,360
they throw a tantrum.

208
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,950
They're gonna blow up the lab.

209
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,920
I don't know

210
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,430
who came to my place and opened the window that day.

211
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,250
I didn't find out until noon the next day.

212
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,730
I'm still scared to think about it.

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,720
Here. Here.

214
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,180
There was a pile of powder spilled here.

215
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,240
Luckily it's not on this layer.

216
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,640
Otherwise,

217
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,450
I wouldn't be alive today.

218
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,280
Can a man get in through this window?

219
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,430
Well...

220
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,430
There's no way guys like us can climb in here.

221
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,170
We'll get stuck halfway through.

222
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,590
What if it's a kid?

223
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,120
A kid?

224
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,980
Then that shouldn't be a problem.

225
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,780
Mowan,

226
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm going to send a telegram to your auntie.

227
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,240
She would be thrilled

228
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,420
to know you're still alive.

229
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,400
Uncle Li,

230
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,630
I want to ask you a question.

231
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,830
Go ahead.

232
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,550
Why did my mom take care of my auntie so much?

233
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,690
Don't you know about it?

234
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,160
What?

235
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,540
Your auntie's eye

236
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,850
was broken by your mother.

237
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,500
Miss An.

238
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,410
I'm Luo Shaochuan.

239
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,130
Hello. I'm An Qiuzi.

240
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,230
You must be tired from your journey.

241
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,840
Who did my mom wipe fingerprints for?

242
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,940
Only An Qiuzi.

243
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,140
Don't worry.

244
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,870
You have to wait for Shaochuan to bring her back.

245
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,240
My mom knew she killed my father.

246
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,720
She sent us to the country to protect her.

247
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,490
And for her sake,

248
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,380
my mom didn't say anything until the moment she died.

249
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,960
After all these years,

250
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,580
how can she be okay with that?

251
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,050
The current evidence can't prove that

252
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,970
she is the murderer.

253
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,160
Don't you believe in unique logic?

254
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,470
First,

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,630
she was the one who stole the morphine from Li Yuanshun.

256
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,090
Second,

257
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,150
my mom took the wine out of her hand.

258
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,610
Third,

259
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,580
she was the only one who tried to poison my dad.

260
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,920
Actually, she didn't hate my dad at all.

261
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,690
My mom hurt her,

262
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,050
so she hated all of us.

263
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,900
Even I...

264
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,850
Even I almost

265
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,160
helped kill my parents.

266
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,840
Please calm down.

267
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,790
Poor my mom.

268
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,670
She helped her wipe the bottle

269
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,980
and has been mistaken for a murderer all these years.

270
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,390
Was it you who sent me a telegram?

271
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,260
Yes.

272
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,630
Thank you for the long journey back to Fengtian.

273
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,310
This is my family matter.

274
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,530
I should thank you.

275
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,250
I can't believe

276
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,350
anyone would remember

277
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,500
after all these years.

278
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,940
Inspector Luo.

279
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,610
How did you bring this up out of the blue?

280
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,130
I'll show you someone and you'll understand.

281
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,640
I can totally understand how you feel right now.

282
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,090
But this case

283
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,500
has come to this point.

284
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:12,850
Besides, she's back.

285
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,270
You've been waiting so long.

286
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,970
I hope you can give me a chance

287
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,970
to have a good talk with An Qiuzi.

288
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,030
If she's the killer,

289
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,200
we're all gonna get you justice.

290
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,620
I hope when you find out she's the killer,

291
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,140
you still want that chance.

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,150
Look who I brought here.

293
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,150
You're really Wan.

294
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,480
You look just like my sister.

295
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,300
I wonder

296
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,660
if you're the one

297
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,490
who remember this.

298
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,980
Wan.

299
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,020
We've been looking for you for a long time.

300
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,300
Thank god.

301
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,490
You're still alive.

302
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,400
It must be my sister who watches over us.

303
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,250
You're back, Wan.

304
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,490
Long time no see.

305
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,810
Aunt An Qiuzi.

306
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,590
Wan...

307
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,510
It was nice of you to stop by.

308
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,690
Please have a seat.

309
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,750
You were a little girl when that happened.

310
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,260
There're a lot of things you may not know.

311
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,610
You weren't much older than me at the time.

312
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,360
You've had such a good few years.

313
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:34,990
Go to college.

314
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,760
Get married.

315
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:37,970
Go abroad.

316
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,640
You did all these things.

317
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,680
Wan,

318
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,900
If I had been more careful,

320
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,740
I wouldn't have let you live in a foreign land

321
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,790
and you wouldn't have suffered for so many years.

322
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,400
I'm really sorry.

323
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,520
I'll do anything

324
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,000
to make it up to you.

325
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,480
Make it up to me?

326
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,130
Like my mom did to you?

327
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,180
Wan,

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,130
why don't you go abroad with me?

329
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,370
I'll take care of you.

330
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,060
Thank you, auntie.

331
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,720
I'm way past the point where I need someone to take care of me.

332
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,550
Well,

333
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,960
what would be most helpful now

334
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,950
is to give a full account of

335
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,080
what happened.

336
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,590
I was going to go to France tomorrow,

337
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,200
But I came

338
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,360
as soon as I got your telegram.

339
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,900
I was wondering

340
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,960
if you were really back.

341
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,770
In this way, I can fulfill that wish.

342
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,700
But about what happened back then,

343
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,530
I don't want my sister to be the killer, either.

344
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,480
But she is.

345
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,360
Are you sure?

346
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,440
My sister gave it to me before she left.

347
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,500
I've watched it a million times over the years.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,860
Dear sister,

349
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,680
I've never lied to you,

350
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,260
then or now.

351
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,150
So don't regret it

352
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,940
and move on with your life.

353
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:43,910
Promise me

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,910
you'll be happy.

355
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,600
Find your happy life.

356
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,180
He who owes his debt

357
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,050
shall pay it.

358
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,890
Zhou Ze is my love.

359
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,070
I'm going to follow him.

360
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,030
Pay the debt?

361
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,760
She paid what she owed you.

362
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,890
But what about me?

363
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
She said she owed my brother-in-law's life.

364
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,140
She once said

365
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,350
perhaps only death could bind her to Zhou Ze

366
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,600
forever.

367
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,230
You were too young at the time.

368
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,410
You have no idea

369
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,520
how much your mom loved your dad.

370
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,480
If Zhou Ze was determined to divorce,

371
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,580
my sister would defend it with her life.

372
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,360
Did you know she wrote me a letter too?

373
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,140
[Wan]

374
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,890
How did this happen?

375
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,310
You pretend you don't know

376
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,110
or you really don't know?

377
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,950
This is not what I had in mind at all.

378
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,750
You know your sister.

379
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,760
I wonder

380
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,620
if this is one of her memories for her daughter.

381
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,390
No.

382
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,390
No way.

383
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,330
If my sister said she didn't kill anyone,

384
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,390
then she didn't do it.

385
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Who on earth could have done this?

386
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,160
What makes you think

387
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,620
she's telling the truth?

388
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,250
Look at my eyes.

389
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,620
Don't you blame your sister?

390
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,670
I see you all know.

391
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,000
When I was born,

392
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,890
a lot of neighbors told my sister that

393
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,610
my mom had me now.

394
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,880
She didn't want her anymore.

395
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,720
So my sister was afraid.

396
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,210
She was afraid that I was gonna take her mother.

397
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,980
That's why she lost control and did what she did.

398
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,940
She regretted

399
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,470
every day that followed.

400
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,410
So for your sister,

401
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,770
you're like a sword of Damocles

402
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,250
hanging over her head,

403
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,570
reminding her not to be impulsive.

404
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,620
Her temper

405
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,630
didn't change until she married my brother-in-law.

406
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,700
They're always

407
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,590
at each other's throats.

408
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,400
But they never wanted to be apart.

409
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,020
Did you hate your brother-in-law?

410
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,200
If I really had hated him,

411
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,180
I wouldn't have played pranks on him.

412
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,880
Do you remember the night before,

413
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,680
you pissed your brother-in-law off?

414
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,660
I remember Ge Ai said

415
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,390
she was going to cook Russian food for us.

416
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,320
I encouraged Wan to play a trick on Ge Ai.

417
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,850
I put a lot of salt

418
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,600
on my brother-in-law's plate.

419
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,360
What's in this meal?

420
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,180
It's none of my business.

421
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,860
Ge Ai is a terrible cook.

422
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,550
It's none of my business.

423
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,500
Am I right?

424
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,370
It sucks.

425
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,740
Yes, it's sucks.

426
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,860
Wan,

427
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,550
you can have mine.

428
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,810
Because of you,

429
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,130
this meal is off the table.

430
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,290
Sister.

431
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:41,830
Zhou Ze.

432
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,650
Don’t quarrel with the children.

433
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,410
Exactly.

434
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,650
This meal is terrible.

435
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,700
It’s none of my business.

436
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,600
Qiuzi.

437
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,180
It's my fault,

438
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,970
so you have no rules now.

439
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,820
I'll send you back to the country tomorrow.

440
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,830
And then I was locked in my room.

441
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,830
I was gonna pretend to apologize to my brother-in-law

442
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,870
the next day.

443
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
What did you want to do?

444
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,160
I remember thinking of

445
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,530
a really nasty move.

446
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,770
It's been so long.

447
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,880
I really can't remember.

448
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,220
You really can't remember

449
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,920
or you pretend you can't remember?

450
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,130
What do you mean?

451
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,570
Didn't you go to Li Yuanshun's lab

452
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,240
the next morning?

453
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,690
No.

454
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,730
I went to Uncle Li's place

455
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,870
to return the book.

456
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,230
I remember now.

457
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,330
I went to uncle Li's house, but he wasn't there.

458
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,140
He was probably in our house at the time.

459
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,130
Then I came back from the backyard over the wall.

460
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,310
And then I was caught by Aunt Wanzhi.

461
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,330
I was thinking

462
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,580
I'd sneak back in

463
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,560
when Aunt Wanzhi wasn't looking.

464
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,690
Then my sister came back.

465
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,730
She locked me up

466
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,960
and didn't let me out until dinner.

467
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,010
Do you remember

468
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,000
what you took out of the lab?

469
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,700
I really can't remember.

470
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,180
My memories are trivial.

471
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,000
I was locked in my room

472
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,160
until mealtime.

473
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,090
My brother-in-law didn't come.

474
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,390
That's when he was killed.

475
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,840
Today Aunt Wanzhi made you sweet and sour fish.

476
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,250
Eat more.

477
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,780
There's still one dish to be served.

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,640
Where is Zhou Ze?

479
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
He said he had no appetite

480
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,370
and didn't want to eat.

481
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,400
Do you have good manners?

482
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,960
Yuanshun.

483
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,720
Forget it.

484
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Let's eat.

485
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,030
That's just how Zhou Ze is.

486
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,590
He forgets everything when he paints.

487
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,170
We won't wait for him.

488
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,890
Wanzhi.

489
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,250
Prepare some food.

490
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,220
We'll bring it to him.

491
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,630
Okay, I see.

492
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,180
My sister brought food to my brother-in-law with Xi Wanzhi.

493
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,540
That's when the tragedy happened.

494
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,190
It wasn't long before Xi Wanzhi came running back.

495
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,420
Oh no.

496
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,040
His lordship was murdered in the backyard.

497
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,370
What are you talking about?

498
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,350
What do you mean?

499
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,210
His lordship fell to the ground.

500
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,110
Her ladyship said he's dead.

501
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,720
Brother, check that out.

502
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,360
I'll call the police.

503
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,210
Okay.

504
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,220
Qiuzi, take Mowan upstairs.

505
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,360
None of you are coming down until I tell you.

506
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,690
Then my sister was taken away.

507
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,270
My brother-in-law died.

508
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,940
It was Mr. Li who took care of the rest.

509
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,070
He and Xi Wanzhi discussed

510
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,170
taking Wan and I to the countryside for shelter

511
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,210
without Uncle Li's knowledge.

512
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,620
But I didn't think Wan would get lost at that moment.

513
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,920
Uncle Li was furious with me about it.

514
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,180
Luckily, you're back.

515
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,600
Actually, we've been looking for you for years.

516
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,490
Uncle Li and Mr. Li will find you

517
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,930
anywhere they hear from you.

518
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,440
I've been trying to find out about you since school,

519
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,980
but nothing.

520
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,990
Luckily, you're back.

521
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,040
Wan.

522
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,790
What have you been doing all these years?

523
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,830
I'm fine.

524
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,960
Let's not talk about this for now.

525
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,880
Mr. Li helped with the lawsuit

526
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,330
and the children.

527
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,420
He's quite warm-hearted.

528
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,870
Why do you call Li Yuanshun uncle Li

529
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,610
and Li Yuanpu Mr. Li?

530
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,310
Shouldn't you be closer to Li Yuanpu?

531
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,030
Actually, uncle Li is kind of an interesting guy,

532
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,080
like an old urchin.

533
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,850
We joked with him,

534
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,690
but he didn't mind.

535
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,400
So Wan and I used to hang out at his place.

536
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,920
I still remember

537
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,140
the windows of his lab were very small.

538
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,670
Only Wan and I could get in there.

539
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,500
We scared the living daylights out of uncle Li

540
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,460
every time we went there.

541
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,270
He was afraid that

542
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,920
we might bump into his treasures.

543
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,130
In this way,

544
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,000
we had a better relationship with uncle Li.

545
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,410
Mr. Li

546
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,170
took care of us

547
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,400
because he loved my sister.

548
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,570
It's nice,

549
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,520
but it didn't feel close enough.

550
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,800
What do you mean?

551
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,130
Actually he liked my sister.

552
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,190
You said he liked my mom?

553
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,840
Are you sure?

554
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,250
I saw it with my own eyes the night before.

555
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,520
Huaijin.

556
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,910
Please come in.

557
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,980
Yuanpu, what's wrong?

558
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,350
Why do you keep pestering Zhou Ze?

559
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,750
Why are you telling me this all of a sudden?

560
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,120
We all know Zhou Ze well.

561
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,340
He is a prodigal son.

562
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,000
You've got a marriage now,

563
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,740
but his heart is not in you.

564
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,570
Today is Ge Ai.

565
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,440
You can do whatever it takes to keep him here.

566
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,740
But if there are more people in the future,

567
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,980
can you keep him every time?

568
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,030
And this time I could see that

569
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,750
he is determined to marry Ge Ai.

570
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,820
Zhou Ze asked you to talk to me?

571
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,680
No.

572
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,000
Tell him

573
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,180
I'm not going to agree to divorce him.

574
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,340
Even if I die,

575
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,110
I won't divorce him.

576
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,510
To fulfill him is to fulfill yourself.

577
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,420
Fulfill?

578
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,110
What do you mean?

579
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,860
My daughter is so young.

580
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,400
She can't live without her mother and her father.

581
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,830
Saving this family is the best thing.

582
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,130
Even if I agree to divorce him,

583
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,070
I'm sure Zhou Ze

584
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,810
will regret his decision sooner or later.

585
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,760
Huaijin.

586
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,130
Ge Ai is not the first,

587
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,850
and she won't be the last.

588
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,700
Growing up,

589
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,400
all you cared about

590
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,030
was Zhou Ze.

591
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,890
When are you gonna turn around and see that

592
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,670
there's someone else?

593
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,840
There're other people who care about you.

594
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,660
There're others

595
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,100
who see you as the only one.

596
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,130
Li Yuanpu,

597
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,470
what are you talking about?

598
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,530
Huaijin,

599
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,820
I've been waiting for this for years.

600
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,250
Huaijin,

601
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,100
I've been waiting for this for years.

602
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,000
Give me a chance.

603
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,510
I won't let anything happen to you.

604
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,010
Unbelievable.

605
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,600
Huaijin. Huaijin.

606
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,550
Huaijin. Huaijin.

607
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,650
I'm just gonna pretend that

608
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,110
nothing happened today.

609
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,190
Was that what you're doing

610
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,960
to your best brother?

611
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,650
That's all I remember from that time.

612
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,590
Did he ever talk to you about it?

613
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,890
Never.

614
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,520
I have to see him again tomorrow.

615
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,710
It's getting late.

616
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,550
Let me get you back to rest.

617
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,230
I got a room for you.

618
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,400
Thank you.

619
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,910
What time shall we see Mr. Li tomorrow?

620
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,080
Don't trouble yourself.

621
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,300
It's a long journey.

622
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,810
Get an early rest.

623
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,390
Okay.

624
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,170
If you want,

625
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,370
you can always talk to me.

626
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,920
I miss you so much.

627
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,030
Let's go.

628
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,700
Why didn't you just say that?

629
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,980
She was the one who stole the morphine from Li Yuanshun

630
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and poisoned him.

631
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,800
I don't think she really knows.

632
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,490
Her feelings for you and your mother

633
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,190
should be real.

634
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
If we accused her now,

635
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,260
it would put a lot of pressure on her.

636
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,970
That's very thoughtful of you.

637
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,230
You've thought about everyone.

638
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,600
Did you ever think about me?

639
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,260
Even if she didn't know,

640
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,900
even if it was a mistake,

641
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,150
she's also a killer.

642
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,730
She killed my parents

643
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,730
and she's been able to

644
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,820
enjoy her life for years.

645
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,560
Why?

646
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:34,920
Fine.

647
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,040
If I go and tell her right now,

648
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,290
it's her who put the morphine in that wine glass.

649
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,860
It's her who killed her brother-in-law.

650
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,290
And her sister took the fall for her

651
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,070
to protect her and was sentenced to death.

652
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,410
What is she gonna do?

653
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,450
Will she continue to enjoy her life?

654
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
If it turns out that

655
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,710
she didn't steal the morphine

656
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,440
and she didn't kill anybody,

657
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,450
I can take the blame for wronged her.

658
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,660
But can you get over it?

659
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,950
She is the only family

660
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,780
you have left in the world.

661
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,550
I've been an orphan for so many years.

662
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,090
I didn't have anyone,

663
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,290
and I don't need anyone.

664
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,810
You're very considerate.

665
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,820
There's no room for flaw in your reasoning.

666
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,340
I have a great mom.

667
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,090
She was willing to give her life

668
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,650
for her sister.

669
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,360
I was superfluous.

670
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,400
I crossed the line.

671
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,290
I didn't know where I was.

672
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,850
I took myself too seriously.

673
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,210
I even thought...

674
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,880
I can't believe I'm interfering with your case.

675
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,340
Sorry, Detective Situ.

676
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,630
Zhou Mowan, listen to me.

677
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,920
Solving crimes is not just about logic, evidence,

678
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,980
but emotion.

679
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,270
To An Qiuzi,

680
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,610
you're the only family she has left

681
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,500
in the world.

682
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,290
As a bystander,

683
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,890
I really felt

684
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,330
her feelings for you and your mother.

685
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,790
She can't play this kind of thing.

686
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,900
She needn't have come here, either.

687
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,980
She was supposed to go to France.

688
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,450
Hearing the news,

689
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,210
she returned the ticket and came right away.

690
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,380
So your mother loved her

691
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,560
as much as she loved you and your mother.

692
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,580
I believe you can feel it.

693
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,670
I really don't think she was the killer.

694
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,080
Trust me.

695
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,360
I've always believed in you.

696
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,210
I hope it isn't the last time.

697
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,130
What are you doing?

698
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,880
You're up.

699
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,360
What time is it?

700
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,400
No one can sleep anymore.

701
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,630
I was looking for you in your room.

702
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,610
I had something for you.

703
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,570
Cleanser.

704
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,570
Thank you.

705
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,159
You're welcome.

706
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,699
What are you doing?

707
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,630
Let's go.

708
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,489
I need you to help me with the case.

709
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,430
We all like Fang Huaijin.

710
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,890
It's not a secret.

711
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,630
When I saw you the other day,

712
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,830
I had the illusion that she was back.

713
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,410
I. She.

714
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,370
Zhou Ze. My brother.

715
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,290
We grew up together.

716
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,130
She finally chose Zhou Ze.

717
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,120
We left gracefully,

718
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,730
but that didn't mean

719
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,150
we need to cut all our emotional ties.

720
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,470
So you asked my mom

721
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,420
to be with you at a time like that.

722
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,470
I couldn't help myself a little bit.

723
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,650
Anyway,

724
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,340
Fang Huaijin was the most beautiful person I've ever seen.

725
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't know how she was in your father's heart.

726
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,470
Whenever she drank tea in the sun,

727
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,010
it's the most beautiful painting in my heart.

728
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,740
That afternoon in the lab,

729
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,480
I kept looking sideways at her.

730
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,010
When she asked if morphine could kill her,

731
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,260
I saw a death wish in her eyes.

732
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,760
So when I was leaving, I grabbed Zhou Ze.

733
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,040
I wanted to talk to him about it.

734
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,790
Ge Ai.

735
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,530
I'd like to talk to you formally.

736
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,550
You mustn't think of yourself as young and beautiful.

737
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,170
I'd like to talk to you.

738
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,800
Zhou Ze has a wife.

739
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,960
After so many years,

740
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,650
what difficult situation have you and Fang Huaijin not experienced.

741
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,380
Why are you getting a divorce?

742
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,560
I don't want to do this.

743
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,890
I don't know how I'm gonna end up

744
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,240
at this point.

745
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,990
Two crazy women.

746
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,870
You've thought this thing through?

747
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,870
Leave Fang Huaijin

748
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,150
and get married again.

749
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,330
Even if I get divorced,

750
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,630
she won't leave me.

751
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,040
Women

752
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,490
wouldn't be so annoying

753
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,460
if they know when to stop.

754
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,360
Why can't they wait until

755
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,300
I finish this work?

756
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,140
At first, I thought

757
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,680
foreign women were different.

758
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,230
They're the same.

759
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,010
You don't really love Ge Ai.

760
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,070
Why do you marry her?

761
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,970
Ask her.

762
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,960
She's like a slug.

763
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
I can't get rid of her.

764
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,130
So you're lying to them?

765
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,540
Why don't you understand?

766
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,870
Lies are what women want most.

767
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,260
You're just too honest.

768
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,260
That's why you're still single.

769
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,160
Fang Huaijin was not the kind of person

770
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,940
who solved problems by running away.

771
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,850
Otherwise, she wouldn't have been in this relationship

772
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,670
all these years.

773
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,550
She

774
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,890
could have left Zhou Ze

775
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,270
the first time a woman came along.

776
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,140
Have you ever thought about it?

777
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,250
You confessed your love to her in that situation

778
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,130
and let her be with you.

779
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,400
She definitely wouldn't say yes.

780
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,530
I was just trying to get her

781
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,010
to get away from Zhou Ze.

782
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,100
I didn't think about it that much.

783
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,370
Didn't your teacher teach you?

784
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,190
Don't be a backward-looking person.

785
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,560
It's hindsight.

786
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,830
If everyone starts from the end and moves forward,

787
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,900
then there won't be any regrets in the world.

788
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,410
If you are in the middle of it,

789
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,240
will you be able to weigh the pros and cons

790
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,040
before making a sensible decision?

791
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,370
If you can,

792
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,260
you haven't been in love.

793
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,700
After all these years,

794
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,910
nothing has changed here.

795
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,600
Even though nothing's changed,

796
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,070
it's still different.

797
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,560
There is a Chinese saying.

798
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,520
I don't know if you have ever heard it before.

799
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,260
"Things aren't how they used to be."

800
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,820
Where once the swallows knew the mansions of the great,

801
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,870
they now to humbler homes would fly to nest and mate.

802
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,250
Of course I know things aren't how they used to be.

803
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,490
But when Zhou Ze died,

804
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,740
my heart died with him.

805
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,660
My love was buried

806
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,080
in this soil by Fang Huaijin's own hands.

807
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,560
Honey.

808
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,730
It's perfect.

809
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,360
You're like a fallen angel.

810
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,350
But the sunshine here is not perfect.

811
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,330
It isn't good enough for you.

812
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,040
The best sunshine is in your backyard.

813
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,400
I was sitting there drinking coffee,

814
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,000
and the sun was pouring down on me.

815
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,320
So Zhou Ze took you back to his place?

816
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,490
Yes.

817
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,850
I liked that place.

818
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,290
I felt

819
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,170
every shaft of sunlight there

820
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,250
was welcoming me.

821
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,230
Every day since then,

822
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,000
I've enjoyed the moment

823
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,190
Zhou Ze painted me in that backyard.

824
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,400
It was a time just for the two of us.

825
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,840
Beautiful.

826
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,110
The morphine was in the pocket.

827
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,960
And the clothes were in the closet.

828
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,440
I'd like to see An Qiuzi's room again.
