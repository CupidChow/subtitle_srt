1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,080
The violin was alright.

3
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,280
Maybe someone sent the wrong violin?

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,759
No way.

5
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,640
She called my name.

6
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,800
She said it was for me.

7
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,039
Do you remember

8
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,840
which teacher it was?

9
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,479
Ms. Zhou, you know

10
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,560
I can't really tell who's whom.

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,759
She seemed familiar.

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
But I can't remember who she was.

13
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,240
Think about it.

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,600
Did she ever teach you?

15
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
I really can't remember.

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
Ms. Zhou,

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,800
do you think

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
something dirty got on me?

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,680
My violin had always been fine.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,120
But since I came back from Fengtian after the vacation,

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
it has been weird.

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,520
It couldn't be tuned properly.

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,440
Now it's even weirder.

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,200
Do you think

25
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,640
that was a female ghost?

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,120
Stop scaring yourself.

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,079
The female ghost just wanted to give you a violin?

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,360
No, it's too scary.

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,840
I don't even want to go to the music classroom anymore.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,040
A few days ago,

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
when we were there,

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,520
the light

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
was shaky

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
and fell off itself.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
Isn't it scary?

36
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,240
The female ghost is scary.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,760
Ms. Lin is scary too.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,160
What should I do, Ms. Zhou?

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,760
You mean that something went wrong

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
after Ye Zhenzhen came back from Fengtian?

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,280
Was the murderer looking for the violin?

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
Show me that violin.

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Ms. Zhou.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,760
Are you going out?

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't tune my violin well.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to look for a skilled master.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You should be careful when you are out.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,079
It's not safe lately.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
You too.

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,400
See you.

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,240
Principal Fan.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
Calm down, Principal Fan.

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,440
-It's okay. -No way.

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,240
It's okay.

55
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
It's okay.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,480
-No way. -Principal Fan, it's okay.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,840
The victim, Luo Jinyan,

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,800
was killed by a blunt weapon which hit the back side of her head.

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,960
It could be a stone

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
or a brick.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,920
But no weapon matching it was found

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
at the scene.

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,560
Impossible.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,040
How could she be dead?

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,000
Impossible.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
How could she be dead?

67
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,640
No.

68
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,279
No way.

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,279
Calm down.

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Principal Fan.

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,600
Principal Fan.

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,720
Boss.

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,720
Boss.

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,120
Sergeant Bao said

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
they're about to interrogate the teachers.

76
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,720
He asked if you're coming.

77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,200
Okay.

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,240
Violin No.5.

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,040
I'll disassemble it.

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
Okay.

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,159
If you break it, pay the girl.

82
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,960
What is it?

83
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,360
With those with an alibi eliminated,

84
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,920
the range of the murderer is getting narrower and narrower.

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,000
If it wasn't Tao,

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,840
it must be Li.

87
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,080
Or we can arrest them both

88
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,320
and even punish them.

89
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,720
Well,

90
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,840
what if it was neither of them?

91
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Then release them.

92
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,280
Take two innocent people back to the police station,

93
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
and let the real murderer

94
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,920
continue to commit crimes during this time?

95
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Stop being pretentious.

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,040
What if you had asked Situ Yan

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,840
to investigate this case earlier?

98
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
Would we have investigated the dog?

99
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,320
If we hadn't investigated the dog,

100
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
would Luo Jinyan have died?

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,560
We couldn't catch the murderer,

102
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,960
and now you are blaming Situ Yan for not investigating the case?

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,360
Stop.

104
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,640
Don't say us.

105
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,400
It's about you.

106
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
You've been in charge of this case

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
from beginning to end.

108
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,080
This morning, you told me faithfully that

109
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,520
the case will be closed soon.

110
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,680
Now Luo Jinyan is dead.

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,360
Let me ask you,

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,160
who is the murderer?

113
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,560
I...

114
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,320
I will certainly give you an answer.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Of course you have to.

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm taking the blame

117
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,840
from the higher level for you.

118
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,680
You know?

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,960
You have two choices now.

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,640
First,

121
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
ask Situ Yan over

122
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
to help you investigate the case.

123
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,080
Second,

124
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
catch the murderer yourself.

125
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,840
Make your choice.

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,640
You guys,

127
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,000
keep an eye on Tao

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,680
and Li.

129
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,159
Keep an eye on what they do

130
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,560
and what they say.

131
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,800
If there's anything suspicious,

132
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
report immediately.

133
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,360
Yes.

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm the vice principal here, Luo Jinyan.

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
The one with glasses

136
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,760
is Fan Lihua.

137
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,720
My name is Li Pei.

138
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,680
I teach Mandarin.

139
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,840
Xia Ru'an.

140
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
Principal's secretary.

141
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,600
You still remember me?

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,440
I can see it.

143
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,760
It's right behind you.

144
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,799
Zhao Qiansun.

145
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm a painter.

146
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,240
Don't touch me.

147
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,920
Shaochuan.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,840
Shaochuan.

149
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,240
Luo Shaochuan.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,160
It's early in the morning.

151
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,560
What's wrong?

152
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,760
What's wrong?

153
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,480
Let me ask you.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
What did you do to Jingxuan yesterday?

155
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,880
Yesterday?

156
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,160
I didn't even see her yesterday.

157
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,120
What did I do to her?

158
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,560
Nonsense.

159
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
You are talking nonsense with me, right?

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,680
I got up on the wrong side of the bed.

161
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,600
She said she wanted to leave,

162
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
and asked me to send her to Beijing for a business trip.

163
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,160
Let her go if she wants to...

164
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,520
She wants to leave?

165
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,000
I couldn't stop her.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,040
You should talk to her.

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,800
She listens to you the most.

168
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,920
Okay.

169
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Will mom's way

170
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,320
really work?

171
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,040
Jingxuan.

172
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,240
Jingxuan.

173
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you really leaving?

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,760
Yes.

175
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,560
You don't need me here anyway.

176
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm also in someone's way.

177
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,520
Why don't I go to Beijing and learn business?

178
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,720
Great.

179
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,880
You've finally grown up.

180
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,080
If you want me to stay,

181
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
I can stay.

182
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,840
No.

183
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,160
Learning is a good thing.

184
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,720
After you finish your studies,

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,200
you can help mom take care of our Luo family together.

186
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,120
What?

187
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,800
The Luo family?

188
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,240
I'll drive her later.

189
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,480
There's no need to hurry.

190
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
Isn't she packed?

191
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
It's perfect to go at this time.

192
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,160
You...

193
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Don't forget anything.

194
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Mom,

195
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,320
what kind of bad idea is that?

196
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,760
I...

197
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,760
Hurry up.

198
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,400
No, I...

199
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
We are from a noble family.

200
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,000
We should be polite and courteous.

201
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,400
You need to inform your relatives and friends

202
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,960
before you travel far.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
Let's go to Mrs. Shen first.

204
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Don't be rude.

205
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,200
Jingxuan.

206
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,520
Jingxuan.

207
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
Why are you leaving?

208
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,840
It's too hasty today.

209
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,320
Besides,

210
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,760
Mrs. Shen may not be up this early.

211
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,800
Just go in and tell Mrs. Shen

212
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,520
and Situ Yan that you're leaving.

213
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,680
If I go see Situ...

214
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,440
You don't think I like Situ Yan, do you?

215
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,320
You like Situ Yan?

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,040
I'll just go directly to Beijing.

217
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,520
Jingxuan. Jingxuan.

218
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,280
Don't go.

219
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,320
I don't have time to see you off today.

220
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
After I finish my business,

221
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
I'll take you there in one or two days.

222
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,600
I can go by myself.

223
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
Jingxuan.

224
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,000
Jingxuan.

225
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
Women always ask you

226
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
to leave her alone.

227
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,920
In fact, however,

228
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,840
she wants you to comfort her.

229
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,840
When they say

230
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,160
"I don't want to see you",

231
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,120
it means you'd better show up immediately.

232
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,360
If they say "I'm not angry",

233
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,320
that means their lungs are gonna explode out of anger.

234
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,880
Young man,

235
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,560
if she gets away, you'll lose your wife.

236
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,080
Listen to me.

237
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,680
Go after her.

238
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,720
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,480
That's my sister.

240
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,640
I don't think

241
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,520
she treats you as her brother.

242
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,280
Why are you here talking to me so early in the morning?

243
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,120
It's none of your business.

244
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,840
Why were you pulling her

245
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,360
in front of my house early in the morning?

246
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,000
What do you want to do?

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,760
Who's going to your house?

248
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,520
I wanted to go next door.

249
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,480
Then why didn't you knock

250
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,160
if you were looking for someone?

251
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,480
It's none of your business if I knocked or not.

252
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
So annoying.

253
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,120
Do you want breakfast?

254
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
There are steamed buns and porridge.

255
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,320
You've made a lot, Auntie Shen.

256
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840
I knew you were coming,

257
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
so she made breakfast for four.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,080
Last night,

259
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,040
you told me to make dinner for four, right?

260
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,920
I was too hungry last night.

261
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
So last night,

262
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
you asked me to eat more

263
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
because you were too hungry?

264
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,400
You've been working hard lately.

265
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,960
Eat more nuts for nutrition.

266
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Tell me.

267
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,280
What happened last night?

268
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,680
Something happened at the girls' school again.

269
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,200
What's wrong with that woman?

270
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,240
She has a name.

271
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,200
It's Zhou Mowan.

272
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,600
I mean,

273
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,320
why is she still at your place?

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Isn't the kidnapping case solved?

275
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,200
What is she doing here with you?

276
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,000
She wants to marry you?

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Or does she want to be your servant?

278
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,320
Bro,

279
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,400
you have to set your mind straight.

280
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,760
You've solved the case,

281
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,440
and there are plenty of girls out there.

282
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
But she's not suitable for you.

283
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,720
I suspect

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,520
she has something to do with the girls' school case.

285
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,160
Really?

286
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,800
What's the connection?

287
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,560
They assigned a kidnapping case to you first.

288
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
It was obviously a dog, but they insisted it was a human.

289
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,680
That's obvious.

290
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,720
The purpose was to distract you so that

291
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,080
you couldn't investigate the girls' school case.

292
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,720
You're too imaginative.

293
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,840
She was fooled by Shen Huatang.

294
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,680
Who would have known Shen's daughter is a dog?

295
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,680
Look who Shen Huatang is.

296
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,520
The daughter of a banker.

297
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,160
How bad could it be?

298
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,920
You're siding with the capitalists because you are one of them.

299
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,680
Fine.

300
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,840
Then go ask Miss Shen about her motive.

301
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,600
What do you mean?

302
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,520
Does this woman know why Lin Jie was killed?

303
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,800
She has a name.

304
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,640
Ms. Zhou. Ms. Zhou.

305
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,640
Zhou Mowan and I

306
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,280
have been to the crime scene.

307
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,880
I thought Zhou Mowan was the murderer.

308
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,240
Luo Jinyan was searching

309
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,320
Zhou Mowan's locker before she died.

310
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,520
I thought she found some clues inside.

311
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,880
It'll be the best if that's not the case.

312
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,400
I'm just worried that you were deceived, okay?

313
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
So what exactly was

314
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,640
in the violin box?

315
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,040
This is it.

316
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,040
If the motive is really in this violin,

317
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
then you're in danger now.

318
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,960
What is inside this violin

319
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,000
that's worth a life?

320
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,600
We can't see it from the outside.

321
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,000
We have to tear it apart.

322
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,440
Zhou Mowan

323
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,960
hasn't shown up

324
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,240
after Lin Jie's incident, right?

325
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
Do you know where she is?

326
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
No idea.

327
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,000
But Ms. Zhou is not the murderer.

328
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,040
She wasn't at school on the day of the incident.

329
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,280
Find her.

330
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,120
Go back first.

331
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,360
Take our time.

332
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,680
All right, don't ramble on.

333
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,640
What's in it?

334
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,000
Gems.

335
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,760
A large bag of

336
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,040
very expensive gems.

337
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,320
What is it?

338
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,920
Gems.

339
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,880
A large bag of gems.

340
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,400
Do you know why Ye Zhenzhen went to Fengtian?

341
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,839
She told me a little bit about it.

342
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,640
She said she went to see her uncle in Fengtian.

343
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,280
Her uncle

344
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,440
works for the owner of a printing house.

345
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,880
But only after one day,

346
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,520
something happened to the owner.

347
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,359
The car and manpower previously arranged

348
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,920
were called back.

349
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,040
She and her mother

350
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,200
could only stay in the city for two days

351
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,920
before they came back.

352
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,360
You used to be in Fengtian, too.

353
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,160
What?

354
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm from Harbin,

355
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,080
but I've never been to Fengtian.

356
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,120
I'm not suspecting you.

357
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,920
I was just asking.

358
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,160
Times were rough in Fengtian back then.

359
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,160
Yes.

360
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,040
They said there was a warlord making trouble in the city.

361
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,520
So her uncle told her

362
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,320
not to stay there

363
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,400
and go back to Harbin.

364
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,640
The murder of the owner

365
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,360
must be related to this.

366
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,440
Are they okay?

367
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,760
They are fine.

368
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
They live in the city.

369
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,000
The printing house is in the commercial port.

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,920
It's quite far away.

371
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Did anything strange happen to Ye Zhenzhen

372
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,080
during her trip to Fengtian?

373
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,760
Nothing happened in Fengtian.

374
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,680
But there was something on her way back.

375
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,840
She said their luggage was searched by someone

376
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,000
on the train.

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,720
If they noticed it later,

378
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,160
the valuable items would have been stolen.

379
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,600
I see.

380
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
The jewelry must have been put in

381
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,880
at that time.

382
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,280
At that time?

383
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,560
Ye Zhenzhen said that

384
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,720
when they were out,

385
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,000
her uncle went to look for them.

386
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,880
Situ,

387
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,640
I've checked what you asked me to investigate.

388
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,080
The owner of Fengtian Printing House,

389
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,760
who's also the chairman of the Fengtian Chamber of Commerce,

390
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,280
was assassinated a while ago.

391
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,560
The reason is unknown.

392
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,560
But there is a speculation that

393
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,000
after Xu Shiren was killed,

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,440
in order to maintain the interests of the commercial circle,

395
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,520
he once united with the merchants

396
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
to resist the revolutionaries from having troops in Fengtian,

397
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
which aroused hatred in the Revolutionary Party.

398
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
That's why he was killed.

399
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,760
Does this have anything to do

400
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,560
with the ghost incident?

401
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,840
Why did you and Mr. Luo both ask me to investigate Fengtian?

402
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
Was it really a revenge?

403
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
It was for money.

404
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
Any news about the assistant of the printing house owner?

405
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,120
His whereabouts are still unknown.

407
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,240
It seems to be dog-eat-dog.

408
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,840
Someone killed the printing house owner

409
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,560
and framed the paraders in the city.

410
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,800
They took his money

411
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,920
and put it in the violin to transport it out of the city.

412
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
But both of them wanted to keep it to themselves.

413
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,160
The assistant is very likely to be dead.

414
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,560
So the murderer was looking for the violin with money inside

415
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,440
in the storage room,

416
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,840
when the teacher saw it.

417
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,000
So he killed her to silence her.

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
Not only that,

419
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,280
but two groups should be looking for the money now.

420
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,120
Why?

421
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,840
Why?

422
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,720
Tell me why.

423
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,680
Inspector Luo.

424
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,600
Why are you so mysterious?

425
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,800
How's your case going?

426
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,560
Do the police need to report to you

427
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,280
about the progress of the case?

428
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,840
I... I just want to know.

429
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,920
The big-headed dolls you called in last time

430
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,560
were not professional.

431
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,880
I suggest you go to the Home-guarding God

432
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,760
and conjure the ghost.

433
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,360
Even if he didn't do it,

434
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,760
right,

435
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,600
he can still see something.

436
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,280
I know a few of them.

437
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,800
By then,

438
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,720
we can set up an altar here.

439
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,840
What do you think?

440
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,600
Are you telling me what to do?

441
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,280
I dare not.

442
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,480
I was just suggesting.

443
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,840
Get lost.

444
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,160
If you need it,

445
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,040
just tell me.

446
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,680
I thought you weren't going to help me.

447
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,280
I didn't expect you to investigate so much for me.

448
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,720
Didn't I buy you some time

449
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,040
to investigate

450
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,000
and hang out with girls?

451
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,320
I didn't.

452
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,800
I was doing this for the case.

453
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,920
I need to know

454
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,880
the teachers' identities and their background.

455
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,920
I did find something.

456
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,640
Check out the first murder.

457
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,600
Xia Ru'an.

458
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,240
Li Pei.

459
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,040
Tao Zhiling.

460
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,320
They have no alibi.

461
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,000
Zhou Mowan and Zhao Qiansun took a leave that night.

462
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
They were not at school.

463
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,040
The other teachers don't live in the dorm.

464
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,520
Check out this one.

465
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,840
Only Xia Ru'an

466
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,480
has an alibi.

467
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
That way, the suspect can only be

468
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,360
Li Pei or Tao Zhiling.

469
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
Especially this Tao Zhiling. She is a newcomer.

470
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,640
I'll send someone to keep an eye on her.

471
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,360
I'll take her down

472
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,560
if she makes a move.

473
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,520
So you don't like her at all.

474
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,160
It's just for work?

475
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
Aren't we talking about work?

476
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,880
At least,

477
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,680
Xia Ru'an is clear of suspicion.

478
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,120
Why don't we go and see Tao Zhiling?

479
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,160
I think if you interrogate her,

480
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,840
she will confess.

481
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,760
Who first found out

482
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,920
about Luo Jinyan's death?

483
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Fan Lihua.

484
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,520
She again.

485
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
I want to hear what Fan Lihua has to say first.

486
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,240
Let's go.

487
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
I was about to sleep.

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,720
Then I saw some vague

489
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,360
blinks of light

490
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,800
from time to time

491
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,760
in the music classroom.

492
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,520
There seemed to be light.

493
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,920
Since Mr. Luo made a scene here,

494
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,840
Luo Jinyan has made it clear that

495
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,160
no one should go near the music classroom.

496
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,720
So...

497
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,880
So I was very suspicious.

498
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,680
I wanted to check the music classroom.

499
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,280
To protect myself,

500
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,760
I took a wooden stick

501
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,360
to the music classroom.

502
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,920
Did you see anyone on the way?

503
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,360
When I got to the music classroom,

504
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,280
the lights were dim.

505
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,920
So I turned on all the lights.

506
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,160
And then,

507
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,200
I found Principal Luo

508
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,080
sitting under the locker.

509
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,200
Ms. Luo.

510
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,120
Ms. Luo.

511
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,160
Ms. Luo.

512
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,680
Do you know what Luo Jinyan was looking for

513
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
in the music classroom?

514
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,200
During the day,

515
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,680
many parents came to take their children back.

516
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Luo Jinyan refused.

517
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
Later,

518
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,440
after the parents went back,

519
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,840
she asked me and Auntie Lan

520
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,440
to check the teachers' and students' dorm.

521
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,200
We checked

522
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,320
and found that

523
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,560
Ms. Zhou Mowan hadn't come back to school for two days.

524
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,280
Besides,

525
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,000
she is a music teacher.

526
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,120
I think

527
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,840
Luo Jinyan believed

528
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,200
Zhou Mowan must have something to do with Lin Jie's death.

529
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,240
So she went to the music classroom alone

530
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,600
to look for clues.

531
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,040
Yes.

532
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,760
When she died,

533
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,240
she was looking through Zhou Mowan's locker.

534
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960
When you were in the music classroom,

535
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,320
did you see anyone

536
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,760
or hear anything?

537
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,800
Mr. Situ.

538
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,400
Mr. Luo.

539
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,880
I feel

540
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
my whole body is weak.

541
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,720
It must be a long time

542
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,560
before I can cooperate with your work again.

543
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,000
But...

544
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,920
But don't worry.

545
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,040
I've already informed

546
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
my assistants.

547
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,040
Xia Ru'an,

548
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,640
and Li Pei.

549
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,600
They will cooperate with you.

550
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,760
Twice in a row,

551
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,960
she was the first one to find the victim.

552
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,360
Let alone her,

553
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,480
I can't stand it even thinking about it.

554
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,000
Are you okay?

555
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm fine.

556
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,720
Go to Luo Jinyan’s.

557
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,480
What the corpse was like

558
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,800
when Luo Jinyan was murdered?

559
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,240
It's similar to what Fan Lihua said.

560
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,040
The victim was killed facing the locker.

561
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,320
The murderer hit the back of her head

562
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,800
with a blunt weapon.

563
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,520
When she died,

564
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,080
she was checking Zhou Mowan's locker.

565
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
There was nothing else

566
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,600
but a musical instrument in it.

567
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,280
So, I guess

568
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,440
the murderer knew she had the jewelry.

569
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,480
But unexpectedly,

570
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,120
Luo Jinyan was one step ahead.

571
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,400
The murderer was afraid that Luo Jinyan would find the jewelry first,

572
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,840
so he went the whole hog and killed her.

573
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,200
But he didn't expect that

574
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,920
Zhou Mowan left the violin in the dorm.

575
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
Go check the scene.

576
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,920
Okay.

577
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,080
Traces of human.

578
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,200
Just as I thought.

579
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,560
What?

580
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,520
The rumor of ghosts

581
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,960
was released by the murderer on purpose.

582
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,840
But if it wasn't a revenge,

583
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,000
why did she do that?

584
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,000
Because she didn't want others to know

585
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,360
she was looking for something here.

586
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,320
Unfortunately,

587
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,600
Lin Jie wasn't superstitious.

588
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,520
But Luo Jinyan's situation was different.

589
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,000
She entered the music classroom first.

590
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,200
In this way,

591
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
since the murderer knew someone was inside,

592
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,680
why would he come in?

593
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
He was afraid that others would beat him to it?

594
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm afraid the murderer

595
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,080
had gone through the boxes long ago.

596
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,320
What should we do now?

597
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,880
Let's check those teachers first.

598
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,280
I looked into this as a revenge case for a long time.

599
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,880
I even found out about

600
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,680
the Princess's suicide incident for this.

601
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,320
I thought the Prince family killed their daughter

602
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,080
to play up to the royal family,

603
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,840
and then fled to Fengtian to avoid trouble.

604
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,600
Therefore, the Princess's lover or bestie

605
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
wanted to kill them

606
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,760
to avenge the Princess's death.

607
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,400
They killed Lin Jie first, and then Luo Jinyan.

608
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,320
Although you said it was not a revenge,

609
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,040
I was right anyway.

610
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,120
They must have come here

611
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,640
from Fengtian this semester.

612
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
This must be right, don't you think?

613
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,600
You may be unreliable,

614
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,560
but you're quite imaginative.

615
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,200
I'll take it as a compliment.

616
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Sort of.

617
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,320
Have you checked Zhao Qiansun?

618
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,360
Yes.

619
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,160
There's nothing wrong with his alibi.

620
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,720
He said he was in Huifangli.

621
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Bao checked it himself.

622
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,280
Huifangli?

623
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
He's a painter in a girls' school.

624
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,160
Looks like he's well-paid.

625
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,600
He's a painter,

626
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,920
but he's allergic to paint.

627
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,840
How do you know?

628
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
You can tell by looking at his face.

629
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
I'll check it again.

630
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,440
Take care,

631
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,960
Li Fangfang.

632
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,160
Okay, thank you.

633
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,680
We are here.

634
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,400
Okay.

635
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,240
Be careful.

636
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay.

637
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
Inspector Luo, you are here.

638
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,600
This is...

639
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,040
Detective Situ.

640
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,120
This is the principal's secretary,

641
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,800
Xia Ru'an.

642
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,600
What's going on?

643
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,600
When Lin Jie was killed,

644
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,800
Principal Luo could keep it under control.

645
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,920
Now even she was killed.

646
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,880
How can the parents sit back?

647
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,240
Principal Fan is also ill.

648
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,000
We plan to

649
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,640
send the students back

650
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,880
and get this case solved first.

651
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,160
What about you?

652
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
How's the investigation going?

653
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,720
We almost raveled out the clues.

654
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,920
Did you find out the girl who committed suicide seven years ago?

655
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,120
Secretary Xia,

656
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
did Zhao Qiansun

657
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
come this semester too?

658
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,800
Yes.

659
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,240
Why? Are you suspecting him?

660
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,000
Do you know what he used to do?

661
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,480
I didn't ask about that.

662
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,760
But his resume

663
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,840
should be in the school archives room.

664
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,920
I'll find it for you.

665
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,000
There's no file of Zhao Qiansun.

666
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,080
There's really something wrong with him.

667
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,480
Did you also come this year?

668
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,040
Yes.

669
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,360
I've checked this.

670
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,920
Secretary Xia used to work as a proofreader

671
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,080
in a newspaper office in Fengtian.

672
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,560
Later, she came back to take care of her mother.

673
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,280
So she wanted to find a stable job close to home.

674
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
And when the incident happened,

675
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,840
she was with me.

676
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,200
Looks like

677
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,720
you want to give a job of the Luo family

678
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,120
to Secretary Xia.

679
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,600
I'm flattered, Inspector Luo.

680
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,160
I don't think I'm suitable.

681
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,640
Ms. Li Pei has been taking a long leave

682
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,800
since last year.

683
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,080
Yes.

684
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm not sure

685
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
why she's taking the leave.

686
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm not responsible for this kind of affairs.

687
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,160
Can you arrange me to talk face to face

688
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,040
with Li Pei and Tao Zhiling?

689
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,920
I'm afraid not now.

690
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,600
Ms. Li Pei is outside,

691
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,920
running the leave-school procedures for the students.

692
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,840
How about later?

693
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,480
By the way,

694
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,440
can you give a copy of each teacher's picture

695
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,360
to me?

696
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,240
Why do you want this?

697
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,680
I can't really tell who is whom.

698
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,720
OK.

699
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,520
The teachers are busy.

700
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,640
Let's go see Zhao Qiansun first.

701
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,200
Sure.

702
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,160
Have a seat.

703
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,960
Zhao Qiansun.

704
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,160
Yes.

705
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,360
How did you come to the school?

706
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,160
The school was hiring painters.

707
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
So I came.

708
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,760
Is there any problem?

709
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,960
They don't have your file.

710
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,800
Principal Luo hired me.

711
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,320
You have to ask her.

712
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,280
Otherwise,

713
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,360
Mr. Luo, you can summon spirits.

714
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,800
You...

715
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,880
Mr. Luo,

716
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,360
you know

717
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,400
on the day of the incident,

718
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,560
I have an alibi.

719
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,800
I'm not the murderer.

720
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,320
Looks like

721
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,880
you are not interested in

722
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,280
Mr. Li's money.

723
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,480
How did you know?

724
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,040
Since you've known about it,

725
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,320
I have nothing to hide.

726
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes.

727
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,840
I was ordered to keep an eye on Ye Zhenzhen

728
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,000
and find a breakthrough on her.

729
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,080
Who are you?

730
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,639
The ones you can't mess with.

731
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,280
Rumor has it that

732
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,679
Mr. Li was assassinated

733
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,600
because he offended some organization.

734
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,000
He was working for the government.

735
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,239
The best thing a businessman can offer

736
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,520
is nothing but money.

737
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
So the missing money

738
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,199
was supposed to be given to you.

739
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,800
After he died,

740
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
the money disappeared.

741
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,600
So someone sent you to get the money back.

742
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,199
But I'm curious about one thing.

743
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,760
How did you know

744
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,480
Ye Zhenzhen had the money?

745
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,159
She's just a student.

746
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,239
We didn't know.

747
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,120
We just widened our range of search.

748
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,160
Until Lin Jie died.

749
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,200
And we suspected from long ago

750
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,000
that there's something wrong

751
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,920
with that guy by Li's side.

752
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Looks like he really took the money.

753
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,480
He could even hide the money

754
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,880
on his niece.

755
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,200
It's really unexpected.

756
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,000
Since Mr. Situ said so,

757
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,880
you must know where the money is.

758
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,520
Please hand it over.

759
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,720
So your original purpose

760
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,560
was to follow the Ye family

761
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,760
and find that assistant

762
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,800
to get the money back.

763
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,240
Yes.

764
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
But he never showed up.

765
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,760
We knew he's probably dead.

766
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,000
On the train,

767
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,080
you should have searched

768
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,520
the Ye family's luggage.

769
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,120
We have long suspected

770
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Li was killed by him.

771
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,800
After that, he framed an organization.

772
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,880
And he asked his sister to come to Fengtian

773
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,840
at such a sensitive time.

774
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,440
If not for delivering the money,

775
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,520
what else could it be?

776
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,000
That's why we searched the luggage,

777
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,320
but we found nothing.

778
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,400
The money

779
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,880
was hidden in Ye Zhenzhen's violin.

780
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,600
Why do you keep talking about money?

781
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,160
Mr. Luo,

782
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,240
that was our money in the first place.

783
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,160
Someone took it.

784
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,200
Shouldn't we take it back?

785
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,360
What evidence do you have

786
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,680
to prove that the money is yours?

787
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,800
I advise you

788
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,840
to hand it over,

789
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,040
or you'll get into trouble.

790
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,720
You're a murderer.

791
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,080
And you are telling the police not to get into trouble?

792
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,000
I told you I didn't kill anyone.

793
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,320
I'm just a painter.

794
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,920
But there is one person

795
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,960
you should look into.

796
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Stop!

797
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,080
Why are you sneaking around

798
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,760
in front of my music classroom?

799
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,080
Is this your music classroom?

800
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,280
Why is this your music classroom?

801
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm a music teacher.

802
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,960
Of course this is my music classroom.

803
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,320
Well, I...

804
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,120
I was passing by.

805
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,680
I knew something was not right with Tao Zhiling.

806
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,680
Was Luo Jinyan's desk leg broken?

807
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,800
Are you out of your mind?

808
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,520
What kind of problem is that?

809
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,720
Were you fixing it?

810
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,280
I don't know if it's broken or not.

811
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,480
She didn't ask me to fix it.

812
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,960
But she did ask me to find her

813
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,720
a stick this long.

814
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,560
It's square.

815
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,280
I see.

816
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,600
Can I leave now?

817
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,000
Mr. Situ,

818
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,240
don't forget about the money.

819
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,880
It's you.

820
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,520
Secretary Xia said the police are looking for me.

821
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,840
You work for the police?

822
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,680
According to the file,

823
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,720
you took a year off last year.

824
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,880
Yes.

825
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,600
Can you tell me why?

826
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,560
I was too tired.

827
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,240
I wanted to rest.

828
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,160
Is this

829
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,360
related to the case?

830
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,400
Where have you been?

831
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,880
Guangdong.

832
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Guangxi.

833
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,000
Hunan.

834
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,840
All southern cities.

835
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,400
I was not feeling well,

836
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,760
so I wanted to go somewhere warm to recover.

837
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
Have you been to Fengtian?

838
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,640
No.

839
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,320
If there's any problem,

840
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,960
I'll come to you again.

841
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,920
I see.

842
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,080
Thank you, Mr. Situ.

843
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Is Ms. Zhou alright?

844
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,160
She's fine.

845
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,400
We are friends.

846
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,120
So she came to help me

847
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,640
to learn about the school.

848
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,080
Tao Zhiling is missing.

849
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,040
What?

850
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,760
I sent someone to follow her.

851
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,840
She left school this morning

852
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,400
and went to the tea garden for opera in Huifangli.

853
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,240
And then she went missing.

854
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,080
Okay.

855
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,920
Sir, welcome.

856
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,240
Liu.

857
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,320
What is this opera about?

858
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,440
White snake, green snake and Xu Xian. You haven't heard of it?

859
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,160
It's my first time.

860
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,960
Sir, Wolong nuts for you.

861
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,080
Waiter,

862
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,880
is Fahai on today?

863
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,360
You want to see Fahai?

864
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,600
Come back tomorrow.

865
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,480
Fahai?

866
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,720
Male or female?

867
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,280
What do you think?

868
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,000
Eat your food.

869
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,120
What happened?

870
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
What do you think?

871
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
Sir, what's wrong?

872
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Do you have any backdoor?

873
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,400
Backdoor?

874
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,520
There's one in the backstage.

875
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,640
Sir, you haven't paid yet.

876
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,560
We lost her. What should we do?

877
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
Go back and report.

878
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,240
Okay.

879
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,120
Go check the dorm.

880
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,680
I'll get the key from Auntie Lan.

881
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,520
Don't bother.

882
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,560
The victim, Tao Zhiling,

883
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,600
was shot in the head.

884
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,040
The skull was pierced.

885
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,840
The bullet trajectory and the gun

886
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,960
are the same as the traces when Lin Jie was killed.

887
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,280
It's certain that it's the same weapon.

888
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,720
The time of death was two hours ago.

889
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,800
By the way,

890
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
we can see some bruises on the victim.

891
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,440
She must have fought with someone before she died.
