1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
He was stabbed so many times.

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
The murderer must be venting anger on him.

4
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,479
It shows how much people hate you.

5
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
The communicating door is locked from the other side.

6
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,880
The window is so wide open.

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
Did the murderer run away?

8
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,040
You said the murderer is still on the train.

9
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
Did you say it to deceive them?

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
No.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
The murderer is still on the train.

12
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,600
Follow me.

13
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
As expected, no footprints.

14
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,880
No one came out

15
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,600
and it didn't snow.

16
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,040
So,

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,360
opening the window is just a smoke bomb.

18
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,440
God's way is higher than man's.

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,560
The train stopped for a night.

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
It's like God was helping us.

21
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
I must find the murderer.

22
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,880
What is this?

23
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,280
Sleeping pills.

24
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,920
It's loaded.

25
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,320
He was quite vigilant.

26
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,520
Pipe cleaner.

27
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,720
Pearl.

28
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,000
Pearl?

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
Pipe cleaner.

30
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
Barrister Situ.

31
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,880
Barrister Situ.

32
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,840
Evidence.

33
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
This is the evidence.

34
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
This is...

35
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,080
This belongs to the murderer.

36
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,120
Come with me.

37
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,520
No one believes me.

38
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,600
No one.

39
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,160
Why don't you believe me?

40
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,800
I have been so nervous since I came back.

41
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,840
I was trembling sitting on the bed.

42
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,040
Please help me.

43
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,520
Help me.

44
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,440
Don't be afraid.

45
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
We're all here.

46
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,880
What happened?

47
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,240
Take your time.

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,440
Now when I see the door,

49
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,840
I get scared.

50
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,520
And

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,400
just over there,

52
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,200
I saw this button.

53
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,280
It's not mine.

54
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm sure that last night,

55
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,280
someone must have entered my room.

56
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,120
It was the murderer.

57
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,159
It was him.

58
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,159
But you don't believe it.

59
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,360
Don't panic.

60
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,440
Calm down.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,360
If you keep on making so much noise,

62
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,240
you'll be the next one.

63
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
When was the communicating door locked?

64
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,800
Last night.

65
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,760
Liao Yun locked it.

66
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,720
Liao Yun?

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,640
Yes, the lady who kept coughing.

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,720
She kept coughing.

69
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
Coughing on and on.

70
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,560
Just ahead.

71
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
I was annoyed.

72
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,640
So I brought her here to get some cough medicine.

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,120
When I was looking for medicine for her...

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,840
It's in the box.

75
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,160
I asked her to check

76
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,200
if the communicating door was locked.

77
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,120
Yun.

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,720
Please check if the communicating door

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,520
has been locked for me.

80
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,520
Okay.

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,000
But she was so clumsy that

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,680
she opened the door

83
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,280
and fell in herself.

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,320
She then got out in a hurry.

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,240
Right.

86
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,800
She must have forgotten to lock it.

87
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
I've found the medicine.

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
I didn't check it.

89
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
I thought she locked it.

90
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,200
Thank you.

91
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,520
You're welcome.

92
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,560
So the murderer killed him

93
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,320
and escaped from the communicating door.

94
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
He escaped into my room.

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,080
Then why did the murderer do it?

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,040
He created a secret room

97
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
to make someone think

98
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
the murderer had jumped off the car and run away.

99
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
Someone?

100
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,760
By the way,

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,640
I don't believe

102
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,880
this is a pearl

103
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,240
fallen from you, right?

104
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,560
If I could afford such a precious pearl,

105
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
I wouldn't be in this industry.

106
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,560
This is...

107
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,320
I see.

108
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,440
Maybe

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,880
you have a red cheongsam?

110
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
What red cheongsam?

111
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,320
Before it fell,

112
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,240
I think this pearl

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,560
should be on the neck

114
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,920
of a lady or a madam.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,760
As for the pipe cleaner,

116
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,440
I think

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,960
it belongs to a man who smokes.

118
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,400
I've checked this carriage.

119
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
There are 12 rooms in total.

120
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,000
The smaller numbers are on the left.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,600
The bigger numbers are on the right.

122
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
The toilet

123
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,840
is close to Room One.

124
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,560
From Room One to Seven

125
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
is Situ Yan,

126
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,040
Ma Shiying,

127
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,800
Qi Hong,

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Princess Rong Xiang, Zong Yan, Bai Lu,

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
and Liao Yun.

130
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
Room Eight and Nine are connected.

131
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,760
George Brel lives in it.

132
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,840
Wan Jixiang is in Room 11.

133
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,679
Shi Chunshan is in Room Ten.

134
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,680
Okay.

135
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,400
You are done here.

136
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,880
You can leave now.

137
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,840
Leave the camera.

138
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,040
This is my camera.

139
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
Why would I take your camera?

140
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
After the photos are printed out,

141
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,000
we'll return the camera to you right away.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,160
Once the murderer is caught,

143
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
you can report at any time.

144
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Well...

145
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,400
Be gentle.

146
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,920
So naggy.

147
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,760
Tell me about yesterday.

148
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,760
The more detailed, the better.

149
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Okay.

150
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,280
The last station the train stopped at was

151
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,920
Jinzhou.

152
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,200
It arrived at 11:58 p.m.,

153
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
and stopped for about ten minutes.

154
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,080
No one got on or off.

155
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,680
After that, the train went on for 20 more minutes.

156
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,160
Till now.

157
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,400
The rails ahead were blown up because of the battle.

158
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,560
It's common.

159
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,680
I thought the traffic will be back to normal soon.

160
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,600
Not long after the train stopped,

161
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I heard Ma Shiying ring the bell.

162
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,520
I went to answer the bell.

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,760
Sir.

164
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,400
What can I do for you?

165
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,320
Go away.

166
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,880
Then he asked me to go away.

167
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,480
I thought he must have pressed it by mistake,

168
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,120
so I went back.

169
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,280
At that time,

170
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,240
Princess Rong Xiang rang the bell too.

171
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,920
She said she had rheumatism.

172
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,960
She asked me to call her maid, Shi Chunshan, over.

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,960
Princess Rong Xiang.

174
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,120
What can I do for you?

175
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,760
I have rheumatism.

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,240
Call Shi Chunshan from Room Ten here.

177
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,480
Okay.

178
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
Ms. Shi.

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
Princess Rong Xiang asked you to come over.

180
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,600
Got it.

181
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,080
Okay.

182
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,760
I went to inform Ms. Shi

183
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,080
and went back to duty.

184
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
I was bored,

185
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,480
so I drank with Wan Jixiang and the others for a while.

186
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,840
Zong.

187
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,000
The wine is really good.

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,640
Very good.

189
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,000
You're back.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Liu is back.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
Here, add more.

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,040
Okay.

193
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,920
Take off your coat.

194
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,960
It's okay.

195
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,480
Cheers.

196
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
I have work to do later.

197
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,120
Where were we?

198
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,360
Not bad.

199
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
How many years have you been working here?

200
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,960
For many years.

201
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,000
At about one o'clock,

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,920
someone rang the bell again.

203
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,920
It was you, Mr. Situ,

204
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,520
and that lady.

205
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
Do you need anything, Sir?

206
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,960
It was a quarter past one.

207
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,400
That's right.

208
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
Around that.

209
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,080
The lady in Room Three said

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,880
there was a man

211
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
in her room.

212
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,960
I didn't take it seriously.

213
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
What's so strange that

214
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,040
a woman like this

215
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,920
had a man in her room?

216
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,160
I went to check the communicating door for her.

217
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
The door was not locked.

218
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,880
Who knows if she left the door open for Ma Shiying.

219
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,520
I locked the door for her

220
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,800
and came out again

221
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
to answer your call.

222
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,200
After sending you water, Mr. Situ,

223
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
I've been in the night duty room.

224
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,880
I think

225
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,960
I picked up one of your buttons.

226
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
My buttons are all here.

227
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,760
It's not mine.

228
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,680
Was there another conductor last night?

229
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,760
No.

230
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,000
This is the rule.

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,480
The first-class carriage

232
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,960
only has one conductor.

233
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,560
To avoid the mixing of customer's habits

234
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,920
due to handover,

235
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,240
other conductors are not allowed in.

236
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,120
But sometimes I go chat with them.

237
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,920
Do you smoke?

238
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
We don't allow smoking.

239
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,960
Did you see anyone else

240
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,040
in the passage last night?

241
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,240
Yes.

242
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,120
A woman

243
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,840
wearing a red cheongsam or a skirt of some kind.

244
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,880
She went to the bathroom.

245
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Do you remember who it was?

246
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,240
I didn't see her face.

247
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,560
It must be one of the ladies on the train.

248
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,120
Thank you.

249
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,840
Can I get my salary from last week?

250
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,240
You have to wait until the case is closed.

251
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,040
Go ahead and ask.

252
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll tell you everything I know.

253
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Barrister Situ,

254
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
I really don't know

255
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,400
about the murder.

256
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,640
I really don't know.

257
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,680
Aren't you his secretary?

258
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,480
I am.

259
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,240
But I'm not in charge of murder.

260
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,800
I know Russian.

261
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
I help him take care of some documents.

262
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,360
And I translate for him.

263
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,720
He doesn't know Russian at all.

264
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,680
I'm not involved

265
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,000
in anything else.

266
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,760
He wanted to beat you yesterday.

267
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,440
I tried to help you.

268
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,720
You can't be so ungrateful.

269
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,600
Speaking of yesterday's quarrel,

270
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
he said something about me,

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,560
"a trick of a scholar".

272
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,600
How arrogant.

273
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,200
You're playing a trick of a scholar again, aren't you?

274
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
Come on, kill me.

275
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,800
Come on.

276
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,320
What did he mean?

277
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,600
Don't you know

278
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,640
what you did?

279
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,760
What did I do?

280
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,920
Well...

281
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,320
Just answer my questions.

282
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,880
The threatening letter.

283
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,320
The threatening letter?

284
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,840
Didn't you write this?

285
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,640
Is it your style?

286
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,320
Anything else?

287
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,480
No.

288
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,240
Just two letters.

289
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,680
We received them over the past two days.

290
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,880
I didn't expect Ma Shiying

291
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,400
would be scared by such tricks.

292
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,880
Exactly.

293
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,720
After he saw you yesterday,

294
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,160
he said he wants to switch carriage.

295
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,280
Who would have expected

296
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,560
that he hadn't even got the time to switch

297
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,640
before he was killed.

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,960
This morning,

299
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,840
Liu came to me.

300
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,320
I knew something was wrong.

301
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,560
When was the last time you saw him?

302
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
Last night.

303
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,840
When he said he wanted to switch room.

304
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Do you know

305
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,320
he takes sleeping pills at night?

306
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,720
I had no idea.

307
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,320
I heard him say

308
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,840
he couldn't sleep well on the train.

309
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,120
What did you do

310
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,360
after leaving his room?

311
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,000
I drank with Zong Yan.

312
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,840
After the train stopped,

313
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,040
we even smoked together

314
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,480
at the door.

315
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,560
It was too cold outside.

316
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,800
I didn't even wear a coat.

317
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
We came back after smoking for a little while.

318
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,360
What cigarette did you smoke?

319
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,280
Hold on.

320
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,320
I've quit.

321
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,960
Here.

322
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,960
After smoking?

323
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
After that,

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,400
we went back to drink.

325
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,520
Till what time?

326
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,960
Who would remember that?

327
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,280
We had a long chat.

328
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,080
The longer we talked,

329
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
the happier we got.

330
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,280
I went to sleep after I went back to my room.

331
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,320
Right.

332
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,000
Liu came by during that time.

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,160
We drank for a while.

334
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
But soon after that, someone pressed the bell,

335
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,520
and he went out again.

336
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
Did you see

337
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
anyone passing by during this time?

338
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
The conductor.

339
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Liu.

340
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,960
He went back and forth.

341
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
After we came back,

342
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,720
he came up too.

343
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,200
After that,

344
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
a woman passed by.

345
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,200
Who?

346
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,600
In a red cheongsam.

347
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,240
She should be very young.

348
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Liu got on when the train was about to leave.

349
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
Really?

350
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,760
I don't remember.

351
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
I drank too much yesterday.

352
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,240
Well...

353
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,560
Why don't you ask Zong?

354
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,640
He didn't drink.

355
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
He must remember it.

356
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,680
He didn't drink?

357
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,160
He never drinks.

358
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,840
He said

359
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
all soldiers don't drink.

360
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,840
Thank you.

361
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,200
That's who I am.

362
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,240
I never drink.

363
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,680
The battlefield is unpredictable.

364
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,000
Every minute

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
could be a matter of life and death.

366
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
I must always be alert.

367
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
I'm different from some specious scout

368
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,840
like you.

369
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,040
Really?

370
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,920
I'll give it a try.

371
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,120
What are you looking at?

372
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
What if I look at you?

373
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
If I had a gun,

374
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,640
you wouldn't have had a chance to pull out your gun.

375
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,560
Mr. Zong.

376
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
We're here to investigate

377
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,680
for the safety of the whole train.

378
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,400
Please cooperate.

379
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,680
Look at him.

380
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,560
Look how he talks.

381
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,080
Don't try to irritate

382
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,800
whoever you meet.

383
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,960
I've never seen someone who's been in battlefield

384
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,920
that doesn't drink.

385
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,680
That's why your army isn't good enough.

386
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,680
Mr. Zong.

387
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
Wan Jixiang said

388
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
after you returned to the room after smoking,

389
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,080
a conductor walked by.

390
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,760
Is that so?

391
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,240
Yes, that's true.

392
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,240
Liu got on when the train was about to leave.

393
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,600
Did I say I saw Liu Zijie?

394
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,280
I saw another conductor.

395
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,360
Walking past here,

396
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
to the dining car.

397
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,200
We've had two bottles.

398
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,840
Really?

399
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,760
He never came back.

400
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Are you sure?

401
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,000
Did you mistake him for someone else?

402
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,560
Absolutely not.

403
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,080
Although I didn't see his face,

404
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,200
his figure was much smaller

405
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,280
than Liu Zijie's.

406
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,600
People from the battlefield

407
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,480
are very sensitive to body shape.

408
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,880
It was definitely not Liu.

409
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,040
What did you talk about that night?

410
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,000
You mean Wan Jixiang and I?

411
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,400
What can men possibly talk about?

412
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,520
Women.

413
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,360
Fighting wars.

414
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,160
Just chit-chat.

415
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,680
Till when?

416
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,600
Half past one.

417
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,960
Maybe later.

418
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,040
And then?

419
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,880
He was drunk.

420
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,160
I took him to bed.

421
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,360
And it was the next morning.

422
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,000
You were so noisy

423
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,760
in the dining car.

424
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,000
I didn't knew something happened until then.

425
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,080
To be honest,

426
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,920
Barrister Situ,

427
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
whether Ma Shiying is alive or dead

428
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
is none of my business.

429
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,960
Why do I think you are the murderer?

430
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,600
Ma Shiying is a killer.

431
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,640
You can sneak into his room

432
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,680
and kill him.

433
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,400
Only you

434
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,480
is capable of doing this.

435
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,240
Didn't you just say

436
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
the murderer must be that reporter?

437
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Whose side are you on?

438
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,800
The truth.

439
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,560
I think you're the only one who smokes pipes on this train.

440
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,920
Right?

441
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,640
Is this yours?

442
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,280
Maybe.

443
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,040
They all look the same.

444
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,520
I have a few more.

445
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,120
Can this solve the case?

446
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,760
I can gift you a few more.

447
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,040
This was found at the crime scene.

448
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,200
So what?

449
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,040
Mr. Zong, are you going to Harbin?

450
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,440
Fengtian.

451
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,760
Something urgent?

452
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,120
Of course not.

453
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,840
I've been discharged for so many years.

454
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,760
Now,

455
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,000
all I have is time.

456
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,880
So you don't have to work for any government anymore.

457
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,560
I've risked my life for too many years.

458
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,960
I'm tired of it.

459
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
But if it was not urgent,

460
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,440
why didn't you wait for a day?

461
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,600
You left your luggage at the hotel, didn't you?

462
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,640
Here's the thing.

463
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,320
I don't like

464
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,160
to change my schedule after it's set.

465
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,360
Thank you.

466
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,360
You're welcome.

467
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,560
Trust me.

468
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,240
My intuition tells me

469
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,160
he is the murderer.

470
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,960
He bribed Wan Jixiang

471
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,640
and got the exact schedule of the deceased.

472
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,960
Then he got on the train with a ticket.

473
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
He made the secretary give his alibi.

474
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,600
In the end,

475
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,680
he killed Ma Shiying.

476
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,200
According to the original plan,

477
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,160
when we found the deceased this morning,

478
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,680
he should have got off the train in Fengtian.

479
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,040
For now,

480
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,720
I'd rather trust a woman's intuition.

481
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,120
Call a lady here.

482
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,480
Her Highness,

483
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,680
or that coughing lady?

484
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,880
No, trust me. It must be him.

485
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,960
The owner of the pipe cleaner.

486
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,200
The owner of the pearl.

487
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,680
The woman in a red cheongsam.

488
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,360
The man in a conductor uniform.

489
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,600
Who is the murderer?

490
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
This is easy.

491
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,920
I know.

492
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,680
Just like that button.

493
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,760
Double clues.

494
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,960
The man who smoked the pipe

495
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,600
tried to frame the woman with pearls.

496
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,320
But he accidentally

497
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
left the pipe cleaner at the crime scene.

498
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,960
I learned it from you.

499
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,960
Let's go and see

500
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,760
which woman

501
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,040
the man smoking the pipe was trying to frame?

502
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,640
Can I have a look?

503
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,640
Is this what you want?

504
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
It's a cap rack.

505
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,240
But it's not like this.

506
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,440
That's all.

507
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,040
Your Highness.

508
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
Can I talk to you about

509
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,280
what happened last night?

510
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,080
Go ahead.

511
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,040
I'd like to ask you two

512
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,160
what you did last night.

513
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,160
Last night,

514
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,200
I wanted to sleep early.

515
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,720
But

516
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,240
I had rheumatism.

517
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,600
Princess Rong Xiang.

518
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,280
What can I do for you?

519
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,280
I asked the conductor to call her over and massage me.

520
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,520
When was it?

521
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,240
About...

522
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,360
About one o'clock.

523
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,520
At that time,

524
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,920
the car had stopped for a while.

525
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,880
How long did she stay in your room?

526
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,680
About two quarters.

527
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
My leg pain was alleviated a little,

528
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,400
so I asked her to go back to rest.

529
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,040
She didn't want me to catch a cold,

530
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,920
so she brought some quilt here.

531
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,240
That was about

532
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,640
a quarter past one.

533
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,200
Did you meet anyone last night?

534
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,800
I think I met a conductor.

535
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,400
Was it Liu Zijie?

536
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,520
No. Not him.

537
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,760
I've never seen him.

538
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,880
Then after that,

539
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,160
did you see that person again?

540
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,080
No.

541
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,680
Do you remember

542
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
what he looks like?

543
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,000
I didn't pay much attention.

544
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,760
Your Highness.

545
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,960
I've brought quilt here.

546
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,920
Come in.

547
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,200
He was short.

548
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,680
Not as tall as Liu Zijie.

549
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,320
I don't remember anything else.

550
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,880
So when you saw him,

551
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,560
it should be about a quarter past one.

552
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,480
Yes, about that time.

553
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,320
When I

554
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,600
brought the quilt over.

555
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,680
Thank you.

556
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,320
Ask your men to search every room

557
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,680
and their luggage.

558
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,320
I guess the conductor uniform

559
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,800
should be in

560
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,120
a woman's suitcase.

561
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,200
Ma'am,

562
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
can I borrow this?

563
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,280
Of course.

564
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:56,960
By the way,

565
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,600
Ma'am, I think this should be yours.

566
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,560
It fell on the ground.

567
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,680
It's not mine.

568
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,320
Really?

569
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,760
Then I should ask someone else.

570
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,360
Your cough seems to be much better.

571
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,720
Thank you for your concern.

572
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,160
Thanks to Bai Lu,

573
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,560
who took care of me the whole night.

574
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,200
Bai Lu?

575
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,560
Yes.

576
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,160
The female student next door.

577
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,000
She seemed

578
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,800
to be very sorry

579
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,160
for not being able to borrow medicine for me.

580
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
She kept me company till around 12.

581
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
When the train stopped,

582
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,160
I asked her to go back and rest.

583
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,560
After that,

584
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,000
I coughed and

585
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
couldn't sleep well for the whole night.

586
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,000
I think

587
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
the medicine must have worked.

588
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,840
It's not that bad now.

589
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,320
What's that sound?

590
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,160
There seems to be something wrong

591
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,200
with Bai Lu's room door.

592
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,480
Whenever you open or close the door,

593
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,800
it makes noise.

594
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Did she leave again

595
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,800
after she went back yesterday?

596
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,480
I don't think so.

597
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,680
The door remained silent

598
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,840
for the whole night.

599
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,920
Can I ask you

600
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,760
a very personal question?

601
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,200
If it can help you solve the case,

602
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
I think so.

603
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,240
We are all scared.

604
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,800
Ma'am, I want to know

605
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,040
if you have a red cheongsam.

606
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't like red.

607
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,240
Bright colors don't suit me.

608
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,280
I heard

609
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,400
you went into Ma Shiying's room last night.

610
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
You offended that kind of person.

611
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm sure you're still confused.

612
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,680
I have that kind of experience.

613
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,120
I must have lost my mind due to the illness,

614
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,960
so I opened the wrong door and fell in.

615
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,360
He... He even...

616
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
I understand.

617
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,760
So I went out hurriedly.

618
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,440
I really don't want to recall what happened last night.

619
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,280
I'm sorry.

620
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,080
You are not suspecting

621
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,280
a weak lady

622
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,560
of killing that man, are you?

623
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,280
I just want to get the piece of puzzle

624
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,960
from her.

625
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,640
Thanks a lot.

626
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,120
Can I ask you a few questions?

627
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,160
The red cheongsam is not mine.

628
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,000
So you know whose it is?

629
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,160
Something is wrong with my door.

630
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,440
I told the conductor

631
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,800
and he said he would fix it.

632
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,680
Besides,

633
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,600
Mrs. Liao coughed all night.

634
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
I didn't sleep well all night.

635
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,480
I saw a woman

636
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,280
in a red cheongsam walking by last night.

637
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,240
I have another question for you.

638
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,480
Did you drop the pearl?

639
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,000
You are not suspecting

640
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,520
the student of killing Ma Shiying, are you?

641
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,520
If you hear something

642
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,320
or see something,

643
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,760
or if you feel endangered,

644
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,800
you can come to me anytime.

645
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,360
Before the train stops

646
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,520
in Fengtian,

647
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,120
we must find the murderer.

648
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,920
Otherwise, all of you

649
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,280
will be sent to the police station.

650
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,760
By then,

651
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
they won't be as gentle as us.

652
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,360
I almost have

653
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
it figured out.

654
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,600
Based on what they said,

655
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,320
the train stopped in Jinzhou.

656
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,640
Then, a skinny person

657
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,160
in a conductor uniform

658
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,360
got on the train.

659
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,320
He used the conductor's key

660
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,760
to open Ma Shiying's door

661
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,680
and killed him.

662
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,480
Then he created the secret room as you said.

663
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,120
In the end,

664
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,600
he left from Qi Hong's room.

665
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,280
How did he

666
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,360
disappear in the train?

667
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,440
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

668
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,760
Fine.

669
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,880
Let me tell you.

670
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,880
Each evidence

671
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,600
corresponds to a piece of the puzzle.

672
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,840
When we put all the pieces together,

673
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,600
the truth will be revealed.

674
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,720
You've played jigsaw puzzle before, haven't you?

675
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,160
Xu...

676
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,960
Xu...

677
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,040
Xu Huaichang died in a naval battle.

678
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,280
He died in a battle?

679
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,000
But

680
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,480
it doesn't matter

681
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,360
how he died.

682
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,440
There's one more thing about the Xu family

683
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,920
that you may want to know.

684
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,440
What is it?

685
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
The Xu family's tragedy.

686
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,360
The Xu family's tragedy?

687
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,679
It took place in Harbin 12 years ago.

688
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,960
The murderer sneaked into the Xu family

689
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
and killed Xu Huaichang's wife, Yuqin,

690
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
and his daughter.

691
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,280
After the incident,

692
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
a student of Mrs. Xu's called the police.

693
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,280
She described the murderer's face.

694
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,040
The police suspected that

695
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,719
the murderer collaborated with Xu's maid.

696
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,040
Plus, during the interrogation,

697
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,080
the testimony of the maid did not match.

698
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,159
In the end, she was sentenced to death.

699
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,159
But before the execution, this maid committed suicide

700
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,239
and left a suicide note to confess her innocence.

701
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,800
What valuable things

702
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,960
could the poor single mother and daughter have?

703
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,920
Exactly.

704
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,000
So there was great controversy about this.

705
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,760
After Xu Huaichang died,

706
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,679
Mrs. Xu used Huaichang as her pen name

707
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,400
to write in the newspaper and support the political reform.

708
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,680
Plus, the murderer hasn't been brought to justice yet.

709
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,320
So the reason of the murder

710
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,880
has no specific explanation yet.

711
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,240
Who else was there in the Xu family?

712
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,040
Xu Huaichang had a sister.

713
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,280
There was a cook

714
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,560
and a maid.

715
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
The maid who committed suicide.

716
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,920
But neither of them was home

717
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,080
when the murder happened.

718
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,080
What was Ma Shiying doing back then?

719
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,000
Ma Shiying.

720
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,640
Let me check.

721
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,080
I'm working on his exclusive report.

722
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,560
Here.

723
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,960
This is a photo of Ma Shiying from 11 years ago.

724
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,920
A few years after the incident,

725
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,080
Ma Shiying stayed in Harbin.

726
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,240
Could the murderer of Xu family's tragedy

727
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,400
be Ma Shiying?

728
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,720
Don't note it down.

729
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,120
Your pen

730
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,200
is much scarier than Ma Shiying.

731
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,800
By the way,

732
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,880
someone on the train

733
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,160
has something to do with the Xu family.

734
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,600
Who?

735
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,320
Princess Rong Xiang.

736
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,400
She is Mrs. Xu's godmother.

737
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,960
Brother.

738
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
We found a conductor uniform

739
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,640
in Shi Chunshan's luggage.

740
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,760
Step back a little.

741
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,040
Stand still.

742
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,800
It's not mine.

743
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,280
It's not mine.

744
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,400
Stand still.

745
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,760
Someone must be trying to frame me.

746
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
Mr. Situ.

747
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,920
It wasn't me. I didn't kill anyone.

748
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,240
This is not mine.

749
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,480
I don't know when it was placed here.

750
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,120
Someone must be trying to frame me.

751
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,040
You can't wrong a good person.

752
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,640
I think

753
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
you've been taking care of Her Highness all night.

754
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,000
You had no time to kill.

755
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,720
The murderer left Room Three

756
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,560
in the conductor uniform.

757
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,800
And he changed into a red cheongsam here,

758
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,120
so he left the uniform here.

759
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,960
Do you have a red cheongsam?

760
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,840
I don't have a red cheongsam.

761
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,640
What about this pearl?

762
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,120
I don't know.

763
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,080
I don't have one.

764
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,000
I want to know

765
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,640
how long has Her Highness been suffering from rheumatism?

766
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,560
For many years.

767
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,120
When I first started serving Her Highness,

768
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,400
she had it.

769
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,520
Especially in the past two years,

770
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,680
in winter,

771
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,040
she couldn't even walk.

772
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,880
You've been with her for years?

773
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,800
Yes.

774
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,480
Then you should know Xu Huaichang

775
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,600
and his wife Yuqin.

776
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,480
Yes.

777
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,360
What about the tragedy of the Xu family?

778
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,520
Miss Yuqin was so kind.

779
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,680
I can't imagine

780
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,880
what kind of vicious person

781
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,040
could commit such a cruel crime.

782
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,200
I'm suspecting everyone I see.

783
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,360
What do you think?

784
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,400
My intuition tells me

785
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,880
everyone could be the murderer.

786
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,000
Can't your intuition

787
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
be a little more stable?

788
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,440
This is too complicated.

789
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,920
He deserved it.

790
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,280
He deserved it.

791
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,920
If I knew he was the murderer,

792
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,640
I would have killed him too.

793
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,560
Definitely.

794
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,840
You haven't been in touch with Mrs. Xu

795
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,480
for a long time.

796
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,920
It was my fault.

797
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,640
I watched her grow up.

798
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,200
But she supported the foreigners' things.

799
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,600
She betrayed me

800
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,840
and her father.

801
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,440
Later,

802
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,640
her husband died.

803
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,920
She was wanted in Nanjing

804
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,800
and fled to Fengtian.

805
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,800
Her mother was soft-hearted.

806
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,360
She wanted me to persuade her father

807
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,600
and let her go home.

808
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,600
If I knew the times would change,

809
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,880
I should have let her stay in the family

810
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,760
and this wouldn't have happened to her.

811
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,200
It was my fault.

812
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,120
I got her killed.

813
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,640
At least when Mrs. Xu was alive,

814
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,760
she was happy.

815
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,480
I'm old.

816
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,520
Times have changed.

817
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,240
Can I ask you more about

818
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
what you did

819
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,400
after Shi Chunshan left last night?

820
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,040
Or did you hear anything?

821
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,800
Last night,

822
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,160
even if I didn't call Shi Chunshan over,

823
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,320
I wouldn't have been able to

824
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,120
run over and kill

825
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,480
Ma Shiying given my condition.

826
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,440
Next time, you can try to spend the winter in the south.

827
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,480
You'll feel better.

828
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,640
I didn't expect

829
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,800
it would be so serious this year.

830
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,600
Maybe

831
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,720
it's fate

832
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,600
that I got on this train.

833
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,000
Are you still in touch with the Xu family?

834
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,200
After the incident,

835
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,800
I haven't contacted them for years.

836
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,400
I heard that Mrs. Xu's mother is still alive.

837
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
But she's not in good health.

838
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,440
The girl's death

839
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,960
was a big blow to her.

840
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,960
After what happened to the Xu family,

841
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,360
she never recovered.

842
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,600
I really want to bring this good news to her.

843
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,240
Maybe

844
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,800
it'll help her.

845
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,160
Everyone has been checked.

846
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
We still don't know whose pearl and cheongsam these are.

847
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,480
Only Room Eight and Nine are left.

848
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,520
There's another woman in the car.

849
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,000
Impossible.

850
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,680
We've checked.

851
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,000
He ordered rice for two.

852
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,080
Rice for two.

853
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,600
Send it to my room when it's done.

854
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,560
Yes, sir.

855
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
So I think...

856
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,320
Don't say "I think".

857
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,160
You'd better think it through if you think at all.

858
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,400
He's an American diplomat.

859
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,520
Brother.

860
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,040
Brother.

861
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,520
I found the red cheongsam.

862
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,360
Where is it?

863
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,040
Take me there.

864
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,520
Okay.

865
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,320
Is the cheongsam

866
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,480
really inside?

867
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,080
I think so.

868
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,080
But I don't think Mr. Situ is that kind of person.

869
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,040
So he's a thief crying "Stop thief".

870
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,480
Is it a challenge or a warning?
