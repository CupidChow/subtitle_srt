1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,160
Did you find anything valuable?

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,440
No.

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,120
Chairman Luo was killed after 9:30.

5
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
So...

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,200
So after investigating,

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,080
we're back to square one.

8
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,400
They cleared my name for a while.

9
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,520
To prove that I didn't have an alibi,

10
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,040
they even changed the time of my dad's murder

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,200
to 9:30.

12
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,080
If it weren't for this,

13
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,960
I wouldn't have known my family

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
has become like this.

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,680
They are forcing me to turn myself in.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
But if you turn yourself in,

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,320
the murderer will be free.

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
At 9 p.m.,

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,040
Xie Hua saw a stranger

20
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,400
at your door.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,760
According to his description,

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,240
this person

23
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,880
was the same person who sent you back.

24
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,040
The police have started investigating.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,440
However,

26
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,800
you're still wanted.

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
A stranger who Xie Hua doesn't know

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,960
came to our house

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,280
and found my dad's study.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,480
My dad happened to leave open a window for him.

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,760
After the crime,

32
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,120
he even sent me back to the hotel.

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,200
Do you believe that?

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,280
But he is the most likely person

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,520
who knows your whereabouts after you got drunk.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,280
He sneaked into our house

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,600
and sent me back to the hotel.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,520
Why does it sound like I paid someone to kill my dad?

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,240
When all the clues

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
lead to the same conclusion,

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,720
another conclusion will come out soon.

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,040
Cigarettes.

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,120
Cigarettes.

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
Jin Qiming.

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Situ.

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,640
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,280
Do you need my help?

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,720
There's something

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,120
I need you to investigate for me.

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Sure, let's talk inside.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm going to hand in my manuscript.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
It's about the Luo family.

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,240
The Luo family?

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,480
Wei Minxi and Master Luo had known each other since early youth.

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,560
Later, the Luo family left their hometown

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,040
and went to Harbin for business.

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,160
Wei Minxi got married.

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,960
Her husband was also a businessman.

59
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,720
He was quite rich.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,480
But he

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,440
had problems in drinking, domestic violence and cheating.

62
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,920
Five years ago,

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
Wei Minxi came to Harbin with her husband.

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,880
Two years later,

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,680
her husband died of alcohol abuse.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,040
What about Wei Minxi?

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,960
Wei Minxi was killed at home.

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,680
There were signs of struggle in the house.

69
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
The police concluded that

70
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
it was some roaming marauders.

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,760
But there was something strange.

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,160
What was it?

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,600
Master Luo soon got killed after that.

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,360
I don’t think it’s a coincidence.

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,280
So I looked into it.

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,520
You found something else?

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,600
I asked my friend from the bank

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,360
to get Wei Minxi's turnover.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,200
I found out that every month in the past two years,

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,600
she would disburse a large sum of money from their deposit.

81
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,480
I don't think she would

82
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,560
hide the money at home

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
or lend it to someone.

84
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
She was unfamiliar with Harbin.

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
The Luo family was her closest friends.

86
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,360
No one in the Luo family lacks of money.

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
So I think

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,520
maybe she was blackmailed.

89
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
And the reason

90
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
was relevant to her husband's sudden death?

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,640
What's the connection?

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,720
Soon after Wei Minxi

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,600
met Mr. Luo in Harbin,

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
her husband died suddenly.

95
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,800
Actually, people in the newspaper office,

96
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,560
they don't believe it's such a coincidence.

97
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,120
But due to the pressure from the Luo family,

98
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
no one dares to question it.

99
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,880
You really can make up stories.

100
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Her husband suddenly died.

101
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
What does it have to do with my family?

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,680
He...

103
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
He's wanted by the police.

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Yes, I'm wanted.

105
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
Report me.

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,320
Mr. Luo.

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,200
I... I dare not.

108
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,240
I won't.

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,520
As long as Situ trusts you,

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,560
I trust you.

111
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,920
Why don't you ask me?

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,520
What do you want to know?

113
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,120
I'll tell you everything.

114
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
I want to know in the past two years,

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
how much money did Wei Minxi withdraw in total?

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
20,000.

117
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,480
It doesn't tally.

118
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
What do you mean?

119
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
The police found hundreds of silver dollars

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,760
in Fang Hong's house.

121
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
The amount is too different.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,280
I think...

123
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,320
Hundreds of silver dollars.

124
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
Fang Hong.

125
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
He could make ten silver dollars

126
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
in a month at best.

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,480
Hundreds?

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,200
He said his mother was sick.

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,880
The housekeeper advanced him the money.

130
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,480
Actually, I...

131
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,080
He's an orphan.

132
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
There's no mother.

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,840
Actually, I've investigated Fang Hong.

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,120
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
I’ve investigated everyone

136
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
in your family.

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
But Fang Hong is out of the ordinary.

138
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,640
Before he went to Mr. Luo’s house,

139
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,200
he worked for Li’s.

140
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,800
But he left after a few days.

141
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,280
After that, he lived in the 16th Street.

142
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,400
16th street.

143
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
Full up at New World Restaurant.

144
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,120
Applaud at Grand Stage.

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,160
Take a bath at New Spring.

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
Sleep well at Huifangli. That's the place.

147
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
He must be rich.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,520
Mr. Li from the Li's,

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
is famous for being afraid of his wife.

150
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,040
He opened the shop under his father-in-law's help.

151
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,840
A few years ago,

152
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,760
he had a lover in Huifangli,

153
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
kept it a secret.

154
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,600
He feared his wife would find out.

155
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,960
Coincidentally,

156
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Fang Hong also has a lover,

157
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
also in Huifangli.

158
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
Not only at the Li's,

159
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,800
at those shops Fang Hong used to work at,

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
the same thing happened.

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
Every time he resigned,

162
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,159
he would go to Daowai and squander.

163
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,040
He's a longterm labourer.

164
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,280
Where did he get the money?

165
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,920
After he went to my house,

166
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,600
he must have heard Bai Shanshan gossip about Aunt Wei.

167
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,440
Of course he wouldn't miss

168
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
such a good opportunity

169
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,720
to blackmail him.

170
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,800
And his job

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
was taking personal care of my dad.

172
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,120
I guess Aunt Wei

173
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,440
was afraid that he would harm my dad.

174
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
So she didn't tell him.

175
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,400
It's reasonable.

176
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
In that case,

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,440
why did Wen Yi cover up for this bastard?

178
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Did she have any secret?

179
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,960
Opium paste.

180
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,080
What are you looking for?

181
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
Mr. Situ.

182
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,320
Your mysteriously appearance

183
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,920
may scare me to death.

184
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,680
Well,

185
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,600
Ms. Wen asked me

186
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,480
to clean the yard.

187
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,120
Look.

188
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm working.

189
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,720
You can earn a lot

190
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
by sweeping the floor every day.

191
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,000
Mr. Situ,

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
please don't teasing me.

193
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,679
My family is sick.

194
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,679
We need money urgently.

195
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,039
That's why I asked for my salary in advance.

196
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,760
I explained to you last time.

197
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,720
But you didn't say

198
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,840
where you got the money for Huifangli.

199
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,080
Mr. Situ,

200
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,000
nowadays,

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,240
people who have money,

202
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
who wouldn't want to enrich their experience?

203
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,720
Maybe we can meet a rich employer.

204
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,280
Mr. Luo has been there too.

205
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,960
The young master of the Xie family

206
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
is a regular there.

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Even Ms. Wen.

208
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,800
If she hadn't been there,

209
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,640
how could I find this job?

210
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,320
If you suspect anyone who's rich,

211
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
who's been to the 16th Street.

212
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Then everyone in this house

213
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,440
will be involved.

214
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,280
But not everyone in this house

215
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,680
has blackmailed Mr. Li.

216
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
Now your master

217
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,920
was killed for a blackmail case.

218
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,240
And coincidentally,

219
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,400
there is a habitual offender in the house.

220
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Blackmail, what are you talking about?

221
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,520
I kindly

222
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,880
kept the secret for them.

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,920
Mr. Li

224
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,000
thought I was loyal and honest,

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,600
so he gave me more money.

226
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,760
That bit of money,

227
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,080
you and the masters of the Luo family are scornful of.

228
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,920
I don’t need to

229
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,960
kill someone

230
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,920
for this bit of money.

231
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,800
The Luo family

232
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,320
has more secrets than Mr. Li?

233
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,240
Of course.

234
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,160
Mr. Situ,

235
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,560
I'm telling you

236
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
so that you won't think of me as a murderer any more.

237
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,680
I'm not capable of killing.

238
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,800
I can always tell

239
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,880
if someone has secrets.

240
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,040
Master had a secret.

241
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
So I thought

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,360
I needed to find out Master's secret,

243
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,400
share his burden.

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,880
He was always alone,

245
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,280
mumbling, in a daze.

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,600
You're such a kind and considerate person.

247
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,120
Of course.

248
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,720
Unfortunately,

249
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,880
your master

250
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
didn't understand your thoughtfulness.

251
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
Exactly.

252
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,840
If he had told me earlier,

253
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
he wouldn't have been killed.

254
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,600
Then you would be killed.

255
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,280
But I know who the murderer is.

256
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,360
You have to believe me.

257
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
It's Ms. Wen.

258
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,160
You took Wen Yi's money.

259
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,000
This is how you keep her secret?

260
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,480
She told you everything?

261
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,280
The villain is accusing me.

262
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
So you'll suspect me.

263
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,200
Mr. Situ,

264
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,680
you can't fall into her trap.

265
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,120
She must be the murderer.

266
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,000
Two days ago,

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
I heard her arguing with Master.

268
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,640
Master was very angry and told her to get out.

269
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,360
So you used this to blackmail her?

270
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,640
I blackmailed her

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,720
because she's been cooking the books,

272
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,160
losing the family's money.

273
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,520
Me blackmailing her

274
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,440
even helped Master get back some losses.

275
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,480
Master had a fight with her.

276
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
He must have found out.

277
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
The money she lost

278
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,480
could put her into prison for decades.

279
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,680
Anyone in her shoes

280
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,960
would kill him.

281
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,080
Madam.

282
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,960
Madam.

283
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,600
Before the incident,

284
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,920
you also searched this desk, right?

285
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,760
Did you see a silver knife?

286
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,400
I didn't

287
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,280
take the silver knife.

288
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,000
Master bought the silver knife.

289
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,680
Can't I take it out and have a look?

290
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,800
What before and after the incident?

291
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
It has nothing to do with me.

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,520
Don't try to frame me.

293
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,640
I heard there were people coming in at the front door

294
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,720
and the back door.

295
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,080
So I left.

296
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,400
Who took the silver knife?

297
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,000
It must be the one who came in later.

298
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
What time was it?

299
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,880
6 p.m.

300
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
It's none of your business.

301
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,560
Your master's talking. Don't interrupt.

302
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,200
How did Wen Yi teach the servants?

303
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,520
How dare you!

304
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,600
Madam.

305
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,040
When you left that day,

306
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,400
did you forget to put back the tablecloth?

307
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,480
I'm the hostess of this house.

308
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
I can't search my drawer?

309
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
All of them

310
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,800
are guarding against me as if I'm a thief.

311
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,720
Of course I couldn't let them see me.

312
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
When I left that day,

313
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,440
the silver knife was still in the desk.

314
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
Don't try to blame it on me.

315
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
Mr. Situ.

316
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm looking for Wen Yi.

317
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,600
Ms. Wen went out.

318
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,320
She will be back before dinner.

319
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,360
Are you suspecting

320
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,920
she is the murderer?

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,920
Where is your boss?

322
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,360
I am the boss.

323
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
Have you collected

324
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,040
this kind of ring these days?

325
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,920
Zhang showed us

326
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,680
a ring like this he just got.

327
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,520
What?

328
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,680
Is it stolen?

329
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
Who is Zhang?

330
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,080
The owner of the opium den next door.

331
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,720
People who come here

332
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,600
usually don't get their property righteously.

333
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,360
If you lose something,

334
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,600
just accept it.

335
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
Don't make us small business suffer losses.

336
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,880
Small business?

337
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,640
You are the most unrighteous.

338
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,400
You...

339
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,920
Let's go.

340
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,440
Move!

341
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,040
Stop!

342
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,640
Move!

343
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,640
Move!

344
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,240
Isn't that the wanted young master of the Luo family?

345
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,920
Yes.

346
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,400
Let's go.

347
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:22,800
Come on.

348
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,640
Stop!

349
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,680
Get out of the way!

350
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,560
Stop!

351
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,560
Stop!

352
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,320
Stop!

353
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,120
Stop!

354
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,520
Stop!

355
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,120
Stop!

356
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,200
Stop running!

357
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,200
Stop!

358
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,360
Stop!

359
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,080
Stop!

360
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,120
Stop!

361
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,320
Stop!

362
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,200
Stop!

363
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,720
Stop!

364
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,480
Stop!

365
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,920
I'm crushed.

366
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm crushed.

367
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,920
Get up!

368
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,800
Got him.

369
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,320
We got him.

370
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,960
Get up.

371
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,440
Arrest him!

372
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Lift him up!

373
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,760
Yes sir.

374
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,360
Get up.

375
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,680
Let go!

376
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,880
Let go of me!

377
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,520
It's you!

378
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,280
Take him away.

379
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,800
Let's go.

380
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,320
Wait.

381
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,640
You're here too.

382
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,720
They must be accomplices.

383
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,520
Take them both.

384
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,080
Wait.

385
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,040
I can prove

386
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,480
Luo Shaochuan didn't have time to commit the murder.

387
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,400
How can you prove it?

388
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,080
Him.

389
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,680
I heard that on the night of the incident,

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,760
between 9:30 to 9:45,

391
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,720
you were checking the accounts in the room?

392
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,640
Yes.

393
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,720
What if

394
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,360
Chairman Luo was killed during that time?

395
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,720
Then you have no alibi.

396
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,800
At 6 p.m. that day,

397
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,640
you went to the back door once.

398
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,080
I didn't.

399
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
Bai Shanshan opened the drawer of the storage cabinet.

400
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,640
She left as soon as she heard something from the back door.

401
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,880
Then Xie Hua came in,

402
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,480
and saw you closing the drawer.

403
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,160
At that time,

404
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
you came in from the back door.

405
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,640
I just came back from outside.

406
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
To avoid delay,

407
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,440
I took the footpath.

408
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,200
Did you see the silver knife

409
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,760
when you closed the drawer?

410
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,760
I don't remember.

411
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,720
So at 9:30 that night,

412
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,400
you went through the hallway outside the study,

413
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,320
and got to the back door.

414
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,840
No.

415
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,840
That night,

416
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,920
Fang Hong tried to

417
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,120
to eavesdrop on Chairman Luo’s conversation in the room.

418
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,240
He didn’t hear anything.

419
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,600
But you heard it clearly.

420
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,960
So,

421
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
there are only two explanations.

422
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,440
One,

423
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,000
you were in the room.

424
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,680
The other one,

425
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,319
you were in the hallway outside the study.

426
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,800
Anyway,

427
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,960
you couldn't be on the stairs

428
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,280
like you said.

429
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,119
Mr. Situ,

430
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,280
these are just your speculations.

431
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,319
Mr. Situ.

432
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,200
Mr. Situ.

433
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,079
What's the hurry?

434
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,079
The man Mr. Xie met at the door

435
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,880
has already been caught.

436
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,200
He confessed.

437
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,120
He said everything.

438
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,240
He killed Uncle.

439
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,400
It's really him.

440
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
It can't be him.

441
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
He didn't kill anyone.

442
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,840
He's not the murderer.

443
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,520
Why do you say he's not the murderer?

444
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,840
When Master was killed,

445
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,320
I was with him.

446
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,320
Conspiracy.

447
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,160
No.

448
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,680
You worked together to kill your employer.

449
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,800
What are you talking about?

450
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,080
What's the relationship

451
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,880
between you two?

452
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,440
If you don't tell me,

453
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,640
I'll write like this.

454
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,840
He came to borrow money from me.

455
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,400
You hired a murderer.

456
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,240
He just borrowed money.

457
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,080
He's my distant relative,

458
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,520
just came from the countryside.

459
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,400
We arranged to give him the money at night.

460
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,920
But in the afternoon, Master said

461
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,520
Director Xie was coming that night.

462
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
Normally, when we have guests,

463
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,840
dinner will finish late.

464
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,520
I was afraid when he came,

465
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,080
if he couldn't find me,

466
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,640
he would make a fuss.

467
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,680
So at 6 p.m.,

468
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,920
I left a note at the back door,

469
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,120
told him to wait a little longer.

470
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,920
I would be there at 9:30.

471
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
The time of the crime was 9:30 p.m.

472
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,040
How much did you spend

473
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,120
to hire a murderer?

474
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,800
Do you have proof that I killed him?

475
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,960
Of course I do.

476
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,560
I wouldn't bring you here if I don't.

477
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,440
I forgot.

478
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,640
You are best at

479
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,160
not distinguishing between right and wrong.

480
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,720
It's not that we can't tell right from wrong.

481
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,160
It's because you're really scheming.

482
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,360
Do you think

483
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,280
you found a good-for-nothing

484
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,320
from the opium den to commit the murder,

485
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,800
and we can't find him?

486
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,840
No way.

487
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,320
You are here, aren't you?

488
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,360
Confess.

489
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
How much did it cost to hire a murderer?

490
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,720
I hired a murderer.

491
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,080
Tell me,

492
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
why would I kill Master?

493
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,160
Why?

494
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
The whole world knows

495
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,000
you want to be Mrs. Luo.

496
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,600
But in the end,

497
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,720
Luo Wensheng didn't marry you.

498
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
Love became hate.

499
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,640
That's right.

500
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,400
It's true.

501
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,680
I did love Master,

502
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,200
but I never hated him.

503
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,280
Speaking of hate,

504
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,120
I hated him for being disappointing.

505
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
You gotta be kidding.

506
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,320
He was the richest man in Harbin.

507
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,920
You thought he was disappointing.

508
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,280
What else did you want him to be?

509
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,840
It was all because

510
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,440
he married someone else, not you.

511
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,000
Before that,

512
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,040
you two had a big fight, right?

513
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,680
He even asked you to get out.

514
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,520
That's not right.

515
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,680
I need to talk to her again.

516
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,000
Bao will have she confess soon.

517
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,120
She's not the murderer.

518
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,760
What did you say?

519
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,120
If all these years,

520
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,520
it was Wen Yi who had been blackmailing Wei Minxi,

521
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,640
she wouldn't have had to cook the books.

522
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,440
Besides, the expenses

523
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
of the Luo family of these years was less than 20,000 silver dollars.

524
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
Why would she let others take advantage of her?

525
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,480
If she has a clear conscience,

526
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,400
why is she equivocating?

527
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
That's what I want to know.

528
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
We've got everything.

529
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,920
Let's hear your confession.

530
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Thank you.

531
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,040
Did you quarrel with Master

532
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,960
because of his marriage?

533
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,640
No matter how I explain it now,

534
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,000
you won't believe me.

535
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,960
Then why are you asking me?

536
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,840
You didn't want Wei Min Xi to marry the family,

537
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,920
not because you were being selfish.

538
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,120
You knew

539
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,080
she killed someone.

540
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,200
Three years ago,

541
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,960
when Wei Minxi's husband was still alive.

542
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,560
I saw her

543
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,880
go to the tavern her husband used to go to.

544
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
She didn't drink.

545
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,680
I was curious

546
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,040
so I stayed outside for a while.

547
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,240
She asked the manager a few questions,

548
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,920
gave him some money and came out.

549
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,600
When she came out,

550
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,840
I could tell something was bothering her.

551
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,040
She seemed very flustered,

552
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,120
and went back home.

553
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,040
I thought something was wrong.

554
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,840
So I kept watching her in secret.

555
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,040
Until that night.

556
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,480
I saw her

557
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,800
pour the wine she bought that day

558
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,520
under the tree in front of her house.

559
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,640
Afterwards, about that,

560
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,320
I asked Dr. Xie for her opinion.

561
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,960
Dr. Xie said

562
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,880
if it was arsenic poisoning,

563
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,080
the person's liver and stomach would bleed.

564
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,760
The same way as a sudden death of alcohol.

565
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,200
If her husband died of poisoning,

566
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,640
then we can confirm it by opening the coffin and doing an autopsy.

567
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,760
I told Master about it.

568
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,440
But he didn't believe me.

569
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,440
I couldn't let a woman like her

570
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,320
marry into the Luo family.

571
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,320
So I told Bai Shanshan

572
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,520
the story as a rumor.

573
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,680
Bai Shanshan was fooled.

574
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,080
She told everyone

575
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,640
to stop Wei Minxi from getting married.

576
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,000
But in the end,

577
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,960
I couldn't stop Master from marrying her.

578
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,080
Wei Minxi killed her husband

579
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,600
so that she could marry you.

580
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,680
Don’t you worry that

581
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,880
she will kill you

582
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,280
for the Luo family’s property?

583
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,200
I don't need your permission

584
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,880
to get married.

585
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,400
Master.

586
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
I've been a butler here for almost 20 years.

587
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,600
I've also taken this place as my home.

588
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,920
Even if you don't think for yourself,

589
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,040
you should think about Young Master.

590
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,440
You think I don't know

591
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
who spread the rumor

592
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,680
about Wei Minxi killing her husband?

593
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,600
If you want to quit,

594
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,320
you can get out now.

595
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,800
You couldn't convince Chairman Luo,

596
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,960
so you went to blackmail Wei Minxi.

597
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,680
No.

598
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,920
You plot was about to come to light.

599
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
So you hired a killer

600
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,560
to kill Wei Minxi.

601
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,960
He came to you for money that day,

602
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,280
the money he deserved.

603
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,040
Is it right?

604
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,760
No.

605
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,920
We found that you provided him a lot of funds.

606
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,480
It wasn't a small amount.

607
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,160
It was a huge sum of money

608
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,520
that you had to live frugally so that you could pay him.

609
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,920
If he's just a distant relative,

610
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,120
there's no need to help him that much.

611
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,280
You have been subsidizing

612
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,960
an irrelevant person with big money.

613
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
If you

614
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,360
don't have a shady relationship,

615
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,600
what else can it be?

616
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,080
Move!

617
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,920
Hurry up.

618
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,360
What's your relationship?

619
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,360
If you don't confess,

620
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,400
I'll beat him.

621
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,960
Don't hurt him.

622
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,040
He didn't kill anyone.

623
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,440
He's not the murderer.

624
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
I want the truth.

625
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,520
Only if you tell me,

626
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,960
I can help you.

627
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,640
He is my son.

628
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,640
We didn't kill anyone.

629
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,800
That night,

630
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
when we met at the back door,

631
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Young Master was drunk and right beside us.

632
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,120
I had him send Young Master back to the hotel.

633
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,760
It was so cold.

634
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,120
I couldn't let Young Master

635
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,400
lie on the floor like that?

636
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
If I wanted to kill someone,

637
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,480
why would I bother?

638
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,640
Why didn't you

639
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
tell us earlier?

640
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,600
A woman raised a child out of wedlock.

641
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,280
Who would tell such a thing

642
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,320
unless they have no alternative?

643
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,280
I was too young.

644
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,320
My family knew I was pregnant,

645
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,800
so they kicked me out.

646
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,440
I couldn't even support myself.

647
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,520
How could I afford him?

648
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,080
I had to give him away.

649
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,120
After I gave him away,

650
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,160
if it weren't for Master,

651
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,200
I would have frozen to death on the street.

652
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,560
Master gave me food

653
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,840
and a job.

654
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,680
I admire Master and respect him.

655
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,160
Madam passed away.

656
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
For a long time,

657
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,560
Master was overcome with grief.

658
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,360
Later,

659
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,960
he met Wei Minxi in Harbin.

660
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
There was smile

661
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
on his face again.

662
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,760
If Wei Minxi was not like that,

663
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,360
I would be happy for Master.

664
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
Your son smokes opium.

665
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,320
You're always short of money.

666
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,240
He knew about Wei Minxi from you,

667
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,160
so he blackmailed her.

668
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,240
He didn't.

669
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,760
Your son is idle.

670
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
He's capable of anything.

671
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,360
As his mother,

672
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,120
you spend most of your time

673
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,440
in the Luo family.

674
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,280
How could you know what he did

675
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,920
behind your back?

676
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,720
An opium smoker.

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,760
Do you think

678
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
he can control himself?

679
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,240
Dr. Xie has been helping my son quit smoking.

680
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,960
It works.

681
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,120
But recently,

682
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,800
Dr. Xie has been nowhere to be found.

683
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,480
That's why my son was craving for opium

684
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
and went to smoke.

685
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,920
If you don't believe me,

686
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,280
you should ask him.

687
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,880
Who is this Dr. Xie she just mentioned?

688
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
My son, a doctor.

689
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,840
He went to Guangzhou for a meeting.

690
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,800
I checked the accounts of the opium den.

691
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,000
It doesn't tally.

692
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,040
If you blackmailed Wei Minxi,

693
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,200
you didn't need to cook the books.

694
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,760
In the end, you were blackmailed by Fang Hong.

695
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,160
You never thought about taking the Luo family's money

696
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,640
for yourself.

697
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,840
But your behavior

698
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,720
would get both of you into trouble.

699
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,440
If I don't give him money,

700
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,320
he might steal,

701
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,680
rob.

702
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,640
What should I do?

703
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,720
What can I do?

704
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,120
Why are we

705
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,040
back to square one?

706
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,120
Luo Shaochuan.

707
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,000
She...

708
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,280
Her son.

709
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,200
Bai Shanshan, Zou Jingxuan,

710
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,120
and those servants,

711
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,240
none of them is the killer.

712
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,040
Then who is?

713
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,880
Mr. Situ.

714
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,360
I want to

715
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,280
take another look at Wei Minxi's file.

716
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,280
Sure.

717
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Look at you.

718
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,240
All these investigating,

719
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,840
all we get are small household affairs,

720
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,200
trifles.

721
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,680
We have efficiency assessment

722
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,600
of case solving.

723
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,200
Enough.

724
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,280
This is not your specialty.

725
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,360
Don’t get involved.

726
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,280
I'll have them release Luo Shaochuan.

727
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,000
Take him home and rest.

728
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,720
Are you okay?

729
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,120
Are you alright?

730
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,040
They couldn't afford to hurt me.

731
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,840
I'm telling you.

732
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,440
If you hurt

733
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,240
our Young Master,

734
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
you'll pay for it.

735
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,000
I won't

736
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,760
forget this.

737
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,880
Don’t hold grudges, Mr. Luo.

738
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,720
It’s our duty.

739
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,000
Again,

740
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,360
even though Director Xie bailed you out,

741
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,640
the case is still under investigation.

742
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,680
You are still

743
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,920
under suspicion.

744
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,520
Am I right, Lawyer Situ?

745
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:15,880
Right.

746
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,600
Thank you, Sergeant Bao, Director Xie.

747
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,200
We'll leave now.

748
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,440
Okay.

749
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,360
Talking about suspicion.

750
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,560
They already made arrest.

751
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,800
This time,

752
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,640
if Jingxuan didn't return the cheque,

753
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,520
and make such a scene.

754
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:33,960
This case,

755
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,920
they may never get at the truth.

756
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,400
Right?

757
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,240
You try to guard against everyone.

758
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,440
Yet it's difficult to forestall a thief within the house.

759
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,960
Mom.

760
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,080
Enough, Anut.

761
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,360
They haven't found the killer yet.

762
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,600
Ms. Wen is not the killer.

763
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,480
She's not the murderer?

764
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,200
Who is it then?

765
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Forget it. Who cares?

766
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,960
Let’s get down to business.

767
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,840
Shaochuan!

768
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,240
Don’t take it

769
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,800
seriously.

770
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,960
I asked Jingxuan to steal the cheque.

771
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,600
Please don't bear a grudge.

772
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,720
If you really bear a grudge,

773
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,160
don't bear it against Jingxuan.

774
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,880
Just bear it against me.

775
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,400
Do you hear me?

776
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,960
Mom.

777
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,040
It's late. Where are you going?

778
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,360
Mom, stop talking.

779
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,000
What, silly?

780
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,120
It's for your own good.

781
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,760
I have to thank you.

782
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,000
You're welcome.

783
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,640
I have a favor

784
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,480
to ask of you.

785
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,080
Go ahead.

786
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,000
Would you please

787
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,400
help me find out

788
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,120
who killed my father?

789
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,040
It's not you.

790
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,080
Cut it out.

791
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,840
Neither is Wen Yi nor her son.

792
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Ms. Wen,

793
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,640
she went too far this time.

794
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
But it's understandable.

795
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,080
Her merits can redeem herself.

796
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,000
Neither is Bai Shanshan nor Zou Jingxuan.

797
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,400
It's not Fang Hong.

798
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,600
Other servants of the Luo family

799
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,360
were helping in the kitchen all night.

800
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,160
They had no time to kill someone.

801
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,320
Who is suspicious?

802
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm sorry.

803
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,840
Something came up at the newspaper office.

804
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,920
Congratulations, Mr. Luo.

805
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,560
Sit down.

806
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,520
I invited you here

807
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
to re-investigate

808
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Luo Wensheng's social relationship.

809
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,000
Impossible.

810
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,920
If you want to investigate my dad's social relationship,

811
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,520
you have to start from all the

812
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,120
inhabitants in Harbin.

813
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,360
From Fujiadian,

814
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,400
to the North Market.

815
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,480
From Nangang,

816
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,560
to Shuangchengfu.

817
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,320
You have to investigate them all.

818
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,800
Regardless of their status.

819
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,000
Too many people.

820
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,440
It's really not easy.

821
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,680
I think

822
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
we can figure out

823
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,880
who will benefit the most

824
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,600
if he kill Chairman Luo

825
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,120
and frame Mr. Luo.

826
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,280
There must be someone

827
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,680
I didn't notice.

828
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,080
We have seen it so many times

829
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,120
and found no clue.

830
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,080
There must be something we missed.

831
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,760
Jin Qiming.

832
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,840
What?

833
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,400
What is this?

834
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,920
Recording paper.

835
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,520
It was with the will.

836
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,360
It was supposed to

837
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,760
be handed to Wei Minxi together.

838
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,240
But...

839
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
You go back to the newspaper office

840
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,720
and find a recorder.

841
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,200
A recorder?

842
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,480
Okay.

843
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,720
You need to go to a place.

844
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,280
You should at least tell us

845
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,480
what the recorder we are waiting for looks like.

846
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,120
About this big.

847
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,680
With a handshake handle,

848
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,240
and a speaker.

849
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,440
It's heavy.

850
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,360
Situ,

851
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
here's the recorder.

852
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,280
I've seen it before.

853
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,520
There was one in Master's room.

854
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,840
I once wanted to dust it.

855
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,080
Master even scolded me.

856
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
I thought it was some treasure.

857
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,360
But it seems to be gone now.

858
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,960
I found it.

859
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,680
Let me try

860
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,040
to recreate the whole process of the murder.

861
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
In fact, from the beginning,

862
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,240
we all walked into the killer's trap.

863
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,680
The real time of the murder

864
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,680
was not 9:45,

865
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,600
nor 9:30.

866
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,920
It was

867
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,600
before 9:00.

868
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,680
Impossible.

869
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,120
Impossible.

870
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,920
At 9:30,

871
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,360
Chairman Luo was still alive.

872
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,760
All along,

873
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,080
I've been wanting to tell you.

874
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,639
But I don't know how.

875
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,000
This...

876
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,440
This voice is...

877
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,960
I've been suffering from this.

878
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,320
I've been afraid that someone would take everything away.

879
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,760
I thought

880
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,679
as long as I pay,

881
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,239
I can avoid trouble.

882
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,199
I never thought

883
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
his demand for money

884
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,639
would become more and more frequent.

885
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,760
I don't want to be controlled by someone else.

886
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,920
I don't want you...

887
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,719
Right.

888
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,360
This voice.

889
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,040
It's the same as what I heard that day.

890
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,560
What’s so strange about it?

891
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,840
Shaochuan is back.

892
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Did Shaochuan kill my husband's brother

893
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,239
and imitate his voice?

894
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,920
Luo Shaochuan.

895
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,960
Aunt,

896
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
I'm not in the study.

897
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,720
That's right.

898
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,160
This is it.

899
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,600
That day when I opened the door of the study,

900
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
the chair was placed just like this.

901
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,960
The angle of this chair

902
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,240
is blocking the recorder.

903
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,320
So people at the door couldn't see it at once.

904
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
At 9:30 that night,

905
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,040
the voice

906
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,000
came from this recorder.

907
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,280
Because the sound of the recorder is very low,

908
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,800
Fang Hong didn't hear the details clearly.

909
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,240
And Wen Yi would think

910
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,400
Chairman Luo was assigning things.

911
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,920
Because the recorder was playing

912
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,480
the content of the letter he's reading.

913
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,760
But after the incident,

914
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,320
the recorder disappeared.

915
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,680
In other words,

916
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,560
someone went back to the scene and took it.

917
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:45,800
Right.

918
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,960
Because the killer wanted the evidence back.

919
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,520
So,

920
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,720
he must be the first one to go back to the scene.

921
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
If that's the case,

922
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,280
after I left,

923
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,400
he entered the study through the window,

924
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,640
quickly killed Chairman Luo

925
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,800
and left the recorder like you surmised

926
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,440
to create an illusion

927
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,560
that Chairman Luo is still alive.

928
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,080
Then he left the study.

929
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,560
He had plenty of time.

930
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,720
But besides killing,

931
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,960
he also had to frame.

932
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,000
A pair of military boots shoeprints

933
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,120
were imprinted clearly near the window.

934
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,680
Besides,

935
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,840
he had to secretly take the dagger

936
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,280
in the living room.

937
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,600
The last time the dagger was seen

938
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,760
in the collection desk was at 6 p.m.

939
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,560
Anyone could take it away from the desk

940
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,120
when we were having dinner.

941
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,320
Right.

942
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,280
Many people saw Luo Shaochuan that day.

943
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,960
Many people could enter the study through the window.

944
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
There were more people who could take the dagger.

945
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,480
But not many people knew the Luo family had a recorder.

946
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,280
Based on all the conditions,

947
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,400
you're the only one

948
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,080
who meets all the conditions, Director Xie.

949
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,840
You seem to be obsessed

950
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,960
with the investigation of this case.

951
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,000
How could you come up with

952
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,920
such a conspiracy theory?

953
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,120
How could I take such a big thing

954
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,080
in full view of people?

955
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,200
I have to ask you.

956
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,800
Why did you use

957
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,520
such a big case

958
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,760
to carry only a few files?

959
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,920
Tell me.

960
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,800
Why?

961
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,080
I couldn't find a suitable case.

962
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,000
Besides,

963
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,680
I have no motive to kill him.

964
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,480
I don't like him.

965
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,480
He's like a worm in brother's belly.

966
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,200
But if he killed someone,

967
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,160
he killed for brother.

968
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,480
If he killed brother,

969
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,000
what's in it for him?

970
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,200
It's not just my guess,

971
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,040
there is evidence.

972
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,160
You left the study at 8:50 that day.

973
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,640
At 9 p.m.,

974
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,000
you met the strange man outside the door.

975
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's 200 meters from here to the gate.

976
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,280
It's a three-minute walk.

977
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,560
But it took you ten minutes.

978
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,800
That's enough time for you to walk back and forth.

979
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,160
What did you do during that time?

980
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,280
You took those military boots

981
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
out of your case,

982
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,200
the kind only Luo Shaochuan would wear.

983
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,680
You secretly,

984
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,320
carefully soiled the soles

985
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,440
and left the so-called evidence.

986
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,120
Then you went to the bar to find Luo Shaochuan.

987
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,760
You know him too well.

988
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
You knew,

989
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,040
if you tell him,

990
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,840
"Your father got sick because of you."

991
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,560
He will definitely worry.

992
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,920
He had to come back later,

993
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,320
just like you said.

994
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,520
You went to the bar,

995
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,280
made sure that Luo Shaochuan had left.

996
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Where is Shaochuan?

997
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,320
Mr. Luo.

998
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,880
He left.

999
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,880
Then you rushed back to the Luo family.

1000
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,760
After you sneaked out of the study,

1001
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,400
you ran into Fang Hong on purpose.

1002
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,520
Is Luo Shaochuan back?

1003
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,280
Everything went as you wish.

1004
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,200
When you made arrest the next day,

1005
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
you only wanted two outcomes.

1006
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,680
Either Luo Shaochuan got killed.

1007
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,840
Dead man tells no tales.

1008
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,520
Or you let him go,

1009
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,400
make sure he never come back.

1010
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,920
I’ve known Chairman Luo for years.

1011
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,960
I don’t want to see his offspring die.

1012
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,680
Be careful during the arrest.

1013
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,120
Yes sir.

1014
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,360
As long as Luo Shaochuan is not arrested,

1015
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,120
no one will know

1016
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,000
there's more to this case.

1017
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
You were so lucky.

1018
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
The night before,

1019
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,800
Luo Shaochuan was drunk.

1020
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,920
He didn't remember

1021
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,640
anything from that night.

1022
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,440
And Zou Jingxuan's testimony

1023
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,680
delayed the time of the crime.

1024
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,280
Unknowingly,

1025
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,400
she provided you

1026
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,000
with a perfect alibi.

1027
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,760
And you,

1028
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,160
as the main investigator of this case,

1029
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,440
as long as you don’t reveal the secret of the recorder,

1030
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,320
the time of Chairman Luo’s death

1031
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,440
will be between 9:30 to 10:00.

1032
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,120
Unfortunately,

1033
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,160
you're not that lucky.

1034
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,800
The chair was moved.

1035
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,400
Such a small detail

1036
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
was remembered by Fang Hong.

1037
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,560
And,

1038
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,440
Luo Shaochuan knew me before.

1039
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,920
The most important evidence,

1040
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
this recorder paper

1041
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,800
was found at your house.

1042
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,920
It recorded

1043
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,440
the real content

1044
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,600
of that letter.

1045
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
All along,

1046
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,640
I've been wanting to apologize.

1047
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,360
But I don't know how.

1048
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,960
All these years,

1049
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,960
I've been suffering from this.

1050
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,320
I've been afraid that someone would take everything away.

1051
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,400
I thought

1052
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,120
as long as I pay,

1053
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,680
I can avoid trouble.

1054
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,160
I never thought

1055
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,000
his demand for money

1056
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,440
would become more and more frequent.

1057
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,720
I don't want to be

1058
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,840
controlled by someone else.

1059
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
I don't want you to be controlled.

1060
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm going to end this

1061
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,160
before we get married.

1062
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,840
I think

1063
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,080
we are destined not to be together.

1064
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,200
This is the last thing

1065
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,400
I could do for you.

1066
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,640
Luo Wensheng didn't burn the letter.

1067
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,280
It was you.

1068
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,280
It shouldn't be.

1069
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
It shouldn't be.

1070
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,040
It shouldn't be.

1071
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,560
Mr. Luo.

1072
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,360
Shaochuan!

1073
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,680
Stop him!

1074
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,960
He treated you as his best friend.

1075
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,120
Why did you kill him?

1076
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
Why?

1077
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,320
Because he doesn't know.

1078
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,600
The letter didn't mention

1079
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,760
the person who blackmailed Wei Minxi.

1080
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,280
Yes.

1081
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,080
I blackmailed Wei Minxi.

1082
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,200
I covered for her in the first place.

1083
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
She should thanked me.

1084
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,960
But she wanted to tell

1085
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,520
Luo Wensheng about it.

1086
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,200
She wanted to take desperate measures.

1087
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,640
No way.

1088
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,720
I will kill her.

1089
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,800
I will shut her up for good.

1090
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,240
But I was late.

1091
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,600
When I arrived,

1092
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,000
she had written the letter to Chairman Luo.

1093
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,880
There were traces left

1094
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,320
on the next page.

1095
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,000
She wrote down my name.

1096
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
But I never thought

1097
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,280
she wrote another letter.

1098
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,160
One that didn't mention me.

1099
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,480
I did everything I could.

1100
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,640
Still a woman schemed my downfall.

1101
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,800
There's no point in hiding the truth now.

1102
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,800
This is the truth.

1103
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,040
I'm not hiding anything.

1104
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,960
I need money to get around.

1105
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,520
I need to socialize, bribe my way up.

1106
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,200
I'm just a deputy director now.

1107
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,280
I have a long way to go.

1108
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,760
I don’t want others to point at me and say that

1109
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,920
I'm a loser who got this position

1110
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,880
only because of Luo's connection.

1111
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,480
I need money.

1112
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,640
I blackmailed Wei Minxi.

1113
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,960
I knew her husband's cause of death

1114
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,640
definitely wasn't alcohol.

1115
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,120
It was poison.

1116
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,440
Nobody knew better than me.

1117
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,480
It was me.

1118
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,560
It was all me.

1119
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,640
You're not the one

1120
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,640
who blackmailed and killed Wei Minxi.
