1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
The deceased Tao Zhiling

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,880
was shot in the head

4
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,640
and through the skull.

5
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,080
The bullet trajectory and the pistol

6
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,200
are consistent with that of Lin Jie's murder case.

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,520
It can be concluded that it is the same weapon.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,720
The time of death was two hours ago.

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
By the way,

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,160
some bruises can be seen on the victim's body.

11
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,680
She should have fought with someone before she died.

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,440
Tao Zhiling is dead.

13
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,880
Now the only suspect left is Li Pei.

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,039
Li Pei.

15
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,440
Liu, come here.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Boss.

17
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Li Pei was checking in students leaving the school at the entrance

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,000
two hours ago.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,680
Who is it?

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go check it out.

21
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,560
I see, she has spent all her money here.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Secretary Xia.

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
How much does Tao Zhiling get paid a month?

24
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
Sixty yuan a month.

25
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Other than that,

26
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,079
does she have other sources of income?

27
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,200
Never heard of it.

28
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,560
I found it in her bag.

29
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,680
That's why.

30
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,400
So what you're saying is

31
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Tao Zhiling really saw the murderer

32
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,080
on the night of the murder?

33
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,280
Do you remember your servant Fang Hong?

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,160
Tao Zhiling lived a life of luxury,

35
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,560
because extortion is easy money.

36
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,399
She wanted to

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,440
tell the murderer she saw him through you.

38
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,440
We can't explain it to the superior this way.

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,480
What should we do now?

40
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,520
Should we arrest someone first?

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,800
Who?

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,200
What are you looking for?

43
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
This is blood.

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
This is the murder weapon used by Fan Lihua to kill Luo Jinyan.

45
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,680
It's Fan Lihua?

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
She said it herself.

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,280
She said

48
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,160
she saw a light in the music classroom

49
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,960
and went to check it out.

50
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
I don't understand.

51
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,840
Then she said

52
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,000
she grabbed a wooden stick to defend herself.

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,760
But the stick was by the door, wasn't it?

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,120
Luo Jinyan asked Zhao Qiansun for the stick,

55
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,200
because her table was broken

56
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,600
and she needed a new table leg.

57
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,280
But after the crime,

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,080
the stick wasn't in Luo Jinyan's dormitory.

59
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,640
Instead, it was found in the music classroom.

60
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,480
I knew

61
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,800
I couldn't hide it from you.

62
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,040
I killed Luo Jinyan.

63
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,480
I did it in a moment of madness.

64
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,200
You're just in time.

65
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,360
Let's see if there are any clues

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,760
in the other lockers.

67
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
Lin Jie must have found something.

68
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,280
I just wonder whose locker it's hidden in.

69
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Get moving.

70
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,280
Why are you still standing there?

71
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,200
Okay.

72
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,600
You just can't do anything right.

73
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,800
You're so submissive in everything.

74
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,120
No one knows what they'll do

75
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,920
if the police come later.

76
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
Look for it.

77
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
We have to find all the clues.

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm the principal. I'm the principal.

79
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,080
I thought I'd be happy after I killed her.

80
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,440
But...

81
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,400
But I...

82
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,840
I couldn't sleep all day.

83
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,120
I was anxious all the time.

84
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,600
I couldn't even close my eyes.

85
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,720
I'm begging you.

86
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,960
Take me in.

87
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,520
I beg you.

88
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,400
Lock me up.

89
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,880
Please lock me up.

90
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Okay?

91
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,240
Principal Fan, Principal Fan, get up.

92
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Luo Jinyan is too strong.

93
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,960
She wants to take charge of everything.

94
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,760
She even wants to know the reason for a murder case.

95
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
But why did you kill Luo Jinyan?

96
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,120
I think

97
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
it was for her ideal school.

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,840
I...

99
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
This whole school

100
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,640
was founded by me.

101
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,520
The reason I started the school

102
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
was to raise these girls

103
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,400
to be educated and virtuous in the family.

104
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,360
You know what?

105
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
In the past, all the kids graduated from our girls' school

106
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,760
were known as fair ladies.

107
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
But look at them now.

108
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,480
Look at them now.

109
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,360
After Luo Jinyan's arrival,

110
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
it's been a mess here.

111
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,680
It's been a mess here!

112
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
What kind of crap did she teach?

113
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,160
And that Lin Jie too.

114
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,880
She said she was teaching the so-called music.

115
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,200
Is that music?

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
She's totally teaching these girls

117
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
to giggle and flirt in front of people.

118
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,760
Shame on her!

119
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,480
Principal Fan,

120
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
that's too radical.

121
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,840
Actually, education...

122
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't talk to me about education.

123
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,280
I've been teaching and educating people for 30 years.

124
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
I know what education is!

125
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Look at these girls nowadays,

126
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,280
do they look like girls?

127
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,720
Seven years ago,

128
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,280
the girl committed suicide.

129
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,760
She was the daughter of a prince.

130
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,320
But she had to marry a man who had no shame.

131
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
Who caused this?

132
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,400
Who caused this?

133
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,640
Luo Jinyan!

134
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Luo Jinyan deserves to die.

135
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,600
I should kill her.

136
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,040
I really can't let her

137
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,800
harm these girls.

138
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,080
You know what?

139
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,120
You know what?

140
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,600
Principal Fan.

141
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,320
I shouldn't have let her harm these girls.

142
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,280
Principal Fan,

143
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,720
what are these girls?

144
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
Do they only deserve to raise their children in the family?

145
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,920
We are no worse than men.

146
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,440
We are not inferior to men.

147
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
Besides, the era of suppressing women

148
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,520
has already passed.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,240
What you're doing

150
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,920
is not teaching these girls.

151
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,040
You're harming them, Principal Fan.

152
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,760
Wake up, Principal Fan.

153
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,040
What did you say?

154
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,280
You should wake up!

155
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,320
You know what?

156
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
All my education is about this book.

157
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,880
This book has been proven right for 2,000 years

158
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,080
by our ancestors.

159
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,760
Are these theories wrong?

160
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
Are they?

161
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,760
It's not these theories that are wrong.

162
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,560
It's you, restless people.

163
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,720
You know?

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,760
If education doesn't keep up with the times,

165
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
what's the difference between that and shackles?

166
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,840
What you can't accept

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,680
is not new learning at all.

168
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,680
What you can't accept

169
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,560
is that you've been abandoned by the times.

170
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,440
You appear to be obedient and gentle.

171
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
But in fact, you are

172
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,280
a devil hiding in the shadows.

173
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm not wrong.

174
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm not wrong.

175
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
It is you who are wrong.

176
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,680
It is you.

177
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,040
It's all of you

178
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,680
who ruined this school.

179
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,560
You…

180
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,640
Young and talented.

181
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,040
I knew it.

182
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,680
There's no case that you can't solve,

183
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,160
Barrister. Situ.

184
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,120
Of course.

185
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,560
Mr. Luo also helped with this.

186
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,800
That's not what you just said.

187
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,120
Mr. Luo.

188
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,760
You're kind-hearted.

189
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,160
I meant to take both of them back.

190
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
They'd confess

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,520
upon torture.

192
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,600
See, he had to ask for evidence.

193
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,600
I always say the future is yours.

194
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,000
It's yours.

195
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Well, I'll go back first

196
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
to report this to the director.

197
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,880
You take care of the rest.

198
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm leaving.

199
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,800
He contributes nothing to this case,

200
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,040
yet is faster than anyone to receive credit.

201
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,400
How many years has he been a cop?

202
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
You've only been a cop for a few days.

203
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
How can you act the same?

204
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,840
Oh, come on.

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,600
You can't bear the most

206
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,720
Fan Lihua's feudal and superstitious thinking.

207
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,040
Why didn't you refute her?

208
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,960
Because for people like Fan Lihua,

209
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,320
the more opposing voices,

210
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
the more she can be sure of

211
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,880
the rightness of her actions.

212
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,520
In your opinion,

213
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,800
she wants to imprison humanity and freedom.

214
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
But in her mind,

215
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,320
it's a kind of devotional

216
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
self-motivation.

217
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,440
I didn't expect

218
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
Principal Fan, who was always gentle and kind,

219
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
would do this.

220
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,400
Once she's obsessed with something,

221
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
she can hardly get out.

222
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
Two principals.

223
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,720
One killed and the other was killed.

224
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,360
It's such a mess.

225
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
Have you thought about

226
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,200
the job change I mentioned to you before?

227
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Inspector Luo,

228
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
I appreciate your kindness.

229
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
But I have my plans.

230
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,280
Thank you both for your hard work today.

231
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
I have to write a report on this

232
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,080
to the council.

233
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,040
I'll go back first.

234
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,320
Jingxuan is so nice to you.

235
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,520
Why did you come here for cold shoulders?

236
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,720
What are you talking about?

237
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Wait a minute.

238
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,320
Didn't you say the murderer was coming for the jewel?

239
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,520
Yes.

240
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,040
Fan Lihua hasn't mentioned it the whole way.

241
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,560
That's right.

242
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,960
Then why did Fan Lihua kill Lin Jie?

243
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,040
Who said that Fan Lihua killed Lin Jie?

244
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,480
So this case isn't over?

245
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,960
Who said that the case is over?

246
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,080
Fan Lihua killed Luo Jinyan.

247
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,560
But she didn't kill Lin Jie.

248
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,480
Then who killed Lin Jie?

249
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,160
I'm still investigating.

250
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,600
Wait for me to sort it out.

251
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,840
In other words,

252
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,920
Luo Jinyan being killed

253
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
has nothing to do with me not finding the murderer.

254
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,000
Is that right?

255
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,440
To be precise,

256
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
these are two cases that happened in the same place.

257
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,720
Great.

258
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,320
I haven't slept a wink

259
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
because of it.

260
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

261
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,360
You didn't come to me earlier either.

262
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
Wait a second.

263
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,360
To make it up to me,

264
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,280
you have to go somewhere with me.

265
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,840
Where to?

266
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,800
You'll know when you get there.

267
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm not going. I'm going home.

268
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't worry.

269
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm sure you'll like it.

270
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,240
Why don't you change your clothes?

271
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,320
Hurry up and get changed.

272
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,920
You come here to spend time

273
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,040
instead of going home?

274
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,280
Go home?

275
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,480
To get embarrassed with my aunt?

276
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,400
Where's Jingxuan?

277
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,200
She went to Beijing.

278
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,480
She really did?

279
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,680
She really did.

280
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,000
She said she was going to study.

281
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,240
I think it's a good thing.

282
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,200
She and her mother can take care of our family together in the future.

283
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,000
So I let her go.

284
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,080
You don't have much emotional intelligence.

285
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,360
I don't even know how they get along with you.

286
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,200
You talk as if you have high emotional intelligence.

287
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,080
Where to go?

288
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,760
Home.

289
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,680
You're back?

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why don't you go upstairs to bed?

291
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,280
Have you solved your case yet?

292
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
Almost.

293
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
Have you eaten yet?

294
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,400
Yeah.

295
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,520
Then I'm going to bed.

296
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,760
You don't have to wait for me in the future.

297
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,319
I'll let you know if anything happens.

298
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,119
In the future?

299
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
I thought you'd stay here with Mrs. Shen

300
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,880
until the case is solved.

301
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,040
Do you have time tomorrow?

302
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,599
It's up to you, isn't it?

303
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,079
The school won't resume

304
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,920
and I won't go back to school

305
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,240
unless you solve the case.

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,320
Then draw me some pictures.

307
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,560
I'm a music teacher.

308
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,240
I know.

309
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,600
What do you want to draw?

310
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,000
A couple of portraits.

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,960
I want Ye Zhenzhen to double-check

312
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,360
the guy who sent the violin.

313
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,400
I know someone

314
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
who is good at portraits.

315
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll take you to him tomorrow.

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,080
You really can't do it?

317
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,440
I can't.

318
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,680
It's right there.

319
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,080
Miss. Zhou.

320
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,560
Sir.

321
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,400
You come for another portrait?

322
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,840
This time it's not me, it's my friend.

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,560
I want you to draw these pictures

324
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,160
as sketches.

325
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,120
But with a different costume.

326
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,800
Put on short hair, a hat,

327
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,600
and glasses.

328
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,960
Your friend doesn't have a special fetish, does he?

329
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,360
No, he's a detective.

330
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,960
Okay, okay.

331
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,280
Let's sit over there.

332
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Is this it?

333
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,040
Short hair, hat, glasses.

334
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,520
Just as Zhenzhen described.

335
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Let's go find Ye Zhenzhen.

336
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,960
This is Principal Van.

337
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,400
This is Secretary Ha.

338
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,760
This is Ms. Li.

339
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,280
And this is Ms. Tao.

340
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,800
Look.

341
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,200
Among these four people,

342
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,160
which one is more like the person who gave you the violin that day?

343
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,360
None of them?

344
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,920
They look alike,

345
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
yet differently too.

346
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,800
Have you seen any of them in Fengtian?

347
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Fengtian?

348
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,160
Did you see her in Fengtian?

349
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
I'm not sure.

350
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,200
She looks and doesn't look alike at the same time.

351
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,320
Miss. Zhou, you know

352
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,760
I'm not very good at recognizing faces.

353
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,080
Think about it again.

354
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,680
Think it over.

355
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,960
She looks more beautiful than Ms. Li,

356
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,440
but she looks like her too.

357
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,720
Have you been to Fengtian?

358
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,720
No, I haven't.

359
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
Excuse me.

360
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,680
Situ, it's that way.

361
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
You go back first. I have to go to the newspaper office.

362
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,360
Okay.

363
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,720
Situ,

364
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
this is the file of the girls' school case I checked.

365
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,520
But the case is closed now.

366
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,280
Do we still need it?

367
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,480
It's a different story.

368
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,320
The killer used the rumor of haunting

369
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,120
to keep people away from the music room.

370
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
Lin Jie was murdered because she ran into the killer.

371
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,720
I thought the principal did it

372
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,320
out of jealousy of the vice principal.

373
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,880
They are two cases.

374
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,840
Two cases?

375
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,760
Investigate a few more people for me.

376
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,480
The background of these teachers at the girls' school.

377
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,680
I have investigated Li Pei.

378
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,880
Since she's a prime suspect,

379
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,080
I checked it out.

380
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,120
Situ Yan.

381
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,520
Li Pei is missing.

382
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,480
You lost her again?

383
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Let's go inside. It's too cold.

384
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,640
She hasn't been seen

385
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,720
since you asked her yesterday.

386
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,400
My men thought the case was solved

387
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,680
now that Fan Lihua was arrested.

388
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,880
So they withdrew themselves

389
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,400
without my permission.

390
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,160
When I tried to find her this morning,

391
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,480
she had disappeared.

392
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,960
Since your men have all withdrawn,

393
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,760
how did you know?

394
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Xia Ru'an said it when she came over to take a statement.

395
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,520
She said she couldn't find Li Pei

396
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,960
and thought she'd gone home.

397
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,880
It's a good thing I kept an eye out.

398
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,000
I asked Liu about it.

399
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,320
His answer

400
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,480
totally startled me.

401
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,760
Forget it, I didn't make myself clear yesterday.

402
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
You guys can send me back.

403
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,280
No, it's too dangerous.

404
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,360
That's why

405
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,520
I have to be sent back.

406
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,000
If we don't find out who did this,

407
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,880
I wonder how many more people she'll kill.

408
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,680
You already know who the killer is?

409
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,720
It's a guess.

410
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,960
That's why I don't want you to risk going back.

411
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,760
Translated, you don't have any evidence yet.

412
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,440
That's why you should send me back.

413
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,440
Wait, what are you talking about?

414
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,240
It means you have to regret

415
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,400
sending Jingxuan away.

416
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,640
You just can't treat me nicely.

417
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,440
I think I should go back,

418
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,840
so that the killer can be lured out.

419
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,280
What do you think?

420
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,760
Yeah.

421
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,680
If she does take the bait,

422
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,840
get out of there.

423
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,920
We'll take care of the rest.

424
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,520
I don't care what you two say.

425
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,600
What's next?

426
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,960
I'll explain it to you later.

427
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,800
Let's get the men first.

428
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
You scared me.

429
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,880
It's you, Miss. Zhou.

430
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,040
Of course, it's me.

431
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,360
Who else could it be?

432
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
I thought it was Inspector Luo.

433
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,880
He's been looking for me every day.

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,200
I didn't expect either

435
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,320
that I've only been out of school for a few days,

436
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,280
and something so big has happened.

437
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,280
Thank you for your hard work these days.

438
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,920
Is there anything I can help you with?

439
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
No, it's fine.

440
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,160
Anyway,

441
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,120
the board will decide on a new principal next month.

442
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,720
I just have to make it through the month.

443
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,920
What are you doing with the violin?

444
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,200
It's not my violin.

445
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,560
It's Ye Zhenzhen's.

446
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,320
It can't be tuned right.

447
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,400
I thought I'd have someone else do it.

448
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,920
Why don't you go this afternoon?

449
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,720
It's already noon.

450
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,240
We can have lunch together.

451
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
No need.

452
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm on a diet lately.

453
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,680
You'll have more energy to lose weight when you're full.

454
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,800
Go with me.

455
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,880
I want to talk to you

456
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,800
about what happened in the past several days.

457
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,800
Okay, then let's dine together.

458
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,320
Wait for me to put the violin back in the dormitory.

459
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,600
Okay, I'll see you in front of the school.

460
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,480
Okay.

461
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,160
Secretary Xia,

462
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,320
what are you doing?

463
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,080
You did it on purpose.

464
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,520
Where are the jewels inside?

465
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,160
Can you take

466
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
the blood-stained jewels?

467
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,240
That's my money.

468
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,400
It's not your money.

469
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,440
It's the money of the owner of Fengtian Press.

470
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
You even killed two people

471
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,720
for the money that doesn't belong to you.

472
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,920
Wait.

473
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,280
It's three, I think.

474
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,720
Ye Zhenzhen's uncle is missing.

475
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,840
You have something to do with this, too, right?

476
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,320
It's four.

477
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,000
Why didn't you wait for us to get here?

478
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,040
You were too slow.

479
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,520
Why you?

480
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,160
Do you remember that she said

481
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,880
she came back to take care of her mother?

482
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,400
You came this year too?

483
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,240
That's right.

484
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,560
I've checked this.

485
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,120
Secretary Xia worked at a newspaper in Fengtian

486
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,320
as a proofreader.

487
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,760
Then she came back to take care of her mother.

488
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,160
She wanted to find a secure job close to home.

489
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,200
And at the time of the murder,

490
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,000
she was with me.

491
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,240
She always had a purpose in every job.

492
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,800
After completing her goal,

493
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,560
she would leave on the pretext of taking care of her mother.

494
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
She came to the girls' school

495
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,560
this time for the money.

496
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,960
The newspaper that Xia Ru'an worked for

497
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,760
was indeed funded by Fengtian Press.

498
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,080
Xia Ru'an

499
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,200
changes her job every once in a while.

500
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,840
Her reason is

501
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,680
to take care of her sick mother.

502
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,760
But I've asked her neighbors back home.

503
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,120
Her mother passed away a long time ago.

504
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,680
Where else had she worked before?

505
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,840
The Rokko iron ore mine,

506
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,880
Cologne Brewery,

507
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,480
and the Nakamori Bank.

508
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,840
She worked as a secretary or something.

509
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
But strangely,

510
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,440
every time she left,

511
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
theft or the disappearance of important shareholders

512
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,320
would be reported in these companies.

513
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
Do you know the cause of her mother's death?

514
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,760
I heard it was very serious rheumatism.

515
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,840
The family was penniless at the time of her death.

516
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,640
Even the money for the burial

517
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520
was offered by an old widower in the village.

518
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,600
But right after she was buried,

519
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,360
the old widower forced Xia Ru'an to pay the debt with her body.

520
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,240
Within a few days,

521
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,960
the old widower also died.

522
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,400
How did he die?

523
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,560
I don't know.

524
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,080
Anyway, he was buried quickly.

525
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,200
The old widower had no family.

526
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,400
It's said that he was not well-liked in the village.

527
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,200
By the way,

528
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,160
some people claimed to see Xia Ru'an

529
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,880
running out of his room

530
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
before he died.

531
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Then she left the village.

532
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Later, Xia Ru'an

533
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,800
worked and studied in Fengtian for a while.

534
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,280
For about a year or so.

535
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,240
After that, she was kicked out by the boss's wife.

536
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,720
When she was kicked out,

537
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,440
the boss's wife said

538
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,360
the clothes Xia was wearing were from her family,

539
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,520
so she stripped Xia naked and threw her out into the street.

540
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,400
This was a very ugly thing.

541
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,960
So she probably couldn't stay in Fengtian anymore

542
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,000
and she came to Harbin.

543
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,440
If you need money,

544
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,320
you can cheat me.

545
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,720
I can give you much more than this.

546
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,360
Why did you kill so many people

547
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,280
for so little money?

548
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,320
So little money?

549
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,200
Mr. Luo,

550
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
do you know how much this is?

551
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,760
It's more than an ordinary family

552
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,920
can spend in their lifetime.

553
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
I got it on my merit.

554
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,280
That's my money.

555
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,520
You're rich because of your father, aren't you?

556
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,440
You can't even be a good cop

557
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,160
if it weren't for him.

558
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,400
You didn't earn this.

559
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,960
You are not capable at all.

560
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,480
You have no right to criticize him,

561
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,320
because he has never

562
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,600
sacrificed others to achieve his goal.

563
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,720
Whether it's when he's at his best

564
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,360
or when he's most lost,

565
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,560
he has never shirked

566
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,960
the responsibility he should take.

567
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,360
He is sincere to you.

568
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,160
But you

569
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,040
only treat him as a handy tool.

570
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,320
I've never doubted you.

571
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,680
I've doubted everyone.

572
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
I never thought it was you.

573
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,600
It was my oversight

574
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,120
that killed Tao Zhiling.

575
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,960
No.

576
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,560
It was Tao Zhiling who took her own life.

577
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
She saw me kill Lin Jie.

578
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
Then why didn't she say anything?

579
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,280
She just tried to use this

580
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,840
to blackmail me.

581
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,040
So

582
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,280
instead of saying that I killed her,

583
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,360
I'd rather say

584
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
she was killed by her greed.

585
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,720
We don't need a perfect victim.

586
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
We only need to punish the perpetrators.

587
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,880
From Fan Lihua's point of view,

588
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,040
she was also right to kill Luo Jinyan.

589
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,840
Why can't you wake yourself up

590
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,320
with what you said to her at that time?

591
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,640
Do you think…

592
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,840
Do you think…

593
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,000
You think if I don't kill them,

594
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,440
they will let me go?

595
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,520
Liang Kun worked at the Fengtian Press

596
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,000
as an assistant for so many years.

597
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,920
He could kill his master he'd served for 10 years

598
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,680
for money.

599
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,760
Do you think he can

600
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,560
share the money peacefully with me?

601
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,200
It's all my idea of

602
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,040
how to get the money

603
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,120
and how to get the money out of Fengtian

604
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,480
through the hands of Ye Zhenzhen's uncle.

605
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,640
I did it…

606
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,640
I did it because of his selfishness.

607
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,840
Don't talk about

608
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,200
the dog-eat-dog stuff anymore.

609
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,560
He's a murderer.

610
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,200
You are too.

611
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,320
No.

612
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm not.

613
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,280
I was forced.

614
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
I was forced.

615
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
I'm begging you.

616
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,320
I'm begging you.

617
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Please.

618
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,880
Can you give me one more chance?

619
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,640
Please.

620
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,760
Can you give me one more chance?

621
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,560
Please.

622
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,360
Yeah.

623
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Tell that to the judge.

624
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,440
Okay.

625
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,960
Mr. Luo,

626
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,240
you're a good man.

627
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,880
I'm sorry to you.

628
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm willing to go with you to the police station and turn myself in.

629
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,200
I unloaded all the bullets just now.

630
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,280
Actually

631
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,560
Xia Ru'an is also quite pathetic.

632
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,719
She's just using some tragic past

633
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,719
to cover up her cruelty.

634
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,040
She's brought misfortune to more people

635
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,520
because of her misfortune.

636
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,000
The press owner's son lost his father.

637
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Ye Zhenzhen lost her uncle.

638
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,639
Lin Jie's family lost their daughter.

639
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,400
Too many people.

640
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,480
What about Li Pei?

641
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,199
Li Pei is clean.

642
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,239
She did go to Fengtian.

643
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
But for some reason,

644
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,800
she couldn't tell us.

645
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,120
Do you have a moment, Ms. Li?

646
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I'd like to talk to you.

647
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,480
About Fengtian.

648
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,000
You suspect that I killed Tao Zhiling.

649
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,760
Why did you hide your visit to Fengtian?

650
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,679
I've never been there.

651
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,040
No.

652
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,640
I've never been to Fengtian.

653
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,800
But your students

654
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
saw you in Fengtian.

655
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,280
Mr. Situ,

656
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,000
why does going to Fengtian mean I'm the murderer?

657
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,920
The murderer went to Fengtian to do something

658
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,320
and returned to Harbin

659
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
to track down some stuff.

660
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,840
Lin Jie was killed

661
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,080
because she broke into this.

662
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,680
And during the crime, Tao Zhiling

663
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,120
saw her blackmailing the murderer.

664
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,160
So she was also killed.

665
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,600
I did hide it, but...

666
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,800
I didn't kill anyone.

667
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,320
If you had killed someone,

668
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,080
I wouldn't be the one talking to you now.

669
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,400
Ms. Li, I know

670
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,000
everyone has secrets.

671
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,800
But now lives are at stake.

672
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,880
If you don't want to talk about it,

673
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,840
next time you can only explain it

674
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,680
to the police and the media.

675
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Mr. Situ,

676
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,960
have you ever been married?

677
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,880
No.

678
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,840
How nice.

679
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,320
If you've never been married, you wouldn't know

680
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,440
how desperate life can be

681
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,320
to marry someone who doesn't love you.

682
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,760
He is the light of my life.

683
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,320
I only feel alive

684
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,840
around him.

685
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,640
I was born unattractive when I was a child.

686
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,680
I was always taught

687
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,640
to be gentle, kind, and generous.

688
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,480
But no boy has ever liked me.

689
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,080
Then my family introduced someone to me.

690
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,600
They said

691
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,160
as long as the man was willing to marry me,

692
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,520
I should be grateful.

693
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,920
But what that man saw in me

694
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,600
was my respected status as a teacher in the girls' school.

695
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,080
Our marriage lasted five years.

696
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,840
I was already exhausted.

697
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,440
Luckily…

698
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,400
Luckily, I met him later in the journey.

699
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,720
I could feel

700
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,440
that he really liked me.

701
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,720
He appreciated me.

702
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
But

703
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,200
he already had a wife and children.

704
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,920
And I'm married too.

705
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,960
So you went to Fengtian to see that person?

706
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,160
That's right.

707
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,520
But after I arrived,

708
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,120
I found out his wife

709
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,880
had given him another child.

710
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,160
So I had to leave.

711
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,400
Ms. Li,

712
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,360
I respect you.

713
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,280
I'll keep this matter a secret for you.

714
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,840
But there is something I want to say to you.

715
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,160
Only you are the light in your life.

716
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,440
It's not a shame for her to borrow money.

717
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,960
Why didn't she say so?

718
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,520
Do you know what privacy means?

719
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
It's called privacy.

720
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,960
But then again,

721
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,680
Ms. Li is really nice.

722
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,280
She's very nice to her students.

723
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,480
She's also good to us.

724
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,800
You arranged for her to escape, right?

725
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,320
I asked Jin Qiming to make her hide for a while,

726
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,800
in case the killer turned on her.

727
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,880
Why didn't you tell me?

728
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,280
It's not a big deal.

729
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,840
I see.

730
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,880
You must think

731
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
I can't find it out, right?

732
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,680
I shouldn't have become a cop.

733
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,640
I didn't expect you'd take it seriously

734
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,440
in the case of detecting.

735
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,960
I'm not taking it seriously

736
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
in the case of force, am I?

737
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,480
When people are pointing guns at me,

738
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,920
I can only count on you.

739
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,240
Mr. Luo, you can trust me.

740
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
You're definitely more talented than Situ

741
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,800
in handling a case.

742
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,800
What talent?

743
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,200
You can precisely fall in love with the murderer

744
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,600
among the suspects.

745
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
Zhou Mowan, I thought I just saved your life.

746
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,360
I'm just kidding.

747
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,000
I meant what I said to Xia Ru'an just now.

748
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,600
There's no need for you

749
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,280
to deny yourself because of others.

750
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
You can't solve the case

751
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,800
without me.

752
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,880
But would you be a police officer without me?

753
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
You should've been

754
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,320
a rising business tycoon in Harbin.

755
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,040
That's a good comfort.

756
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,160
Guys,

757
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
the case is solved, right?

758
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,600
Liu,

759
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,000
what's this pile?

760
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Bao brought it over.

761
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,160
He said it's the file you wanted from Fengtian.

762
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,760
I've solved the case and now it's sent here.

763
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,560
Send it back.

764
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,840
Bao's out on the force.

765
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,760
Where did he go?

766
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
Jasmine Restaurant.

767
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,000
They said a man died.

768
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,000
Come with me.

769
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
The dead man, Molly.

770
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,760
The bullet broke the skull from the right temple,

771
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,120
which caused his death.

772
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,960
His hand showed signs of a reaction to the smoke.

773
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,080
It does match the characteristics of suicide.

774
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,920
Combined with He Wannian's confession,

775
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,120
Molly should have shot himself

776
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,400
between 12:30 and 1:00.

777
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,240
Molly?

778
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,920
Why not?

779
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,760
This is the specialty of Jasmine restaurant.

780
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,120
You can't get it anywhere else.

781
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,840
You should try it too.

782
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Suicide?

783
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,880
Liang, come with me over here.

784
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,840
Are we going to be okay?

785
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,840
Is this the way it's supposed to be?

786
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,080
No one has touched it?

787
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,280
I don't think so.

788
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,960
Let me ask.

789
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,240
It was like that in the back kitchen when you came here?

790
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,960
It was.

791
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
No one has touched it?

792
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,200
No.
