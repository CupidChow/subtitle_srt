16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,030
Okay.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,360
If something happens to Yu Daren these days,

18
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,430
I promise

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,670
your bureau’s inaction will appear on

20
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,250
all the newspapers in Harbin.

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,630
You’re threatening me.

22
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,509
I don’t think I’m threatening you.

23
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,500
I’m just telling you,

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,550
this is not my guess.

25
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,950
It’s Situ Yan’s guess.

26
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,310
Think about it.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Wait.

28
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,470
Okay, you can investigate for a few more days.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,200
But the case must be closed by the end of the month.

30
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,750
I want a man wanted.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,630
Who is it?

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,920
I’ll tell you when I figure it out.

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,750
Can somebody rule him?

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,600
Do you have any respect for me as a superior?

35
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,750
I’m so angry.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,820
Someone!

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,579
Keep an eye on

39
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,490
Yu Daren of Zhongji Bank.

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,530
It’s for protection.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,250
If you find anyone suspicious,

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,420
arrest him.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,460
Go ahead.

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,610
I see.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,680
There’s no one left.

46
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,540
They don’t have much patience.

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,440
I’ve recorded those people’s cases

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,640
for you.

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,730
That’s why they left?

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,700
What else can it be?

51
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,000
It’s all here.

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,140
I’ve screened them. Nothing major.

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,460
Some of the cases were cleared in two or three sentences.

54
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,050
So they left.

55
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,990
But I’ve kept their contact information.

56
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,170
I told them

57
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,640
if there was any case you’d like to take on,

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,850
you’d contact them.

59
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,160
So many people’s cases.

60
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,780
You’ve taken them all?

61
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,880
Those who came to you trust you.

62
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,110
I can’t just drive them all away.

63
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,320
I should behave like an assistant.

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
That’s condescension for you, Miss Zhou.

65
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,000
I’m starving. Do you have any food?

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,130
Mrs. Shen has saved some food for you.

67
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,120
I’ll go prepare it.

68
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,750
She’s also calling your teacher’s wife that way?

69
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,710
She’s my assistant.

70
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,790
Time to eat.

71
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,370
What’s this?

72
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,630
Fried vermicelli with sauerkraut.

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,730
The sauerkraut is from Mr. He next door.

74
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,800
A new shabu-shabu restaurant is opening up ahead.

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,529
Let’s eat there.

76
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,640
Don’t go out.

77
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,190
Let’s make do and get down to business.

78
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,610
It’s inedible.

79
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,370
Let’s eat and talk.

80
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,260
You went to see Shen Huatang today?

81
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,380
What’s wrong?

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,570
Nothing.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,040
Bao has agreed not to close the case yet

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,270
and give us some time.

85
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,470
Only you can handle it.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,909
That’s not true.

87
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,430
Not at all.

88
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:03,870
Actually

89
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,480
I’d like to see Yu Daren.

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,390
I don’t think you’ll get anything out of it.

91
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,430
Why?

92
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,670
I ran into him this afternoon.

93
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,510
No need to send me off, Miss Shen.

94
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,430
No way.

95
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,050
Miss Zhou, you’ve been a great help to me.

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,430
By the way,

97
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,520
there’s something I want to ask you.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,270
What is it?

99
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,110
Miss Zhou, you see, Lin Jie is gone anyway.

100
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,040
Why don’t you teach me piano from now on?

101
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,870
Let's talk about it later.

102
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,070
Miss Zhou, just teach me.

103
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,220
Yu, you’re back.

104
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,940
Huatang, you have a friend here.

105
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,810
This is Miss Zhou.

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,360
I asked her to teach me piano.

107
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,340
But she hasn't agreed yet.

108
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,560
You are Mr. Yu?

109
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,360
How are you?

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,900
-Huatang, take care of our guest. -Hello.

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,409
Mr. Yu.

112
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,340
I want to ask you something.

113
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,280
There was a murder at Jasmine Restaurant yesterday at noon.

114
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,270
Do you remember anything?

115
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,740
I’ve been questioned

116
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,290
by the police about this.

117
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,990
I’ve told them everything I need to tell.

118
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,450
I don’t know about the rest.

119
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,120
I hope you won’t harass my family

120
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,230
because of this.

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,910
It’s not like this.

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,560
I asked Miss Zhou to teach me to play the piano.

123
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,650
And we happened to talk about it.

124
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,410
She is concerned about you.

125
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,150
Excuse me, Mr. Yu.

126
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,610
I still want to ask,

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,240
do you remember the people in the restaurant yesterday?

128
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,960
There was a young man who was in a panic

129
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,100
and a woman named Cheng Xiangjun.

130
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,260
Do you know her?

131
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,330
Cheng Xiangjun?

132
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,000
It’s her again.

133
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,200
You know her?

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,960
Isn’t she the one

135
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,370
who greeted you the other day?

136
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,940
Which one?

137
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,380
The one we met when we were in front of our bank.

138
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,560
I don’t remember.

139
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,409
The one who said she was my mother’s classmate.

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,870
I was thinking

141
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,700
how could my mother have such a classmate

142
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,390
since she’d been studying abroad.

143
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,150
Mr. Yu.

144
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,910
It’s me, Cheng Xiangjun.

145
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,370
I was your wife’s classmate.

146
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,660
We even had dinner together.

147
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,040
I’m sorry, you’ve got the wrong person.

148
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,150
I can meet tons of people like this a year.

149
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,550
They say they’re old friends

150
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,380
or old classmates of someone,

151
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,120
making up relationships

152
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,990
to get some benefits.

153
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,720
You can meet this kind of person almost every day.

154
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,840
That’s rude.

155
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,170
Miss Zhou,

156
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,680
don’t be angry

157
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,280
He’s just like that.

158
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,530
I thought Shen Huatang was already different enough.

159
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,210
I didn’t expect Yu Daren to be even worse.

160
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,770
He’s just a small man intoxicated by success.

161
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,890
I was trying to make friends with him?

162
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,750
He’s too self-righteous.

163
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,560
Cheng Xiangjun’s noodles

164
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,550
should have been delivered to him.

165
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,040
We can’t yet be sure

166
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,500
that Cheng Xiangjun was the one who poisoned it.

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,220
You’re too hasty.

168
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Just swear with her

169
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,220
at this time.

170
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,670
She’s venting her anger.

171
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,230
I do have a good idea.

172
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,020
Bring Cheng Xiangjun and Shen Huatang

173
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,080
to Mr. Luo.

174
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
He can take whichever one he likes.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,010
You’d better stop it.

176
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,870
Why did you mention Shen Huatang again?

177
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,890
I always think Shen Huatang is a bit strange.

178
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:37,760
Why?

179
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,039
I feel like

180
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,059
she doesn’t seem to want me

181
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,090
to mention this case.

182
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,640
I didn’t go to see her to play the piano.

183
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,940
Where’s your baby girl?

184
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,950
That dog chewed up my favorite dress.

185
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,870
I asked Li Ying

186
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,500
to sell it at the North Market.

187
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,510
I’m just kidding.

188
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,550
I asked my staff to take him out for a walk.

189
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,480
By the way, Miss Zhou.

190
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,360
Li Ying said

191
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,320
you came to see me

192
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,260
for the murder case at Jasmine Restaurant.

193
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,630
What?

194
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,790
I heard that the chef committed suicide.

195
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,450
You’re quite well-informed.

196
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,390
Yu was there for dinner.

197
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,060
What’s wrong?

198
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,000
Does even a suicide need to be investigated now?

199
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,940
The police prefer it to be a murder case.

200
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:32,960
Murder?

201
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,850
Who would kill a cook?

202
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,570
To rob him of his kitchen knife?

203
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,230
There’s a man named Li Chengyan.

204
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,140
Do you know him?

205
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,360
I don’t.

206
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,570
What’s he like?

207
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,090
I don’t know yet.

208
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,330
Did Mr. Yu tell you about

209
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,780
his meal?

210
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,460
No.

211
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,100
So, Miss Zhou,

212
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
have you found out

213
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,180
any suspect in this case?

214
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,190
I guess the hotel should be quite busy

215
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,140
at that time of day.

216
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,720
Quite the opposite.

217
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,940
Because Jasmine Restaurant was not doing well.

218
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,230
In fact, all the people who came to eat were old acquaintances.

219
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,330
However, a young man was new there.

220
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,300
A young man?

221
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,800
A young man.

222
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,210
What kind of young man?

223
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,010
I don’t know yet. I’ve never seen him.

224
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,400
But

225
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,690
I heard that he looked like he was in a hurry.

226
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,530
No one in the restaurant knew him.

227
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,570
The person in charge of this case happened to have seen him.

228
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,240
He’s the detective who helped you find the dog.

229
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,120
Then why do you suspect that man?

230
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,790
It’s not suspicion.

231
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,280
It’s just a search.

232
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,080
You seem to be very concerned about him.

233
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,630
I think Shen Huatang

234
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,000
should know this young man.

235
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,110
And this young man

236
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,300
must have something to do with this case.

237
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,200
Now you suspect

238
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,330
the murderer wanted to kill Yu Daren in the first place.

239
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,050
Then do you think

240
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,480
Shen Huatang could have arranged the murder?

241
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,110
What's Shen Huatang’s relationship with her stepfather like?

242
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,580
Not bad.

243
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,150
They are really close.

244
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,710
I heard that Yu Daren is involved in

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,620
Mr. Luo’s recent case.

246
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,430
What do you mean by “involved”?

247
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,090
It was just an unlucky encounter on the road.

248
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,750
A chef put rat poison in a customer’s food

249
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,190
and killed a customer.

250
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,580
As a result, the cook also committed suicide.

251
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,980
If the rat poison

252
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,690
had been put in Yu Daren’s food,

253
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,210
he would’ve been unlucky.

254
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,550
Yu Daren

255
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,750
is a good person though.

256
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,870
Shen Baifeng has been dead for three years

257
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,300
and he hasn’t even remarried.

258
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,690
He doesn’t even have a girlfriend.

259
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,070
He’s just engaged in banking

260
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,570
and take care of Shen Baifeng’s children.

261
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,590
That’s right.

262
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,550
Love is cultivated.

263
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,870
Look how Huarong and Huatang hated Yu Daren

264
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,190
in the early days.

265
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,900
Now they’re truly like a family, right?

266
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,240
Do you think we’re underestimating him?

267
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,080
I don’t think he married Shen Baifeng

268
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,720
for money.

269
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,440
Yu Da Ren is in his thirties.

270
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,230
He’s good-looking and has a good body.

271
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,330
And he married a widow who’s almost 50.

272
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,040
If it wasn’t for money, what else could it be?

273
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,720
That’s true.

274
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,830
To put it bluntly,

275
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,850
Yu Daren could even marry Shen Huatang.

276
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,300
Our family mahjong table

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,880
is the intelligence center of rich people

278
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,300
in the entire Harbin.

279
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,780
How did Shen Baifeng die?

280
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,470
Women. She died of obsession with beauty.

281
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,130
People are all obsessed with beauty.

282
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,540
What do you mean by women?

283
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,530
Men are the same.

284
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,190
Let’s get down to business.

285
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,510
I heard

286
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,260
that this is how Shen Baifeng died.

287
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,550
Shen Baifeng was stubborn.

288
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,640
She took medicine to maintain her beauty and died.

289
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,070
What kind of medicine did she take?

290
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,600
It’s a kind of beauty medicine.

291
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,160
It was very popular back then,

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
and said to keep youth forever.

293
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,850
It’s worth a lot of money.

294
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,830
Later my brother-in-law’s wife’s cousin

295
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,880
tested the drug.

296
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,910
He said there was an ingredient in the medicine called

297
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,220
chnine?

298
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,290
Strychnine?

299
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,760
It could be.

300
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,760
How come I’ve never heard

301
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,770
that Shen Huatang has a brother?

302
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,720
Although Yu Daren

303
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,390
got along with the two descendants of the Shen family,

304
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,510
Shen Huarong loved the freedom

305
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,990
and didn’t want to be constrained.

306
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,370
He hated going to work at the bank.

307
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,950
It’s said at our family mahjong table

308
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,630
that back then, the police suspected Yu Daren.

309
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,160
Someone saw him go to the hospital to buy Strychnine.

310
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,690
Later he and his sister

311
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,800
got into a big fight with Yu Daren

312
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,180
because of this.

313
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,310
It doesn’t look like that.

314
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,680
Shen Huatang

315
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,690
is always talking about Yu.

316
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,580
It doesn’t look like they’re isolated.

317
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,540
That’s because Yu Daren didn’t hurt anyone.

318
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,140
He’s taken good care of Shen Huatang for the past three years.

319
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,330
So it’s no problem that Shen Huatang is close to him.

320
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,540
Who is Yu Daren from?

321
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,370
From Beijing.

322
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,300
He came to Harbin later.

323
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,690
That’s why

324
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,190
it’s better to marry well than do well.

325
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,190
Mr. Luo,

326
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,560
if you marry Shen Huatang,

327
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,380
both of you

328
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,240
will marry well.

329
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,830
It’s like the fertilizer of the whole Harbin

330
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,550
goes to your family’s fields.

331
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,510
Anyway, anyone is okay but you.

332
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,190
That’s too much.

333
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,260
Whose side are you taking?

334
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,250
He’s always

335
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,300
on my side.

336
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,860
I want you to draw Cheng Xiangjun

337
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,310
and that young man for me.

338
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,160
No.

339
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,180
I have no choice.

340
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,640
So I ask you to help me.

341
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,430
Let’s go to the market and let the painter do it tomorrow.

342
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
I want to put a missing person notice in the newspaper tomorrow,

343
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,140
so that the police will be able to arrest them.

344
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,400
Once we find them,

345
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,800
the truth of how Moly died

346
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,250
will come out.

347
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,180
Okay, I’ll draw it for you.

348
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,000
But I have a condition.

349
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,210
What condition?

350
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,490
I haven’t thought about it yet.

351
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,010
When I do,

352
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,250
no matter what the condition is, you have to fulfill it.

353
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,440
-Even if... -I promise.

354
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,940
You’re really talented at drawing.

355
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,010
I just drew it.

356
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,500
I’m going to bed now.

357
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,110
May I ask you

358
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,570
what can I do for you?

359
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,110
We’d like to see Mr. Yu.

360
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,700
Do you have an appointment?

361
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,260
Is it too late to make an appointment?

362
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,250
I’m sorry.

363
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,120
Mr. Yu’s work schedule

364
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,110
is on a minute-by-minute basis.

365
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,490
You can’t do it without an appointment

366
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,950
even if you’re a police officer.

367
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,170
Go tell your boss

368
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,970
that someone is trying to kill him.

369
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,560
Many people want to kill Mr. Yu.

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,780
He doesn’t care.

371
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,150
What’s your name?

372
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,930
Forget it.

373
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,260
Let’s wait.

374
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,590
He has to come out for lunch.

375
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,650
I can’t let this go

376
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,200
You go and bring Yu Daren to me.

377
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,930
Tell him

378
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,550
Luo Shaochuan wants to deposit all the Luo family’s assets

379
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,650
to your bank.

380
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,650
You’re Mr. Luo.

381
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,130
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

382
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,100
It’s my fault.

383
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,420
I didn’t recognize you.

384
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,600
I’m going to ask our boss Yu to come over.

385
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,670
Wait a minute.

386
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,290
I hate people who look down on people

387
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,600
with a little money.

388
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,060
You have a little money, too, don’t you?

389
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,060
That’s not true.

390
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,760
I’m not like them.

391
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,880
I’m a nobleman.

392
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
If you want to work with us

393
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,400
out of trust,

394
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,390
I welcome it.

395
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
But if it’s still about

396
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,349
the cook’s case.

397
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,700
I’m really sorry.

398
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,230
I’ve already told the police what I have to say.

399
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,470
Let’s find a restaurant and talk over lunch.

400
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,240
I’m sorry.

401
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,710
My lunch is already booked.

402
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,650
You make reservations for your meals.

403
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,619
That’s right.

404
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,099
I’m dealing with such a big mess all by myself.

405
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,089
I’m scrambling for time.

406
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,160
I really don’t want to

407
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,560
waste my time on trifles

408
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,220
like waiting for food.

409
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,950
So when did you make your reservation

410
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,160
to Jasmine Restaurant?

411
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,590
Actually, every morning

412
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,300
the secretary will confirm the schedule with me,

413
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,670
including the dining arrangements.

414
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,920
Some time ago, it was because

415
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,230
Jasmine Restaurant was good.

416
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,880
But if I had known

417
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,880
it could cause so much trouble,

418
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,300
I wouldn’t have bothered to go even if it was good.

419
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,760
I understand how you feel when you can’t solve a case.

420
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,470
You can’t report it to the superior.

421
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,150
So you harass the witnesses again and again.

422
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,490
But I really hope

423
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,550
you can waste someone else’s time.

424
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,600
My time is really valuable.

425
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,710
How much money do you make a day?

426
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,820
I do not have as much money as your father.

427
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,710
But at least I make a lot more than you do.

428
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,120
Mr. Yu, Mr. Luo means no harm.

429
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,470
We’ve investigated.

430
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,480
The meal you ordered is the same as the victim, Li Chengyan.

431
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
So we highly suspect

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,150
the murderer was coming for you.

433
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
It’s for your good.

434
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,480
So I hope you can carefully recall

435
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,280
what happened in the restaurant

436
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,940
before and after the crime

437
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,330
and whether you saw any strange people.

438
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,820
For example, Cheng Xiangjun.

439
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,960
Hua Tong also mentioned someone called Cheng Xiangjun to me.

440
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,380
But I don’t remember a thing.

441
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,210
Because I don’t know this person at all.

442
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,990
If you think there’s something wrong with her,

443
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,390
you should go to her.

444
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,190
But I still want to thank you both for your kindness.

445
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:51,960
It’s just that I don’t need it.

446
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,500
I have a job. I can’t stay.

447
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,360
Haven’t the police settled

448
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,940
the case?

449
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,390
It’s still to be verified.

450
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,170
You put out an APB when it’s still pending?

451
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,740
Is this person the murderer?

452
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,070
What if the wrong person is arrested?

453
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,280
If he’s wronged, he’ll be released.

454
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,570
We arrest him because he’s a suspect.

455
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,850
Be released?

456
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,470
If you arrest the wrong person,

457
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,720
you’re condoning the criminal,

458
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,630
so that he can hurt Yu again.

459
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,710
Miss Shen is too worried.

460
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,480
There were eight people at the scene before and after the crime.

461
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,790
Two are dead.

462
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,090
Two are wanted.

463
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,140
Three are under control.

464
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,070
Your father is the only one who is free.

465
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,210
Mr. Yu,

466
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,410
if you want to enjoy a good meal,

467
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,170
waiting is essential.

468
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,730
At least in front of the rules,

469
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,270
your time is no more valuable than anyone else’s.

470
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,470
Huatang, why are you here?

471
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,170
It smells good.

472
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
Excuse me, I’ll have the same casserole noodles.

473
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:07,960
Okay.

474
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,370
Now I think you’re right.

475
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,520
That murderer

476
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,490
should have finished off Yu Daren.

477
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,430
That young man was after Yu Daren.

478
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,850
Why do you say that?

479
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,770
Do you remember what Shen Huatang said just now?

480
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,900
She questioned why we arrested the man?

481
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,300
The next sentence.

482
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,530
The next sentence?

483
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,440
That arresting the wrong person

484
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,200
is giving the real murderer

485
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,160
a chance to hurt Yu Daren?

486
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,270
But how did she know

487
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,980
the murderer was going to kill Yu Daren?

488
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,420
Unless

489
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,180
she was the one who wanted to kill Yu Daren.

490
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,910
What are you looking at?

491
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,690
Shen Huatang is out.

492
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,080
She’ll probably be looking for the young man.

493
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,100
Let me go after her.

494
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,600
Can you do it?

495
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,580
First, I’m a soldier.

496
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,150
Second, Zou Jingxuan has been around me since she was a child.

497
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,960
So I'm good at stalking, anti-stalking

498
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,160
and anti-anti-stalking.

499
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,480
Let’s go too.

500
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,170
We’re not done eating yet.

501
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,150
Pack it up.

502
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,430
Excuse me, we need to pack up the food.

503
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,670
Okay, wait a minute.

504
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,190
Here you are.

505
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:21,810
Thank you.

506
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,130
Rich girls are boring.

507
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,610
Shen Huatang has been shopping all day.

508
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,630
She doesn’t look like an attempted murderer.

509
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,430
I never said she would kill someone.

510
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,610
I just said

511
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,230
she might go to see that young man.

512
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,380
Are you playing word games with me?

513
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,360
Mr. Situ, Mr. Luo.

514
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,600
The portrait has been published.

515
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,490
But I haven’t received any news

516
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,360
about Cheng Xiangjun.

517
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,970
I wonder if there’s any news from the police.

518
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,640
Did she stay at another hotel?

519
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,430
I really found out.

520
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,880
I asked around the hospital

521
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,680
and found a hotel where she had stayed.

522
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,160
[Dayang Hotel]

523
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,160
[63 Central Street]

524
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,980
But it was earlier.

525
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,500
It was on the ninth of this month.

526
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,170
The ninth?

527
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,960
Yes.

528
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,490
The people at the hotel said

529
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,860
she didn’t check out.

530
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,460
But since the 12th,

531
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,390
she hasn’t been back.

532
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,610
They packed her things and left them at the front desk.

533
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,040
Any news about Cheng Xiangjun in Beijing?

534
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,100
I asked my colleagues in Beijing to check it out.

535
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Cheng Xiangjun

536
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,340
used to be a nurse.

537
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,560
She loved to listen to opera.

538
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,200
Her food and clothes were also very elegant.

539
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,520
She loved to socialize

540
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,280
and was well-liked.

541
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,200
She just couldn’t make ends meet

542
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,270
so she changed her career to selling drugs.

543
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,520
She came to Harbin this time

544
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,130
to take advantage of the shortage of rat poisoning

545
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,000
and make some quick money.

546
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,790
Let’s go to the hotel.

547
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,830
One moment, please.

548
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,410
It says in the newspaper

549
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,500
that the police are looking for Cheng Xiangjun.

550
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,500
She’s killed someone?

551
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,930
No way.

552
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,530
What?

553
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,840
Doesn’t she look like someone who would kill?

554
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,100
Not really.

555
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,230
You have so many customers here.

556
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,280
Can you keep track of everyone?

557
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,600
Miss Cheng was very nice.

558
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,700
She was very generous with her money.

559
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,600
And she wouldn’t let us clean up her house.

560
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
She thought we didn’t clean up

561
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,410
as well as she did.

562
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,670
Please come in.

563
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,030
She occasionally didn’t come back.

564
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,390
So no one noticed when she left suddenly.

565
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,280
Five days ago,

566
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,410
the money she paid ran out.

567
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,580
That’s when we realized that Miss Cheng hadn’t come back.

568
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,570
So we took her luggage and put it away.

569
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,690
Officer, the photo on the wanted notice in the newspaper

570
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,780
doesn’t look like her.

571
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,770
What’s wrong with it?

572
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
If you look closely, it’s the same person.

573
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,390
It’s just that Miss Cheng doesn’t like to wear earrings.

574
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,030
I’ve seen her several times without them.

575
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,990
You said she doesn’t wear earrings?

576
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,060
No.

577
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,390
Can I take these things away?

578
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,440
Are you a cop too?

579
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,020
I am.

580
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,780
Then please sign here.

581
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,670
Cheng Xiangjun and Li Chengyan were neighbors.

582
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,120
So did Cheng Xiangjun kill Li Chengyan?

583
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,400
Or would Cheng Heung Kwan and Li Cheng Yan be killed together?

584
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:47,670
Here.

585
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,020
How is Beijing? Is it fun?

586
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
I was not there to have fun.

587
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,670
I was there for business.

588
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,520
Okay.

589
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,550
How did it go?

590
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,570
All right.

591
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,920
If you come to Beijing in the future

592
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,980
and need anything, you can call me.

593
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,470
Are you serious?

594
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,960
The case at the girls’ school was solved?

595
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:11,750
Of course.

596
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,440
I heard the murderer was the secretary.

597
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,340
Are you okay?

598
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
What could possibly happen to me?

599
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,370
I saw you take her to dinner.

600
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Were you stalking me?

601
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,200
You have a new case?

602
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,160
That’s right.

603
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,920
But it’s been over a week

604
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
and hasn’t seen progress.

605
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,030
This time, even Szeto can’t do anything.

606
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,330
None of the two suspects can be found.

607
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,430
I don’t know if they’re alive or dead.

608
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,130
Mom.

609
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,450
You’re back.

610
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,570
How come you’re so thin now?

611
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,830
It’s like I’m holding a handful of ribs.

612
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,060
Why did you go to Beijing to suffer?

613
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,370
I didn’t.

614
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,720
Yes, you’ve lost weight.

615
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,120
Mom.

616
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,050
Go change your clothes.

617
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,030
I’ve booked a nice restaurant

618
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
for you.

619
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,040
Boss.

620
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,890
Boss, Bao has found Cheng Xiangjun.

621
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,760
Where?

622
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,510
She’s dead.

623
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,300
Nearby Plain Lane.

624
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,680
Tell Situ Yan

625
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,370
to go to the scene.

626
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,210
You two eat first.

627
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,660
I have to go to Plain Lane.

628
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,780
What’s the hurry? She’s already dead.

629
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,060
Mom, I have to check it out too.

630
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,500
Maybe I can help.

631
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,630
I mean.

632
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,040
You’re a girl…

633
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,810
You two are gone.

634
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,880
Should I eat alone?

635
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,290
Jingxuan just got back.

636
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,430
Why bring her here to see a dead man

637
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,860
instead of letting her rest?

638
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,740
Mowan, I wanted to come here myself.

639
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,310
I wanted to give you a hand.

640
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,620
It’s good to have someone to run errands.

641
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,100
Bao came here when he received the report.

642
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,040
The informant said

643
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,810
he saw the portrait of Cheng Xiangjun in the newspaper

644
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:49,860
and it occurred to him

645
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,030
that she had been around here.

646
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,680
Where?

647
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,380
Right there.

648
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,280
There’s a family named Feng here.

649
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,720
The informant said

650
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,640
he saw Cheng Xiangjun twice in total.

651
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,240
Once in the afternoon half a month ago,

652
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,500
and the other time was

653
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,130
the night Moly was killed.

654
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,730
It’s three or four days from the first time.

655
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,170
It was so long ago.

656
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,740
Why did he wait until now?

657
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,280
He said he had just returned from a trip

658
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,960
and found the order for arrest

659
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,810
when sorting through old newspapers at home.

660
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,180
So he rushed over to report it.

661
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,980
Bao is now throwing tantrum inside.

662
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,310
Why?

663
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,880
He wanted to decide

664
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
that Moly committed suicide.

665
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,670
But now that Cheng Xiangjun also died,

666
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,500
she can't eat rat poison too.

667
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,850
Cheng Xiangjun is dead?

668
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,550
That’s right.

669
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,180
Our men wanted to ask around

670
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,170
to see if the family knew Cheng Xiangjun.

671
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,830
But no one responded.

672
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,170
After breaking into the house,

673
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,720
they smelled a corpse.

674
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,310
Later, they found the victim

675
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,130
in a suitcase.

676
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,050
She was bent like that.

677
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,760
Don’t mention it.

678
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,750
Are you sure the victim is Cheng Xiangjun?

679
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,080
Not completely sure.

680
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,880
Why?

681
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,220
You’ll know if you go in and take a look.

682
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,650
It’s too messy inside.

683
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,150
Don’t go in.

684
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,200
Wait for me here.

685
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,230
I’d better go in and take a look.

686
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,560
Mr. Situ, Mr. Luo.

687
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,200
See?

688
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,090
If you had made it clearer

689
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,400
to me

690
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,140
about Moly’s death,

691
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,660
if we had set up

692
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,890
a net to catch her,

693
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
we wouldn’t have let the suspect

694
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,920
get away with it for more than half a month.

695
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,660
Didn’t I make myself clear?

696
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,820
You’re the one who had to…

697
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,520
There was no evidence before.

698
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,360
And none of the two key suspects

699
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,430
was found.

700
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,070
The evidence at the scene is closed.

701
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,470
So the case is basically in line with your assumptions.

702
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,890
But now there’s a new victim.

703
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,110
Sergeant Pao.

704
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,350
Can we restart

705
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,540
the investigation of Moly’s case?

706
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,250
Come up.

707
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,720
Here is the case.

708
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,470
It’s really difficult to go through the procedure.

709
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,020
But I’m also a practical person.

710
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,290
Moly is dead.

711
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,840
How can he come over and kill someone?

712
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,250
Is that so?

713
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,020
I’ll take care of the procedure.

714
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,340
But you must also do me a favor.

715
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,290
You have to prove clearly

716
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,170
that the two cases are related.

717
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,840
You’re good at arranging things, Bao.

718
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,520
Okay.

719
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,450
Can you I.D. the victim?

720
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,130
The face is gone.

721
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,980
Dr. Fang is checking inside.

722
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,920
But telling from the physical evidence at the scene

723
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,510
and the clothes and shoes of the victim,

724
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,390
you’re right.

725
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,640
The deceased is Cheng Xiangjun.

726
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,180
I have some work to deal with at the bureau.

727
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,190
I have to go.

728
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,250
See you there later.

729
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,350
He’s digging a hole for you.

730
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,840
That’s right.

731
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,550
You knew that, but you still jumped into it?

732
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,710
Connected cases

733
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,890
must be connected for logical reasons.

734
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,900
What if they’re not?

735
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,330
Like the girls’ school case.

736
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,730
Two separate cases.

737
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,590
Who’s in charge?

738
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,060
You, of course.

739
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,560
I’m not a cop.

740
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,460
What can they do to me?

741
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,490
So you two are calculating

742
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,470
to let me take the blame?

743
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,120
It doesn’t matter.

744
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,960
Not to mention Sergeant Bao,

745
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,320
even if the director came,

746
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,480
what could he do to you?

747
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,530
The police station is built by your family.

748
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,200
He’s completely gone bad.

749
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,130
This person shouldn’t be short of money.

750
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,490
Why?

751
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,870
You men don’t understand.

752
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,260
Don’t ignore these clothes

753
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,190
ordinary in style.

754
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,780
She made them so ordinary

755
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,840
with such expensive materials.

756
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,600
She was not only very rich,

757
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,630
but also very low-key.

758
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,960
You see?

759
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,580
She was deliberately trying to look ordinary.

760
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,920
She was trying to hide her other identity.

761
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,850
But she wouldn’t stoop to the cheap stuff.

762
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,600
That’s right.

763
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,130
[Testimonial]

764
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,970
If all these fabrics are worth a lot of money,

765
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,880
can we find this person through the clothes?

766
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,330
I think she made all these clothes herself.

767
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,620
If they were ready-made clothes,

768
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,680
there shouldn’t be such stitches.

769
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,060
If they were made by a tailor,

770
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,050
it’d be a bad tailor.

771
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,290
What do you think?

772
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,190
Did you find anything?

773
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,190
Call your mother.

774
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,020
My mother?

775
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,390
Don’t ask so many questions.

776
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,500
Now it’s her turn.

777
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,140
Her face is ruined.

778
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,660
She’s been dead for a long time.

779
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,400
Thanks to the weather,

780
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,090
the body is still in good condition.

781
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,080
So far, we can only tell

782
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,090
she’s been dead for more than half a month.

783
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,310
There is no way to be more precise.

784
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,000
The initial cause of death is presumed to be

785
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,790
massive bleeding caused by comminuted skull fracture.

786
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,190
The weapon should be a large and heavy blunt tool.

787
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,590
The killer used it to hit the victim’s face several times.

788
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,030
It tends to be a man

789
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,440
or a woman doing manual labor.

790
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,800
I’d like to see the body.

791
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,780
Take care of your protection.

792
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,630
Dr. Fang, give me a mask too.

793
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,920
Miss Zhou should not go in.

794
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,500
It’s okay.

795
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,410
I’m Mr. Situ’s assistant.

796
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,050
Not these shoes.

797
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,290
What?

798
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,910
Not these shoes.

799
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,630
The bow

800
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,300
must have fallen off and been sewn on.

801
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,480
It’s the same as what you saw that day.

802
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,070
Those shoes are new, not so old as this pair.

803
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,930
Shoes

804
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,260
can’t get worn out in a day.

805
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,190
But this doesn’t mean

806
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,940
she is not Cheng Xiangjun.

807
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,020
And this.

808
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,050
He Wannian burned her wrist

809
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,660
when packing up for Cheng Xiangjun that day.

810
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,770
Don’t joke with me.

811
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,449
I don’t drink that.

812
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,909
It’s like a poor family’s bean compost…

813
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,170
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

814
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,270
If she had been killed that day,

815
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,719
I’m sure there would have been scars on her skin.

816
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,750
But there is no scar on her.

817
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,210
If she’s not Cheng Xiangjun,

818
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,550
who is she?

819
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,600
Give me a pen.

820
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,360
Mrs. Luo,

821
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,409
is this how you usually play cards?

822
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,980
Aren’t we all playing the same way here?

823
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,960
Three characters.

824
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,850
Three dots. I won.

825
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,020
Mrs. Luo.

826
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,580
I’ve been blessed by your luck.

827
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,760
You should come more often.

828
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,469
Our young master is working on a case around here.

829
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,889
If you can help me out,

830
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,139
I could come here more often.

831
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,580
You’re talking about Mrs. Feng’s family, right?

832
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,840
The head of the family is Feng?

833
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,630
That’s right.

834
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,510
I think his name is Feng Chengchu.

835
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,460
Yes, it’s Feng Chengchu.

836
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,220
I often see his wife.

837
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,890
Mrs. Feng told me

838
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,090
her husband was a businessman.

839
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,890
He doesn’t come home all the time.

840
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,100
I wonder

841
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,210
what this beautiful wife

842
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,480
does in private.

843
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,450
I think

844
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,670
you’re just

845
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,830
being jealous.

846
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,300
You just think Mrs. Feng is good-looking

847
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,090
and have to make up things about her.

848
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,830
Isn’t that so?

849
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,110
Mrs. Luo,

850
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,430
whose man comes home in the middle of the night

851
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,470
and can’t be seen during the day?

852
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,480
That’s right.

853
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,200
Mrs. Feng has lived with us for three years.

854
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,440
I haven’t seen Mr. Feng once.

855
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,140
Really?

856
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,840
It’s not Mrs. Feng who died, is it?

857
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,450
Her husband couldn’t bear it

858
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,190
and killed her.

859
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:47,980
I’m telling you.

860
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,010
Mr. Feng is a spy.

861
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,840
There are spies in your area?

862
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,970
Are you serious?

863
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,440
I’m not lying.

864
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,660
My son works in the government.

865
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,200
I told him what Mrs. Feng said.

866
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,580
He said

867
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,120
“Mr. Feng must be a spy”.

868
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,320
Think about it.

869
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,120
Has Mrs. Feng told us

870
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,240
what kind of business her husband was in?

871
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,230
Has she?

872
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,550
It’s just a cover.

873
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,480
He’s making excuses for his absence.

874
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,250
It’s just a murder case.

875
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,300
You’re exaggerating with the spy thing.

876
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,200
It’s true. I’m telling you.

877
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,130
I asked Mrs. Feng.

878
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,190
What did she say?

879
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,450
Mrs. Feng

880
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,950
verbally denied it

881
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,100
but gave me a small soap

882
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,270
in private.

883
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,660
And she said, “Don’t tell anyone else”.

884
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,440
Really?

885
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,700
Yes, yes.

886
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,930
That’s true.

887
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,800
Is it?

888
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,060
I won again.

889
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,540
Why did you win again?

890
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,400
-Money. Money - You’re so lucky.

891
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,270
Did you collude together?

892
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,890
How come!

893
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,510
-No way. -Pay up.

894
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,280
Situ.

895
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,770
Send a telegram.

896
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,330
Director Wang of the Ministry of Justice in Beijing?

897
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,860
Because of this case?

898
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,540
He is my classmate.

899
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,460
I want him to investigate something.

900
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,970
I thought Jin Qiming is there to help you.

901
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,490
It looks like a dead end in terms of Cheng Xiangjun.

902
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,490
I’m afraid only the Director

903
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,430
can make a way out with his official authority.

904
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,960
I’m going to the toilet to cleanse my bad luck.

905
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,240
Your luck is too good.

906
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,200
Let’s go.

907
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,420
How is it?

908
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,260
I didn’t catch some of it.

909
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,500
Repeat it to me later.

910
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,630
Okay, I’ve memorized everything.

911
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,660
Let's go.

912
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,400
Let's go.

913
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,440
They’re so smart at mahjong.

914
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,960
They’ve won me a few dozen big ones.

915
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,030
Cover it for me.

916
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,330
You have all the family money.

917
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,730
It’s up to you.

918
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,740
That’s true.

919
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,890
Let me tell you something.

920
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
I’ve seen a lot of

921
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,710
things of this kind today.

922
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,480
Something must go wrong when it seems abnormal.

923
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,820
Mrs. Feng

924
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,890
was here to meet with her lover.

925
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,940
Secret agent?

926
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,190
That’s total nonsense.

927
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,550
I mean, Auntie.

928
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,820
You’re so smart.

929
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,940
There is nothing you can’t find out

930
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,490
in the whole of Harbin.

931
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,990
That’s right.

932
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,780
After eight rounds of mahjong,

933
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,370
I can check out

934
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,330
her ancestral history.

935
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,070
You’re back.

936
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,350
How’s it going?

937
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,420
Did you find anything new?

938
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,140
The deceased is not Cheng Xiangjun.

939
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,980
Who is it?

940
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,750
I know.

941
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,380
It must be Mrs. Feng.

942
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,000
Who’s Mrs. Feng?

943
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,550
The one that rented the house is the Fengs.

944
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,460
Feng Chengchu seemed to be a businessman.

945
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,350
He seldom came back.

946
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,350
Neighbors in the street

947
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,170
never got to see him in person.

948
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,810
It’s too cold, let’s get inside.

949
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,170
He only came back in the middle of the night to his wife.

950
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,460
But no one has ever seen him in the daytime.

951
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,600
Feng Chengchu?

952
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,880
Feng Chengchu is not a businessman.

953
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,430
So what does he do?

954
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,250
He’s a secret agent.

955
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,850
A secret agent.

956
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,150
That’s right.

957
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,530
How?

958
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,770
Cheng Xiangjun is probably a secret agent killer.

959
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,080
Selling drugs is just a cover for her identity.

960
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,220
She must have received an order from her superiors.

961
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,950
She killed Li Chengyan

962
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,680
and Mrs. Feng too.

963
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,080
The secret agent thing

964
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,680
is out of the hands of the police.

965
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,590
The less we know about it,

966
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,490
the better.

967
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:30,980
Hurry up.

968
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,260
Put out the wanted notice for Cheng Xiangjun.

969
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,090
This case is closed.

970
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,100
There aren’t that many spies.

971
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,530
I’ve heard

972
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,450
Mrs. Feng

973
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,420
was cheating with her lover.

974
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,510
That’s right.

975
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,180
Why is that right again?

976
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,590
Cheng Xiangjun might not be a secret agent killer.

977
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,350
She might be a professional killer.

978
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,640
Her employer was Mrs. Feng.

979
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,130
Li Chengyan knew Mrs. Feng was cheating on her.

980
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,560
Mrs. Feng asked Cheng Xiangjun

981
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,640
to kill Li Chengyan.

982
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,750
Then why did she kill Mrs. Feng too?

983
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,440
Because Mrs. Feng didn’t

984
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,870
pay Cheng Xiangjun on time.

985
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,280
So Cheng Xiangjun had Mrs. Feng killed as well

986
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,070
to silence her.

987
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,670
You’ve done a good job.

988
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,180
Put up a wanted notice and call off the team.

989
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,770
Sergeant Pao.

990
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,050
It’s a pity that you’re not writing a play

991
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,570
with your talent.

992
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,130
But think about it.

993
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,210
If Cheng Xiangjun

994
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,890
was really a professional killer,

995
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,480
she could have stopped after killing Li Chengyan.

996
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,170
Why would she need to kill Moly too?

997
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,600
Because she was particular.

998
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,830
She was a particular killer.

999
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,000
Okay, you guys can go.

1000
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,230
I have to write my report.

1001
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,660
If you’re gonna say this,

1002
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,740
aren’t you afraid that a few more people will die later?

1003
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,890
You’re a cop.

1004
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,070
Why are you always thinking about people being killed?

1005
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,360
Sergeant Bao, you promised me

1006
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,690
you’d give me more time.

1007
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,190
You investigate the case; I’ll write my report.

1008
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,430
Let’s not interfere with each other.

1009
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:05,890
Go ahead.

1010
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,200
Let’s go back to the office first.

1011
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,050
Situ.

1012
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,850
You want me to investigate a secret agent?

1013
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,000
The person who lived there should not be a spy.

1014
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,880
Why?

1015
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:31,470
How could a secret agent

1016
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,030
let his wife

1017
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,560
announce his identity?

1018
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,900
If that’s the case,

1019
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,210
the one who killed Mrs. Feng

1020
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,520
must be her husband.

1021
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,020
Why are you here, Mr. He?

1022
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,090
The door is open, so I come in.

1023
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:49,980
You guys...

1024
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,880
You’re talking about the case?

1025
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,140
Why didn’t you close the door?

1026
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,180
You’re the only one who dares to come in so directly.

1027
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,680
I’m not looking for you.

1028
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,270
I’m looking for this kid.

1029
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,250
Here's the sauerkraut I just made. Try some.

1030
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,920
Thank you, Mr. He.

1031
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,930
I'll make you a casserole of plain boiled pork

1032
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,980
with the sauerkraut sometime.

1033
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,450
You know what to do.

1034
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,400
I'll leave now.

1035
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,000
Boss.

1036
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,950
Boss, something happened.

1037
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,780
What’s wrong?

1038
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,590
Shen Huatang has been kidnapped.

1039
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,240
I think the person who reported the crime is suspicious

1040
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,230
and held her in the interrogation room.
