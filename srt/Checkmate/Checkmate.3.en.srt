1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,440
I guess so.

3
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,160
But Mr. Situ

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
does not look like this kind of person.

5
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's a thief crying "Stop thief" trick.

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,840
What did you say?

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,800
Liu says that

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,039
the deceased said "go away" in Russian last night.

9
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,640
Ma Shiying can't speak Russian.

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,720
Then who can speak Russian?

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,920
Mr. Situ.

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Wan Jixiang,

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,720
and Liu.

14
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,840
Liu is a conductor.

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
And I was talking to Wan Jixiang.

16
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,280
So whoever

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
doesn't have an alibi

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
is the killer.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Didn't you two both meet the killer,

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,880
which is the conductor?

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,360
And now you're telling me

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
that Situ Yan is the killer.

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,200
I only caught a glimpse of him

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,360
passing down the aisle

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,640
when I was sitting in my room.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,840
It was impossible for me to see that clearly.

27
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,640
But Mr. Situ also rang the bell,

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,240
when Ms. Qi Hong found the killer.

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,320
I don't think he was the killer.

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,079
It was room three you firstly went to,

31
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,680
before you went to room one, right?

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,240
Then Situ Yan should have time

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,480
to come out of Room Three first

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,640
when you went in to check,

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,520
and then went back to wait for you.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, if that's the case,

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
the man I saw

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
might not be Situ.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
Is this a challenge or a warning?

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Everybody, stay put.

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,200
I understand

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,160
there was a homicide happened in this train,

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,040
and you want to solve it before the train arrives.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
But I didn't leave my room last night.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
I went to bed early.

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,280
And I know nothing about it.

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,000
So I'm not gonna answer any questions.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,360
Mr. George Blair,

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,840
I just have one question for you.

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
Is there any other...

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,840
Are you crazy?

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,760
He is a diplomat

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,920
with diplomatic immunity.

55
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,800
Even if he's the killer,

56
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,040
it's beyond the scope of our duties.

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,720
Using diplomatic immunity to escape from punishment

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
makes no difference to

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,200
Ma Shiying using his foreign nationality to do the same thing.

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
You'll get into big trouble

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
if you keep making a scene like this without any basis.

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,840
It will be a diplomatic incident.

63
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,800
It's not just about you.

64
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,160
He's a lefty.

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,440
And Ma Shiying' s fatal wound

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,520
was caused by using left hand.

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
What do you want?

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,200
Do you know who I am?

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,360
Here's the thing,

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,760
Mr. George Blair.

71
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,560
We're investigating

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
a homicide

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,839
happened on this train.

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
You are a diplomat,

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,600
but...

76
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,880
Then you should know

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
that you have no right to interrogate me.

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
For a homicide happened in China,

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
we have the right to investigate anyone

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
who was in the vicinity of the crime scene.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
You haven't even confirmed

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,920
ownership of this rail with the Russians.

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,800
What rights are you talking to me about?

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
I'm not in charge of the rail.

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,320
But I make the call on this train,

86
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,280
because I own it.

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
You're being unreasonable.

88
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,480
Mr. George Blair,

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,520
I want to ask you a question.

90
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,280
Go away.

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
Is there a woman in your room?

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Hands off.

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
You ordered two meals.

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
Is there a woman in your room?

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,080
Answer me!

96
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,640
Let them in.

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,280
You have disturbed my wife.

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,320
I'm not gonna let this go.

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,480
Hello, madam.

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,440
I'm sorry to bother you.

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
My health condition is not good

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,840
and I could catch a cold easily.

103
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
So my husband was just worried about me.

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,680
Please don't mind.

105
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,440
Say what you want to say

106
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,040
and then go.

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,520
We don't like to be disturbed.

108
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
Can I see your passports, please?

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,960
Madame, you are Chinese, after all,

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,960
Can I have your Chinese name?

111
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Fang Ting.

112
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,760
Are you going to Harbin?

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,200
My husband

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,920
is a consul at the American Consulate in Harbin.

115
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
Have you been

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,320
to Harbin before?

117
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,000
Sure,

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
we spent most of our time in Harbin.

119
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
Have you heard about the tragedy at Xu family?

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,800
When did it happen?

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Twelve years ago.

122
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,640
I was eleven or twelve years old,

123
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,240
and hadn't been to Harbin yet.

124
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,120
So I have no impression on this.

125
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,200
Is the case that you're investigating

126
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,920
connected to this matter?

127
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
We're looking for clues

128
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,880
the killer left behind.

129
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,960
As offensive as it is,

130
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,840
we still hope to...

131
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
No, you have no right

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,600
to search our luggage.

133
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:43,960
Well, what if I just want to see

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,080
madam's jewelry box?

135
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,440
Is that okay?

136
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,960
Can I have a look at that?

137
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,680
What happened to these pearls?

138
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,600
I accidentally broke my necklace

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,640
when I was packing.

140
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,320
There was no time to fix it,

141
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,720
so I had to take them on the train.

142
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
Have you ever left the room since you got on the train?

143
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
Like going to the bathroom or something.

144
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,560
What exactly are you suspecting?

145
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,160
Get out of here.

146
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,800
Stop doing that.

147
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,280
Leave him alone.

148
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,240
Stop this.

149
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,920
I need help.

150
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,320
Hands off him.

151
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:26,960
Coming.

152
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,400
Stop this.

153
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,680
Stop!

154
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,120
Leave him alone.

155
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,919
Leave him alone.

156
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Let go of me.

157
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,520
I'll answer any questions,

158
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,840
as long as you let him go.

159
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,280
I haven't been out of my room

160
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,240
since I got on the train.

161
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
I was in the room all the time.

162
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,640
And I went to bed early last night.

163
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,200
In fact,

164
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,760
all we know is that somebody was killed.

165
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,520
We don't even know

166
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,480
who's dead.

167
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm gonna make you regret it.

168
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
If that's the case,

169
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,160
how do you explain this?

170
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,880
What do you mean?

171
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,360
This is what we found at the crime scene.

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
I believe

173
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,040
that madam must have broken the necklace

174
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,880
at that moment.

175
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,200
You missed one

176
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
when you were collecting the pearls.

177
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120
If you are telling the truth,

178
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,960
how come somebody who has never been outside the room

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
could get the chance

180
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,840
to leave a pearl in someone else's room?

181
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,240
I really don't know what you're talking about.

182
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,560
Don't kill me.

183
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,240
It's okay.

184
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,120
Everything will be okay.

185
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,960
This is the murder weapon.

186
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,280
I was trying to get a pack of cigarettes,

187
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,760
and I saw the dagger right there.

188
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,720
I don't know why it is under my purse.

189
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,480
I really have no idea.

190
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,640
The killer

191
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,680
probably put it there

192
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,160
when he was getting out.

193
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,960
He will be back.

194
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,880
He will come back for sure.

195
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,520
You guys are so irresponsible.

196
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,440
You should publicize your investigation.

197
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,960
Now the killer is among us.

198
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,400
Anybody could get killed.

199
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,120
Everyone is having a nervous breakdown.

200
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
We've almost found the killer.

201
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
There's no need to be scared.

202
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,040
Can I see what's in this purse?

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
The murderer left too many clues

204
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,800
in your room.

205
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,640
I believe

206
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,080
he may come back anytime.

207
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
I don't want to die.

208
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
I don't want to die.

209
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,760
Don't kill me.

210
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,200
I won't say anything.

211
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,520
I won't say anything.

212
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,160
I won't tell anyone about anything.

213
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
Don't kill me.

214
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't kill me.

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Can you stop making her agitated.

216
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
I think she'd better leave her room

217
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,480
and go to your place.

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,360
Stay with her.

219
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,080
You are the one who has seen the murderer.

220
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,560
So your memories

221
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,080
are very important to us.

222
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,560
And once we catch him,

223
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
you'll be safe.

224
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,120
I've said everything I remember.

225
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,280
So many clues,

226
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,360
and so many witnesses.

227
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,280
But you still can't find the murderer.

228
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,840
You just can't find the murderer.

229
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,520
Don’t worry.

230
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,480
Bai Lu will be with you.

231
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,640
We can send someone to protect you

232
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,720
if you need.

233
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
You won't be in danger.

234
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,800
So,

235
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,680
could you please recall

236
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,920
what happened last night?

237
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,280
For example, this communicating door,

238
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,440
was it open

239
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
or locked?

240
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
I don't know.

241
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
I really don't know.

242
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,840
This is very important.

243
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,000
Please think about it carefully.

244
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,560
Well.

245
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
I remember now.

246
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,440
Last night,

247
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,920
I hung my wash bag

248
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,640
on the handle of that communicating door.

249
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,680
It was blocking the door lock.

250
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,840
I didn't check it.

251
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,880
So,

252
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,760
I didn't see it clearly.

253
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
Right there!

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,840
The door lock was blocked.

255
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,440
I know...

256
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I know you're scared.

257
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,800
You don't have to trust me,

258
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,680
but you can trust him.

259
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,040
He will find the murderer.

260
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,800
And what I can do

261
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,480
is to protect you.

262
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,920
I'll be relieved

263
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,840
if you all leave me alone.

264
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
This next question I'm going to ask

265
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,800
may be a little offensive to you.

266
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,080
But from what I saw yesterday,

267
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,240
you are very close to Ma Shiying.

268
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
In this case,

269
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,600
you probably wouldn't mind

270
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
if the door was locked or not.

271
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,280
Why would you ask Liao Yun

272
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,360
to confirm again?

273
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,760
It was because

274
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,280
there are too many evil men in this world.

275
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,960
That's why there are so many poor women.

276
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,280
I think you misunderstood me, Mr. Situ.

277
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm no longer

278
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,280
the kind of woman you think I am.

279
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,520
And I'm no longer young.

280
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,400
Now,

281
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,000
all I do to earn a living

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
is to make people happy.

283
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm just a singer.

284
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,600
You're still a singer?

285
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Yeah.

286
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
Now,

287
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,160
I just play the piano and sing.

288
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,240
I was afraid that

289
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
Ma Shiying would do something to me.

290
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,040
That's why

291
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,440
I would repeatedly check if the communicating door was locked at that time.

292
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,720
I've been so rude.

294
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,760
May I

295
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
leave now?

296
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,040
What's wrong?

297
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,240
I was wondering

298
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,200
why she would lie.

299
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,560
Who are you talking about?

300
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,800
Hello.

301
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
Her Highness wants to see you.

302
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,920
Please.

303
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,680
I heard

304
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,720
you found a pearl.

305
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,520
Yeah.

306
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,840
We have found the owner.

307
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,160
I believe that the murderer

308
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,680
will soon be found as well.

309
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,000
The pearl you found

310
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,720
must be the one I lost.

311
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Look,

312
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,880
this silver pin

313
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,640
of this hairpin broke.

314
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,400
That's why the pearl fell off.

315
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,120
I don't wear this hairpin often.

316
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,760
The silver pin has turned black.

317
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,560
Go check if the pearl you found

318
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,720
is also stained

319
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
with some blackened stains.

320
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,360
Do you know

321
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,920
where I found this pearl?

322
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,560
I don't even know when it was lost.

323
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,120
I wore this hairpin

324
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,400
yesterday,

325
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,600
but didn't pay attention to it.

326
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,040
Then I put it back in the box.

327
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
It was after you asked my servant

328
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,280
about the pearls today

329
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
that I went to take a look.

330
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,960
Pearls

331
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
are round,

332
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,280
so they may roll around.

333
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,440
What do you think a smart person would do

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,760
if he or she wants to free the guilty?

335
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,360
At least

336
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,280
that person wouldn't try to frame a diplomat.

337
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
Things are getting weirder.

338
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,119
The murderer

339
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
was hiding in Ma Shiying's room around 1:00 yesterday.

340
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,560
Meanwhile,

341
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Wan Jixiang,

342
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,520
Zong Yan.

343
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,359
and Liu Zijie

344
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,640
were drinking together.

345
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,319
Bai Lu and Liao Yun said that neither of them had left last night.

346
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,000
Shi Chunsan was in Princess Rong Xiang's room.

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,160
Liu Zijie can prove it.

348
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,280
Then,

349
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,079
the only people without an alibi

350
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,040
are me,

351
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,160
Qi Hong,

352
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,400
and the Blairs.

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
Around 1:15,

354
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,600
Shi Chunshan saw the strange conductor

355
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,160
in the aisle.

356
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,880
At that time,

357
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,680
Qi Hong and I rang the bell almost at the same time.

358
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,480
Liu Zijie can testify that.

359
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,760
Zong Yan has already said that

360
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
you had time to commit the crime at that time.

361
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,560
But I chose to trust you.

362
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,160
Are you suspecting me?

363
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,560
If you still can't find out the murder,

364
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,520
I have every reason to suspect that

365
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,360
you are using me to confuse the situation.

366
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,960
I won't explain this to you now.

367
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,440
Go away.

368
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,160
Here's the thing.

370
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Our original intention is to solve the case as soon as possible.

371
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
I don't want to see you.

372
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,400
Please go away.

373
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,920
Xu Fangting!

374
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,560
Hiding your identity won't help you in any way.

375
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,680
She has nothing to do with this.

376
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,360
You're right.

377
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,280
I'm Xu Fangting.

378
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,200
And I know that it was Ma Shiying who died.

379
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,280
So I didn't dare to say who I am.

380
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,680
Once I tell you,

381
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
you will doubt me.

382
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,240
Just like now.

383
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,280
We just want to get closer to the truth.

384
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,040
You have no right to judge Ma Shiying.

385
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,080
But someone else did it.

386
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,160
You should be applauding,

387
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
not looking for the judge.

388
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,960
Whoever he is,

389
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
he is a good person.

390
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
No matter who he is,

391
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,960
he's a murderer.

392
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,680
But he killed my sister-in-law and her child.

393
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,360
You think they deserved to die?

394
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,080
You knew Ma Shiying was the murderer?

395
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,240
I saw him

396
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,560
on the day of the crime.

397
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,800
That devil.

398
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,920
But he was not guilty now.

399
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,800
It's like what happened in Beijing

400
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,320
the other day.

401
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,840
He became a lawful citizen.

402
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,800
If you say I don't deserve to be a member of the legal profession,

403
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,680
then do you deserve to be Chinese?

404
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,240
Do you?

405
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,680
The police ignored my allegations,

406
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,400
the evidence left at the scene

407
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
and anything else.

408
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,080
This is fate.

409
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
Fate made me witness his retribution for sin.

410
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
So you hid in the box

411
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,840
because you were afraid of being recognized by Ma Shiying?

412
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,920
He had never seen me.

413
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,480
So he didn't know me.

414
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,600
But I knew he was the devil.

415
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,880
How could my sister-in-law have extra money?

416
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,840
She had exhausted her strength

417
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
in maintaining the household of her whole family.

418
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,080
That bastard didn't find money.

419
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
But after he saw my sister-in-law he tried to molest her.

420
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
She told me to run with the baby.

421
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,440
I was so scared at the time.

422
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,360
Who are you?

423
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,040
Let go of me!

424
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,880
Let go of me!

425
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,120
Stop it!

426
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,040
Please.

427
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,120
Let go of me!

428
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,080
Let go of me!

429
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,240
Let go of me!

430
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,080
Please! Let me go!

431
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
Mom!

432
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,400
Mom!

433
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,600
Mom!

434
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,160
Mom!

435
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,240
I ran away.

436
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
I left them behind and ran.

437
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,280
You were only twelve years old.

438
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,720
There was nothing you could do by staying there.

439
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,600
It wasn't your fault.

440
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,040
I'm the one who got my niece killed.

441
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,280
It was me.

442
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,600
None of this would have happened

443
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
if I had grabbed her hand a little tighter

444
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,440
or covered her eyes.

445
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,080
This had nothing to do with you.

446
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,600
It wasn't your fault.

447
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
I really wanted to kill him myself.

448
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,280
But I didn't even have the courage to look at him again.

449
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm a loser.

450
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,040
I'm useless.

451
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,240
So,

452
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,880
someone killed him for you.

453
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,160
I know what you're suspecting.

454
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,640
But that's not what we did.

455
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,840
Maybe...

456
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
there are other people on the train who know the Xu family?

457
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,920
I don't know.

458
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
I only heard that

459
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,960
Princess Rong Xiang is also on this train.

460
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,640
She's my sister-in-law's godmother.

461
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,320
But she's too old.

462
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,480
Besides,

463
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,720
she and my sister-in-law

464
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,520
stopped seeing each other a long time ago.

465
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm afraid she's not the one who killed Ma Shiying.

466
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,760
What were the names of the servants in your house at that time?

467
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,760
We did not usually call them by their names directly.

468
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,880
What kind of person was the one who reported the crime at that time?

469
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,800
She was just a student.

470
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,200
A student?

471
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,240
Yes.

472
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,320
She studied English with my sister-in-law.

473
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,800
But I can't remember her name.

474
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,440
Could

475
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,560
she be on this train too?

476
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,080
Maybe I can remind you of her name.

477
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,400
For example,

478
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,000
Qi Hong or Bai Lu?

479
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,520
Han Shuang? That's right.

480
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,920
Her name is Han Shuang.

481
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,600
I remember now.

482
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,000
Han Shuang?

483
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Yes.

484
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,720
She was a student twelve years ago,

485
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,280
she can't still be a student now, right?

486
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,040
Her age doesn't match.

487
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
I've checked her identity-document.

488
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,480
There is nothing wrong.

489
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,280
Her name is Bail Lu.

490
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,000
No.

491
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,960
I'd like to talk to you alone.

492
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,240
What are they going to talk about?

493
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,920
About changing name.

494
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I think you know that

495
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,400
Xu Huichang's sister is also on this train, right?

496
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
I haven't met her.

497
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,680
You were there

498
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
when the Xu family tragedy occurred.

499
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,960
No.

500
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,840
Then why did you call the police?

501
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,120
You were an accomplice?

502
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,920
No.

503
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,640
You helped the murderer?

504
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
I didn't mean it.

505
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,960
What did you do?

506
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,000
I was nine years old

507
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,600
at the time.

508
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,000
I learned English from Mrs. Xu.

509
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,320
She was very nice to me.

510
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,160
She was like a mother

511
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,160
to me.

512
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,880
There was always a coachman loitering at the door

513
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,000
a few days before the crime.

514
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
I took a ride in his car once.

515
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
He said that Mrs. Xu had done something unseemly.

516
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,200
I haven't seen him

517
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,280
since the crime.

518
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,760
So I suspected him,

519
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,280
and I went to the police.

520
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,160
The police said

521
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,120
that the appearance of the person I mentioned

522
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,200
was the same as that of the murderer Fangting mentioned.

523
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,640
So you killed him

524
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,480
when you met him again?

525
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,280
Mr. Situ,

526
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,720
he once made you nothing

527
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
in court.

528
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,120
So you have a motive to kill too.

529
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,320
When exactly did Han Shuang

530
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,240
change her name to Bai Lu?

531
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,160
She didn't.

532
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
Han Shuang is Bai Lu.

533
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Bail Lu is Han Shuang.

534
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,800
Then why?

535
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,080
When I was reading the list of people on the train

536
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,200
to the Blairs,

537
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,320
she hurriedly told me a name.

538
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,480
That means she knew there are people

539
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,840
on the train who knows her.

540
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,760
People who lie in an emergency situation

541
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,240
are most likely to use the words they associate with.

542
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,920
For example.

543
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,320
Green reeds are thick and dense.

544
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,360
Clear dews become frost thence.

545
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,720
That's my guess.

546
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,280
Her Highness is Mrs. Xu's godmother.

547
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,680
The Blairs

548
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,080
are Mrs. Xu's sister and brother-in-law.

549
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,320
Bai Lu was the one who reported the crime.

550
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,840
Then I wouldn't be surprised

551
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
if all the passengers in this compartment

552
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,720
are related to the Xu family.

553
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,280
I would rather

554
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,400
everyone has nothing to do with the Xu family.

555
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,640
Yes.

556
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,200
Shi Chunshan

557
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
was the cook of the Xu family.

558
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,640
She accompanied Yuqin when Yuqin got married.

559
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,280
She was also displaced

560
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,040
after the Xu family's accident.

561
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,840
She met me two years ago,

562
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,960
and I just happened to be short of

563
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,120
a suitable person.

564
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
This case is related to the Xu family.

565
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,120
I think it's better to save trouble.

566
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,720
We didn't kill anyone.

567
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,120
And we don't want to get ourselves into trouble.

568
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,240
You were there

569
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,520
when the Xu family tragedy occurred.

570
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,680
I'm the one who got Mrs. Xu killed.

571
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,840
That devil would not have

572
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,120
come in through that door and killed her

573
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,600
if I had not forgotten to

574
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,680
close the back door that night.

575
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
If I hadn't,

576
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,080
she wouldn't have died.

577
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,600
So you killed Ma Shiying to avenge her?

578
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
No, it wasn't me.

579
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,360
I never knew who the murderer was.

580
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,400
After the crime,

581
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,880
we servants were locked up

582
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,960
for investigation.

583
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,400
I...

584
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,680
I wasn't released

585
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,880
until Ying died.

586
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,680
The Xu family

587
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,120
no longer existed at that time.

588
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,440
I didn't know where to go.

589
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,040
I wanted to go back to Madam,

590
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,880
but she was very sick.

591
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,000
I wandered around

592
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
until I came across Her Highness.

593
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,880
I finally found a place to stay.

594
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,480
I didn't dare to say

595
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,240
what relationship I had with the Xu family.

596
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,760
I was really

597
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,760
scared.

598
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,440
Madam was seriously ill?

599
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,680
I see.

600
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,000
All of you are related to the Xu family

601
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,600
and Mrs. Xu.

602
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,720
Did you bring that book?

603
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,240
Why?

604
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,000
May I have a look?

605
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,560
Sure.

606
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,160
You were so beautiful when you were young.

607
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,680
Sir,

608
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,280
I think you've got it wrong.

609
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,560
That's my daughter

610
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,720
holding my grandson.

611
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,480
They took this two years ago.

612
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,560
I probably

613
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,760
didn't keep it very well.

614
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,800
You're lying.

615
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,680
This photo may develop wrinkles

616
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,080
if you do not keep it well.

617
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,000
But the yellowing of the photo can only be due to the passage of time.

618
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,560
I can see that you've been preserving this photo very carefully.

619
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,720
Even if it is an old photo from thirty years ago.

620
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,160
I think

621
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,440
it's probably because your daughter has passed away.

622
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,800
I was afraid that you would be sad

623
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,440
and didn't want to mention it.

624
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,880
But now I have to say that

625
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,520
the people in the photo

626
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,080
are not your daughter and your grandson,

627
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,600
but you and your daughter.

628
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,280
That trip to Harbin to see her

629
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,640
must have been the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.

630
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,720
And you.

631
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,160
What about me?

632
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,560
You hinted to me that

633
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,200
Ma Shiying

634
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
had the habit of taking sleeping pills on the train.

635
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,720
You said

636
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,360
all these things.

637
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,720
I don't know about these things.

638
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,760
He had a fully loaded pistol under his pillow.

639
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,560
It means he was so worried about the threatening letter.

640
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,640
So he couldn't have been taking sleeping pills

641
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
while he slept.

642
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
What does it have to do with me

643
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,440
if he took or not?

644
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,120
The threatening letters he was afraid of

645
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,120
were not the two you gave me,

646
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
but the one you have burned.

647
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,160
But Wan Jixiang didn't have time to kill people.

648
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
He was just an asshole.

649
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,760
He shouldn't have killed Mrs. Xu.

650
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,480
My parents died early.

651
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,920
So I would do anything

652
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,080
to survive.

653
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,960
Stealing.

654
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,000
Robbing.

655
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,720
Cheating.

656
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,320
People thought I was a child

657
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,640
and would let me go.

658
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,560
But later,

659
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,400
I met someone who was not easy to mess with.

660
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,600
He wanted to beat me to death.

661
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,960
It was Mrs. Xu who saved me.

662
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,080
I met the murderer

663
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,280
before the crime.

664
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,080
I tried to steal from him

665
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
and he caught me.

666
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,240
I didn't want to give up.

667
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,000
So I followed him all the way

668
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,480
to Mrs. Xu's house.

669
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,360
I didn't go in.

670
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,520
I didn't.

671
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
I can responsibly tell you that

672
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,000
Wan Jixiang definitely did not leave the box at that time,

673
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
at least not when Ma Shiying died.

674
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,200
Xu Huichang died in a naval battle.

675
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,440
At that time, the entire fleet was wiped out.

676
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,080
And the ground landing point of Japanese army

677
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,120
happened to be Weirong.

678
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,080
That's nothing.

679
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,920
Back then,

680
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
we surrendered without even fighting in Weirong.

681
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,840
Give in when it's time to give in.

682
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,239
Why don't you drink?

683
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,920
You really want to know?

684
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,639
Then I'll tell you.

685
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,080
I was responsible for transferring my sister-in-law

686
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,400
first to Fengtian

687
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,679
and then to Harbin,

688
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,560
but I received other orders midway.

689
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,120
When I returned to Harbin,

690
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
it was the day of the murder.

691
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
I was drunk

692
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,960
that night.

693
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
I was supposed to be there that night

694
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,840
to make sure she was safe.

695
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,760
But I was drunk.

696
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,080
So...

697
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,800
Liu is an experienced conductor.

698
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,840
He has been working from the first train until now.

699
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,240
Ying's last name is Liu, right?

700
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,400
It was me.

701
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,040
It was all my fault.

702
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,720
I can't believe I didn't trust my own daughter.

703
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,200
If it wasn't for me,

704
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,080
she wouldn't have killed herself.

705
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,840
She had a grievance.

706
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,600
I'm gonna get this straight.

707
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,880
Yeah.

708
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,360
I knew her,

709
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,680
and had known her for a long time.

710
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,240
When I was in Nanjing,

711
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,160
I had a terrible illness,

712
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,040
before she was arrested.

713
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,960
It was her who looked after me.

714
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,760
She just cared about everything.

715
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,640
I was a prostitute at the time.

716
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,720
But she just kept persuading me to quit.

717
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,800
While meat and wine go to waste behind the vermilion gates of the rich,

718
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,080
the poor is frozen to death on an empty stomach by the roadside.

719
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,000
I did that to make a living.

720
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,880
I didn't steal anything or rob anyone.

721
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,240
What did I do wrong?

722
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,840
How could her always have her nose up to tell me what to do?

723
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,760
I was pissed.

724
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,880
So I told them about the stuff between her and Huai Chang.

725
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,720
It was all her fault.

726
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,960
Why did she have to advocate reform at that sensitive time?

727
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,000
After that,

728
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,560
She ran away

729
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
to Harbin.

730
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,960
Why was I so scared?

731
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,600
I was afraid of the killer

732
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,720
to kill me.

733
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,800
He was here

734
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,040
to avenge Mrs. Xu.

735
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,880
You said you left your wash bag on the door handle.

736
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,160
So you didn't even know if the door is open or closed.

737
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,920
But if you really did so,

738
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,200
you would find that the bag won't be able to stop anything.

739
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,840
Because the door handle

740
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,440
is lower than the door lock.

741
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,280
I read an editorial before I get on the train.

742
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,440
I don't remember the content.

743
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,840
But I do remember

744
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
that the author's name

745
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
was Huai Chang.

746
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,160
You've got the pipa pick in your purse.

747
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,680
But there are no calluses

748
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,040
of plucking strings on your fingers.

749
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,400
Instead, you have calluses

750
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,880
on the outside of your pinky

751
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,720
and middle finger.

752
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,040
You've stopped being a prostitute for a long time,

753
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,960
and become a writer.

754
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,760
You had kept Mrs. Xu alive

755
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,400
in your own way.

756
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,440
I just wanted to show her

757
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,960
that I can live a good life.

758
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,160
But it was too late.

759
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,360
Everyone on this train except me

760
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
is connected to the Xu family.

761
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,280
I don't think

762
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,760
it's a coincidence.

763
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,880
Doctor estimated

764
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,440
that the time of death was between 0:00 and 2:00 am.

765
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,360
All of your descriptions

766
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,800
are trying to lead me

767
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,880
to a made-up fact.

768
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,680
At midnight yesterday,

769
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,440
a fictitious killer got on the train

770
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,840
from Jinzhou Station.

771
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,640
He wore a conductor's uniform,

772
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,840
and used a master key to open the Ma Shiying's room.

773
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,200
After his murder,

774
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,920
he made an chamber of secrets,

775
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,000
and left Qi Hong's room.

776
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
He took off his clothing in Shi Chunshan's room,

777
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
then disappeared

778
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,320
at the direction to the bathroom

779
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,760
wearing a red cheongsam.

780
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,680
It would have been a perfect story

781
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,800
if the train hadn't stopped.

782
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,560
The killer should have got off the train by now.

783
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,880
Unfortunately,

784
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,320
the train stopped all night.

785
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,000
And no one could get away from here.

786
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,920
All of you were working together

787
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,000
on describing a killer

788
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
who didn't exist.

789
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,560
When exactly did Ma Shiying die?

790
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,040
His broken dial

791
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
seemed to suggest that

792
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,240
he was experiencing a violent event.

793
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,280
Ma Shiying was devoted to watches.

794
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,680
How could someone like him

795
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,520
sleep with a watch on?

796
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,400
That means

797
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,520
1:15 is the fake time of death

798
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,680
created by the killer.

799
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,800
Since the time of the crime was not 1:15,

800
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,080
could it be before then?

801
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,480
That's what you want me to believe.

802
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,320
At 00:40,

803
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,920
I was woken up by the loud noise in Ma Shiying's room.

804
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,840
And then I heard him

805
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,440
telling the conductor to get out in Russian.

806
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,520
Then Wan Jixiang and Zong Yan told me that

807
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,960
Ma Shiying didn't speak Russian.

808
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,800
Because you also wanted me

809
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,400
to be involved in this perfect alibi.

810
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,840
It was like the time of murdering

811
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,640
was really before 1:15

812
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,240
But what if it was after 1:15?

813
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,600
Like

814
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,680
1:30,

815
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,080
1:40,

816
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,640
or even

817
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,720
a time infinitely closer to 2:00.

818
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,720
Then all of your...

819
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,440
All of your alibis

820
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,200
would be null and void.

821
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,200
The victim was stabbed nine times.

822
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,880
Some of his stab wounds were deep

823
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,440
and some were shallow.

824
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,040
Those shallow wounds

825
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,720
pierced only the superficial layer of his skin.

826
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,480
And one deep wound

827
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,000
went straight through his entire lung.

828
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,480
Nine stabs.

829
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:23,840
One,

830
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,720
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

831
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,280
You happen to be nine people as well.

832
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,680
You...

833
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,960
You...

834
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
have given a trial to him.

835
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,720
But your trial was illegal.
