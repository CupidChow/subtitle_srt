[Episode 17]

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,750
Fang Huaijin has always been meticulous.

17
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,740
This time is no exception.

18
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,520
Seeing her calming down,

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,600
we thought

20
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,270
it had blown over as usual.

21
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,700
But no one expected

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,110
she stole morphine from my brother's lab

23
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,710
to kill Zhou Ze.

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,800
Did anyone see it?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,360
No.

26
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,490
The police found it in her wardrobe

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,410
after the incident.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,400
She put the morphine

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,050
into the wine she brought to Zhou Ze

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,430
the next day.

31
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,860
Bringing wine to Zhou Ze?

32
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,770
They quarreled again during lunch.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,550
It was because on the day before that day,

34
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,680
Fang Huaijin's sister, An Qiuzi

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,520
egged on Zhou Mowan

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,710
to fool Zhou Ze.

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,480
Zhou Ze wanted to send her back to the countryside,

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
but Fang Huaijin refused to do so.

39
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,930
How many times have I told you?

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,850
I'll pack her things right away.

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
I must send her away.

42
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,960
How can you treat her like this?

43
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
What should I do to her?

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,010
Tell me how I should treat her.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,880
You don't agree with me

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,360
no matter how I deal with her.

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,640
If she can neither stay here nor be sent away,

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,040
then you tell me what I should do!

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,079
How many more people do you want to hurt?

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,990
I don't want to discuss this with you anymore.

51
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,700
I don't want to waste time anymore.

52
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,590
I just need a glass of wine.

53
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,660
Let me get it for you.

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,350
The newly-delivered beer is still cold.

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,270
I want vodka, the pure type.

56
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,540
I also want some, please.

57
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,040
Before meeting Ge Ai,

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,360
Zhou Ze's favorite

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,260
was the cold beer Fang Huaijin prepared for him.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,700
But it all changed

61
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,020
since Ge Ai came to their life.

62
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,960
Zhou Ze no longer liked mildly bitter beer,

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,410
but stronger vodka.

64
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,090
I suppose, from that moment,

65
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,400
Fang Huaijin also realized it.

66
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,160
And that was why she made such a decision.

67
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,560
Your brother and Fang Huaijin...

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,700
The four of us grew up together.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,630
My brother had been in love with Fang Huaijin since childhood.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,440
Fang Huaijin loved Zhou Ze.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,890
But she never rejected my brother.

72
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,800
And Zhou Ze

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,360
always flirted with girls.

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,480
But he would at least restrain himself

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,380
in front of Fang Huaijin.

76
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,260
So, they got married.

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,700
Fang Huaijin is not as simple as she looks.

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,500
She did the same during the trial.

79
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,320
She would pretend to be pitiful with silence

80
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,160
to earn people's sympathy.

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,660
Based on the reasons above,

82
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,060
we can totally believe

83
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,230
Fang Huaijin murdered her husband Zhou Ze.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,660
Fang Huaijin,

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,450
do you have anything else to say?

86
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,630
I didn't kill anyone.

87
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,339
Fang Huaijin.

88
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:16,980
Huaijin.

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,120
According to what I said,

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
you can get a lighter sentence.

91
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,030
He committed suicide.

92
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,900
Zhou Ze is very passionate about life.

93
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,370
Before he died,

94
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,060
he was still devoted to writing.

95
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,400
How could he possibly commit suicide?

96
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,490
I don't know.

97
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,470
I don't know.

98
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,600
I don't know.

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,409
He committed suicide.

100
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,860
He committed suicide.

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
I don't know why you think

102
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,620
there's any grievance in this case.

103
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,470
But I'm a lawyer,

104
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,360
and personally witnessed the whole case.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,909
I'm very sure that

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,770
there's no injustice or any hidden fact.

107
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,880
Nothing.

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,300
Why did she insist that Zhou Ze committed suicide?

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,130
I've asked her.

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
She either kept silent

111
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
or repeated Zhou Ze committed suicide.

112
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,760
So, we could only make use of

113
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,120
the traces, clues and evidence at the scene

114
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,310
to confirm that Zhou Ze was killed by her.

115
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,200
I think Fang Huaijin didn't know what to do

116
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,910
and that's why she tried to justify herself

117
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,420
in this way.

118
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,090
Fang Huaijin is a decent person.

119
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,780
If I were not her friend,

120
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,900
maybe she would say something.

121
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,830
There seems to be something wrong with this case.

122
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,580
So, you've noticed it?

123
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,020
It's so obvious.

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,290
I could tell from the way you asked

125
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,940
that there must be something wrong.

126
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,730

They haven't come back yet?

What do you mean?

151
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,550
Last night, my young master and Mr. Situ

152
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,740
came back after taking a shower.

153

I thought he wouldn't return it back.

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,700
with such a trivial matter.

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,409
You could have just tell me and I would ask someone to go get it.

171
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,810
We're here

172
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,909
for something else.

173
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,130
May I ask

174
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,700
who is in charge of this case?

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Zhang is in charge of this case.

176
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,780
Is there anything important?

177
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,800
This incident

178
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,530
happened at my friend's house.

179
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,730
There are some doubts.

180
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,190
And I have some questions to check with the detective in charge.

181
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,760
Zhang

182
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,660
is a sophisticated person.

183
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,830
He's about to retire,

184
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,980
and rarely takes his work seriously.

185
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,230
He never shows up in office.

186
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,040
Could you please tell me his address?

187
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,250
He doesn't have a home.

188
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,320
You may be able to find him at the casino.

189
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,020
We won.

190
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,740
Officer Zhang.

191
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,059
Do you know Fang Huaijin?

192
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,659
What Fang Huaijin?

193
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,480
I have no idea.

194
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,070
A painter named Zhou Ze died of taking excessive morphine.

195
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,200
The suspect is his wife Fang Huaijin.

196
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,190
She seemed to add morphine to his vodka.

197
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,770
What do you want to ask me?

198
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,080
Does it have anything to do with me

199
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,710
even if there's something wrong with the case?

200
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,090
The evidence on the case file is not sufficient.

201
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,450
I want to know the details,

202
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,000
and that will decide the judge's final trial.

203
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,370
I don't care whether it's sufficient or not.

204
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,280
What does it matter?

205
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,750
If we don't have enough evidence,

206
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,120
then it means there may be injustice

207
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,980
Cases with injustice abound.

208
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,070
If you want to reverse the verdict, go to the judge.

209
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
You've made a person being wronged,

210
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,450
how could you be so nonchalant?

211
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,040
It was the judge who decided the case,

212
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,340
not me.

213
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,840
Even if a person was wronged,

214
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,070
it's the Judge that should be blamed.

215
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,050
Let me tell you.

216
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,090
Crows are all black.

217
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,420
As long as the case is closed,

218
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,790
it doesn't matter at all whether the evidence is sufficient or not.

219
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,930
There are so many birds in the world,

220
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,460
why do you want to be the most black crow?

221
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,060
It's better than being the white kind, isn't it?

222
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,980
I don't think

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,570
being a white crow is bad.

224
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,320
As the saying goes,

225
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,890
"the bird that takes the lead always gets shot."

226
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,260
Do you have a child?

227
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,480
A police officer's children

228
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,010
must think

229
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,880
it's a super honorable job to be the police.

230
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,890
But what about the daughter of a murderer?

231
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,260
Can you imagine

232
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,570
how many scornful looks she will face in her life?

233
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,920
But the root of all this

234
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,690
lies in you.

235
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,420
Women

236
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,860
should have self-awareness.

237
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,190
If you can't stand your husband being a womanizer,

238
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,370
then don't marry him.

239
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,500
He might promise

240
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,010
he would change after marriage?

241
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,200
Did he really change?

242
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,480
The woman couldn't stand it after marriage,

243
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,090
and then put morphine in the wine,

244
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,410
determining to kill her husband.

245
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,280
What else could there be?

246
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,680
Where was the poison?

247
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,910
It was in the wine, wasn't it?

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,530
Anywhere else?

249
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,680
No.

250
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,270
The wine her husband drank

251
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,820
was brought by Fang Huaijin.

252
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,330
There were fingerprints on the glass,

253
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,380
except the wine bottle.

254
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,240
Obviously,

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,770
Fang Huaijin wiped off the fingerprint.

256
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
So, you're also not sure

257
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,080
who wiped off the fingerprints.

258
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,510
It's obvious enough.

259
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,510
Morphine was found in Fang Huaijin's wardrobe.

260
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,520
She also admitted

261
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,580
she stole it from Li Yuanshun.

262
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,530
Obviously,

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,480
the one wiping the fingerprint could only be her.

264
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,610
But everyone already knows

265
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,690
she poured the wine for her husband.

266
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,430
It doesn't make sense for her to wipe off her fingerprints.

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,390
Young men, you know too little.

268
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,800
Even those murderers who're covered in blood

269
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,820
would wash their hands first after killing.

270
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,790
Why did she wipe off her fingerprints?

271
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,330
Because she was afraid of being found out.

272
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,330
I've been a police officer for so many years.

273
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,290
I know criminals better than you.

274
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,770
I will reverse the verdict for Fang Huaijin.

275
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
I plan to re-investigate this case.

276
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,110
Just as what I expected.

277
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,530
I knew from your frowns that

278
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,950
there must be something wrong with this case.

279
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,040
You've made progress.

280
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,600
Looks like you'll be a good detective in the future.

281
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,110
I'm not good at solving cases.

282
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,460
I'm just your assistant.

283
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,240
Just investigate this case if you want to do so.

284
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,750
Except Fang Huaijin,

285
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,550
there were six people at the scene.

286
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,220
Li Yuanpu,

287
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,470
Li Yuanshun,

288
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,480
Ge Ai,

289
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,810
their long-term laborer Xi Wanzhi,

290
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,570
Fang Huaijin's sister, An Qiuzi,

291
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,510
and Zhou Mowan.

292
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,480
According to the file,

293
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,240
Zhou Mowan had been playing the piano in her room

294
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,160
without coming out that day,

295
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,240
so she probably knew nothing.

296
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,800
So, the remaining five persons can all be suspects.

297
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
Could it be Li Yuanshun?

298
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,400
He was taken advantage of by his beloved woman Fang Huaijin

299
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,950
who became Zhou Ze's wife.

300
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,750
So, he killed Zhou Ze and got Fang Huaijin framed.

301
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,610
I've investigated it.

302
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:32,990
He's a doctor,

303
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,920
specialized for drugs,

304
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,020
having the ability to commit the crime.

305
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,310
What about the others?

306
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,010
About Xi Wanzhi,

307
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,280
she's now still working as a long-term laborer for another family in Fengtian.

308
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,500
The Russian returned to Russia after the incident,

309
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,870
being in Vladivostok.

310
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,920
As for An Qiuzi,

311
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,410
she went back and forth

312
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,530
and finally went to Shanghai to study.

313
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,470
Let's go to Li Yuanshun first.

314
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,720
It turns out that Zhou Mowan became like this

315
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,980
after such a calamity in her family.

316
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,900
I kinda feel sorry for her.

317
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,020
Inspector Luo.

318
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,510
After you left,

319
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,050
I recalled a thing.

320
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,200
This is the suicide note Fang Huaijin left for her daughter,

321
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,150
seemingly telling that she's innocent

322
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,140
and let her daughter live well.

323
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,220
Not long after the incident,

324
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,520
the girl got lost.

325
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,440
I couldn't reach her.

326
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,590
If there's a chance,

327
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,940
please give this letter to her.

328
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,620
Okay.

329
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,290
Actually, I've thought about it.

330
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,370
Considering that Fang Huaijin refused to cooperate,

331
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,170
there might really be injustice.

332
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,060
But there's no problem with the evidence.

333
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,230
Maybe she thought that claiming herself being innocent

334
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,750
could comfort her daughter.

335
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,680
I want to find out the truth myself.

336
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,480
Okay.

337
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,520
I'll look forward to the truth.

338
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,620
I'm looking forward to your good news.

339
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,400
Goodbye.

340
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,810
Fang Huaijin

341
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,310
is also a master at controlling people's hearts.

342
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,800
If she were still alive,

343
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,410
you could really

344
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,170
compete with your future mother-in-law.

345
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:15,980
Go away.

346
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,440
I forgot my stuff.

347
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,080
I shall go back to get my stuff.

348
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,790
Why are you investigating my family behind my back?

349
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,920
When we sorted out the files...

350
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,740
Why did you do that?

351
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,290
I didn't investigate you on purpose.

352
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,320
It's telling about my parents, right?

353
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,670
Not bad, Situ Yan!

354
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,860
You finally used your wisdom on me.

355
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,880
Listen to me.

356
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,810
These are found by accident

357
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,580
from the files of the school case

358
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,120
Luo Shaochuan borrowed from Fengtian.

359
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,860
So what?

360
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,760
So, Mr. Luo and you are here to laugh at me?

361
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,170
Or to reveal my scar?

362
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,950
You misunderstood it.

363
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,820
How could I want to laugh at you?

364
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,290
Luo Shaochuan won't either.

365
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,600
I really think something is wrong with this case.

366
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,730
Then why did you hide it from me?

367
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,730
Must everyone standing in front of you

368
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,890
be completely seen through

369
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,850
and be transparent

370
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,170
to make you feel proud?

371
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,030
It's not like that.

372
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,960
Because...

373
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,610
Because you are

374
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,250
to me.

375
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,970
So I didn't want to give you hope and let you down.

376
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,340
That's why I didn't tell you in advance.

377
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,260
You're great, Situ Yan.

378
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,090
It seems that you're really proud

379
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,790
of exposing suspects' disguise.

380
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,850
Your words are like sharp swords,

381
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,770
being no less than the murderer's knife.

382
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,600
You must be very proud of yourself now.

383
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,450
You can finally show your talent

384
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,400
with my wound.

385
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,410
In this case,

386
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,680
your mother's lawyer is my senior.

387
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,060
I have doubts about this case,

388
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,450
so I came to ask him about the situation.

389
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,120
That's all.

390
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,300
If you think I offended you,

391
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,920
I shall apologize to you.

392
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,200
We can leave Fengtian anytime.

393
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,870
Even if you don't want to talk to me anymore,

394
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,360
I accept it.

395
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,060
But I really didn't expect

396
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,520
I could be such a person in your heart.

397
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,590
Your mother left you this letter.

398
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,030
I'm sorry.

399
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:04,900
Here.

400
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,329
What's wrong with her?

401
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,790
She even came here to query our intention.

402
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,829
Shall we continue the investigation?

403
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,920
Yes.

404
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,660
Luckily she had no intention to kill us.

405
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,530
You have no idea

406
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,510
how she described me just now.

407
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,290
To be honest,

408
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,790
I kinda envy Zhou Mowan's dad.

409
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,730
He could mix with so many women.

410
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,600
But it's hard for both of us to deal with one.

411
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,960
You're a bit off the track!

412
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,390
Mr. Situ,

413
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,890
this is the Unifon you ordered.

414
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,510
It's delivered so fast.

415
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,620
You have good taste.

416
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,940
Our facial cleanser is made from Hydromica.

417
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:46,960
It's made through an 180-day process,

418
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,070
including powder-refining in water,

419
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,370
and repeated sedimentation and filtration.

420
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,510
Its mud is very thin.

421
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,610
So, nothing can be better than it for your skin care.

422
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,360
Thank you.

423
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,430
[Wan,

424
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,550
when you read this letter,

425
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,260
mom probably has passed away.

426
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,030
But when I think

427
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,100
you'll be ridiculed

428
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,320
for having a mom who's a murderer,

429
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,070
I really fall apart inside.

430
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,550
Wan.

431
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,490
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,570
But please trust mom.

433
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,990
I didn't kill anyone,

434
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,160
let alone your dad who loved you like I did.

435
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,710
At that time,

436
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,420
I was so disappointed in your dad,

437
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,680
thus thinking about leaving this world alone

438
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,870
on impulse.

439
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,830
After I calmed down,

440
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,630
I gave up the thought.

441
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,490
But I didn't expect...

442
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,160
Wan,

443
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,990
without mom and dad,

444
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,340
you should still grow up happily and healthily.

445
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,400
We will protect you and love you

446

in another world.]

447
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,970
Later,

448
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,420
you can try to ask her some questions

449
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,380
in the name of caring about her.

450
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,210
Will it work?

451
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,900
You can pass the buck to me if she realizes it.

452
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,050
You can tell her I forced you to come.

453
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,020
That's just the way it is!

454
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,650
Why are you so ungrateful?

455
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,780
I'm doing this all for your Zhou Mowan!

456
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,120
I don't know to which family she will belong in the future.

457
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,870
But it definitely won't be mine.

458
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,240
Open the door.

459
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,050
It's me.

460
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,550
I brought you a gift.

461
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,290
Why aren't you saying anything?

462
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,560
Or you can blame me.

463
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,320
You can scold me too.

464
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,150
Go and ask.

465
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,360
Hello.

466
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,290
Where does the newly-arriving Miss Zhou live?

467
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,660
Miss Zhou?

468
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,430
Which Miss Zhou?

469
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,510
She’s tall.

470
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,390
The one in a red coat.

471
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,090
There indeed was a lady in red coat.

472
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,790
She just went out.

473
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,190
Thank you.

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,430
Could she go back to Harbin?

476
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,230
Back to Li Yuanpu's place?

477
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,450
Let's go.

478
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,520
Zhou Mowan.

479
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,200
Yes.

480
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,490
She never came here.

481
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,130
Didn't she ask you to investigate this case?

482
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,560
How could you get separated?

483
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,070
I hope so.

484
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,020
What do you mean?

485
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,760
Zhou Mowan is my friend.

486
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,860
If we can confirm that

487
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,450
her father wasn't killed by her mother,

488
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,710
then it's probably the best gift I can give her.

489
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,240
You're quite romantic.

490
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,580
It's a good idea,

491
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,720
but there's no possibility for you to reverse the case.

492
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,250
I found the problem.

493

What is it?

more details about the case.

For example?

Zhou Ze wanted to divorce her and marry herself.

500

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,500
Li Yuanshun?

503
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,190
Yes.

504
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,930
My brother knew they had a fight.

505
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,790
He said there was a way to calm them down,

506
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,470
and he took everyone to his lab.

507
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,760
He thought everyone would like those bottles and jars

508
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,100
as his did.

509
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,730
No wonder Fang Huaijin didn’t choose him.

510
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,290
Can too much of this make people addicted

511
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,200
like opium does?

512
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,560
You don't know, do you?

513
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,340
This is the most addictive thing in opium.

514
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,730
It kills people.

515
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,440
It can not only take one's life,

516
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,920
but also destroy the whole country.

517
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,690
Don't underestimate it.

518
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,400
It can defeat an army

519
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,170
without sacrificing a single soldier.

520
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,190
Is it really that powerful?

521
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,430
Didn't you just say this can cure illnesses?

522
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,440
I've been suffering a headache recently.

523
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,960
Give me some.

524
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,690
Your headache

525
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,910
can't be cured.

526
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,680
How much of it can take a person's life?

527
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,770
250 mg for the pure type.

528
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,660
For the extracted type, I need to calculate it.

529
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,840
How much is that?

530
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,720
No one expected

531
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,510
Fang Huaijin already thought about killing with morphine.

532
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,540
The next morning,

533
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,370
Zhou Ze talked about divorcing Fang Huaijin,

534
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,110
so they had a big quarrel.

535
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,800
I happened to see it.

536
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,420
I told you it's not true.

537
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,750
What do you want?

538
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,550
Divorce?

539
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,160
Come on. Let's divorce.

540
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,220
Why are there always

541
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,630
so many women around you?

542
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,180
One after another.

543
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,210
How can you be so cruel?

544
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,470
I don't want to talk about this now.

545
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,940
We'll talk about it later.

546
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,760
But we're already unable to avoid it.

547
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,130
Can you stop fooling around?

548
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,540
You think too much.

549
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,320
Can't you just give me some peace.

550
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,050
I'm serious.

551
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,590
Where are you going?

552
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,430
I shall go to the backyard.

553
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,500
Don't be upset.

554
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,500
Have some water.

555
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,110
Women are so annoying.

556
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,100
Can't they just understand us a little bit?

557
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
If there is a next life,

558
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,320
I will never get married.

559
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,930
That's all because they love you.

560
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,880
Is this love?

561
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,480
This is a shackle.

562
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,530
This is imprisonment.

563
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,600
This is torture.

564
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,220
It's purely a kind of kidnapping.

565
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,030
He's gone too far.

566
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,820
Then, I've been in the living room all the time.

567
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,660
Fang Huaijin was taking care of the two kids.

568
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,690
Zhou Ze was drawing for Ge Ai in the backyard.

569
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,730
Everything kinda went well for the whole morning.

570
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,970
Until lunch, my brother came.

571
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,710
They had another quarrel.

572
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,670
I think I've told you this last time.

573
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,800
They quarreled in the morning,

574
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,120
and did it again after taking care of the two kids?

575
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,080
Right.

576
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,450
Maybe she was trying all methods

577
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,190
to stop Zhou Ze and Ge Ai from being together.

578
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,970
I remember in the quarrel,

579
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,810
Zhou Ze said he would make her pack up

580
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,700
and send her away.

581
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
Whom was him referring to?

582
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,700
Fang Huaijin's sister, An Qiuzi.

583
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,400
Weren't they talking about the divorce?

584
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,380
No.

585
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,620
An Qiuzi knew Zhou Ze was going to divorce Fang Huaijin,

586
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,760
So, she urged Zhou Mowan to go to Zhou Ze.

587
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,040
They added a lot of salt in the dishes for dinner.

588
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,130
Zhou Ze was in a bad mood,

589
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,580
so he got angry with the two kids.

590
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,760
He said he wanted to send her back to where she came from.

591
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,820
But where could she go?

592
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,780
Fang Huaijin was in a hurry to talk about this with him.

593
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,690
Then Zhou Ze wanted to drink,

594
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,320
and Fang Huaijin went to get the wine.

595
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,760
Yes.

596
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,860
Ge Ai also said she wanted to drink.

597
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,960
I think it may be a series of stimulation

598
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,310
that pushed Fang Huaijin to a dead end.

599
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,910
And that was why she poisoned the wine.

600
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,340
What a pity.

601
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,960
I want to go to the Zhou Mansion.

602
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,380
Its tone may not be as good as it was before.

603
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,300
Adjust it.

604
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,620
It will be recovered.

605
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,370
I think I should thank you.

606
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,970
If it weren't for you,

607
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,130
I would never be able to see

608
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,330
the letter my mom left me.

609
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,380
You don't have to thank me.

610
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,140
I was too arrogant.

611
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,290
You've already offended me.

612
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,340
Unless...

613
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,440
Unless I return the truth to you.

614
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,020
No matter what kind of person my mom is,

615
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,540
I want to hear the truth from you.

616
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,730
If she really didn't kill anyone,

617
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,300
I will definitely

618
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,510
prove her innocence together with you.

619
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,760
This is my senior, Attorney Li Yuanpu.

620
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,400
He was also an old friend of your parents.

621
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,550
I remember you.

622
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,520
Mr. Li.

623
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,930
You've grown up.

624
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,710
You and your mother

625
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,500
look exactly the same.

626
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,050
Where have you been these years?

627
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,910
We got no news about you.

628
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,210
We thought...

629
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,720
After I got separated with my aunt,

630
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,200
I never found the way home.

631
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,620
And I never came back.

632
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,070
When I have time,

633
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,710
I'll take you to see your parents.

634
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,800
They will be relieved

635
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,980
after seeing you grow up.

636
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,000
We really don't have a room.

637
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,720
Can you help us?

638
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,670
There were still rooms during the day.

639
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,590
Not now.

640
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,570
It's full.

641
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,750
I'm really sorry.

642
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,070
You shouldn't have bickered during the day.

643
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,180
Are you happy now?

644
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,220
What shall you do?

645
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,750
It's no use looking at me.

646
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,910
I won't live together with anyone.

647
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,700
What have you found?

648
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,620
Except you and your parents,

649
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,550
there were five persons involved in this case.

650
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,760
Li Yuanshun.

651
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,480
Li Yuanpu.

652
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,890
An Qiuzi, your aunt.

653
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:05,940
Xi Wanzhi,

654
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,010
and Ge Ai.

655
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,960
Except An Qiuzi and Ge Ai,

656
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,590
the rest of them are in Fengtian.

657
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,780
I've already visited my senior Li Yuanpu.

658
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,770
I'm gonna meet Li Yuanshun

659
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,550
and Xi Wanzhi next.

660
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,910
Especially Li Yuanshun.

661
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,770
What about Ge Ai and my aunt?

662
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,390
Leave it to me.

663
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,600
It has been too long since the time of the case.

664
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,410
There's almost no trace to follow.

665
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,890
So, I can only talk with the persons involved

666
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,170
to see if I can find some details

667
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,340
and complete the puzzle.

668
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,710
I still have some images of the time in my mind.

669
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,140
Li Yuanpu said the day before the incident,

670
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,100
An Qiuzi and you annoyed your father.

671
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,730
He threatened An Qiuzi

672
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,100
to send her home.

673
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:48,900
Do you remember?

674
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,730
I remember the afternoon before that day,

675
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,920
the adults all went out.

676
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,280
My aunt suddenly came to tell me

677
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,580
that my dad was gonna abandon me

678
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,690
and ran away with another woman,

679
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,620
so we must stop it.

680
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,480
How could she

681
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,020
tell a kid such things?

682
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,440
She's not much older than me.

683
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,310
She was still a child at that time.

684
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,050
But unlike me,

685
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,150
she lived in my home since she was a little kid,

686
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,550
so she was afraid of being abandoned.

687
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,310
She and my mom are uterine.

688
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,160
After my grandmother passed away,

689
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,490
my aunt's father married another woman.

690
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,730
But that woman treated her badly.

691
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,010
So, my mom brought her to our house.

692
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,760
So, whenever she made your father unhappy,

693
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,290
your father would threaten her to send her away.

694
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,910
Almost.

695
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:38,860
And then?

696
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,460
Then...

697
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,430
At night on that day,

698
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,640
Ge Ai made Russian food at my home.

699
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,350
My aunt told me

700
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,810
we must make the meal

701
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,920
really unpalatable

702
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,690
so that my dad wouldn't abandon mom.

703
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,810
I remember we put a lot of salt

704
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,920
in the dishes.

705
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,980
Dad was very angry when he found it out.

706
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,710
He knew it was my aunt and me

707
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,780
with no need to guess.

708
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,260
He asked my mom to lock us up.

709
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,200
The next morning,

710
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,640
aunt came to me again.

711
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,050
She said she had a better way.

712
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,880
When she was dragging me out,

713
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,210
she was caught by my mom.

714
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,860
Where are you going?

715
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,510
We want to play in the backyard.

716
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,100
Go back to your room and do your homework.

717
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,150
Wan.

718
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,650
Are you trying to upset your dad again?

719
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,110
You're always messing around.

720
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,630
Go back to play the piano.

721
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,540
You shall not stop without my permission.

722
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,470
Go.

723
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:48,820
After that,

724
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,630
I stayed in bed,

725
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,880
being angry with my mom.

726
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,350
I didn't come out until dinner.

727
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,030
What are you doing?

728
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,320
Write down the clues.

729
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,630
Zhou Mowan provided the information

730
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,550
which shows what happened from the murderer's having the chance to get morphine

731
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,360
to the happening of the incident.

732
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,190
And Li Yuanpu

733
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,980
provided clues to the case,

734
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,659
including his interactions with Zhou Ze and Fang Huaijin.

735
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,730
But it's not detailed.

736
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,760
I'm quite clear

737
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,889
about the specific clues.

738
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,020
I draw this just to see...

739
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,480
But when you were in the office,

740
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,219
you kept working on the timeline.

741
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,770
Shouldn't we confirm

742
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,940
everyone's alibi first?

743
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,800
This case is about poisoning.

744
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,179
So, there could be a time gap.

745
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,090
Think about how Yu Daren and Li Yantong

746
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,489
poisoned Shen Baifeng.

747
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,489
The alibi doesn't work at all.

748
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,800
And it's an old case

749
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,620
without evidence.

750
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,870
So, I plan to use the pairwise elimination method

751
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:50,980
to clear the suspicion.

752
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,050
The one whose suspicion can't be ruled out in the end

753
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,730
could be the murderer.

754
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,980
The pairwise elimination method means...

755
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,670
When two or more people

756
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,450
give the same narration over the same issue,

757
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,010
then what they tell can be seen as the truth.

758
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,320
And I'll cross the circle.

759
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,370
If two people

760
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,250
give different narrations over the same issue,

761
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,330
then we can assume that someone has recall bias,

762
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,590
or someone lies.

763
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,670
Then I will draw a dot on it,

764
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,180
indicating that there's something wrong.

765
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,340
This is a good idea.

766
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,740
Did your teacher teach you this?

767
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,450
Just my own ignorant idea.

768
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,060
It's newly-created.

769
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,720
You're...

770
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,940
We're Dr. Li Yuanshun's friends.

771
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
We need to ask him about something.

772
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,610
Dr. Li is not here today.

773
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,360
Aunt Wanzhi.

774
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,500
Who are you?

775
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,400
I'm Mowan.

776
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,720
Mowan.

777
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,020
Mowan.

778
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,080
We've been looking for you since you got lost.

779
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,700
Where did you go?

780
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,020
Aunt Wanzhi.

781
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,630
We're investigating the old case of my family.

782
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,490
We think there are hidden facts.

783
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,480
But I was too young back then.

784
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,560
I can't remember many things.

785
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,210
Can you tell me

786
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,870
everything you know?

787
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,750
I don't think my mom is the murderer.

788
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,920
But...

789
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,060
What did you see?

790
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,840
It's been so long.

791
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,410
Let bygones be bygones.

792
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,630
Mowan,

793
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,910
you have a new life now.

794
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,300
Her Ladyship must be

795
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,640
very pleased.

796
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,080
You know who the murderer is?

797
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,790
Aunt Wanzhi.

798
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,980
Are you...

799
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:53,960
It was Madam...

800
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,190
It was Madam that killed Master.

801
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,830
I dare not tell the police the truth.

802
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,290
I thought

803
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Madam wouldn't die if I did so.

804
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,000
But I know very well

805
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,550
it was she that killed your father.

806
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,450
I was going to keep it to myself for the rest of my life

807
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,360
until I die and meet Her Ladyship in another world.

808
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,200
Zhou Ze!

809
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,680
What's wrong?

810
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,520
Zhou Ze!

811
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,200
Zhou Ze! Wake up!

812
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:36,960
Don't scare me!

813
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,490
Go get the doctor!

814
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,450
Help!

815
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,150
-Zhou Ze. -Help!

816
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,090
Zhou Ze!

817
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,530
What's wrong?

818
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,440
Don't scare me.

819
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,980
Wake up!

820
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,200
Zhou Ze!

821
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,870
Zhou Ze!

822
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,470
So, the fingerprints on the bottle were really...

823
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,950
No.

824
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,070
My mom wouldn't kill anyone.

825
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,510
I believe she wouldn't.

826
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,740
What did you see on that day?

827
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,600
Or what were you doing at that time?

828
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,930
You think I'm lying?

829
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,770
I believe your loyalty to Her Ladyship.

830
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,250
And now,

831
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,520
lying is meaningless.

832
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,380
But if what you said is true,

833
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,840
her mother killed her father,

834
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,660
she should know

835
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,290
the poison should not be in the wine bottle,

836
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,370
but in the glass.

837
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,420
What do you mean?

838
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,380
You mean my mom knew who the murderer was,

839
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,770
but she didn't know where the poison was put.

840
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,670
So, she wiped off the fingerprints to protect that person.

841
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,320
It's just a speculation.

842
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,370
So, what you saw

843
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,620
is very important to us.

844
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,860
That day...

845
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,170
That morning,

846
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,840
I was looking for Miss An all the time.

847
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,310
An Qiuzi.

848
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,560
The day before that day,

849
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,330
Mr. Li invited Madam

850
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,120
to visit his lab.

851
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,360
In return,

852
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,620
Her Ladyship held a banquet at home the next afternoon.

853
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,090
So, I was busy in the kitchen all morning.

854
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,740
But later in the morning,

855
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,610
Madam was worried that Miss An would play a prank again

856
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,900
and upset Master,

857
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,780
so we looked for her everywhere.

858
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,870
Madam.

859
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,960
Wanzhi.

860
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,560
Have you seen An Qiuzi?

861
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,900
Didn't she get locked up by Master?

862
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,380
She's not in the room.

863
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,370
I'll go find her.

864
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,960
Miss.

865
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,300
Miss An.

866
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,950
Where did she go?

867
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,880
Miss An.

868
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,920
Miss An.

869
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,500
Miss An.

870
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,600
Miss An.

871
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
My dear,

872
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,260
don't run around.

873
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,640
-If your brother-in-law sees you here... -Will he really drive me away?

874
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,180
I don't think he has the guts.

875
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,530
Enough.

876
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,990
Your sister is upset.

877
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,870
Don't cause trouble for her.

878
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,710
Come with me.

879
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:18,720
No!

880
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,600
Come with me.

881
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,890
What a kid...

882
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,150
Let's go.

883
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,180
Go!

884
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,100
An Qiuzi said

885
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,100
Zhou Ze wouldn't really drive her away.

886
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,040
Miss An had no mother since childhood,

887
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,140
so she lacked discipline.

888
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,200
She only took Madam as her sister.

889
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,810
And it was not the first time for her

890
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,260
to fool Master.

891
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,620
When Master was in a good mood,

892
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,920
he would just let it go.

893
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:52,010
But when he was in a bad mood, he would threaten to send her away.
