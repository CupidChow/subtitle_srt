[Episode 23]

16
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,430
Jingxuan investigated my teacher's death with you,

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,380
but she didn't know the real murderer was right in front of her.

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,110
For the so-called Oracle,

19
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,509
you abandoned your family, murdered your friend,

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,759
and even killed Chairman Luo

21
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,720
who raised her up.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,060
Now she's in trouble because of you.

23
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,560
You don't deserve a daughter like her.

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,250
You're right.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,750
I don't deserve a daughter like her.

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,540
You went to Beijing to prepare for the assassination?

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,120
Yes.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,130
But not entirely.

29
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,210
In the Northeast Region under X's command,

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
the major work is to kill and eliminate dissidents.

31
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,280
I stay in Beijing

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,630
to find someone useful for the Oracle.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,390
After that,

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,079
someone will take over my job

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,360
and take them as their own use.

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,240
Like Yu Daren?

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,060
Luo Wensheng has always supported the Southern Government.

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,250
This is what the Japanese hate to see the most.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,670
And he has lived in Harbin for a long time,

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,700
and the power behind him is complicated.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,180
He won't allow the Harbin Chamber of Commerce he hosted

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,970
to be manipulated by the Japanese.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,940
So, they want Yu Daren to replace him.

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,320
Chairman Luo was murdered.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
The chairman of Fengtian Chamber of Commerce was killed.

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,050
Zhao Qiansun was killed.

47
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,160
Yu Daren committed suicide

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,720
and kidnapped Consul Kondo.

49
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,340
It's all X's doing?

50
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,440
Yes.

51
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,720
But some are also coincidences.

52
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,150
The power of the Oracle is far beyond your imagination.

53
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,100
It may be backed by the Heavenly Emperor.

54
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,640
They are now infiltrating the economy, public opinions and judiciary

55
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,560
of the Northeast Region in various ways.

56
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,680
Assassination is just one aspect.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,580
Ma Shiying's assassinating Xu Shiren

58
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,070
was X's plan.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,530
So, they won't allow Ma Shiying to be alive,

60
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,850
and killed him too.

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,210
By use of the Xu family's tragedy,

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,520
he could gather the victims into a carriage

63
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,470
and kill the enemies,

64
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,980
making the Oracle invisible.

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,570
If Bai Lu hadn't committed suicide,

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,500
the case wouldn't have been in doubt at all.

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,800
Bai Lu actually died because of you.

68
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,730
Every time a plan fails,

69
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,860
someone will die

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
as a sacrifice to it.

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,760
The sacrifices are highly-esteemed.

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,210
They are already quite loyal.

73
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,230
But X still doesn't trust them.

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,750
Xie Hua is also a man of the Oracle?

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,680
No.

76
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,790
X wants to get Xie Hua involved,

77
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,510
and killing is the best way to make it.

78
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,230
Unfortunately, you saw through Xie Hua's trick.

79
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,390
So, in order to protect his son,

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,650
he could only commit suicide.

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,330
Luo Wensheng's being murdered

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,740
was plotted by X.

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
But I'm not clear

84
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,590
about its details.

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,760
Because I'm not as particular as XX.

86
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,460
Otherwise,

87
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,230
Zhao Qiansun wouldn't have died so easily.

88
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,839
What if they don't want to be sacrificed?

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,540
It's not up to them.

90
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,770
Bai Lu

91
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,300
is indeed not innocent.

92
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,810
And she's determined to die.

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
What else can we do?

94
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,520
She died?

95
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,450
She died of poison shortly after getting off.

96
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,640
Before she died,

97
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,090
she turned herself in to the Fengtian Police.

98
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,650
Any hesitation

99
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,130
would lead to the whole carriage's being destroyed.

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,950
But she didn't have to do so.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,230
Anyway,

102
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,280
she just did so.

103
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,650
You...

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,170
And you.

105
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,560
Come with me.

106
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,130
You are right.

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,010
Yu Daren committed suicide.

108
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,090
Take me to the scene.

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,660
Too late.

110
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,630
Bao has asked someone to clean the scene.

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,810
and dispose of the dead body.

112
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,020
If you go now,

113
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,630
all you can see is a small casket.

114
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,950
Since the case of the East Express,

115
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,600
many murderers have died in my cases.

116
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,690
Don't feel guilty.

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,030
You didn't kill them.

118
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,040
It's the justice and truth you insist on

119
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,280
that brought them such ends.

120
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,730
Don't you think it's a little strange?

121
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,770
From Ma Shiying, my dad, Ms. Wei,

122
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,270
to teachers, Headmaster, the secretary,

123
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,180
Moly, the owner, the banker,

124
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,180
and nurses...

125
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,520
There's no connection among them at all.

126
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,380
Unless there really is an organization.

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,800
What organization could it be?

128
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,030
I'm not sure.

129
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,100
But I just have

130
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,540
a strange feeling.

131
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,450
Maybe there are more such cases

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,390
in the places we don't know.

133
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,520
The person X likes the most

134
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,210
is actually you.

135
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,350
But since you have different values,

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,590
he couldn't recruit you.

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,990
As your influence and ability grow stronger,

138
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,330
you will become a thorn in his eyes.

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,960
Even if he can't kill you,

140
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,080
he will drive you away.

141
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,240
What else does X know about me?

142
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,530
I've told you

143
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,450
what I know.

144
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,110
["No One Lives"]

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,460
Jingxuan.

146
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,460
Say goodbye to Uncle Xie and Uncle Du.

147
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,960
Don't call me uncle.

148
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,500
Just call me Boss Du or Du.

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,180
Although I'm your uncle's friend,

150
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,490
I'm much younger than him.

151
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,270
Don't call me uncle.

152
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,200
Just call me Du.

153
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,730
Don't call me uncle.

154
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,960
Don't call me uncle.

155
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,230
Do you know

156
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,340
why he didn't let you call him uncle?

157
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,090
Because he's your father.

158
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,220
Bai Zhi cried in front of the tomb.

159
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,580
She realized it too late.

160
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,810
He risked his life

161
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
to get her out of here alive.

162
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,770
Nine Character.

163
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,490
The tile is...

164
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
A useful tile is already held up...

165
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,130
How can you still

166
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,100
in the mood to play mahjong?

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,050
Why not?

168
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,920
You won't let us leave.

169
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,680
Leave?

170
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,050
The bridge for leaving this village is broken.

171
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,870
How can we leave?

172
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,860
What do you mean?

173
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,790
It's snowing heavily.

174
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,190
When it will stop is unknown.

175
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,090
We need to

176
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,350
find another way.

177
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,150
Otherwise, if it keeps snowing,

178
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,700
all of us will be frozen to death.

179
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,630
We would have left this morning.

180
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,640
But now,

181
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,270
we can't leave at all.

182
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,670
Nonsense.

183
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,470
Ding Meng.

184
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,750
No mood to play anymore...

185
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,680
Ding Meng,

186
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
how much food and water are there in this house?

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
We need to make a plan

188
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,290
to see how long the supply is sufficient for us to live here.

189
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,080
I had no time to go shopping.

190
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,530
There's not much left.

191
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,330
Where did you put the firewood?

192
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,070
The basement.

193
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,300
The basement...

194
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,570
Get someone to check it

195
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,330
and put out all fire in the fireplaces.

196
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,020
Let's all gather together.

197
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,930
Don't let the firewood run out.

198
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:20,770
Okay.

199
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,210
What matters most is that we can't panic.

200
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,700
Let's go to the kitchen.

201
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,160
Jingxuan,

202
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,780
you don't look well.

203
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,180
Go take a rest.

204
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,310
We have enough people.

205
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm fine.

206
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,210
I'm fine.

207
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,630
We're trapped.

208
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,270
What do you mean?

209
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,400
The suspension bridge is broken.

210
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,800
It's snowing heavily outside.

211
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,490
I don't know when it will be repaired.

212
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,440
I asked Liu

213
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,480
to check the firewood.

214
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,850
Jin Qiming put out all fire

215
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,120
in the house's fireplaces,

216
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,650
and asked everyone to stay together.

217
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,290
Zhou Mowan took other ladies

218
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,690
to the kitchen to count the amount of food and water left.

219
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,060
It's not sure

220
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,420
how long we can hold out.

221
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,350
I see.

222
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,290
What do you mean?

223
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,250
How did the suspension bridge break?

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,740
It was crushed by snow.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,550
Boss.

226
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,420
Here.

227
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,530
The interrogation is over?

228
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,570
Don't let anyone come near the study.

229
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,160
Is something bothering you?

230
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,600
There are the Oracle's men here.

231
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,240
What do you mean?

232
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,730
It seems

233
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,460
Zhou Mowan was right.

234
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,140
What did she say?

235
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,100
She said

236
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,100
you should stay out of the Japanese Consulate's business.

237
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,410
Lu did it himself.

238
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,430
Let him solve it himself.

239
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,730
Since they want to kill you,

240
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,810
I have to find a way to kill them first.

241
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,290
After we get out of here,

242
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,650
no matter whether a war will start

243
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,970
or what happens,

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,800
you shouldn't get involved anymore.

245
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,230
I'm gonna send you out to hide.

246
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,220
This Mr. X of the Oracle

247
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,420
asked Du Heng to send me a message.

248
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,240
Du Heng is also the Oracle's member?

249
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,980
No wonder he was to kill Shen Jianxian and Fang Jianqi.

250
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,400
What was the message?

251
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,490
X is to kill three more people here.

252
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,180
To kill three more people?

253
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,690
I must stop this from happening.

254
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,240
But he knows me very well.

255
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,830
Does Du Heng know who're to be killed?

256
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,250
They only have one-way contact.

257
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,560
Du Heng doesn't know either.

258
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,540
Who do you suspect?

259
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,590
Liu has been with me since young.

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,320
He's not the kind of capable person.

261
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,240
For Bao,

262
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,330
He'd like to do anything for whoever pays him.

263
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,830
But he only wants to get promoted and get rich.

264
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,660
I don't think he would take the risk.

265
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,650
No.

266
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,830
I have to hide Jingxuan and Aunt first.

267
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,230
Don't panic.

268
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

269
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,730
You suspect me?

270
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,730
If I suspected you,

271
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,630
I wouldn't tell you this.

272
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,800
Be careful.

273
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,810
Is there any water?

274
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,540
Bring me water!

275
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,730
Hurry up! Hurry up!

276
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,000
Put out the fire!

277
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,640
Hurry!

278
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,900
Put out the fire!

279
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,510
This way.

280
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:45,820
Is anyone there?

281
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,180
Help! Help!

282
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,780
They are all inside.

283
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,400
Rescue them first!

284
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,280
Boss.

285
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,480
Get out!

286
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,340
If you want to put out the fire,

287
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,130
you have to ensure your own safety first.

288
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
How did the fire start?

289
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,060
I don't know who boiled the water.

290
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,340
No one knew when it boiled away.

291
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,330
Luckily, we're all fine.

292
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,200
We don't use firewood,

293
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,150
but water gas.

294
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,860
It will be a disaster if it's not used carefully.

295
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,770
Except you,

296
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,910
who else is able to boil water here?

297
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,370
Where is Jingxuan?

298
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,070
Who saw her?

299
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,810
Jingxuan is not feeling well.

300
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,630
She went to rest.

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,450
Oh no.

302
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,280
This is a diversion?

303
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,850
Where can he go?

304
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,020
The roads outside

305
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,360
are blocked by snow.

306
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,380
It's so cold.

307
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,680
Besides, the suspension bridge is broken.

308
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
He'll die even if he goes out.

309
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,280
So, if three more people would die as Du Heng mentioned,

310
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,650
the first one is himself.

311
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,840
Three more people die?

312
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,890
Go find him.

313
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,300
We must find him as soon as possible.

314
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,000
Let's go, Bao.

315
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,900
I know what you want to ask.

316
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,980
I'll tell you later.

317
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,570
The current situation is very dangerous.

318
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,050
Gather everyone together.

319
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,430
Don't let anyone run around alone.

320
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,520
Keep an eye on them.

321
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,230
Where is my wine?

322
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,820
Tell me.

323
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,630
What does that mean?

324
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,310
Why?

325
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,220
Why three more people would get killed?

326
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,450
I don't know.

327
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,350
Will Du Heng still be the murderer?

328
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,690
I really don't know.

329
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,480
I know as much as you do.

330
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,660
Ms. Zhou.

331
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,550
I don't know either.

332
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,810
Anyway, let's listen to Situ.

333
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,450
He said we should stay here

334
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,160
and not go anywhere else.

335
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,440
As long as we gather together,

336
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,270
the murderer won't have a chance to do it.

337
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,480
When the snow stops,

338
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,730
the police can help us leave here.

339
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,560
Please, I beg you.

340
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,450
So many good things.

341
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,240
Nicotine?

342
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,350
Awesome.

343
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,350
You're the best.

344
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,790
Boss.

345
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,640
Over there!

346
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,070
Boss.

347
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,280
It's just over there.

348
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,200
Boss.

349
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,370
He's dead.

350
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,230
Who did this?

351
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,440
He was stripped and frozen to death.

352
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
I think he took it off himself.

353
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,300
He drank wine,

354
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,150
which accelerated the drop of his body temperature.

355
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,090
When the temperature drops rapidly,

356
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,610
people can feel hot instead.

357
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,340
Where is Jingxuan? Who saw her?

358
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,100
She's not feeling well.

359
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,120
She went to rest.

360
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,740
Don't let Jingxuan know

361
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,590
I'm her father,

362
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,670
nor anyone else should know

363
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,910
my relationship with Jingxuan.

364
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:14,970
I promise you.

365
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,800
Thank you.

366
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,339
When we go back,

367
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,500
tell them we didn't find him.

368
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,819
Don't tell anyone.

369
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,890
Why?

370
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,859
Listen to me.

371
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,550
Okay.

372
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,060
Bury him here.

373
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,690
Do you know

374
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
why he didn't let you call him uncle?

375
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,870
Because he's your father.

376
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,370
She has known it.

377
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,260
Shaochuan,

378
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,320
are you even keeping it from me?

379
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,610
We have the right to know

380
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,050
what's happening here.

381
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,070
Why three more people would die?

382
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,260
Have you found them?

383
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,810
Yes. Say something.

384
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,250
-Say something, what's happening? -What?

385
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,760
Tell us.

386
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,750
You didn't find him, did you?

387
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,850
-Right. -Three more people will be killed.

388
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,610
One by one.

389
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,690
I only have one mouth.

390
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,540
Mr. Luo,

391
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,730
Tell them.

392
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,090
They kept asking me just now.

393
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,180
I can't answer it.

394
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,930
Tell us.

395
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,040
Why three more people would die?

396
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,160
Du Heng is from the Oracle.

397
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,130
The Oracle does exist?

398
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,430
They want to kill three more people?

399
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,710
This is a challenge for me.

400
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,560
Three more people will die here.

401
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,410
So I must find him

402
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,660
and stop it from happening.

403
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,150
How is that possible

404
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,820
with so many eyes here?

405
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,890
The first one is already dead.

406
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,920
Du Heng?

407
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,010
Don't tell anyone about this.

408
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,170
At this time,

409
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,680
there's no need to cause extra panic.

410
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,080
So, in order to deal with you,

411
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,690
the Oracle would kill three more people?

412
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,110
He's taking people's lives as a joke.

413
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,980
Do you know who that person is?

414
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,150
I only know he knows me well.

415
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,080
And he's among us.

416
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,760
As for who he is...

417
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,570
So, the suspects are few in number.

418
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,250
I didn't suspect you.

419
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,340
Looks like you did.

420
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,460
Why was the kitchen on fire just now?

421
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,880
Just now?

422
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,770
You suspect...

423
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,970
Only with suspicion

424
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,240
can I rule out.

425
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,800
Mowan.

426
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,180
I still don't feel well.

427
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,380
I'm going upstairs.

428
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,460
Just go.

429
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,680
Jingxuan?

430
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,760
I knew it.

431
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,110
Impossible.

432
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,720
It couldn't be Jingxuan.

433
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,200
Why would Jingxuan do that?

434
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,730
He has nothing to do

435
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,660
with Du.

436
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,120
She's not a member of the Oracle.

437
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,120
-If you keep talking nonsense... -Luo Shaochuan, calm down.

438
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,600
Calm down!

439
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,510
How can I calm down?

440
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,680
What did she say?

441
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,250
She said Jingxuan served the Oracle

442
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,830
and wanted to kill you.

443
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,100
She didn't say anything.

444
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm sorry.

445
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,390
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,620
I let Du Heng go.

447
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,480
Why?

448
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,190
He's my dad.

449
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,250
How did you know?

450
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,530
Dong Cixin said

451
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,760
the book "No One Lives"

452
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,870
was written by Du.

453
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,520
There's an old judge whose surname is Lei in the book.

454
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,290
He's afraid of getting retaliated,

455
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,850
daring not to let anyone know he has a daughter.

456
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,080
He asks the girl

457
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,170
to call him Lei

458
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,580
instead of uncle.

459
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,660
Du Heng.

460
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,110
He never let me call him uncle,

461
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,310
but to call him Du.

462
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,580
When Mowan went to get food this afternoon,

463
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,530
I went with her.

464
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,130
Everyone,

465
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,130
we're not afraid of losing firewood.

466
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,370
Let's drink wine when it's cold.

467
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,390
It has the same effect.

468
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,390
I've had such a hard life before.

469
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,880
Mowan,

470
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,850
I still don't feel well.

471
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,940
I'm going upstairs.

472
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,890
Just go.

473
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,260
Who are you to me?

474
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,960
Why are you so nice to me?

475
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,530
I don't understand what you are talking about.

476
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,620
Don't call you Uncle Du.

477
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,960
Call you Du.

478
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,630
Why?

479
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,790
Why didn't you tell me from the beginning?

480
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,450
Why didn't you show up

481
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,240
for so many years?

482
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,350
Why did you lie to me?

483
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,300
Why?

484
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,130
Why?

485
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,570
Zou Jingxuan,

486
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,240
You don't have a father.

487
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,200
You only have a mother.

488
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,890
and an uncle who raised you up.

489
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,770
You and I

490
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,790
never have

491
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,960
any kinship.

492
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,930
You have nothing

493
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,740
related to a murderer like me.

494
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,050
What are you doing?

495
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,510
They are putting out the fire in the kitchen.

496
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,480
Go!

497
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,930
Silly girl.

498
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,690
If I leave,

499
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,230
they will know you let me go.

500
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,550
Don't worry about me.

501
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,970
How are you gonna handle it?

502
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,570
Leave me alone. Leave now.

503
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,770
For all these years,

504
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,690
I've been hoping to see him every day.

505
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,620
But he's the murderer.

506
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,820
I'm sorry.

507
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,350
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,080
Just get me arrested.

509
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,400
I'm sorry.

510
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,020
No one will blame you.

511
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,720
Anyone in your situation would do so.

512
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,280
With me here,

513
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,560
no one can hurt you.

514
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,210
This is your parents' love token

515
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,550
he left to you.

516
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,530
Where did you find this book?

517
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,460
It was on the sofa.

518
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,520
What's wrong?

519
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,320
Nothing.

520
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,230
You may go downstairs first.

521
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,090
Try not to act alone.

522
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,900
I've figured it out this time.

523
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,450
I used to be a jerk.

524
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,440
I was a jerk.

525
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,080
I mean it.

526
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,320
As long as you can forgive me,

527
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,120
you can scold me.

528
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,430
You can scold me however you want.

529
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,030
If you still don't feel better,

530
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,850
you can hit me.

531
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,640
I mean it.

532
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,640
I won't fight back.

533
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,660
Forgive me.

534
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,890
What's going on?

535
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,520
Dai Liming seems to have suddenly woken up to reality.

536
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,290
He said nothing else could be more important

537
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,390
in front of life and death.

538
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,160
He doesn't want to be alone.

539
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,820
So,

540
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,380
he was apologizing to Zheng Bai?

541
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,650
Dai Liming.

542
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,760
You're really disgusting.

543
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,720
Go home for dinner.

544
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,200
No one can be more disgusting than you.

545
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,490
I'm just trying to repent.

546
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,330
You know nothing!

547
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,370
If it's possible,

548
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,960
nothing can be better than that...

549
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,010
I mean it.

550
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,680
Forgive me.

551
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,930
Let's drink the wine.

552
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,640
Dai Liming.

553
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,000
I'll divorce you.

554
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,860
I'll give you half of the property.

555
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,010
I don't want the property.

556
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,090
Don't be angry.

557
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,150
Can you stop being like this?

558
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,720
It's better to get a good wife than being capable.

559
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,330
He did nothing but to cause trouble.

560
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,330
But he can still get half of his wife's assets.

561
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,880
I don't like what you said.

562
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,890
Couples are supposed to be united.

563
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,170
One is working hard outside,

564
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,450
while the other is managing housework at home.

565
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,960
How can it be said as doing nothing?

566
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,230
I'm talking about him.

567
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,740
Why are you so excited?

568
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,890
You're all with respect in Dori.

569
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,970
I knew you might not like wine.

570
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,940
Look.

571
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,280
Here's also coffee for you.

572
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,290
Have some coffee.

573
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,210
Fine, put it there.

574
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,050
I'll drink it later.

575
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,540
I'll put it here.

576
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,130
The person who let the murderer go is here.

577
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,210
What are you talking about?

578
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,090
Didn't you let Du Heng go?

579
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,340
I'm sorry.

580
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,690
You don't have to apologize to her.

581
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,920
Du Heng won't kill again.

582
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,410
Don't blame Jingxuan for everything.

583
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,640
The guy was already let go,

584
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,920
and it's not your turn to say it.

585
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,350
As a police officer,

586
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,330
how can you guarantee it?

587
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,060
For Du Heng...

588
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,530
Du Heng has pleaded guilty

589
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,340
and turned over a new leaf.

590
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,610
If he kills again,

591
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,370
I'll pay with my life for him.

592
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Of course.

593
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,050
Father-in-law.

594
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,720
You're really evil.

595
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,280
You said Jingxuan let the murderer go?

596
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,270
Where is the evidence?

597
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,570
When the kitchen was on fire,

598
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,450
Zou Jingxuan was the only one absent from the scene.

599
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,460
The way she let Du Heng go

600
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,630
was by blowing all of us up.

601
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,330
You care about this daughter of you,

602
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,730
but she doesn't recognize you as her mom at all.

603
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,000
It's always said that blood is thicker than water.

604
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,520
Look, it doesn't work even you raised her up.

605
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,390
You're so imaginative.

606
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,480
You must feel painful for not getting what you want, right?

607
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,100
In my opinion,

608
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,890
someone who secretly loved Du Heng

609
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,650
but failed to win his heart

610
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,170
let her go while we were putting out the fire,

611
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,080
and now slandering Jingxuan.

612
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,390
Forget it.

613
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,540
Why should I argue with you?

614
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,620
There's no murderer in my house anyway.

615
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm going to shut your mouth.

616
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,560
You said it was embarrassing to hit a woman...

617
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,210
-You said it was embarrassing to hit a woman, didn't you? -Shaochuan, forget it.

618
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,770
Shaochuan.

619
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,230
Don't stop me!

620
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,350
-Shaochuan, calm down. -Go away.

621
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,360
Don't touch me.

622
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,810
Move!

623
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,410
Calm down.

624
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,370
What are you doing?

625
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,310
You guys are being unfair.

626
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,410
Calm down, Shaochuan.

627
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,170
Pull him away.

628
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,750
Why didn't you say anything just now?

629
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,430
What do you want me to say?

630
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,310
Even you think Jingxuan is suspicious?

631
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,480
Dai Liming.

632
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,040
Dai Liming, what's wrong?

633
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,470
Wake up!

634
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:09,930
Excuse me.

635
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,410
Dai Liming!

636
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,300
Get out of the way!

637
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,560
Nicotine?

638
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,000
Nicotine again?

639
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,930
What did you find?

640
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,490
Impossible.

641
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,080
He promised me he wouldn't kill anyone again.

642
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,220
Impossible.

643
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,510
Impossible.

644
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,530
Impossible.

645
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,040
Jingxuan.

646
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:20,890
Let's go.

647
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,670
It's obvious that she let the murderer go.

648
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,800
Who killed Dai Liming?

649
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,270
-Shaochuan. -Go away.

650
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,010
Shaochuan.

651
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,560
Don't stop me!

652
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,970
Shaochuan!

653
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,490
Move!

654
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,340
Mr. Luo, calm down.

655
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,370
-Get out of the way. -Shaochuan!

656
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,020
Stop! Stop!

657
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,140
I don't know.

658
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,490
I really don't know.

659
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,300
Don't look at me. It's none of my business.

660
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,520
Where was the wine originally put?

661
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,080
Jingxuan.

662
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,350
What did you mean just now?

663
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,760
Are you hiding something from us?

664
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:36,940
She is...

665
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,360
Who did it?

666
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,600
No one can kill under your nose.

667
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,190
It takes time to solve the case.

668
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,520
How long?

669
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,570
After we are all killed?

670
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:54,970
Luo Shaochuan,

671
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,260
why don't you find the murderer yourself?

672
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,400
Jingxuan and I were slandered like that just now,

673
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,080
but you just kept silent.

674
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,240
Fine.

675
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,760
I'll find it myself.

676
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,350
I wanted to break up with you long ago.

677
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,080
Let's go.

678
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,380
Go!

679
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:14,930
Liu.

680
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,820
What are you waiting for?

681
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,550
Come here.

682
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:20,740
Boss.

683
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,820
I found it when I was looking for firewood.

684
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,130
It's warm in winter and cool in summer here.

685
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,080
Even a stove is not needed here.

686
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,920
How is it?

687
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,410
Isn't it great to hide here?

688
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,960
I see.

689
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:30,950
Find me a stick

690
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,060
to block the door.

691
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,330
Okay.

692
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,920
After I go out,

693
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,810
you hold the stick to the door.

694
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,440
Don't open the door for anyone,

695
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,160
including Situ Yan and Bao.

696
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,070
Got it?

697
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:54,620
But...

698
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,430
What about Liu?

699
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,710
You have to leave someone to protect us.

700
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,710
Don't trust anyone

701
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,970
except me.

702
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,830
What do you mean?

703
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,050
Are you locking us up here?

704
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,580
They are all suspicious.

705
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,550
Can't you see?

706
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,960
We've been tricked.

707
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,260
What do you mean?

708
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,639
There is no Oracle at all.

709
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,550
All of this

710
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,460
was plotted by Situ Yan.

711
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,650
Are you crazy?

712
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,929
If you lock us up here,

713
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,940
we will have nothing to eat and drink.

714
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,690
We'll freeze or starve to death

715
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,110
before someone comes to kill us.

716
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,370
It's better to be upstairs with food and drink there.

717
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,060
What Oracle?

718
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,230
What are you talking about?

719
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,300
The Oracle

720
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,010
is a Japanese spy organization.

721
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,840
Du Heng is a member of it.

722
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,560
To kill Shen Jianxian and Fang Jianqi was his mission.

723
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,230
Shortly after he told Situ Yan three more people would die,

724
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,300
he was released.

725
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,170
Don't you think it's wired?

726
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,190
I let him go.

727
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,120
Are you crazy?

728
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,170
You know everything?

729
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,480
What are you two talking about?

730
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,860
How did you know?

731
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,380
Situ Yan plotted all of them.

732
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,130
Xie Hua killed my father.

733
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,740
Du Heng killed Shen Jianxian and Fang Jianqi.

734
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,020
All the people who established the Lawyer Association died.

735
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,890
It's quite easy for him

736
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,150
to let Du Heng go by taking advantage of you.

737
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,400
Not only that,

738
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,950
he also wants to get me involved.

739
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,800
You don't believe me?

740
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,280
I'll show you the ticket.

741
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,850
The research of Nicotine's toxicology...

742
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,870
The person who can secretly

743
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,710
put the newspaper in my clothes

744
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,130
could only

745
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,260
be Situ Yan.

746
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,180
Dr. Fang's friend gave him a lot of foreign wine.

747
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,700
But he doesn't like it at all.

748
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,230
He said the wine has very strong smell,

749
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:53,930
So, he asked me to put them

750
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,330
in the closet of the kitchen.

751
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,570
He usually drinks wine.

752
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,650
He asked me to use the rest of the wine

753
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,780
for cooking.

754
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,680
It's true.

755
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,290
In his apartment,

756
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,250
there's really nicotine.

757
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,300
Why is this here?

758
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,220
Nicotine.

759
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,970
When was it put in?

760
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,630
It really wasn't me.

761
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,960
It should be after the fire was put out.

762
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,070
But,

763
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,330
Mr. Situ solved Uncle's case.

764
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,560
And he cleared your suspicion.

765
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,220
It's all him.

766
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,050
No one knows better

767
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,230
about these cases.

768
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,170
And that's why

769
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,410
he would help us reverse the case.

770
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,320
What's in it for him to kill us?

771
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,160
Defeating the Luo family

772
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,140
can be greatest benefit to him.

773
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,380
I don't know how many more persons Situ Yan will kill.

774
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,240
But if the number doesn't reach three,

775
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,330
no one can get out.

776
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,120
But you must live.

777
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm not afraid of death.

778
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm afraid of it.

779
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,360
If you Lock us up here,

780
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,650
in less than two days,

781
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,440
we two will be the dead ones.

782
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,730
If I die,

783
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,800
can you get out?

784
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,510
Cut the crap.

785
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,020
How can I live if you die?

786
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,410
Then I'll be the next to die.

787
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,000
Everyone will be alive.

788
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,760
I have to see you in your wedding dress.

789
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,030
We didn't find Luo Shaochuan and the ones with him.

790
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,280
Have no idea where they hide.

791
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,460
What's wrong with you two?

792
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,820
We two?

793
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,380
He and Jingxuan were slandered,

794
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,160
but you didn't say a word.

795
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,360
Everything Dong Cixin said is true.

796
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,310
How could I help him?

797
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,820
But Du Heng is dead.

798
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,540
How can a dead person kill someone?

799
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,460
Jingxuan was slandered like that.

800
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,550
Why don't you tell the truth?

801
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,210
If I did,

802
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,620
Jingxuan would really be the murderer.

803
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,730
But...

804
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,620
Don't think too much.

805
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,470
No one can hurt you.

806
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,520
unless

807
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,340
I'm dead.

808
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,560
If I die,

809
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,330
Situ Yan has to obey the rules of the game

810
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,280
only three more people die.

811
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,080
So, you will survive.

812
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,000
Two have died.

813
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,960
I mean if I die,

814
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,560
I'll make someone die with me.

815
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,260
In this way,

816
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,140
the total number will reach three.

817
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,580
Who else died except Dai Liming?

818
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,660
Nobody.

819
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,290
They're all here.

820
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,640
How did he die?

821
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,270
How did he die?

822
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,130
Situ Yan killed him by taking advantage of you.

823
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,030
I killed him.

824
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,810
I killed him.

825
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,120
Jingxuan, this has nothing to do with you.

826
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,410
Kill me.

827
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,720
-Kill me. -Silly girl.

828
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,290
Jingxuan.

829
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,010
It has nothing to do with you.

830
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,880
If you kill me...

831
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,540
Jingxuan.

832
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,780
I want to reunite with them.

833
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,530
Kill me.

834
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,570
Silly girl.

835
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,780
What are you talking about?

836
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,750
Mom is here.

837
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,490
I'm here.

838
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,940
I'm here.

839
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,370
I'm here.

840
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,460
What about Dai Liming?

841
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,760
How did Dai Liming die?

842
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,960
That wine

843
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,960
was given by Luo Shaochuan.

844
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,500
Luo Shaochuan gave the wine to Dai Liming?

845
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,680
I don't think so.

846
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,940
It was at that time?

847
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,610
I still don't understand.

848
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,790
Why would Luo Shaochuan

849
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,370
kill Dai Liming?

850
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,340
X actually did nothing.

851
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,840
He just gave a knife

852
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,800
to the people in the house.

853
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,750
If it's needed,

854
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,440
the knife will become a weapon.

855
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,470
He's a master at playing with people's hearts.

856
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,700
I thought I was good at reading people's hearts.

857
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,180
But compared to him,

858
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,990
I'm quite dwarfed.

859
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,480
Don't belittle yourself.

860
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,310
You will find him.

861
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,880
Do you remember

862
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,560
who took the book "No One Lives"

863
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,400
from the study to the living room?

864
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,640
I remember Jin Qiming took it downstairs.

865
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,080
Then they went out

866
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,540
and left you alone in the study.

867
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,600
That book should still be there at that time.

868
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,130
It should still be there.

869
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,840
Let's not talk about this.

870
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,880
Zou Jingxuan doesn't drink wine.

871
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,960
Then why did she prepare a bottle of wine for Du Heng?

872
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,530
Wine?

873
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,760
Without that bottle of wine,

874
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,250
he could have held on a little longer.

875
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,720
Wine...

876
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,370
Everyone,

877
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,660
we're not afraid of losing firewood.

878
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,850
Let's drink wine when it's cold.

879
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,820
It has the same effect.

880
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,730
I've had such a hard life before.

881
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,310
Maybe it was Bai Shanshan.

882
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,810
Bai Shanshan said drinking could help drive cold.

883
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,740
Jingxuan probably gave that bottle of wine to Du Heng

884
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,480
after hearing her words.

885
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,210
Wait.

886
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,020
Let me sort it out.

887
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,330
Jingxuan gave the wine to Du Heng.

888
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,510
Luo Shaochuan passed the wine to Dai Liming.

889
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:24,830
You mean

890
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,150
Bai Shanshan is the culprit?

891
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,970
I don't know.

892
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,220
I really don't know.
