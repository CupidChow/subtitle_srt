1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
In order to marry into a rich family,

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,520
a little risk is worth it.

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
She's not a good woman.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,160
Think about it.

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,600
She and brother were childhood sweethearts.

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
When he was poor,

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
why didn't she want to marry him?

9
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
She insisted on marrying someone

10
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,880
who drunk excessively and beat his wife.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,080
What for?

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,720
Money, right?

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,200
Who would have thought

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,800
the Luo family would be rich in only two years?

15
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Brother

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,160
became the richest man.

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
What a coincidence that

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
she and brother

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,120
reunited in Harbin.

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,160
What's more,

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,040
two years later,

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,080
her husband died.

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,240
The case has been closed by the police station.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,960
Don't create trouble here.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Director Xie.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,160
You're forgetful.

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
If I remembered correctly,

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,400
because of this,

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,320
you were promoted from a sergeant to the deputy director.

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
It seems that

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,240
you should be the director.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,440
Can't you see

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
what's behind it?

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,200
Mom.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,480
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,400
Chairman Luo lost a cheque.

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,320
They are all the same.

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,320
If they didn't want to get some benefits from us,

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,200
they wouldn't have been so fawning, right?

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,520
You shouldn't be tricked by a few dresses

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
and some lipsticks from Wei Minxi

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,079
into thinking she's a good person.

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,480
Don't

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
get involved.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Let's go.

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,600
Wei Minxi murdered her husband.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,560
The story about Wei Minxi's murder

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,240
came from herself.

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,440
She's not married to Chairman Luo,

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
but she became the hostess of this family.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
She's Chairman Luo's sister-in-law.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,520
The second son of the Luo family

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,079
went out for procurement.

54
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,640
He drowned

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,560
and left such a widow.

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,760
When the Luo family was suffering,

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
her efforts were not lacking.

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,960
Later, the Luo family became rich,

59
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,200
so she wanted the family property divided and live apart.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,520
Chairman Luo saw that

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,240
Jingxuan is pure and kind,

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,520
so he wanted Luo Shaochuan to marry her and settle down.

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,640
Who would have known?

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,600
This matter

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
became the reason for her

66
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,520
to ask for money.

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,120
Do you know

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
who is the last person

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,040
who wants Wei Minxi to marry into the Luo family?

70
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,240
It must be Bai Shanshan.

71
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,600
She said Wei Minxi killed someone.

72
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,840
I didn't believe it at first.

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,920
But...

74
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,640
But what?

75
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,200
In Wei Minxi's letter,

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,760
she admitted it.

77
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,400
She said she committed murder.

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Therefore,

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,880
she was blackmailed.

80
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,600
Where is the letter?

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Not found.

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,920
Not found?

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,240
Maybe

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,760
it was burned by Chairman Luo.

85
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,960
It might have been taken away by the murderer.

86
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,880
I searched all over the Luo's house,

87
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,800
but I couldn't find this letter.

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,880
Do you remember what it says?

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,240
Yes.

90
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,959
All this time,

91
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,680
I've always wanted to say sorry to you.

92
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,280
I don't know

93
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,680
how to tell you.

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
All these years,

95
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,080
this has caused me

96
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,160
a lot of trouble.

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,159
I was afraid that someone would take everything away.

98
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm even more afraid that you'll see me as a murderer.

99
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,200
But now,

100
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,360
I have to say something.

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,720
I don't want to be blackmailed

102
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,159
and live in fear.

103
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,960
I want to tell you

104
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,240
who this person is.

105
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,480
But I'm afraid

106
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,920
you would be hurt.

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
But

108
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
she didn't mention

109
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,200
the person who blackmailed her.

110
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,640
Wei Minxi was afraid that Chairman Luo would be hurt.

111
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,680
For someone who was blackmailed,

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,920
the biggest damage

113
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,880
was to be afraid of being exposed.

114
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,920
And for Chairman Luo,

115
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,080
the biggest damage

116
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,080
was falling in love with a murderer.

117
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
What is Wei Minxi so afraid of that

118
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,680
she kept the murderer's name

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
from Chairman Luo.

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,720
I thought about it too.

121
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,680
The only solution I can think of

122
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,480
is to find the blackmailer.

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,360
This person must be Chairman Luo's  true love.

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,080
So,

125
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,520
Wei Minxi couldn’t say it.

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,480
Now, Luo Shaochuan is wanted in the city.

127
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,800
I think the police

128
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,159
must have got a better clue.

129
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
By the way, around 8:50,

130
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
I came out from the study.

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
I thought Master was calling me.

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
I met Fang Hong.

133
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,560
A servant of the Luo family

134
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,840
was walking in the living room.

135
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,200
Shortly after walking out of the gate,

136
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
I bumped into

137
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
another bold young man.

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
It should've been

139
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,960
around 9.

140
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,960
Are you blind?

142
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,520
That night, Luo Shaochuan never came home.

143
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,920
Wei Minxi's letter

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,480
was not clear.

145
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
I'm afraid that

146
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,040
he had done something wrong.

147
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,280
So I went to the bar to find him.

148
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,080
Director Xie.

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,640
Where is Shaochuan?

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,720
Mr. Luo?

151
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,600
He left?

152
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,520
When did he leave?

153
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,200
Around 9.

154
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,840
Not far off.

155
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
Maybe he drank too much.

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,040
He did drink a lot today.

157
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,159
Do you know where he went?

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,560
Maybe he went home.

159
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,240
That's what he said.

160
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,000
The bartender said

161
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,560
Luo Shaochuan left.

162
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,840
I hurried back to the Luo family

163
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
and ran into Fang Hong.

164
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
Is Luo Shaochuan back?

165
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,600
Mr. Luo?

166
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,960
Is he back?

167
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,200
Everyone in the room

168
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,840
didn't hear the sound from the study.

169
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,600
There's no sign of a fight

170
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,440
at the crime scene.

171
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,240
So I excluded

172
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,120
outsiders.

173
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Chairman Luo.

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,880
Master.

175
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Chairman Luo.

176
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,840
-Master. -Chairman Luo.

177
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,880
Call for a doctor.

178
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,160
Okay.

179
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Have you checked the murder weapon?

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,640
It's one of the Luo's collections.

181
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,920
It was originally placed on the silver table in the living room.

182
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,880
There were fingerprint on the weapon.

183
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,400
It can't match with other people in the house.

184
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
So we think

185
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
the fingerprint could be Luo Shaochuan's.

186
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
Have you compared the fingerprint with the family members?

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
We have compared it

188
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,760
with everyone except Luo Shaochuan.

189
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,560
I mean everyone,

190
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,280
including Chairman Luo.

191
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,800
Are you kidding me?

192
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,040
How could he commit suicide

193
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,320
in such a posture?

194
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,240
We'll see.

195
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,360
Director Xie.

196
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,240
Thank you.

197
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,960
Still not back yet?

198
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm starving.

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Madam Shen.

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
Officer Bao.

201
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,840
Madam Shen.

202
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,480
Director Xie asked me to pick up some documents.

203
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,360
You were not home.

204
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,240
I went to buy groceries. It's cold.

205
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes.

206
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Let me do it.

207
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,960
Thank you.

208
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,280
What about Situ Yan?

209
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm here to get his information.

210
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
He is in the Luo's house.

211
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,200
Why did that troublesome Bai Shanshan

212
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,240
of the Luo family want the will read now?

213
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Mr. Situ left in a hurry

214
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,080
and forgot to bring it.

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,040
Why are you in such a hurry?

216
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,360
Didn’t you say Mr. Luo hasn’t come back yet?

217
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,120
Speaking of...

218
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,400
This bastard,

219
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,720
how dare he kill his father!

220
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,120
This morning,

221
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,280
our men went to catch him.

222
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,360
It's said that he assaulted the police and ran away.

223
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,120
Now,

224
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,520
the whole city is looking for him.

225
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
What? Luo Shaochuan killed his father?

226
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,160
We didn't expect that either.

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,480
Come on.

228
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,600
Take care.

229
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,040
Thank you.

230
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Officer Bao.

231
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,920
Have a seat.

232
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,960
What does Situ Yan need?

233
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
I'll get it for you.

234
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
No, no, no.

235
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,120
No, no, no.

236
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,280
I know where it is.

237
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,320
I'll go get it.

238
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,640
I'll make you some tea.

239
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
What kinds of tea do you have?

240
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,120
Don't bother.

241
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,640
Not at all.

242
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,080
These are the new tea this year.

243
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
I heard

244
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Situ Yan knows Luo Shaochuan.

245
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,560
When you take a walk

246
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,960
or buy groceries,

247
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,160
if you see him,

248
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,600
you have to tell us.

249
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,360
This kid,

250
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
he even dared to kill his own father.

251
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,280
Officer Bao.

252
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,440
Have you found it?

253
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,960
Yes.

254
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
Look, this is it.

255
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,680
Let me walk you out.

256
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,400
Didn't you say

257
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,080
you will make tea?

258
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,880
New tea?

259
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,840
Didn't you say don't bother?

260
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
You are really...

261
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,240
Should I...

262
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,720
No.

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm going back.

264
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,960
See you.

265
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,680
See you.

266
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,360
Okay.

267
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,320
Wei Minxi was killed after sending a letter saying she was blackmailed.

268
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,760
Chairman Luo was killed after receiving the letter.

269
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,880
I know what you want to say.

270
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,480
If murders were committed by the same person,

271
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,320
it can't be Luo Shaochuan.

272
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,840
I don't think

273
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,160
these two murders were related.

274
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,560
According to the clues left at the scene,

275
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,600
there are two possibilities for Wei Minxi's death.

276
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,280
One: she was robbed.

277
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,080
The murderer was unsatisfied

278
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,720
and threatened Wei Minxi to give more money.

279
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,240
Eventually, he lost control and strangled her.

280
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
Another possibility is that

281
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
someone hired a murderer.

282
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,600
Yes.

283
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,600
Someone doesn't want Wei Minxi to marry into the Luo family.

284
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,280
Anyway, the result is

285
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,040
Chairman Luo was in a bad mood,

286
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,880
and it triggered the conflict with his son.

287
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
There was also blackmailing.

288
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
Chairman Luo suspected that it was his son.

289
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,480
Yesterday, Luo Shaochuan drank.

290
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
They couldn't talk calmly.

291
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,640
In the end,

292
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,880
Luo Shaochuan lost control

293
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,440
and killed his father.

294
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,800
Where is the letter?

295
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,720
Could it be that

296
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,360
it was burnt by Chairman Luo?

297
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,040
No.

298
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,760
That's Wei Minxi's last letter.

299
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,840
I arrived at the crime scene last night

300
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
around 10.

301
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
The window was open.

302
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,480
There were footprints near the window.

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
The footprints were very messy.

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,600
This morning,

305
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
we went to Luo Shaochuan's hotel to arrest him.

306
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
During the arrest,

307
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,120
he jumped off the window and ran away.

308
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,320
At the scene, we collected his military boots

309
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,360
After comparison, the result matched the footprints.

310
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,120
When was the curtains opened?

311
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,520
When the police arrived at the scene

312
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,280
and found the corpse,

313
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,240
was the window open?

314
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,840
Yes.

315
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,120
Take your measurements.

316
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,720
Be careful.

317
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,040
Stop dawdling.

318
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,200
I was looking for you.

319
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,840
Just watch the scene.

320
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Don't break our stuff.

321
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,720
Leave if you're done.

322
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,320
This way.

323
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,760
Okay.

324
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,760
Please measure this for me.

325
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,960
Chairman Luo just died,

326
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
and you want to tear down the house?

327
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,000
What are you talking about?

328
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,920
Brother was killed.

329
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
If I don't reinforce the window,

330
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,680
isn't it like inviting bad guys to harm me?

331
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,800
Nonsense.

332
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
Cheer up!

333
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,600
Don't act like you've lost your mind.

334
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
This crazy woman,

335
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
don't let me find out that

336
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,640
she has something to do with the case.

337
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,040
Luo Shaochuan has been a spoiled child.

338
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,320
He spends money like water.

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,440
In order to get money,

340
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,320
he had constant conflict with his dad.

341
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
He was so angry that

342
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,600
he arranged an engagement

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,720
with Zou Jingxuan two years ago

344
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,360
to make him settle down.

345
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
He

346
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,000
went out to join the army in Fengtian.

347
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,920
in the past two years,

348
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,040
he didn't ask for money.

349
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,520
Men at this age

350
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,280
love to play.

351
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,000
He loves to go to brothels.

352
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,960
If he gets addicted to opium and gambling,

353
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,560
he will be ruined.

354
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,680
As a parent,

355
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,840
would he not

356
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,320
pay for his child?

357
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,040
This yard is really big.

358
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
It must be 200 meters from here to the study.

359
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,160
Have you investigated Luo Shaochuan’s transactions?

360
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
He’s not someone

361
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,240
who can save up money.

362
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,720
That means his account is fine.

363
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
Eat slowly.

364
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't choke.

365
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,680
Aunt Shen,

366
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,840
your cooking is so delicious.

367
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
You're hungry.

368
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
These are just some home-cooked dishes.

369
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,400
I was afraid you wouldn't be used to it.

370
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,480
The home-cooked dishes

371
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,640
are the best food in the world.

372
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
I haven't had these for a long time.

373
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,920
Actually, I really hope

374
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,560
when I wake up,

375
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
this will turn out to be a nightmare,

376
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
and my dad will still be alive.

377
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,560
He can beat me or scold me.

378
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,400
Aunt Shen,

379
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
from now on,

380
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,400
you can treat Situ Yan and me

381
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,000
as your sons.

382
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,360
We'll be good to you.

383
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,520
Fried pork in scoop

384
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,200
is my favorite.

385
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,960
It's sweet and sour.

386
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,000
Just like what my mom made.

387
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,640
Fried pork in scoop is sweet and sour everywhere.

388
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,920
You've been busy all day.

389
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,160
You must be hungry.

390
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,880
Thank you, Madam.

391
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,280
Have a seat.

392
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,160
Have you found any clues?

393
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,040
I have some ideas.

394
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,280
It's...

395
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,680
It's so troublesome.

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,680
Is it?

397
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,200
Personal habit.

398
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Mr. Situ,

399
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,720
do you still claim you don't know where Shaochuan is?

400
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,600
You followed me?

401
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,760
You didn't kill Uncle.

402
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,440
Why are you hiding here

403
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,680
instead of going to Uncle Xie?

404
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,160
You suspect me too?

405
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,680
If you're innocent,

406
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,680
why don't you dare to meet the police?

407
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,119
Why don’t you talk to Uncle Xie?

408
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,839
Shaochuan,

409
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,880
have some tea.

410
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,520
Jingxuan.

411
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,040
Xie Hua is different from Situ.

412
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,520
Situ can investigate this case however he wants.

413
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,440
But Xie Hua can't.

414
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,640
He's the deputy director.

415
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,960
His actions

416
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,920
represents the police's attitude.

417
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,680
Will he interrogate or not?

418
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,520
Will torture be used or not?

419
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,880
So,

420
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
before the truth comes out,

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,040
the less people know

422
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,640
the better.

423
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,760
Understand?

424
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,720
There are too many doubts.

425
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,080
And the police had a preconception that

426
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,680
Luo Shaochuan is the murderer.

427
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,560
If we hand him over now,

428
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,120
he won't receive a fair trial.

429
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,840
I didn't suspect you.

430
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,520
I don't believe you'll kill anyone either.

431
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,960
But why didn't you tell me?

432
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,320
If I tell you,

433
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,960
it's like telling Bai Shanshan.

434
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,640
If I tell her,

435
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720
isn't it like telling the world?

436
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,840
Besides, I've asked Situ Yan to find you.

437
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,920
But look.

438
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,960
You already know.

439
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,920
But you think I have something to do with it.

440
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,080
No.

441
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,040
I didn't.

442
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
I've checked the scene.

443
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,040
The murderer entered your study through the window

444
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,880
and left footprints on the window.

445
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,760
The footprints match with

446
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,880
the military boots you left in the hotel.

447
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,240
You had an argument with your father yesterday afternoon,

448
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,880
and someone saw you going home.

449
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,280
These are very unfavorable evidence against you.

450
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,960
I really don't remember anything.

451
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,960
Don't you think it's strange?

452
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
What?

453
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
All the evidence points to you.

454
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,440
What do you mean?

455
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,120
The fingerprint will be found later.

456
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,800
Tell me about Wei Minxi first.

457
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,680
Wei Minxi?

458
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,520
I heard you don't want her to marry into your family.

459
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,160
There's nothing between me and Wei Minxi.

460
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
It's not that I don't want her to marry into my family.

461
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm angry with my dad.

462
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,480
Marriage is a big deal.

463
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,600
He didn't even tell me.

464
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,360
Actually, I wish Wei Minxi could marry into my family.

465
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,480
About me joining the army,

466
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,760
if she hadn't helped me,

467
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
my dad would have broken my leg

468
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,640
and locked me in the house.

469
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,400
Do you know about

470
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,720
Wei Minxi's ex-husband's death?

471
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,000
Did you hear Bai Shanshan’s nonsense?

472
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,000
She doesn’t want any woman

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,800
to enter our house.

474
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,600
After Wei Minxi's ex-husband died,

475
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,560
she spread rumors that

476
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,680
Wei Minxi murdered her husband.

477
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,400
So you must not listen to her.

478
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
But Uncle Xie has found out that

479
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,240
she was blackmailed.

480
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,880
What else could it be?

481
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't believe it anyway.

482
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,720
After your father proposed,

483
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,120
she confessed the murder of her own husband.

484
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
But strangely,

485
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,480
she didn't tell him who the blackmailer was.

486
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,760
She told my dad she killed someone?

487
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
But she didn't tell him who blackmailed her?

488
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,360
Does that make sense?

489
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,200
So the police also think

490
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,480
the blackmailer is your family.

491
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,520
The reason she didn't say it was to protect that person.

492
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,480
And coincidentally,

493
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,680
in the past two years,

494
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,480
you never asked your dad for money.

495
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,080
So I blackmailed her?

496
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Why didn't I ask my dad for money?

497
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,680
Because in his heart,

498
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,240
money is more important than me.

499
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,480
I don't want

500
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,880
to be bullied again

501
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,480
because of money.

502
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,240
I have the money my mom left for me,

503
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
and some odds and ends.

504
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,760
I also bought some property.

505
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,680
So I don't lack money at all.

506
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,840
Besides,

507
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,520
someone is watching us,

508
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,920
one who's always hoping to split up the family.

509
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,000
Just because of the inheritance,

510
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,320
when my dad was alive,

511
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,200
Bai Shanshan fought with him

512
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,360
several times because of this.

513
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:00,960
By the way,

514
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,720
when my dad died,

515
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
what was Bai Shanshan doing?

516
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,080
My mom is not like that.

517
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,000
And Uncle Xie has investigated yesterday.

518
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,200
We are innocent.

519
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,280
What’s your relationship with the Luo family?

520
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
Shaochuan is my fiancé.

521
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,160
My aunt brought me up.

522
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
So we call each other mother and daughter.

523
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,880
When was the last time

524
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,840
you saw Chairman Luo?

525
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,640
At night,

526
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,120
around 9:40 p.m.

527
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
I heard my Uncle was in a bad mood,

528
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,120
so I wanted to say good night earlier.

529
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,920
When I came out,

530
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
I ran into Fang Hong.

531
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,840
He came to deliver tea.

532
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,480
But Uncle didn't want to be disturbed.

533
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,520
So I told him not to go in.

534
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,120
Then I went back to the bedroom and chatted with my mom

535
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,440
until you came.

536
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,920
Name?

537
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,720
Are you asking me about my name?

538
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,600
Don't you know who I am?

539
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,520
Are you suspecting that

540
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I killed someone?

541
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,240
Listen carefully.

542
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,880
I was in the bedroom

543
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
the whole night.

544
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I didn't go anywhere.

545
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
To be honest,

546
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,320
even if Luo Wensheng was still alive,

547
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,800
he wouldn't dare to talk to me like this.

548
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,480
My name is Wen Yi.

549
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm the butler of the Luo family

550
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,520
who is in charge of everything in the family.

551
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,960
Because Master invited you to dinner tonight,

552
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,000
so I was busy in the kitchen all night.

553
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,760
After dinner,

554
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,600
I cleaned up until 9:30,

555
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,360
and went back to my room to calculate the salaries this week

556
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,440
until 9:45.

557
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,480
I went to the kitchen to pay everyone

558
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,680
until 10:05.

559
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,000
Fang Hong came to inform us that

560
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,280
Master was killed.

561
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,520
We were together all night.

562
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,840
I've never left the kitchen.

563
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,960
My name is Fang Hong.

564
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,840
I'm Master's personal servant.

565
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,320
He's in charge of serving Master.

566
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,120
At night,

567
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,600
I did nothing.

568
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,240
I was busy here and there.

569
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,800
I also picked up my salary,

570
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
and sent tea to Master.

571
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,080
But I met Miss Jingxuan

572
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
walking out of his room.

573
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,960
She told me to go back.

574
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
What time was it?

575
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,960
9:45.

576
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,240
It should be

577
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
when I went back to the kitchen.

578
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,640
Wen Yi came to pay us.

579
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,080
So

580
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,520
I'm the only one who doesn't have an alibi.

581
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,880
You just said

582
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,600
when my dad was killed,

583
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
they heard nothing, and it was quiet.

584
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,480
That can't be me.

585
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,320
When we meet,

586
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,120
it can't be so quiet.

587
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,520
Do you remember anything else that night?

588
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,400
No matter how vague it is.

589
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,680
Anything else?

590
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,200
Where is my ring?

591
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,800
I've been wearing a ring these days,

592
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,760
and it's very tight.

593
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,440
It won't fall off easily.

594
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,800
Madam,

595
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
where did you go?

596
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm not feeling well,

597
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,960
so I went out for a walk.

598
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,240
I didn't notice the time.

599
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,160
How many times have I told you?

600
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,800
You're a girl from a wealthy and influential family.

601
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,760
If you wander outside at this hour,

602
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,600
people will gossip if they see you.

603
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,560
I'll be careful next time.

604
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,480
Everyone in this house makes me worry.

605
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,640
Mom.

606
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,840
What's wrong?

607
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,000
Nothing.

608
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
I have to tell you something.

609
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,800
Don't tell anyone about

610
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,240
what happened last night.

611
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,600
Be careful.

612
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,320
Do you mean that

613
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,600
someone was with Mr. Luo?

614
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,880
Do you remember who it was?

615
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,040
About 10 o'clock,

616
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,240
someone

617
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,560
over there.

618
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,600
He

619
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,960
was dressed in rags.

620
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,760
He searched over Mr. Luo for a long time.

621
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Maybe

622
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,480
he was a thief.

623
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,680
What are you doing?

624
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,640
You mean

625
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,120
he came back

626
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
at 10 last night?

627
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,080
Yes.

628
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,120
How long will it take to walk from here to the Luo's house?

629
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,960
From here to the Luo's house?

630
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,160
About 20 minutes.

631
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,160
Chairman Luo was still alive at 9:45.

632
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,720
That means you are not the murderer.

633
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,600
I have an idea.

634
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,400
What is it?

635
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,200
Wei Minxi was blackmailed.

636
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,080
Before she died, she sent a letter

637
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,920
and decided to tell the truth.

638
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,600
But after your father received the letter,

639
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,120
he found out that

640
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,320
she didn't tell him who the blackmailer was.

641
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,040
Soon, he was also killed too.

642
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,160
You're not the one who blackmailed him.

643
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
Who else

644
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,240
would Wei Minxi cover up for?

645
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,840
She doesn't have any family.

646
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,160
Could it be someone from my family?

647
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,120
The weapon was a dagger in your house.

648
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,760
All the evidence pointed to you.

649
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,680
This is a premeditated murder.

650
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,640
The letter that explained the blackmail

651
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,280
disappeared right after the murder.

652
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,280
The murderer

653
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
is most likely the blackmailer.

654
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,720
Then why...

655
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,240
Then why didn't he kill Wei Minxi

656
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,080
and eliminate the future trouble?

657
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,320
He killed her.

658
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,440
But it's too late.

659
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,800
The letter has been sent out.

660
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,840
Anyway,

661
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,880
this person should be familiar with your family.

662
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,240
Bai Shanshan and Wen

663
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,520
can't be the murderer.

664
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,120
One is timid,

665
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,640
and the other wants to be my stepmother.

666
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,800
All suspects have alibis.

667
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
There must be something wrong.

668
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,400
And that cheque...

669
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,120
What cheque?

670
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,000
We checked your account.

671
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,480
We found that a cheque is missing.

672
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,360
Mr. Luo lost a cheque.

673
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,360
They are all the same.

674
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,320
If they didn't want to get some benefits from us,

675
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,240
they wouldn't have been so fawning, right?

676
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,600
You shouldn't be tricked by a few dresses

677
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,480
and some lipsticks from Wei Minxi

678
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,880
into thinking she's a good person.

679
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,520
Don't

680
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,880
get involved.

681
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,440
Let's go.

682
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,640
That's right.

683
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,920
The murderer is after money.

684
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,640
It's reasonable to take the cheque.

685
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,800
Ask Xie to go to the bank.

686
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,440
Whoever gets the money will be the murderer.

687
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,880
Let me analyze it for you again.

688
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,200
Bai Shanshan

689
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,800
always asks my dad for money.

690
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,680
If he didn't give the money soon enough

691
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,400
or much enough,

692
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,640
she would spread rumors that our family abused her.

693
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,800
If she had a motive,

694
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,760
it can only be money.

695
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,760
Jingxuan?

696
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,560
It can't be her.

697
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,200
I watched her grow up.

698
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,120
As for Wen?

699
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,720
Wen might know.

700
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,840
Everything about my dad

701
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,200
has to go through her.

702
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,360
Before my dad married Aunt Wei,

703
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,400
everyone in Harbin thought he was marrying Wen.

704
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
Is it possible that

705
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
she hates him because of love?

706
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,600
Because she is the most likely

707
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,520
to bribe our servants.

708
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Our servants only listens to her.

709
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,160
They never listened to

710
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,040
Bai Shanshan, the so-called hostess.

711
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,920
You mean

712
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,520
everyone in your family

713
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,640
has an evil intention

714
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,720
to kill your father?

715
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,640
Everyone has an alibi.

716
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,720
I can only think of it that way.

717
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,600
Get up.

718
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,200
Let me do it.

719
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,200
Slowly.

720
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,520
In the future,

721
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,400
I'll find someone to serve you.

722
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,360
No need. I'm used to

723
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,120
these things.

724
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,600
Situ helped me a lot.

725
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,960
I have to return the favor.

726
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,080
It's easy to return the favor.

727
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,400
Wash the dishes after eating.

728
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,440
How can Mr. Luo

729
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,840
wash the dishes?

730
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,360
You should

731
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,080
look like you're living under someone else's roof.

732
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,040
Director Xie asked me to pick you up.

733
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,000
Hurry up and go to the Luo's house again.

734
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,480
The fingerprint comparison result is out.

735
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,560
You're smart.

736
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,680
You guessed right.

737
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,520
How did you know

738
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
the fingerprint belonged to Chairman Luo?

739
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,440
I suspected that the murderer

740
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
wanted to frame Luo Shaochuan.

741
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,080
Why?

742
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,440
After the incident,

743
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,560
Luo Shaochuan escaped.

744
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,000
The police compared everyone's fingerprint,

745
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,320
they will think

746
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,920
the fingerprint on the weapon

747
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,080
belongs to Luo Shaochuan.

748
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,480
Last night,

749
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,080
I went to the restaurant

750
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,040
to check Luo Shaochuan’s alibi.

751
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,640
He was sent back to the hotel at 10.

752
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,800
And it takes 20 minutes

753
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
to walk here from the restaurant.

754
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,080
If that's the case,

755
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,640
everyone in this room

756
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,760
has an alibi.

757
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,360
Go find

758
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,040
the stranger I met on the street

759
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,240
that night.

760
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,520
Yes.

761
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
You suspect that the murderer colluded

762
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,560
and hired a murderer to kill?

763
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,560
Uncle Xie.

764
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,520
Have you found anything new?

765
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,200
I want to know in detail

766
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,160
what you were doing that night.

767
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,880
How detailed?

768
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,920
Reproduce the scene.

769
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,920
Miss Jingxuan.

770
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,360
Uncle is in a bad mood.

771
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,480
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

772
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,080
You may leave.

773
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,680
Okay.

774
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,680
After that,

775
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,920
I went back to my bedroom.

776
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,880
That's how it was.

777
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,800
I said good night to Uncle.

778
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,080
On my way out, I met Fang Hong.

779
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,400
It was 9:45.

780
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,400
When you entered the room,

781
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,120
were the curtains closed or open?

782
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,240
I don't remember.

783
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:24,960
Closed.

784
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,360
I mean,

785
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,800
the curtains were closed

786
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,680
when I first arrived.

787
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,440
What's the difference in this room

788
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,840
between then and now?

789
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,520
The chair.

790
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,320
The chair.

791
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Call for a doctor.

792
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,600
Okay.

793
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,600
When I first came in,

794
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,840
the chair was placed aslant.

795
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,160
The second time I came in,

796
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
the chair was straightened.

797
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,240
At that time,

798
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,760
there were many people in the house,

799
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,840
the butler,

800
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,920
Madam,

801
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,840
Miss,

802
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,080
and some servants.

803
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,840
I thought someone might have bumped into the chair at that time.

804
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,200
Apart from that,

805
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,280
there seems to be no difference.

806
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,840
The chair.

807
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,000
Yes.

808
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,640
Someone moved the chair.

809
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,960
The chair was supposed to be straightened.

810
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,520
It was like this when I went out.

811
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,880
When I came back,

812
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,800
the chair was left aslant.

813
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
I think someone has been here.

814
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,160
I guess so too.

815
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Who asked you?

816
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,440
What about when you went in and said "good night"?

817
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,280
What?

818
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,920
The chair.

819
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,560
I don't remember.

820
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,120
Have you moved this chair?

821
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,280
It's just a chair.

822
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,480
It's not a big deal.

823
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,360
What does this

824
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,840
prove?

825
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,160
Can't you focus

826
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,840
on something useful?

827
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,440
Stop!

828
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You can't even figure this out.

829
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
Why are you drinking tea?

830
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,320
Was Master really murdered

831
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,400
after 9:45?

832
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,920
Miss Zou saw Chairman Luo

833
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,480
at 9:45.

834
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,880
I think

835
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,120
it shouldn't be wrong.

836
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,480
I don't think Mr. Luo did it.

837
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,520
Why?

838
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,720
I... I hope he didn't do it.

839
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,880
On the night of the murder, did you move that chair

840
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,840
after you entered the room?

841
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,640
Do you remember where it was?

842
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,960
You should get back to work.

843
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,120
If you have any questions,

844
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,760
feel free to ask me.

845
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,240
Mr. Situ,

846
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,600
you are Shaochuan's friend.

847
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,280
You won’t let him be wronged, right?

848
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,960
There’s nothing I can do.

849
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Unless...

850
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,400
Unless what?

851
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,960
Unless Chairman Luo

852
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,159
was not killed after 9:45.

853
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,480
If Uncle

854
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,120
was killed before that,

855
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,679
Shaochuan is no longer a suspect, right?

856
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,840
You are the last person who saw your Uncle.

857
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
9:45,

858
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,120
you said it.

859
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,360
Could it be...

860
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:21,960
No.

861
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,800
It's not what you think.

862
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,239
Last night,

863
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,880
you didn't say good night to Chairman Luo,

864
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,440
right?

865
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,719
Actually, I've never seen him.

866
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,639
I see.

867
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,239
Bai Shanshan asked you to say this.

868
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,400
She was afraid Wensheng would find out that

869
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,560
she was the one who blackmailed Wei Minxi.

870
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,719
So,

871
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,800
over shoes, over boots.

872
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
You murdered Chairman Luo and tried to frame Mr. Luo.

873
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,400
If you succeed,

874
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,280
the Luo family will be hers.

875
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,600
If you fail,

876
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
you will marry Luo Shaochuan,

877
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,480
the Luo family will still be still yours.

878
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,200
You've thought it through.

879
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,160
No.

880
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,400
I didn't kill anyone.

881
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,120
Neither did my mom.

882
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,440
I lied.

883
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,000
I was not the last one who saw my Uncle.

884
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,360
But we didn't kill him.

885
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,360
What are you two doing?

886
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,120
You failed to frame Shaochuan,

887
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
now

888
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,040
you want to frame us.

889
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,200
Listen.

890
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
No way.

891
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,920
We didn't kill anyone.

892
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,520
I'll say it again.

893
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,240
That night,

894
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,680
we were in the bedroom.

895
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
If you have evidence,

896
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,720
come and arrest us now.

897
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,520
Jingxuan.

898
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,280
Let's go.

899
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,800
Before things are investigated clearly,

900
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,640
no one is allowed to leave.

901
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
Who do you think you are?

902
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,720
Back then,

903
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,000
you became the director

904
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,800
because of the Luo family.

905
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,480
How dare you yell at me now?

906
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,000
Listen.

907
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,960
Be polite to me.

908
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,560
Otherwise,

909
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,320
I can get you up then,

910
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,000
I can also pull you down now.

911
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

912
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,320
Nonsense?

913
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
To be honest,

914
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,520
every penny we spend

915
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,120
is recorded by Wen Yi.

916
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,240
Shall we

917
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,280
check them one by one?

918
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,440
Don't be evasive.

919
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,960
Zou Jingxuan is too timid to kill.

920
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I think you have the courage.

921
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,760
Wen Yi,

922
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,560
bring the ledger.

923
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,560
Mom!

924
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Let go of me!

925
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,520
You're a coward,

926
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,320
that's why people bully you.

927
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,040
You are such a coward,

928
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
so they dare to control you.

929
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,120
Let's go.

930
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,080
Director Xie.

931
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,920
Let me do it.

932
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,080
They are not the murderers.

933
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,880
Fine.

934
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,600
You ask.

935
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,840
I don't want to say a word to this crazy woman.

936
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,600
I know you're not the murderer.

937
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,720
Otherwise,

938
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,040
you wouldn't take the risk to tell me

939
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,880
you didn’t see Chairman Luo

940
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,000
at 9:45 last night.

941
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,520
I promise

942
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,920
if this has nothing to do with the murder,

943
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,920
I won't tell the police

944
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200
or anyone in the house.

945
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,120
After all,

946
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,320
you don't want the servants

947
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,360
to gossip about this, right?

948
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,840
I didn't kill anyone.

949
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
I wouldn’t frame Shaochuan either.

950
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
I stole Uncle’s cheque book.

951
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,360
At that time,

952
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,520
I wanted to return it

953
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,240
and apologize to Uncle.

954
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,400
I hesitated at the door for a long time.

955
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,080
I dared not go in.

956
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,160
Miss Jingxuan.

957
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,920
Later, Fang Hong came.

958
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,920
I was afraid that

959
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,680
he might ask why I was wandering here.

960
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,960
So I lied and said

961
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,680
I came to say good night to Uncle.

962
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,520
I was afraid he would find out that I didn't go in,

963
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,840
so I said

964
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,240
Uncle didn't want to be disturbed.

965
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,560
In the end,

966
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,560
Uncle...

967
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,160
Miss Zou.

968
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,560
You can't satisfy everyone by

969
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,400
meekly submitting to oppression or maltreatment.

970
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,880
You didn't steal the cheque book.

971
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,440
What are you doing?

972
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,200
Are you bullying my daughter?

973
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,000
What do you mean?

974
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,960
That means you understand.

975
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,800
That's right.

976
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,960
I understand.

977
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,040
I took the cheque, so what?

978
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Let me tell you.

979
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,200
Our Master

980
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,920
and Luo Wensheng

981
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,560
fought together for the family.

982
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,320
What's wrong with me using his money?

983
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,040
Look at him.

984
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,920
He's the richest man in Harbin,

985
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,800
but he's so stingy with his family.

986
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,440
Let me put it this way.

987
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,320
I have my share.

988
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,800
I have the right to spend it.

989
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Unlike some servants.

990
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,480
Let me be frank,

991
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,600
Wen Yi

992
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,160
looks honest,

993
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,320
and she dresses poorly all day.

994
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,480
Who is she showing it to?

995
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,040
In the blink of an eye,

996
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,240
who knows what she's planning

997
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,920
with a bunch of sneaky servants?

998
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,680
Mom,

999
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,320
Wen Yi is in charge of the servants.

1000
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,880
It's natural to get close to them.

1001
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,400
Be smarter.

1002
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,440
You still have to manage the Luo family.

1003
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,280
I’m so worried.

1004
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,480
I went to the theater with Mrs. Zhang that day.

1005
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,960
I saw Fang Hong coming out

1006
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,520
from the gold shop.

1007
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,120
Even he has money to buy gold.

1008
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,240
Wen Yi is in charge of the ledger.

1009
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,200
If she tampered with it, who would have known?

1010
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,000
When Shaochuan comes back,

1011
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,040
I have to tell him

1012
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,160
to let that woman hand over the ledger.

1013
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,080
Did Uncle

1014
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,000
sent Fang Hong to do something?

1015
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,280
When did your Uncle

1016
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,680
ever give Fang Hong a good attitude?

1017
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,800
Sent him to do something?

1018
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,560
Look at his sneaky eyes.

1019
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:44,920
No.

1020
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,440
When Shaochuan comes back,

1021
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,400
I’ll tell him

1022
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,840
to fire him too.

1023
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,120
When did Fang Hong come to your house?

1024
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,080
About two years ago.

1025
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,520
Ask Wen Yi about this.

1026
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,440
How would I know?

1027
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,920
I'm not in charge of everything.

1028
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,600
Who is the hostess of this house?

1029
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,280
Have the police checked Fang Hong's account?

1030
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,520
Fang Hong.

1031
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,800
I thought Master was calling me.

1032
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,200
I heard Uncle was in a bad mood,

1033
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,080
so I wanted to say good night earlier.

1034
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,880
When I came out,

1035
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,240
I ran into Fang Hong.

1036
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,880
He came to deliver tea.

1037
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,840
But Uncle didn't want to be disturbed.

1038
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,640
So I told him not to go in.

1039
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,760
Guards!

1040
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,600
Yes.

1041
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,440
Your Lordship.

1042
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,320
I'm innocent!

1043
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,440
This is honest money.

1044
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:46,880
Honest?

1045
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
Tell me about it.

1046
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,200
I...

1047
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,800
What are you doing in front of the study?

1048
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,600
Eavesdropping?

1049
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,120
No.

1050
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,080
At 9:30,

1051
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
I heard Master talking to someone in the study.

1052
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,360
We had a guest.

1053
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,040
I need to make tea.

1054
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,440
When I finished making tea,

1055
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,880
I went to Master.

1056
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,240
Then I met Miss Jingxuan.

1057
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,480
She told me not to disturb Master.

1058
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,280
There was a visitor at 9:30?

1059
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1060
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,280
I was about to tell you,

1061
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,400
but you told me to shut up.

1062
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,920
Tell me now.

1063
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,640
Who was the visitor?

1064
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
I don't know.

1065
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,440
He didn't take the front door,

1066
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,880
but it should be a man.

1067
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,640
They were too quiet.

1068
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,240
I didn't hear them clearly.

1069
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,480
He didn't take the front door?

1070
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,080
You can say whatever you want.

1071
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,160
I don't think he's lying.

1072
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,240
When I was on the way to my room,

1073
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,480
it was around 9:30.

1074
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,040
When I went up the stairs,

1075
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,320
I heard Master saying

1076
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,880
he came more frequently

1077
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,080
for money.

1078
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,680
Luo Shaochuan?

1079
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,120
No.

1080
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,320
Can you tell

1081
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
who it was from the voice?

1082
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,920
They spoke very quietly.

1083
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,840
I only heard this clearly.

1084
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,960
But in the past two years,

1085
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,040
Mr. Luo didn't asked Master for money.

1086
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,800
He wouldn't say that to Mr. Luo.

1087
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,720
I'll take it as the truth.

1088
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,800
How can you explain about

1089
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,640
the money?

1090
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,560
My mom is sick.

1091
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,560
Master lent me the money.

1092
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,960
Does Wen Yi know?

1093
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,480
Is that so?

1094
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,480
Yes.

1095
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,400
Did you find other valuable things?

1096
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,000
No.

1097
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,560
So,

1098
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,600
Chairman Luo was killed after 9:30.
