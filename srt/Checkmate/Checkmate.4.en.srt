1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,920
Nine stabs.

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,120
One,

4
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,200
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

5
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,560
You happen to be nine people as well.

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,120
But your trial is illegal.

7
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,280
You know that.

8
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
So you forged an alibi.

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,720
You even wanted to drag me in.

10
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
If things had happened as you expected,

11
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,560
the first carriage would have been empty,

12
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,720
and the train wouldn't have stopped.

13
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,440
Then last night,

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,320
the train would have arrived at Fengtian Station.

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,920
Though the train may be late,

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,079
we'll arrive in Fengtian by this morning.

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Some of you would have got off.

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
The rest would have

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,840
kept the testimony

20
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,840
that the killer is in uniform.

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
The plan is impeccable.

22
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,040
No one will suspect you.

23
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,840
But the situation has changed.

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,120
You also realized that.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,480
So some threw away the cigarette pipe.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
Some threw away the pearls,

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,000
and someone wore red cheongsam

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,160
to attract my attention.

29
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,480
You just want to make this mess worse

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,960
so that no one can see the truth.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,960
But the truth is the truth.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,680
I said

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
your trial is not legal.

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,280
Because the law

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,680
must be supreme.

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
Because if it is violated,

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,640
everyone,

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,040
every disadvantaged person,

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
can't be protected.

40
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,800
Mr. Situ,

41
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
the train commander just got an express road notice.

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,840
Fengtian's police have blocked the station.

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,800
Once the train gets in,

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
they will arrest the criminal.

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,280
Mr. Situ.

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,040
Justice

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
doesn't belong to Ma Shiying.

48
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,920
And what you said

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,720
has no evidence.

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,839
Impossible coincidences are evidence in law.

51
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,440
Do you want me to tell you some cases?

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,160
I learned law too.

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,760
Of course I know what you mean.

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,760
But

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,000
the whole thing

56
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,440
is not an impossible coincidence.

57
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Or

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
there is no coincidence.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,920
All people related to Xu family's tragedy

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
were placed on this train.

61
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,200
It's not a coincidence.

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,360
I arranged it.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,680
The ticket of Room 1.

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,440
I bought the tickets

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,640
of all rooms.

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
Everyone

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,520
was invited

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,200
to this train by me.

69
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
I want everyone to see

70
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
I've avenged

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,520
for Mrs. Xu.

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Actually,

73
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,880
Mr. Situ,

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,480
I'm very grateful to you.

75
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
For Xu Shiren's case,

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,760
I witnessed the whole court trial.

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,160
According to the distance

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,280
between the murderer and the victim,

79
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,760
the murderer's single arm is about 0.75 meters long.

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,320
And the murderer is about 1.8 meters tall.

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,800
Among all the people here,

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,480
only the defendant has the same shape.

83
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,320
Do you have

84
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,720
anything else to say?

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
Mr. Situ,

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,640
you tried your best

87
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,040
but still failed to convict him.

88
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,280
I don't deserve to study law.

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,159
Do you deserve to be Chinese?

90
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,760
Do you deserve it?

91
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,360
How dare you tie me up?

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,640
Let go of me.

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,080
If the court can't uphold justice,

94
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
someone else should set the rules.

95
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,240
So,

96
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,320
I'm going to execute him,

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,320
representing the nine people in the train.

98
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,880
From the moment I got in the train,

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,240
I've been using Ma Shiying's lechery to make an appointment

100
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,320
to spend the night in his room.

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,200
I took care of Liao Yun

102
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,400
so that she could give me an alibi.

103
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,520
And I broke my room's door

104
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
myself.

105
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,159
As long as I lift it and close it,

106
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,600
there will be no sound.

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
After I came out of Liao Yun's room,

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,240
I went to the dining car,

109
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,240
changed the uniform I prepared in advance,

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
and went to Ma Shiying's room.

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,680
Luckily,

112
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,840
there were sleeping pills in the room.

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,480
After I cheated him to take it,

114
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,520
I made a big noise with him on purpose

115
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,520
so as to

116
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,000
wake you and Qi Hong up.

117
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,560
After that,

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,120
I hung the lock of the door,

119
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
opened the window,

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,960
and left through the connected door.

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,880
Qi Hong saw me.

122
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,280
But she thought I was a man.

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,400
She called Liu Zijie immediately.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,720
I took the chance to sneak out.

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,320
I wanted to go back to my room,

126
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,960
but I ran into Shi Chunshan by accident.

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
Your Highness.

128
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,360
The quilt is here.

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,400
Come in.

130
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,240
We've had two bottles.

131
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,880
Really?

132
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
So soon?

133
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
I had to go to her room

134
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,200
and took off the uniform.

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,320
And then

136
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
I changed into cheongsam

137
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,720
and walked around the passage.

138
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,200
Thus,

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,200
I bumped into your door on purpose.

140
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,760
No.

141
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,680
It's not like that.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,640
The one in cheongsam...

143
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
Was me.

144
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,560
That was me.

145
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,680
Mr. Situ Yan,

146
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,240
I agree with you.

147
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,760
The law is fair.

148
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,440
Murder

149
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,080
is a capital crime.

150
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
Bai Lu! Bai Lu!

151
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you remember the carter's story?

152
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
I told him.

153
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,800
I told him

154
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,000
there was no man in the house.

155
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,160
Only Mrs. Xu and a child were in the house.

156
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,760
I killed her.

157
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,200
She treated me like her own daughter.

158
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,200
All these years,

159
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,400
I couldn't get over it.

160
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
The only thing that keeps me alive

161
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,480
is that I haven't taken revenge.

162
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,880
It has nothing to do with you.

163
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
The murder weapon is in my room.

164
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,200
My fingerprints are on it.

165
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,720
And there is a bloodstained clothes in the room.

166
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,840
I'm the murderer.

167
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
It's not like that.

168
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,120
It's not like that.

169
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
It's not like that.

170
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
It's not like that. Don't talk nonsense.

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
It's not like that.

172
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,280
It's not like that.

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,080
It's not like that.

174
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,320
It's not like that.

175
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
It's not like that.

176
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,480
Good work, Captain.

177
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
Where's Ma Shiying?

178
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,640
Room 2.

179
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,080
Where is the murderer?

180
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
The murderer...

181
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,040
Got off.

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
Got off?

183
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,600
Before dawn,

184
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,640
the train was parked at Jinzhou Station.

185
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,280
The culprit got on the bus in train conductor's uniform.

186
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,360
The victim's secretary

187
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,440
Wan Jixiang

188
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
and this traveler Zong Yan saw him.

189
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,160
Then, he opened Ma Shiying's door

190
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,960
with a master key.

191
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,680
Because the deceased

192
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
used to take sleeping pills before sleeping.

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,440
So he was killed in Room 2

194
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,160
without struggling.

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,080
Then,

196
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,560
he locked the door

197
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,760
and entered Miss Qi Hong's room, Room 3,

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,680
through the connected door.

199
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
While she was sleeping,

200
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,400
he escaped.

201
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
And he got off the train

202
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,080
before the train started again.

203
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,680
Which station?

204
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,080
Jinzhou Station.

205
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,400
What does the murderer look like?

206
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,680
I can help you with the portrait of the murderer.

207
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,720
I can be the witness.

208
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
Where is the victim's family?

209
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
Well, he is my boss.

210
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
Get off together.

211
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

212
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,400
When you get to Harbin,

213
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,080
I'll buy you a drink.

214
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
We're at Fengtian Station.

215
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,000
Passengers getting off,

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
please take your luggage.

217
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,080
Thank you.

218
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,840
God will bless you.

219
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,280
Thank you.

220
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,040
Thank you.

221
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,240
You don't have to thank me.

222
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,800
I just did the right thing

223
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,520
to me.

224
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,720
I hope you won't continue to live in shackles.

225
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,680
Watch out.

226
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
Thank you, Mr. Situ.

227
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,320
If you need anything,

228
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,840
come to the consulate anytime.

229
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,520
Is this choice

230
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,520
really right?

231
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,000
Here.

232
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,080
This is the best wine I've collected.

233
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,480
Please have a taste.

234
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,000
Thank you.

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,320
I can't drink.

236
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Mr. Situ,

237
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,400
please enjoy.

238
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,200
Just call me Situ Yan.

239
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Please enjoy.

240
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,960
Can I call you Situ?

241
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
Thank you for the meal.

242
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,760
In Harbin,

243
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,920
if you need me,

244
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,760
just let me know.

245
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,160
Thank you.

246
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,680
Okay. Thank you.

247
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,480
Madam.

248
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,880
Where's master?

249
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,120
What's wrong?

250
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,040
My name is Xie Hua.

251
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,160
I'm a friend of Mr. Shen and

252
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,120
the Deputy Director of Harbin Police Station.

253
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
Hello, Director Xie.

254
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,760
What happened?

255
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,600
Let's talk inside.

256
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,840
Situ,

257
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll go upstairs and take a rest.

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,560
You talk with Director Xie first.

259
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,079
Okay.

260
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,800
Sorry.

261
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,040
Have a seat.

262
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Director Xie.

263
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,680
What happened to my master?

264
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,840
It's an old illness.

265
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
He has heart disease,

266
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,960
and he suddenly had a seizure.

267
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,960
It was too late

268
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,080
to send him to the hospital.

269
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,320
When did it happen?

270
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
Yesterday.

271
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,240
We went to the banquet together last night.

272
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,320
The banquet was not over yet.

273
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,600
He suddenly felt uncomfortable and...

274
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,560
Before you came,

275
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,920
Mr. Shen told me a lot about you.

276
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,760
I thought you would be

277
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,640
his good helper.

278
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
No one knew this would happen.

279
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,160
It's good that you're here now.

280
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
You can help take care of the family

281
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,400
and persuade your madam to

282
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,320
leave the sadness behind.

283
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
Master treated me like his son.

284
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
I'll take good care of madam.

285
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,520
Thank you.

286
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,360
President Luo.

287
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,560
This is Situ Yan, my beloved disciple.

288
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,920
He just came from Beijing.

289
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,480
This is Luo Wensheng,

290
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,080
President of Harbin Chamber of Commerce.

291
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
He's also a friend of your master for many years.

292
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,280
Hello.

293
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,680
Madam.

294
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:26,800
Thank you.

295
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,360
I've heard

296
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,760
about Ma Shiying.

297
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Although things are complicated,

298
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,520
it ended well.

299
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
This matter has not been reported yet.

300
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,160
I didn't expect Mr. Luo can know everything

301
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,400
without going out.

302
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,760
This case is related to my son,

303
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,800
who's a police.

304
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,200
Luo Shaochuan is your son?

305
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,440
Wensheng.

306
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,680
Let's go in first.

307
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,440
This way, please.

308
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,960
Take care.

309
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,960
Do you know Shaochuan?

310
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

311
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,760
Do you know

312
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,920
when he will come back?

313
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,760
My condolences.

314
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,760
Thank you.

315
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,200
My condolences.

316
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,320
Thank you.

317
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,520
We're leaving now.

318
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,160
Okay.

319
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,040
Jingxuan,

320
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,200
say goodbye to Uncle Xie and Uncle Du.

321
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Don't call me uncle.

322
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,240
Just call me Mr. Du or Du.

323
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm not that old.

324
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,520
Wensheng.

325
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,400
Jingxuan.

326
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,360
Go back first.

327
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,120
Okay.

328
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Auntie Wei, I'm leaving.

329
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,440
About that,

330
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,240
let's talk about it at home tonight, okay?

331
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,640
Wensheng.

332
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,360
It's not a big deal.

333
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

334
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,880
Sure.

335
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
The tailor I hired from Petersburg

336
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,600
will arrive tomorrow.

337
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,560
I'll pick you up in the morning

338
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,320
to measure your size.

339
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,080
You should also choose the fabric for the wedding dress.

340
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,840
What's wrong?

341
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,440
Are you angry?

342
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,240
No.

343
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,520
No.

344
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,640
I just thought of Mr. Shen.

345
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,840
In a blink of an eye,

346
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,400
things just happened.

347
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,120
Don't think too much.

348
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,600
We still have a long way to go.

349
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,480
I'll ask the driver to send you back.

350
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,320
No need.

351
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,840
I need to buy something.

352
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,760
Let the driver send you back.

353
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,720
I'm not a kid anymore.

354
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,480
Don't worry.

355
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,320
What do you want?

356
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
Go to hell!

357
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,360
Shut up!

358
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,560
Situ.

359
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,640
When will master be buried?

360
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,080
The tomb is still under repair.

361
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,720
Maybe in a few days.

362
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,440
By then,

363
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,760
I want to bury him and Siqi together.

364
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,320
After I die...

365
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,080
Madam,

366
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,400
you are still young.

367
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,720
When you reach my age,

368
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,040
you'll know

369
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,680
death is a topic that can't be avoided.

370
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,960
All these years,

371
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,040
I've sent Siqi away.

372
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,600
Now,

373
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,280
I've sent your teacher away.

374
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,200
The father and son

375
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,440
reunited.

376
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,960
But they leave me alone

377
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,840
in this world.

378
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,080
Madam.

379
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,080
I will serve you

380
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,280
like Senior Siqi.

381
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,920
You are so young.

382
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,520
I can't always be a burden to you.

383
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,320
All right.

384
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,600
Let's not talk about this.

385
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm going out.

386
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,320
Eat by yourself.

387
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,320
Xie.

388
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,520
Xie.

389
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,280
According to the analysis of the crime scene,

390
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,200
the murderer must have fled hither and thither,

391
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
and committed robbery and murder.

392
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,560
We believe

393
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,280
the murderer will sell the jewelry he stole

394
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,920
as soon as possible.

395
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
We've set up a trap.

396
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,400
We will catch the murderer.

397
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,760
Why is there no trace of

398
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,120
breaking the doors or windows?

399
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,000
Maybe she was careless

400
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,720
and let the murderer in by mistake.

401
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
Or she might have been tailed.

402
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,040
We must catch the murderer.

403
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,160
I'll cut him into pieces.

404
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,600
Situ.

405
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,920
Madam.

406
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,080
You're still up so late?

407
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,680
Tomorrow,

408
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,960
I'll treat some relatives of your master to dinner.

409
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,680
I guess you don't like

410
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
occasions like that.

411
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,960
You may just cook

412
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,320
at home.

413
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,480
I'll take care of myself.

414
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,680
Madam,

415
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,600
you've been working too hard these days.

416
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,240
Rest early.

417
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
You too.

418
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
Sweet-Bean Sauce Steak.

419
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,280
Fried Bean Sauce Pasta.

420
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,520
What are these?

421
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,440
Hello, sir.

422
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,400
How many of you?

423
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,720
One.

424
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,440
Okay.

425
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,680
Please wait here.

426
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Hello, sir.

427
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,400
Our restaurant is full today.

428
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,320
What would you like to eat?

429
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,480
I'll order for you first.

430
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,440
I saw

431
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,000
Sweet-Bean Sauce Steak

432
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,600
and Fried Bean Sauce Pasta on your signboard.

433
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,160
Yes.

434
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,480
The boss recommends the two new dishes.

435
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,520
Would you like to try?

436
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,200
Interesting.

437
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,240
So do you serve Chinese or western food?

438
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Can you cook western food in that way?

439
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,440
Why not?

440
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,760
This is the characteristic of my Jasmine Restaurant.

441
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,440
You can't eat it anywhere else.

442
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,600
Come on.

443
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,640
It's all because you're not good at western food.

444
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
That's why it's like this,

445
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,800
serving neither Chinese food nor western food.

446
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,840
Cut the crap.

447
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,360
Just tell me how it tastes.

448
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,720
You're lucky.

449
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,080
That means good.

450
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,320
If you say so,

451
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,480
I must serve one more mashed potato

452
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,200
on your steak.

453
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,080
You should try it too.

454
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,400
Okay.

455
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,080
Fried Bean Sauce Pasta, please.

456
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,280
Okay.

457
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,280
Sir,

458
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,680
do you mind

459
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,360
share the table with this young lady?

460
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,000
Okay.

461
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Ask her if she's okay with it.

462
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,800
Okay.

463
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,040
I'm sorry.

464
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,640
Didn't you order the steak?

465
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,960
Sorry.

466
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,440
I usually order pasta.

467
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,240
Mo gave me a steak today, so...

468
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,480
How about I...

469
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,080
It's okay.

470
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,840
Sir,

471
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
this fork was clean just now.

472
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,080
OK.

473
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,880
How about this?

474
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,200
Sell this bowl of noodles to me.

475
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,280
I'll ask the boss to make another one for you.

476
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,160
No need.

477
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
I don't mind.

478
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,040
I'll pay for the part you mind.

479
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,200
I think you misunderstood.

480
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,320
This is just my personal habit.

481
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
I think you misunderstood.

482
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,600
It's my habit to not owe others anything.

483
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,880
This bowl of noodles is on me.

484
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,920
Take it as an apology.

485
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,680
Mr. He,

486
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
I'm so busy.

487
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,120
Go and serve the dishes.

488
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Why don't you dislike

489
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,800
the newspaper I've read?

490
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,480
Here's the money for the newspaper.

491
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
It's you.

492
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,360
I killed someone.

493
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,600
I know.

494
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,120
So,

495
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,080
you're not sure

496
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,120
if you killed anyone.

497
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,400
I wouldn't have come to you if I knew.

498
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,640
Where were you

499
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,680
last night?

500
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Do you know

501
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,720
you have a home?

502
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,560
Lock me up again?

503
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,000
Dad.

504
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
You can't lock me up.

505
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Save it.

506
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,400
Bastard!

507
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,400
Calm down.

508
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,360
Don't fight.

509
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
Apologize to your dad.

510
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm not the one

511
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,520
who should apologize.

512
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,320
You bastard!

513
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,040
Luo Shaochuan.

514
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
You killed your father.

515
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,760
Come with me to the police station.

516
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,080
What?

517
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,560
We suspect that you killed Luo Wensheng.

518
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,400
My dad...

519
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,920
Don't move.

520
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,240
I can't remember.

521
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Where were you

522
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,840
when Wei Minxi was killed?

523
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,040
Wei Minxi?

524
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
According to the newspaper,

525
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,400
you were unsatisfied with your father getting marry again.

526
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,560
You killed your stepmother first,

527
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,320
and then your father.

528
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,560
Who would read the tabloid if he's smart?

529
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,680
Can we believe the tabloid?

530
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,560
Besides, when Wei Minxi died,

531
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
I was in Fengtian.

532
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
I'll find out the truth for you.

533
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
But I need a way

534
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,320
to know about the case.

535
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,760
How about this?

536
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,720
Go find

537
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,640
Zou Jingxuan.

538
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,680
Zou Jingxuan?

539
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,600
My fiancee.

540
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,640
You have a fiancee?

541
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,880
My dad arranged the marriage for me.

542
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,240
But to me,

543
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,520
she's like my own sister.

544
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,120
Go find her.

545
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,240
Tell her you're my friend.

546
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,040
If you want to know more about the case,

547
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,000
she will definitely help you.

548
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,320
What's going on?

549
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,800
Hide upstairs.

550
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,600
Don't come down before I call you.

551
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,240
Okay.

552
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,400
Who are you?

553
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,760
To investigate a case.

554
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,480
I'm here to collect the Luo family's documents.

555
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,240
Only the Luos

556
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,440
have the right to read the documents.

557
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,880
I only take the will.

558
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,160
The will is the same.

559
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,360
It can only be effective when it's read by a lawyer

560
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,160
in front of the whole Luo family.

561
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,680
Now that Mr. Shen passed away,

562
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,800
who should I look for?

563
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,360
I am a lawyer.

564
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,680
You?

565
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,639
I'm Mr. Shen's student, Situ Yan.

566
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,199
I just came from Beijing.

567
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,280
Mr. Luo and Director Xie know me.

568
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,080
Take it then.

569
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,320
Please wait here.

570
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,480
Situ Yan...

571
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,360
This one?

572
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,360
Let's go.

573
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,320
That's all of

574
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,719
Luo Wensheng's will.

575
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,520
Due to Mrs. Wei's accident,

576
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,560
her inheritance

577
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,560
will be inherited by Luo Shaochuan.

578
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,120
Besides that,

579
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,159
do you have any questions?

580
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Uncle really treats me as his family.

581
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,080
How could she take 10,000 silver dollars

582
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
and I have to get living expenses every month.

583
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,440
What do you mean by the right of continued residence?

584
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
I am from the Luo family.

585
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,520
Do I need him to give me the right?

586
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,400
Mr. Situ,

587
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,600
explain to me.

588
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,480
I think

589
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,600
this is your family matter.

590
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,440
Let's wait for Mr. Luo.

591
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,000
Then you can discuss with him.

592
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I've done so much for this family.

593
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
Shaochuan, Jingxuan...

594
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,160
I raised all the children

595
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
in this family.

596
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,480
Don't think you can walk over me

597
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,360
and bully me

598
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,200
just because master died early.

599
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,640
Mom,

600
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,520
uncle didn't mean that.

601
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,760
When Shaochuan comes back, he...

602
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,840
Didn't they say

603
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,920
Shaochuan killed master?

604
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,960
Why does he still have the right to inherit?

605
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,520
Mom.

606
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,560
Let's wait for the police's investigation results.

607
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,120
Okay?

608
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,400
As long as the case is not settled,

609
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,840
Luo Shaochuan

610
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,000
is not a criminal.

611
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,680
Miss Zou.

612
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,880
Are you Luo Shaochuan's fiancee?

613
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,200
He mentioned you to me.

614
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,120
Can we

615
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,720
talk alone?

616
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Mr. Situ,

617
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,000
what my mom said just now is not malicious.

618
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
It's just because

619
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,560
the police think he's the prime suspect.

620
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,680
Don't take it to heart.

621
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
I believe

622
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,400
Shaochuan won't kill anyone.

623
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
But the truth can only be decided by evidence.

624
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
I heard about you.

625
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
You're good at solving cases.

626
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,920
I just know a little about it.

627
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,800
You can tell me everything.

628
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
You are Shaochuan's friend.

629
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,760
I trust you.

630
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,760
At the church,

631
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,480
uncle told me that you're capable.

632
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
I hope

633
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,720
you can help Shaochuan.

634
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,480
Please.

635
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,960
What if Luo Shaochuan is the murderer?

636
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,960
Why do the police suspect Luo Shaochuan?

637
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,560
Because the evidence points to him.

638
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,080
Luckily, Uncle Xie was there.

639
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,560
The police didn't dare to slander him.

640
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,040
But Shaochuan is missing.

641
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,840
I'm afraid

642
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,440
Uncle Xie can't withstand the pressure

643
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
and will catch Shaochuan as the murderer.

644
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
After all, uncle passed away.

645
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,160
No one can stop them.

646
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,520
Of course,

647
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,440
if you find out

648
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,880
the murderer is Shaochuan,

649
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,880
he should be punished by the law.

650
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,600
Okay.

651
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,120
I need to know everything about the case

652
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,040
and the evidence the police have.

653
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,720
Mom.

654
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,480
Come here.

655
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,440
Is Luo has something

656
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,400
to tell Jingxuan in private?

657
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,440
Mom, it's not like that.

658
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,240
Shut up!

659
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,560
Don't judge a book by its cover.

660
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,400
Being with a lawyer

661
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,640
who always deals with rich families

662
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,040
should be careful.

663
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,520
Who knows what he's up to?

664
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,000
Besides,

665
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
I should be the only legal heir

666
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,080
of the Luo family.

667
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,560
You are my daughter.

668
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,960
I can't let you

669
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,240
get cheated

670
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,840
by a glib man.

671
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Let's go.

672
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,760
Mom,

673
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,200
I hereby appoint Mr. Situ

674
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,960
to investigate the cause of uncle's death

675
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,720
as Luo Shaochuan's fiancee.

676
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,520
Miss Zou,

677
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,440
this is against the rules.

678
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,600
Mr. Situ is Shaochuan's friend.

679
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,920
He helped Shaochuan

680
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
in the East Express.

681
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,440
Besides,

682
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,920
if Shaochuan is desperate,

683
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,360
he might go to him.

684
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,840
Director Xie.

685
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,520
I kind of know Luo Shaochuan.

686
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,800
I think I can help.

687
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,960
The funds have been checked.

688
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,160
This should be...

689
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,640
Situ Yan.

690
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,000
You can only involve a little

691
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
in this case.

692
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,280
But you have to promise

693
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,040
you won't interfere with our investigation.

694
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,840
Otherwise, I'll invite you out anytime.

695
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,360
Sure.

696
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,120
Thank you, Director Xie.

697
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
Mr. Luo's accounts

698
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
have been managed by Mr. Shen.

699
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,200
Go back, find the ledger,

700
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,160
and check it.

701
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,440
What a coincidence.

702
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,880
I have it with me.

703
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,560
You came prepared.

704
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,400
Bao,

705
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,160
find an excuse

706
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,320
to investigate Mr. Shen's house.

707
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,440
Luo Shaochuan has nowhere to go.

708
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,040
He must be hiding there.

709
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,360
Let me tell you what happened first

710
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,080
and the clues we have.

711
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,040
Around 6 p.m. yesterday,

712
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,800
I arrived at Mr. Luo's house.

713
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,960
I came here

714
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,920
and saw the drawer was open

715
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,360
so I closed it.

716
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
Master is not back yet.

717
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,400
Director Xie.

718
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,680
Please wait here for a while.

719
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,040
After dinner,

720
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,360
I went to President Luo's study.

721
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,960
What did President Luo

722
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
ask you for?

723
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,680
There is some progress

724
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
of Wei Minxi's murder case.

725
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,880
What progress?

726
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,000
Analyzing the scene of Wei Minxi's murder,

727
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
we thought it was done by the fugitive robber.

728
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,880
So,

729
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,120
we set a trap

730
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,720
in gold shops and pawnshops.

731
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,120
In the end,

732
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,880
in a pawnshop,

733
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,520
we found Wei Minxi's jewelry.

734
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,080
We interrogated the pawnshop owner.

735
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,240
The boss said

736
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
the person who came to sell the jewellery

737
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,600
was Wei Minxi.

738
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,720
Isn't this uncle's gift

739
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,640
for Auntie Wei?

740
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,000
I think she likes it very much.

741
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,040
During that time,

742
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,160
she wore it everytime.

743
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,480
How could she sell gifts from uncle?

744
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,560
President Luo proposed to Wei Minxi.

745
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,640
She agreed.

746
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,480
She said she need to make one thing clear

747
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,880
before the wedding is announced.

748
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,080
Your uncle always thought

749
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,600
Wei Minxi's death is related to this.

750
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,880
Through the clues of the pawnshop,

751
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,360
we checked Wei Minxi's bank account

752
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,640
and found the account was empty.

753
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,080
I don't need you here.

754
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,800
Get back to work.

755
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,960
Yes, Master.

756
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,800
It's just as you think.

757
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,400
Wei Minxi had been blackmailing

758
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,360
over the years.

759
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,920
Who do you think it is?

760
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,200
The problem is

761
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,520
what's her secret.

762
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,480
Who is it?

763
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,920
Master, it's me.

764
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,480
Get lost!

765
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,280
Master.

766
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,720
It's a letter from Mrs. Wei.

767
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,080
Aunt Wei was blackmailed?

768
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,760
Why?

769
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,240
To marry into a rich family,

770
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,440
you have to take some risks.

771
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,920
This woman is not innocent.

772
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,200
Think about it.

773
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,640
She and brother grew up together.

774
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,040
When he was poor,

775
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,840
why she didn't want to marry him?

776
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,880
She insisted on marrying a man

777
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,920
who beat his wife and got drunk.

778
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,120
What for?

779
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,840
Just for money.

780
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,280
Who would have thought

781
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,840
our Luo family would be rich in only two years?

782
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,640
Brother

783
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,200
became the richest man.

784
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,320
What a coincidence.

785
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,200
She and brother

786
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,160
reunited in Harbin.

787
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Besides,

788
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,080
two years later,

789
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,560
her husband died.

790
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
