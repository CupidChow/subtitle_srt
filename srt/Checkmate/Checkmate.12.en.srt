1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,480
We'll brief you two later.

3
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
Again?

4
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,640
We've been asked many times about this matter.

5
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,680
Did you hear the knock in the kitchen?

6
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,520
No, only the sound of the draught fan.

7
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Moly was obsessive-compulsive.

8
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,880
As he opened the cooker and the draught fan,

9
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,400
it was really noisy.

10
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
We could hear nothing outside.

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,040
In other words,

12
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
no one has heard the gunshot?

13
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,280
Yes.

14
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,079
But the bullet has pierced his forehead.

15
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,520
It was clear that he was shot.

16
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,760
If it weren't that it delayed serving,

17
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,040
no one would have known his death for long.

18
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,079
What are you saying?

19
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,200
Moly was your partner, wasn't he?

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
I've never seen you before.

21
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm new here.

22
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,160
A new waiter.

23
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,200
He's silly.

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,040
He would get 800 scoldings from Moly in a day.

25
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,720
Where is Zhao Xiaoling?

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,360
That was why Moly committed suicide.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,680
It was all because of her.

28
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,520
Why do you say that?

29
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,320
About romance.

30
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,000
Several days after this guy came,

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,440
Zhao Xiaoling ran away.

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,800
She went to Manzhouli

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,720
to seek refuge with her fiancé.

34
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,200
Zhao Xiaoling has a fiancé?

35
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,320
She does.

36
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,960
Moly was still dreaming

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,360
about marrying Zhao Xiaoling.

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,520
Who would have thought that

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,440
her fiancé has prospered in Manzhouli?

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,800
He made a fortune

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,640
and took Zhao Xiaoling away.

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,040
Since then,

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,120
Moly had lost his wits.

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,760
He vented his anger on everyone he met.

45
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
All the waiters

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
ran away.

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,760
Who had dinner in this restaurant today?

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,160
Moly had been in a bad mood recently.

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,600
So most of them were regular customers.

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
First...

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,480
Mr. Situ and your friend.

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,760
Then Cheng Xiangjun, a medicine seller.

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,560
She just came to Harbin this month.

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,519
And Mr. Yu of the bank,

55
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,600
Yu...

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,079
Yu Daren.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
Yes. Yes.

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,120
Yu Daren

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,120
left at 12:30.

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
At 12:30,

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
Moly was still serving food.

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
A bowl of meat sauce spaghetti.

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
That was ordered by a new guest.

64
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,520
But what was his name...

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
I don't know his name.

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,800
He said Cheng Xiangjun had recommended that to him.

67
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,480
It was a coincidence that

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,640
they didn't meet each other.

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,080
And then

70
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,360
came Mr. He who lives next door to Mr. Situ.

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
He didn't order much.

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,360
But Moly hadn't served up for a long time.

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,760
Only after being urged twice

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,040
did he realize he should go to the kitchen and see.

75
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,920
Now only we two are left.

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,880
Silly guy.

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,200
That was because their orders were almost the same.

78
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,800
The sales are getting worse.

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,360
We might as well break up.

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,120
He committed suicide

81
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
for such a trivial matter?

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,760
So Moly

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,560
was a sentimental man.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,400
Do you know when he bought that gun?

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
I have no idea.

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,080
Why does a cook need a pistol?

87
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,200
To make a fire and cook?

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,280
OK.

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,800
I'll keep the receipts for the moment.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,680
It's okay that you two come and take a look.

91
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,440
But why do you stick seals?

92
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,200
What do you want?

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
Open for business.

94
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,920
I paid a high rent for this restaurant.

95
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,960
If you have finished,

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,280
I would tidy it up.

97
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
I can open for business anyway.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,000
Can you cook?

99
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,920
Of course.

100
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,080
Why did I run a restaurant if I couldn't cook?

101
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,160
Let me tell you.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,080
I can cook much better than Moly.

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,800
He was just too domineering.

104
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,080
He was so picky about my skill.

105
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,120
He thought a heavy drinker couldn't toss the wok steadily.

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,360
So he asked me to work with accounts in reception.

107
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,040
OK.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,040
Before I close the case,

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,120
no one is allowed to act rashly.

110
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,440
As for the rent,

111
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,680
that depends on your performance.

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
I'll of course behave myself.

113
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,440
Behave myself.

114
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,360
Answer my question first.

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,440
What were you doing when the crime happened?

116
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
I swear before God.

117
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,120
If you suspect that someone has gone to the kitchen

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,480
and killed Moly,

119
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,360
you must have thought too much.

120
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
At noon,

121
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Mr. Situ was here too.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,920
Who would get the chance?

123
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,240
The newspaper office that Xia Ru'an works for

124
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
was indeed capitalized by Fengtian Press.

125
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
Xia Ru'an

126
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,480
changed her job every once in a while.

127
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,160
Her excuse was

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
she needed to take care of her sick mother.

129
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,600
Are you thinking if Moly committed suicide?

130
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,200
Drunkard as He Wannian is,

131
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,640
his statement

132
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,920
sounded reasonable.

133
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,240
But Moly didn't look like one who would commit suicide.

134
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
You haven't been here for long.

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,840
Have you got on with him?

136
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
I forgot a thing,

137
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
officers.

138
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,720
The female guest didn't leave through the front door.

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,480
What do you mean by that?

140
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,520
She seemed familiar with Mr. He

141
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,600
and often left through the back door.

142
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,240
What does she look like?

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,480
I've seen her.

144
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,920
Tell me.

145
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,640
Cheng Xiangjun

146
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,680
She has ordered takeout several times.

147
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,640
I sent that to her.

148
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,640
No, no, no.

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
This sassy woman

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,680
lives in a small hotel.

151
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,920
She lives in a hotel?

152
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,640
She left Beijing to sell medicine here.

153
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,240
So she just lives near the hospital.

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,280
Then shall I...?

155
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,400
Go.

156
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,400
Let's take a look.

157
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,679
Go with Jin Qiming.

158
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,320
Or Zhou Mowan.

159
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,160
I'm engaged.

160
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
I win! Self-draw.

161
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,560
Shaochuan is back.

162
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,680
Why are you back so early?

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
I've cooked Sea Cucumber Soup.

164
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,480
Go and have a bowl.

165
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,280
-I don't want. -Come on. Hurry.

166
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,800
You become rich because of your father, don't you?

167
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,400
If it weren't for him,

168
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
you can't even be a police man.

169
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,400
That is not your capacity.

170
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,560
You are actually incompetent.

171
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
You have no right to criticize him

172
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,720
because he has never

173
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,960
attained his goal with the expense of others,

174
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,200
whether when he was riding on the crest of success

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,760
or in the fall on evil days.

176
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,840
He has never

177
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,800
shrunk from his responsibility.

178
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,560
Are you staying?

179
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,640
I'm looking for someone.

180
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,400
May I ask

181
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,280
if there's a guest named Cheng Xiangjun?

182
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,920
She's not here.

183
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
The Cheng Xiangjun you mentioned

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,200
is not in the room now.

185
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,640
Has she gone to the hospital?

186
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,000
What hospital?

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,080
She's been idling away in seeking pleasure with those of the hospital.

188
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,760
Now,

189
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,240
she might be in a theater.

190
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,480
When did she come to Harbin?

191
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
I don't know that.

192
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,360
Anyway, she has lived here

193
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
for almost a week.

194
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,520
Not only did she go to the opera of foreigners,

195
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,040
but she crooned herself.

196
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,920
I asked her

197
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
why she didn't perform on stage.

198
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,320
She said she had learned it before

199
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,200
but she didn’t get a chance to perform.

200
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,960
It seems that you got along well

201
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,040
with Miss Cheng.

202
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,440
No way.

203
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,240
You have no idea about

204
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
how annoying she was.

205
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,360
I cleaned up her room

206
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,680
but she suspected me of theft.

207
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,160
If I didn't clean up her room,

208
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,320
she would be pickier.

209
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,680
She said she didn't enjoy the service as she spent money.

210
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,240
I run business on the small scale.

211
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
How much can I charge her?

212
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,360
If she wants to live comfortably,

213
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,280
go to the Modern Hotel.

214
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Although it was chump change,

215
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,920
you've earned that, haven't you?

216
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,400
If it weren't for the money,

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,520
what else could I get then?

218
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,520
Just serve her. What else can I do?

219
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,360
She is not short of money.

220
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,720
But she was stingy here.

221
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,640
Why isn't she short of money?

222
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,920
It's obvious.

223
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,720
Every day, she dressed herself up

224
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
like a parrot.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,560
Everyone could tell that she is rich.

226
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,320
We ordinary men save money

227
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,000
and watch opera in tea gardens.

228
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,160
What she enjoyed

229
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
was foreign opera.

230
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
As foreigners sang for her,

231
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
could she enjoy that for free?

232
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,160
When will she come back?

233
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,480
I'm not sure.

234
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,120
Sometimes she would stay out for a whole night.

235
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,200
Sometimes,

236
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,640
she came back after only a while.

237
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,840
How about this?

238
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,160
You come here tomorrow morning.

239
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,880
Or you leave a note

240
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,080
in care of me and I'll ask her to see you

241
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,960
when she's back.

242
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,680
Okay.

243
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,640
Here.

244
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,400
Mowan, why did you come through the heavy snow?

245
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,560
You might catch a cold.

246
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,080
Auntie Shen, I have something urgent to talk to Situ Yan.

247
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
Is it about Moly?

248
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,440
I just passed Jasmine Restaurant.

249
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,640
Did Moly really commit suicide?

250
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,520
The police have made the conclusion.

251
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,240
You don't think Moly committed suicide, right?

252
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,920
Why don't you believe that?

253
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,600
Intuition.

254
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,160
I just had an intuition.

255
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,720
Only when the world is sick of delicious food

256
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,440
would Moly commit suicide.

257
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,400
How would the one who had invented meat sauce spaghetti

258
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
and mashed potato with fermented bean juice

259
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,160
commit suicide?

260
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
We haven't found any clue of murder yet.

261
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,560
Then what's his reason for suicide?

262
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Romance.

263
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Romance?

264
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,000
Moly was a bachelor.

265
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,920
Ever since Zhao Xiaoling's fiancé

266
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,000
took her to Manzhouli,

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,840
Moly had been depressed.

268
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,160
The sales of the restaurant were decreasing.

269
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
Even his cooking skill got worse.

270
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
Did He Wannian tell you that?

271
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
Zhao Xiaoling did like Moly.

272
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,880
But Moly only cared about cooking.

273
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,080
Maybe Moly somehow liked Zhao Xiaoling.

274
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,160
That mattered little to him.

275
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,840
What mattered the most was still cooking.

276
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,520
I've known them for a long time.

277
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm clear about that.

278
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,240
People may lie,

279
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
but data won't.

280
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,560
After Zhao Xiaoling left,

281
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,000
the sales of Jasmine Restaurant kept dropping.

282
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,160
It shows how important

283
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,360
she was to Moly.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,760
Besides, she and her fiancé

285
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,160
were not a good match.

286
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,120
He took her away as he said

287
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
he had found a job in Manzhouli.

288
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,640
Moly must be worried.

289
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
If Moly really did,

290
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,480
why didn't he ask Zhao Xiaoling to stay?

291
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,720
Maybe she would have stayed

292
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
if he had said that.

293
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Just because of his intention,

294
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,760
I don't think he would commit suicide.

295
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Why?

296
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,880
As they were not a good match,

297
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,880
how could he trust him?

298
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,120
You know Jasmine Restaurant better than me.

299
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,800
I want to know more about

300
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
about Moly's personal relationships.

301
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,360
He Wannian,

302
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,400
Moly's partner,

303
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,320
used to be a cook in the early years.

304
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,160
Later, because of his excessive drinking,

305
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,640
Moly stopped him from the kitchen.

306
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
They had a few quarrels about that

307
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
and almost got into a fight.

308
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
Two months ago,

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,360
He Wannian even embezzled the public funds of the restaurant

310
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,040
on opium smoking.

311
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,960
When Moly found that,

312
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,400
he directly called the police

313
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,960
and He Wannian was arrested.

314
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,360
Only after that

315
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
did He Wannian gradually go steady.

316
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
I don't know He Xiangjun.

317
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,880
Yu Daren...

318
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,520
Yu Daren?

319
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
Isn't Yu Daren the boss of Zhongji Bank

320
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,760
and the stepfather of Shen Huatang?

321
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,240
So I want you to contact Shen Huatang

322
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,360
and then inquire about Yu Daren.

323
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,440
You can directly ask Luo Shaochuan

324
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,560
to contact Yu Daren.

325
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,560
Let him rest for a while.

326
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,360
What's wrong with him?

327
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,800
He seemed to have taken

328
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,560
Xia Ru'an's words to heart.

329
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,480
Then what should we do?

330
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,119
Go and comfort him?

331
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,400
No need.

332
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,520
He's the most optimistic man I've ever met,

333
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,160
100 times more than Moly.

334
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,319
Auntie Shen, I might have to disturb you for days.

335
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
Don't say that.

336
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,240
I always feel lonely.

337
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,480
I'm so happy to have you by my side.

338
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,840
Don't be that polite.

339
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,320
You don't have to.

340
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,360
Situ,

341
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
I think

342
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,080
you should give her a suitable identity.

343
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,600
No, you misunderstood.

344
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,480
I came to discuss about Moly's case

345
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
with Situ.

346
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,200
Just treat her

347
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,040
as the assistant I just hired.

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,920
Assistant?

349
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,840
I used to be your teacher's assistant.

350
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Eat up. It's getting cold.

351
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,280
The case about girls’ school has been closed.

352
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Why are you still here?

353
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,440
Are you going to live here?

354
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm his new assistant.

355
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm the boss. Why don't I know that?

356
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,000
Do you have money to burn?

357
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,480
No.

358
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,840
You asked me to find Zhou Mowan, didn't you?

359
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,680
Why are you in such a hurry?

360
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,240
We've found out the reason for Moly's suicide.

361
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,520
He killed Li Chengyan by mistake.

362
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:29,880
Li Chengyan?

363
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,400
Li Chengyan?

364
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,840
Boss.

365
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,040
Excuse me.

366
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,640
Boss.

367
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,280
Li Chengyan

368
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,800
was the new guest

369
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,520
at Jasmine Restaurant yesterday.

370
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,920
He ordered meat sauce spaghetti

371
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,240
and a bottle of kvass.

372
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,720
He felt uncomfortable and went home before he ate up.

373
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,080
This morning the waiter

374
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,400
found him dead in the room

375
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,560
and hurried to call the police.

376
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,560
Dr. Fang has confirmed that he died of arsenic poisoning.

377
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,360
Arsenic poisoning...rat poison?

378
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
We found the address of Jasmine Restaurant

379
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,520
in Li Chengyan's notebook.

380
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,080
He had specially marked

381
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,640
its specialty was meat sauce spaghetti.

382
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,440
Meat sauce spaghetti?

383
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,480
I think it should be recommended by Cheng Xiangjun.

384
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
We sealed down Jasmine Restaurant in time.

385
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,120
So the crime scene was well preserved.

386
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,880
In the test,

387
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,440
we found arsenic in the spaghetti.

388
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,560
So we immediately collected

389
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,880
seasoning bottles in the kitchen.

390
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,520
In the end, we found rat poison

391
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,560
in the saltcellar.

392
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,760
According to the crime scene analysis,

393
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
it was very likely that Moly

394
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,560
had mistaken rat poison as salt.

395
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,160
But when he found out

396
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
his serious mistake,

397
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,240
it was too late.

398
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,480
So he could only apologize with his suicide.

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,440
Now that the chain of evidence was complete,

400
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
Mr. Bao asked us to close the case.

401
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,280
Was it really because of Zhao Xiaoling's departure

402
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,880
that Moly was out of his mind

403
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,400
and made such a big mistake?

404
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,880
Impossible.

405
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
I know you won't believe that.

406
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,560
Absolutely impossible.

407
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,160
First, meat sauce spaghetti doesn't need salt.

408
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,760
What I feel strange is

409
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,280
why rat poison would be in the saltcellar.

410
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
So, here's my second reason.

411
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,440
You two are really alike.

412
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,360
Rags in the kitchen are all white.

413
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,000
One is for pot washing.

414
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,640
One is for dishes.

415
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,720
And the last one is to clean the hearth.

416
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
Each of them has its own position.

417
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
Once I had mistaken them.

418
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,080
I thought as they were all white,

419
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,960
he wouldn't find that, right?

420
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,480
Actually, the boss was like a gas tank

421
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,280
and just burst.

422
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
He kept scolding me all that afternoon.

423
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Moly was similar to me.

424
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,200
He could even tell

425
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,600
white rags in the kitchen.

426
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,680
How could he carelessly put

427
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,960
rat poison into the saltcellar?

428
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,280
So the one who put rat poison

429
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,320
in the saltcellar

430
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
must be the murderer.

431
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
This is doubtlessly a murder case.

432
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,520
Mr. Bao and I will try to buy time.

433
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,080
The bureau is under strict supervision now.

434
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
Hurry up and solve the case.

435
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,920
I need to confirm yesterday's guests again.

436
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
I'll go to Shen Huatang.

437
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,000
Cheng Xiangjun?

438
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,480
She has ordered takeout several times.

439
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
I sent that to her.

440
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,480
When did she come to Harbin?

441
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,480
I don't know that.

442
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
Anyway, she has stayed here for almost a week.

443
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,080
Ten days ago.

444
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,080
Brother Situ.

445
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,040
What's wrong, Situ?

446
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,000
Investigate two people for me.

447
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
Is it related to the Jasmine Restaurant?

448
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,680
Moly was murdered, right?

449
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,640
We're still investigating.

450
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,200
Okay, go ahead.

451
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
One is Li Chengyan.

452
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
He might have run a tavern.

453
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
He came from Beijing.

454
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,920
And I want to know what he is exactly doing

455
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,200
and where he works.

456
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,680
The other is Xiangjun Cheng.

457
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,880
She's from Beijing too.

458
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,120
A medicine seller.

459
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,880
I want to know where she works

460
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,080
and when she came to Harbin.

461
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,280
The more detailed, the better.

462
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,160
Okay, I'll be quick.

463
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,360
Ms. Zhou...

464
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
Don't worry. I'm here for Shen Huatang.

465
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,360
Please come in.

466
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,840
Mr. Situ.

467
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,600
I heard that the police

468
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,040
had found out why Moly committed suicide.

469
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,520
Then can we close the case?

470
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,920
I still have some questions

471
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,240
to confirm with you.

472
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,840
Go ahead.

473
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,000
Are you in a hurry?

474
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,200
Why am I?

475
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,840
Although Moly has died,

476
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,520
I have to keep this restaurant.

477
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,680
Look. Ask me anything you wonder.

478
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
I don't want Moly

479
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,920
to pass away like this.

480
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,560
He didn't even leave a will.

481
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,160
If you can find

482
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,280
his last wish,

483
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,200
I would be grateful.

484
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,280
Where is Zhang Xiaoxi?

485
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,080
Zhang Xiaoxi?

486
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,320
He was new in our restaurant.

487
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,600
And such an accident happened shortly after that.

488
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,840
He had to find a new job, didn't he?

489
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,160
If you want to see him,

490
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,240
I'll ask him here.

491
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,560
Tell me about the customers

492
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,480
of yesterday in detail.

493
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,080
Who they were, what time they came and left

494
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,840
and how they left.

495
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,760
It's hard for me.

496
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,920
Why don't you ask me something I know?

497
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,240
Don't you want to say?

498
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:01,960
Alright.

499
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,520
I heard you didn't get along well with Moly.

500
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,480
He even called the police to arrest you

501
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,320
because you embezzled the public funds of the restaurant.

502
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,760
How could that be embezzlement?

503
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,840
We were partners to run this restaurant.

504
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,480
The funds of the restaurant

505
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,520
belonged to me, didn't it?

506
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,000
So you've borne a grudge against Moly

507
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,520
because of this.

508
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,960
In our restaurant,

509
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,840
everyone had trouble with Moly.

510
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,280
Even if Zhao Xiaoling hadn't seized the opportunity

511
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,760
and left,

512
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,720
she wouldn't stay any longer.

513
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,400
She was forced by necessity

514
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,520
and Moly offered a high wage.

515
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,280
Moly liked Zhao Xiaoling, didn't he?

516
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,000
It went wrong just because of that.

517
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,720
Mr. Moly,

518
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,280
I respect you as you're my boss.

519
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,680
But I hope you can respect my choice.

520
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,240
Your boyfriend

521
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,800
is an unreliable guy.

522
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,440
Does he have a job?

523
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,800
Adult as he is, he lives with a woman's support.

524
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,240
He's lying to you,

525
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,360
cheating you in relationship

526
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,560
and out of money.

527
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,080
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

528
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,600
Listen.

529
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Who would be happy to hear that?

530
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,600
She has fallen in love.

531
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,680
Beauty is the eyes of the beholder.

532
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,400
The more you spoke ill of him,

533
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
the more rebellious she would be.

534
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,320
Moly was a bachelor.

535
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,880
He didn't know that much.

536
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,160
He was just warm-hearted.

537
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,040
What about you?

538
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,920
Why aren't you with your wife and kid?

539
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,840
Mr. Situ,

540
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,040
I know you think I had trouble with Mo.

541
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,440
But Moly saved me

542
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,280
when my wife and kid met an accident.

543
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,480
I would never

544
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,960
bite the hands that feeds me.

545
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,080
Even if Zhang Xiaoxi had been

546
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,200
severely scolded,

547
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,480
we wouldn't go so far as to kill a man.

548
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,760
Mr. Situ,

549
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,760
if you really find out that Moly was murdered,

550
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,040
I would never

551
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,680
charge you when you have meals at my restaurant.

552
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,960
How old is Zhao Xiaoling's boyfriend?

553
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,240
Almost 30 years old.

554
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,200
He was lucky to meet Xiaoling,

555
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
who was kind.

556
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,520
Otherwise, who would care about him

557
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,680
as he was that poor.

558
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,400
He had been jobless.

559
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Then why did she suddenly want to go to Manzhouli?

560
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,200
We tried to persuade her.

561
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,120
We advised her to go

562
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,080
when her boyfriend's business showed signs of a rise.

563
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
But she didn't listen to us. She insisted.

564
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,760
Boss, you want to see me?

565
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,240
Yes.

566
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,120
Mr. Situ wants to ask you something.

567
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,160
Mr. Situ,

568
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,880
I'll send a telegram to Zhao Xiaoling.

569
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm worried about her.

570
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,120
Enjoy your chatting.

571
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,240
Mr. Situ,

572
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,800
there were only these guests yesterday.

573
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,640
Do you remember when they entered the restaurant?

574
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,680
Yes.

575
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,920
Mr. Moly had a requirement for the serving time.

576
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,680
In ten minutes after they ordered,

577
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,480
I should serve the dishes.

578
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,440
If they had reserved that in advance,

579
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,840
we have to finish it in five minutes.

580
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,280
I used to ignore the time

581
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,240
and forgot who came first.

582
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,040
I always mistook them when they ordered the same dishes.

583
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,760
Mr. Moly had scolded me many times.

584
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,520
The first guest of yesterday

585
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,880
arrived at 11:00.

586
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,040
Sir,

587
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,360
what would you like to eat?

588
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,720
A glass of water first. I'm waiting for my friend.

589
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,720
Okay, wait a moment.

590
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,680
When did he leave?

591
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,640
I didn't pay attention

592
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,560
to when he left.

593
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,280
It seemed to be between 12:20

594
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,760
to 12:30.

595
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,200
What do you mean?

596
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
I came in at 12:20.

597
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,480
I seemed to have seen him

598
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,240
walk towards the bathroom.

599
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,680
And I didn't see him

600
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,760
until I went to serve the noodles at 12:30.

601
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
He must have left.

602
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,440
Didn't you see him leave?

603
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
No.

604
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,960
He might have left through the back door as I think.

605
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,200
But he needed to pass through the kitchen if so.

606
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,600
Mr. Moly usually wouldn't let anyone

607
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,560
enter his kitchen.

608
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,320
Is he the one

609
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,760
who killed Mr. Mo?

610
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,680
What about those arrived later?

611
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,120
Then you and your friend

612
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,160
came in for a meeting.

613
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,520
You left around several minutes past 12.

614
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,440
After that,

615
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,680
the female guest I've mentioned

616
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,120
waited for Mr. He to pack up the food for her.

617
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,200
They looked familiar with each other.

618
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,440
I've tasted food of

619
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,400
all restaurants near here.

620
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,200
Only yours suits my taste the most.

621
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,120
It reminds me of

622
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,480
the taste of the imperial city.

623
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
I've recommended your restaurant to all my friends.

624
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,160
So

625
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,800
won't you give me some extra dishes?

626
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Sure, when you come next time,

627
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,920
I'll ask Moly to cook the signature dish

628
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,200
mashed potato with fermented bean juice.

629
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,960
For free.

630
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,280
Stop teasing me.

631
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,080
I won't drink that.

632
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,680
That's smelly water from the poor.

633
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,680
I'm sorry. Sorry.

634
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
I'll buy you some medicine.

635
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,680
Just forget it.

636
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
I'm a medicine seller.

637
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,320
It doesn't matter.

638
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,520
I'll leave this way.

639
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,360
What time was it?

640
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,760
It was after 12:10.

641
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,360
Because that big boss came.

642
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,800
He was wearing an expensive suit.

643
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
His leather shoes were polished.

644
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,400
He seemed to be a banker...

645
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,280
Yu Daren.

646
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,680
Yes. Yes.

647
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,640
That was his name.

648
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,960
Sir, what would you like to eat?

649
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,760
Meat sauce spaghetti is our special.

650
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,600
Mr. Yu has reserved his meal in advance.

651
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,040
Tell Moly to serve now.

652
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,520
Okay.

653
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,120
Sir, please take a seat.

654
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,880
Wait a moment.

655
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,000
Moly didn't want others to enter the kitchen.

656
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,520
Why could she walk through the back door?

657
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,520
She insisted.

658
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,600
It seemed that the back door was closer to her home.

659
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
It really was.

660
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,480
She somehow handled that.

661
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,920
Moly might feel embarrassed to say something.

662
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,000
She was a guest anyway.

663
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,920
At that time,

664
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,800
I was serving the dishes for Mr. Yu.

665
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,360
I just heard her hooting.

666
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,920
She probably went out from the back door.

667
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,600
Yu Daren was a regular guest here.

668
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
He said Mr. Moly's cooking

669
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,240
was unique from others'.

670
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,960
He ate it up

671
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,920
not long after I served.

672
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,200
Probably

673
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
at 12:25.

674
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
Or later than that.

675
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,600
Before Mr. He's arrival,

676
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,560
he left.

677
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,760
During that,

678
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,360
when did Li Chengyan come?

679
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,240
Li Chengyan?

680
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,840
You mean the guest who was recommended here?

681
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,480
Around 12:15.

682
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,040
Not long after the female guest left.

683
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,720
When he ordered,

684
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,880
he told me that he was recommended here.

685
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
And he specially mentioned meat sauce spaghetti,

686
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,120
so I served him meat sauce spaghetti

687
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,920
and a bottle of kvass.

688
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,160
I was new here.

689
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,920
How would I know who the one he mentioned was?

690
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,240
So I just placed the order for him.

691
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,960
Was there anything strange about him?

692
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,360
No.

693
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,720
He looked around when he came in.

694
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,200
Then he found an empty seat and sat down.

695
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,920
At that moment,

696
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,600
that strange young man was still there.

697
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,960
I haven't seen him since then.

698
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,520
After several bites of meat sauce spaghetti,

699
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
he stopped as he said it tasted strange.

700
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,480
Then he left after paying.

701
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,440
I dared not tell Mr. Moly.

702
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,480
If anyone dared to say his food tasted strange,

703
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,000
he would fight with him.

704
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,920
So I cleaned up the food quietly.

705
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,240
When?

706
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,440
Not long after Mr. Yu left.

707
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,840
At around 12:40.

708
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,440
He seemed to be waiting for someone.

709
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,000
But he might feel really sick in the end.

710
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
So he asked me to call a rickshaw

711
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,520
to send him back to the hotel.

712
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,400
Who else has come here?

713
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,680
Mr. He.

714
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
At 12:30, I served him to take a seat.

715
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,000
Mr. He asked me

716
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,800
to serve dishes for the guest I just mentioned.

717
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,200
Then I went to the pick-up counter

718
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,720
and ordered for Mr. He.

719
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,680
But dishes weren't ready as we had waited for 20 minutes.

720
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,080
So I went to urge Mr. Moly.

721
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
I didn't expect...

722
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,920
I see.

723
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,080
Mr. Situ,

724
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,960
I've got no business here.

725
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,760
Can I...?

726
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,080
I've dealt with Bao.

727
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,120
Do you have any ideas?

728
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
So what? Are you going to train me?

729
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,040
After hearing what I said,

730
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,080
do you have any suspects now?

731
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,600
After solving several cases with you,

732
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,760
I think everyone now

733
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,920
is suspicious.

734
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,000
Tell me. Which one should we catch first?

735
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,280
OK.

736
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,720
Let's arrest

737
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,040
that young man who didn't order.

738
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,920
If he had killed Moly,

739
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,760
what was his motive?

740
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,400
We'll find out after questioning him.

741
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
Questioning...

742
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,360
Why are you the same as Mr. Bao now?

743
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,240
Catch him, ask him and torture him.

744
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,200
Then what do you think?

745
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,880
What do I think?

746
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
What you think matters.

747
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,160
Besides,

748
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,480
there are over 100,000 young people in Harbin.

749
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,680
Where can I find him?

750
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,240
There's no hurry.

751
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,240
I'll paint a portrait for you when I'm free.

752
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,440
You can do that?

753
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,240
-Put them there. -They're freshly roasted.

754
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,880
They're hot.

755
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,240
Mr. Situ. Mr. Luo.

756
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
I've got information about Li Chengyan.

757
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
But I didn't find Cheng Xiangjun yet.

758
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,000
I’m here to tell you the news first.

759
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,480
Let's talk inside.

760
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,199
Li Chengyan sells liquor.

761
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,679
He ran a bar in Beijing.

762
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,199
But he has been in jail for three years.

763
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,760
What was his crime?

764
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,120
Fraud.

765
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,239
He opened the bar after he was released.

766
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,560
But the sale was not good.

767
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,880
So he came to Harbin

768
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,440
for dealership of beer.

769
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,960
Did he have any conflict with anyone?

770
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,880
Probably a lot.

771
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,960
He has a criminal record

772
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,199
and always stays with some hooligans.

773
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,960
He's arrogant and likes to fight.

774
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,600
He must have had a lot of troubles.

775
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,280
I've seen many cases like this.

776
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,400
If they want to handle someone,

777
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,280
they would just go over with swords.

778
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,480
He wound't rack his brains to

779
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,920
borrow a knife to kill a man.

780
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,000
After my dad passed away,

781
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,239
Yu Daren took over

782
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,560
the chairman of Harbin Chamber of Commerce.

783
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,320
Yes, our newspaper office has interviewed him.

784
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,360
Yu Daren is just like Mr. Luo...

785
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,960
Stop.

786
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,480
My dad was different from him.

787
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,600
He has a servile attitude to foreign things.

788
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,960
I don't know why he would become a banker.

789
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,040
Maybe it was because of his marriage.

790
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,120
But people like him

791
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,960
usually don't end well.

792
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,000
The chairman of Fengtian Chamber of Commerce

793
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,200
was killed, wasn't he?

794
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,400
There is no comparability.

795
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,840
We're investigating Li Chengyan,

796
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,680
not Yu Daren.

797
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,520
Why is there no comparability?

798
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,520
Why shall I kill a black sheep

799
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,360
who violates the law and commits crimes?

800
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
If I were the murderer,

801
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,760
I would pick up someone

802
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,040
that deserves my great plan.

803
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,320
Among so many people in the restaurant,

804
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,920
who I set a trap to kill

805
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,240
must be a banker.

806
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,080
Wait.

807
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,440
What's wrong?

808
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,600
Yu Daren and Li Chengyan

809
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,000
had ordered the same food.

810
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,480
Who has a reservation would be served first in Jasmine Restaurant.

811
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,720
So if Yu Daren

812
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,600
had not reserved in advance,

813
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,240
he would not have got that bowl of noodles.

814
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,680
Qiming and you ordered coffee,

815
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,240
fruit salad and bread.

816
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,080
Yu Daren ordered meat sauce spaghetti and Borsch.

817
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,120
Li Chengyan ordered meat sauce spaghetti and kvass as well.

818
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,920
That young man only ordered a glass of hot water.

819
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,600
Mr. He ordered roasted vegetables and bread.

820
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,400
If the murderer was targeting Yu Daren,

821
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,120
this is not a trivial matter then.

822
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,320
I have to tell Mr. Bao.

823
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
If his aim was really Yu Daren,

824
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,440
he would try it again

825
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,480
as he has failed for the first time.

826
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,880
Any news about Cheng Xiangjun?

827
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,120
I've enquired several hospitals. But she hasn’t been there.

828
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,280
And those pharmacies haven't answered me.

829
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,440
Situ, some people are at the gate.

830
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
They said they wanted to see you.

831
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,960
Detective Situ, I have a case for you.

832
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,520
Detective Situ, I have a case for you.

833
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,840
Mr. Situ,

834
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,880
Mr. Situ,

835
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,040
Mr. Situ.

836
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,640
I have a case for you, Mr. Situ.

837
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,280
There are a lot of people. The business is booming.

838
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,960
We can open a branch now.

839
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,640
What happened?

840
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,240
Now I remember.

841
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,160
The case of girls' school was published in the press today.

842
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,640
That's a good advertisement.

843
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,760
When I invest in a newspaper office,

844
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,640
I will have you to be the deputy director.

845
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,880
Go through the back door.

846
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,600
Good for you, guys.

847
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,160
You solved

848
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,040
three murder cases of the girls' school.

849
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,120
Yes, we did.

850
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,960
We're engaged.

851
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,760
Let's talk when we're back.

852
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,800
If you don't want

853
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,080
to ruin your day,

854
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,760
you'd better not open that door.

855
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,440
It's overcrowded.

856
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,960
Mr. He,

857
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
can we leave in this way?

858
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,200
You know me?

859
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,520
Moly told me

860
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,160
you lived next to my detective agency.

861
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,400
I'll get you a ladder.

862
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,800
You drank a lot.

863
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,960
It's cold.

864
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
I'll get warm after some drinks.

865
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,960
Mr. He,

866
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,440
what are you busy with in the yard?

867
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,320
Can't you tell?

868
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,280
Kid.

869
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,280
Good for you.

870
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,200
You're a detective.

871
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,920
Sort of.

872
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,280
You must have solved many cases.

873
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,160
He will.

874
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,760
The kidnapping case in the penetralium of Fujiadian.

875
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,760
He didn't get into the career at that time.

876
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Then ripper murder Zhang San in Wenchang Street.

877
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,320
Could it be...

878
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,400
spirit possession by the roadside?

879
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,320
I only solved the case of the girls' school.

880
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,240
But don't worry, sir.

881
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,920
I will work harder

882
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,840
and won't let you down.

883
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,280
Not bad. You're like me in my day.

884
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,000
Look, he’s no wonder an elder uncle.

885
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,760
By the way, Mr. He,

886
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,120
you went to the restaurant as well

887
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,200
when Moly met the accident.

888
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,040
Yes, I did.

889
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,800
But Moly died

890
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
before my dishes were served.

891
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,800
Did you find anything unusual?

892
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,120
Of course.

893
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,000
What was it?

894
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
That day,

895
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,440
I just wanted to eat steak shreds with soybean paste.

896
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,400
But that was sold out.

897
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,360
I could only order bread and roasted vegetables.

898
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,840
But I didn't eat bread and roasted vegetables either.

899
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:51,880
You...

900
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,760
So it delayed your meal.

901
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,720
Don't worry.

902
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,560
I will definitely find the murderer

903
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,880
who killed Moly.

904
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,360
Oh my god. You are a detective.

905
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,720
Did something happen

906
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,960
to Cheng Xiangjun?

907
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,200
Murder?

908
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,360
No.

909
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,440
But I have something to ask her.

910
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,920
Is she back?

911
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,840
No.

912
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,520
Can you show us her room?

913
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,600
Sure.

914
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,640
Come in, please.

915
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,920
Come in.

916
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,400
Not many people bought medicine from her.

917
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,680
Why is she so rich?

918
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,040
Is her money earned by honest means?

919
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,320
What if she targets me

920
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,840
when her money is gone?

921
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,640
How long has it been since she came back last time?

922
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,120
She hasn't shown up

923
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,520
since she left yesterday morning.

924
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
When did she move in?

925
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,160
Probably

926
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,040
the 12th of this month.

927
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,680
Did she move in the day she arrived in Harbin?

928
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,240
I'm not sure.

929
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,000
Is there anything wrong with the time?

930
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,200
Do you know which hospital she has been to?

931
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,600
No.

932
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,840
Check

933
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,000
if she has lived in another hotel.

934
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,120
As for the scope,

935
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,960
neighboring areas of those big hospitals are our priorities.

936
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,320
Stop talking nonsense.

937
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,720
Do you have any evidence or not?

938
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,160
Yes or no?

939
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,640
Isn't the memo evidence?

940
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,560
Of course not.

941
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
This morning, I ate dumplings

942
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,520
with our director.

943
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,880
So who will the murderer kill, him or me?

944
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,880
You...

945
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,240
You're always talking

946
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,880
about what you think

947
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,800
or you guess.

948
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,000
You want the police to take action based on that?

949
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,360
Do you think the police station was built by your family?

950
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,520
Wasn't the police station built by my family?

951
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,960
Even if it was,

952
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,040
you can't do that.

953
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,680
At the end of this month,

954
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,080
the director will urge me to improve clearance rate.

955
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,280
OK.

956
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,080
If Yu Daren met an accident these days,

957
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,880
I promise

958
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,400
your sloth administration would be published

959
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,600
on all newspaper of Harbin.

960
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,680
Brat, you now know how to threaten me.

961
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,000
Not really.

962
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,120
I'm just telling you

963
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
this is not my conjecture,

964
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,240
but Situ Yan's.
