Shen Huatang was kidnapped.

It seems to be premeditated.

64

He knew all her schedule

65

and the shop she went to.

66
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,280
And he waited for the chance

67

to work in collusion.

know his or her identity.

113
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,360
I don't think Feng Chengchu is an agent.

114
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,660
I've heard of an agent disguised as someone else.

115
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
This is the first time I heard that

116
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,050
someone disguised as an agent.

117
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,330
Feng Chengchu might be an agent.

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
The other one might not be.

119
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,580
I see.

120
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,310
What do you mean?

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,100
He said Feng Chengchu is an agent.

122
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,930
But the person who lives there claiming to be Mr. Feng

123
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,659
may not be Feng Chengchu.

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,130
Zhao Qiansun and Feng Chengchu are all fake names.

125
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,260
Zhao Qiansun told you that?

Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li. Feng, Chen, Chu, Wei.

They are all from the Book of Family Names.

Mrs. Feng

132
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,070
tried to hide her identity on the one hand,

133
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,900
and told everyone that

134
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,690
her husband is Feng Chengchu on the other hand.

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,240
Is it suspicious?

136
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,750
Fine.

137
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,490
I'll ask Bao to investigate.

138
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,340
It's all in vain.

139

Never mind.

140

141

Jin Qiming to investigate it.

142
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,690
He knew you'd be slow.

143
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,860
Can you be quiet?

144
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,110
I'm very quiet.

145
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,140
Have some water.

146
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,409
Bao, you don't have to investigate Feng Chengchu.

147
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,170
Okay.

148
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,010

149
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,900
Who is the leader here?

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,730
My bad.

151
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,960
Bastard.

152
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,620
Sergeant Bao, Sergeant Bao.

153
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,290
Something happened.

154
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,150
What happened?

155
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,710
Wasn't you following Yu Daren?

156
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,310
Yu Daren was assassinated.

157
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,670
He was injured.

158
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,420
And he got bandaged and went back.

159

Can't you finish it in one sentence

161
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,400
Go away.

162
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
How is your puzzle?

163
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,220
I can't figure out the frame of the puzzle.

164
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,190
The frame?

165
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,760
It's easy.

166
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll draw the frame for you

167
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,100
as long as you put the inside together.

168
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,050
The frame decides

169
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,740
what kind of case this is.

170
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,870
So far,

171
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,440
all the information we've got is fragments.

172
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,100
The killer killed Li Chengyan and framed Moly.

173
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,250
And the killer killed Mrs. Feng and disguised to be himself.

174
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,400
Why did the killer do it?

175
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,530
Who is Mrs. Feng?

176
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,050
She was definitely not at the scene.

177
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,440
Does she have anything to do with Li Chengyan?

178
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,920
Who is that young man?

179
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,090
That young man must have something to do with Shen Huatang.

180
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,550
But does Shen Huatang have anything to do with their deaths?

181
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,160
By the way,

182
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,960
do you think

183
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,820
Li Yantong looks familiar?

184
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,670
Maybe when men see beautiful women,

185
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
men will feel familiar with them.

186
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,430
Come with me to the police station.

187
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,060
A young man tried to assassinate Yu Daren.

188
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
What's the situation now?

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,680
This afternoon,

190
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,370
Shen Huatang was just found.

191
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,660
Yu Daren was shot

192
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,690
as he got out of the bank.

193
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,820
Mr. Yu.

194
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,560
Catch him! Hurry!

195
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,400
Yes.

196
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,820
How are you?

197
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,920
I'm fine.

198
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,420
Who shot me?

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,720
I don't know.

200
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,740
Go get him!

201
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,450
Yes.

202
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,010
Send Mr. Yu to the hospital.

203
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,610
Yes.

204
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,860
Go away!

205
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,130
Go away!

206
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,400
Stop!

207
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,330
Move!

208
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,880
Stop!

209
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,560
Stop!

210
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,920
Did he confess?

211
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,430
He didn't say anything after he was arrested.

212
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,160
He won't say it.

213
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,840
Did you find out who he is?

214
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,980
He looks familiar.

215
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,720
He seems to be the one we wanted before.

216
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,030
Who?

217
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,630
The one who went to Jasmine Restaurant for dinner.

218
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,340
Mr. Luo asked us to issue the wanted order.

219
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,510
[Wanted, Chen Qingshan]

220
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,090
His name is Chen Qingshan, a student.

221
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,020
He was on strike

222
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,880
in the several demonstrations started by the Revolutionary Party.

223
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,060
Could it be that the South wants to kill Yu Daren?

224
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,910
That's right.

225
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,660
I'll meet him myself.

226
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,730
Enough.

227
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,130
Stop it. It hurts.

228
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,590
You are the one on the wanted order, right?

229
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,330
Who asked you to kill Yu Daren?

230
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,660
The South?

231
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,790
No one.

232
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,080
Not the South.

233
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,440
You may leave.

234
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,130
Yes.

235
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,720
Then why did you kill him?

236
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,830
I wanted to.

237
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,140
Brat.

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,890
I guess you want to see what I can do.

239
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,910
Brat, you're quite stubborn.

240
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Did you go to Jasmine Restaurant

241
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,610
to kill Yu Daren?

242
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,590
Listen.

243
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,180
If you don't tell me,

244
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,260
I will let you know

245
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,950
how it feels to be burnt.

246
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,640
Tell me.

247
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,160
I'd like to see

248
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,340
how stubborn you are.

249
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,900
Tell me.

250
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,610
-Maybe you can survive. -Sir.

251
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,690
[Ask him why he kidnapped Shen Huatang this afternoon.]

252
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,720
So, Shen Huatang asked you

253
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,760
to kill her stepfather.

254
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,470
No.

255
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,900
It has nothing to do with Shen Huatang.

256
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,080
I'll catch her soon.

257
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,850
I'll let her have a taste

258
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,380
like you just had.

259
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,510
Just come at me.

260
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,130
I said it has nothing to do with her.

261
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,140
Don't think you can get away with it without saying anything.

262
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,950
What did you write?

263
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,630
Forget it.

264
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,880
It has the same effect anyway.

265
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,540
Go to Shen Huatang's place now

266
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,510
and tell her Chen Qingshan was arrested.

267
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,780
Let's see how she reacts.

268
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,150
Liu, go with her.

269
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,220
If you find anything,

270
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,380
let me know immediately.

271
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,160
Okay.

272
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,090
Miss Shen is waiting for you in the meeting room.

273
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,690
Li Ying.

274
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,060
You owe me a favor. Do you remember it?

275
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,540
Miss Zhou, what can I do for you?

276
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,680
If I cough later,

277
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,990
come in and fill the water.

278
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,350
Take out the note I wrote

279
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,140
and give it to the people in the car at the door.

280
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,770
What are you doing?

281
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,040
Don't be afraid. That is a policeman.

282
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,490
Okay, Mr. Zhou.

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,150
I remember your kindness.

284
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,170
Mr. Zhou, why are you here so late?

285
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,730
Is there something important?

286
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,980
I heard you were kidnapped.

287
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,620
No.

288
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,640
The servants made a fuss.

289
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,230
Did I cause any trouble for the police?

290
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,420
We caught him.

291
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,370
You caught him?

292
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,740
I wasn't kidnapped.

293
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,980
Did you catch a beggar?

294
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,570
Don't you know Chen Qingshan?

295
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,600
No.

296
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,260
Yu Daren was shot this afternoon.

297
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,120
Do you know that?

298
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,760
Yu was shot?

299
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,260
No wonder he went straight to the hospital after work.

300
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,710
But he didn't tell me anything.

301
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,510
I have to see him.

302
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,920
The police asked him to keep it a secret.

303
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,860
Chen Qingshan was arrested

304
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,690
after he shot Yu Daren this afternoon.

305
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,690
Now, he confessed everything.

306
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,730
It's impossible.

307
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,260
Impossible?

308
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
You two know each other.

309
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,680
Miss Zhou, you lied to me.

310
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,600
No one can stand Sergeant Bao's interrogation.

311
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,660
Chen Qingshan said

312
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,230
you two are close.

313
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,430
And you asked him to kill Yu Daren.

314
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,810
He said I asked him to kill him?

315
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,360
Miss Zhou,

316
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,670
he is an ungrateful person.

317
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,710
How could I ask him to kill Yu Daren?

318
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,170
It looks like you two are really close.

319
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,100
Is he indebted to you?

320
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,480
I know.

321
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,710
Miss Zhou.

322
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,570
I'm willing to see you so late

323
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,970
because I treat you as my friend.

324
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,440
But if you come here

325
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,970
just to trick me and get information,

326
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,040
I'm sorry,

327
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,540
please leave.

328
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,040
Miss Shen, you came to see me so late.

329
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,420
I believe you don't treat me as a friend.

330
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,430
You just want to know

331
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,420
if Chen Qingshan tells you in.

332
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,310
Since you respect me as Miss. Zhou,

333
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,690
and I found your precious daughter for you,

334
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,960
why can't you believe that

335
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,260
I can help you

336
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,680
dealing with this man?

337
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,570
[They are in love and very close.]

338
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,070
Moly, Li Chengyan, and Mrs. Feng.

339
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,360
These three lives

340
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,630
will be enough to sentence you to death.

341
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,040
Boss.

342
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,530
We've asked Shen Huatang.

343
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,410
You wanted to kill Yu Daren

344
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,310
because of her.

345
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,210
You can come at me.

346
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,400
It has nothing to do with Miss Shen.

347
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,690
He deserves to die.

348
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,140
You can sentence me however you want.

349
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,050
On the 16th of this month,

350
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,590
at Jasmine Restaurant,

351
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,390
you were ready to do it.

352
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,790
You are Miss Shen's friend.

353
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,410
And she is Yu Daren's daughter.

354
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,680
You wanted to kill him, but you didn't say anything.

355
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,360
You think you're protecting her?

356
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,460
If you're convicted of murder,

357
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,500
how will Miss Shen feel in the future?

358
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,680
Do you think

359
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,010
she could get out of it?

360
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,140
You probably don't know

361
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,619
how those ladies love to gossip.

362
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,310
In their words,

363
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,859
Miss Shen will become a murderer who killed her father.

364
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,660
How can she live in the future?

365
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,700
I told you

366
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,650
this has nothing to do with Miss Shen.

367
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,510
If you want to protect her,

368
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,510
you'd better tell the truth.

369
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,750
I did want to kill Yu Daren,

370
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,670
but I failed.

371
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,890
I missed.

372
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,110
I don't know

373
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,240
Li Chengyan, Moly,

374
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,890
or some madam.

375
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,870
Did you go to Jasmine Restaurant

376
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,280
on the 16th of this month?

377
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't go there to kill someone that day.

378
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,120
I just wanted to see Yu Daren that day.

379
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I wanted to meet him.

380
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,550
Huatang said he didn't approve of our marriage.

381
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,790
I want to persuade him in person.

382
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,960
Marriage?

383
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,030
I love her.

384
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,300
She loves me too.

385
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,010
I proposed to her.

386
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,160
She agreed.

387
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,800
But her father disapproved.

388
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,680
He thought I came from a poor family.

389
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,960
So what?

390
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,450
Isn't he from a poor family as well?

391
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,030
Huatang and I really love each other.

392
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,090
No one can stop us.

393
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,130
This man is a hooligan.

394
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,790
He was caught and beaten up by the police during the demonstration.

395
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,590
I helped him.

396
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,120
But unexpectedly, I was pestered by him.

397
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,930
He sent flowers and wrote letters to me.

398
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,720
He was always being romantic.

399
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,940
Miss Zhou.

400
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,470
The most ridiculous thing is that

401
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,590
he wanted to marry me.

402
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,400
What should I say?

403
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,590
How should I refuse him?

404
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,440
I could only say

405
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,520
my father

406
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,130
disapproved of our marriage.

407
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,350
My father thought he was from a poor family.

408
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,430
I thought he understood.

409
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,430
I didn't expect this fool

410
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,870
wanted to talk to Yu.

411
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,510
So you told him

412
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,700
about Yu Daren going to

413
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,440
Jasmine Restaurant?

414
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,310
Yes.

415
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,410
What can I do

416
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,540
getting in the middle?

417
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,190
I thought it this way.

418
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
I thought

419
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,820
whether Yu told him

420
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,410
not to push me so hard,

421
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,630
or

422
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,700
he told Yu

423
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,650
to leave me alone,

424
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,950
any way is good.

425
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,730
But I never thought

426
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,910
they would get involved

427
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,990
in such a murder case.

428
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,140
Miss Zhou.

429
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,230
To be honest, I'm really scared.

430
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,030
I didn't mean to do anything.

431
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,220
I really...

432
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm afraid the police will catch Chen Qingshan

433
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,620
and make Yu think that I want to kill him.

434
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,950
Why am I so unlucky?

435
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,450
I don't know why.

436
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,770
I just took a look at Yu Daren

437
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,480
and I became a wanted man.

438
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,990
I did nothing.

439
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,030
Huatang was so worried.

440
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,990
She asked me to hide.

441
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,410
She said the farther I hide, the safer I am.

442
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,590
She even bought me a train ticket.

443
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
She asked me to go to Russia.

444
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,210
She really loves me.

445
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,890
But how can I let her worry?

446
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,860
So I went to see her.

447
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,550
I want to marry her.

448
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
I want to protect her.

449
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,470
I want everyone to bless our love.

450
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,330
He has been wanted these days.

451
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,730
He didn't dare to show up.

452
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,320
He insisted that

453
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,340
he wanted to see me no matter what.

454
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,650
He said he didn't want me to worry about him.

455
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,350
Miss Zhou.

456
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,400
Isn't this ridiculous?

457
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,380
Why should I worry about him?

458
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,590
All my fear came from him.

459
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,100
And he said

460
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,020
he would take me away

461
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,710
and marry me in Russia.

462
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,470
I really don't know what to do.

463
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,100
I don't know how to refuse him.

464
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,260
I had to bring up Yu again.

465
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,930
I said

466
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,050
Yu would never agree.

467
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,490
But I didn't expect that

468
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,410
he wanted to kill Yu

469
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
because of it.

470
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,580
Do you think it's my fault?

471
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,080
Why didn't you refuse him

472
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,940
from the beginning?

473
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,800
I did.

474
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,900
What did you say?

475
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
I told him he had a bright future.

476
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,260
He didn't have to do it for me.

477
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,830
Isn't that obvious?

478
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,130
Does he really think

479
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,890
I would appreciate his talent?

480
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:27,770
Yes.

481
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,650
Huatang appreciated my talent

482
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,830
and that's why she wanted to be with me.

483
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,640
But her stepfather disapproved.

484
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,920
That's why she asked me to persuade Yu Daren.

485
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,590
She asked me to persuade her father.

486
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,060
Is that why you showed up at Jasmine Restaurant?

487
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,210
Yes.

488
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,030
But when I saw Yu Daren,

489
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:49,890
I flinched.

490
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,960
He was wearing such an expensive suit.

491
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,730
And I...

492
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,080
How can I convince him?

493
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,570
I had to run away in fear.

494
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,330
How did you know

495
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,320
Yu Daren would go to Jasmine Restaurant?

496
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,810
Huatang said that.

497
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,450
Yu Daren told the butler that

498
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,130
he would have dinner at that restaurant the next day.

499
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,900
But we didn't know what time it was.

500
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,900
So I went there at 11 o'clock.

501
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,720
I waited until 12:20.

502
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,770
I ran away.

503
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,480
Huatang must be very disappointed in me.

504
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,040
Shen Huatang knew

505
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,230
which restaurant Yu Daren would go for dinner in advance?

506
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,630
When did you book the schedule

507
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,790
to Jasmine Restaurant?

508
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,150
Actually, every morning,

509
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,960
my secretary and I would confirm the schedule

510
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,340
including dinner arrangement.

511
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,690
Are you sure it was 12:20

512
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
when you left?

513
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,210
Yes.

514
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,300
I wanted to talk to him

515
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,640
after he's done ordering.

516
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,560
-We have meat sauce spaghetti. -But...

517
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,530
Mr. Yu's meal is booked in advance.

518
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,230
Tell Mo to bring them on.

519
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,470
Okay.

520
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Sir, please take a seat.

521
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,650
Wait a moment.

522
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,030
I wanted to see him at that time,

523
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,530
but he went to the bathroom.

524
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,500
I've tried dozens of restaurants

525
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
around here.

526
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,380
Your food here suits my taste the best.

527
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,960
Yu Daren went to the bathroom?

528
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,640
Yes.

529
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,410
When?

530
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,850
Before the dishes were served.

531
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,730
It was about 12:15.

532
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,760
He left for one minute.

533
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,480
One minute?

534
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,320
Yes, before the dishes were served.

535
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,300
So, you didn't talk to him?

536
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,210
I couldn't find the chance.

537
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,070
So I sneaked out.

538
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,780
I was afraid that the waiter would catch me

539
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,250
and ask me why I left without eating.

540
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,550
So I ran away from the back door.

541
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,520
It was 12:20?

542
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,250
Yes, there was a clock in that restaurant.

543
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,130
There was no one in the kitchen when I left.

544
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,050
There was only a bowl of noodles on the pick-up table.

545
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,200
I didn't kill anyone.

546
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,500
Are you sure

547
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,890
there was no one in the kitchen?

548
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,210
I'm sure.

549
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,720
If there's no one

550
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,860
in the kitchen,

551
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,970
then who made the meat sauce spaghetti

552
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,330
at 12:30?

553
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,310
At 12:30,

554
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,240
Mr. Mo made a bowl of meat sauce spaghetti.

555
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,720
I brought it

556
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,060
to the man who was murdered.

557
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,610
Are you sure?

558
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,820
It was 12:30.

559
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,480
The clock was right behind Mr. He.

560
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,970
Think about it.

561
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,950
Is there something unusual of the meat sauce spaghetti

562
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,530
that day?

563
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,900
Zhang Xiaoxi, what time is it?

564
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,450
The guests are waiting. Hurry.

565
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,350
Please enjoy.

566
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,340
I remember.

567
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,060
Mr. Mo didn't ring the bell that day.

568
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,960
Ring the bell?

569
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,480
Mr. He, I'm too busy.

570
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,640
Go serve the dishes.

571
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,630
Mr. Mo would ring the bell

572
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,800
after he made the dish.

573
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,420
Then we would go and pick up the dish.

574
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,770
I didn't hear the bell that day

575
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,480
until Mr. He urged me.

576
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
I see.

577
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,610
Here's what you want.

578
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,270
Sir, give me the same one.

579
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,470
Okay, wait a moment.

580
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,240
What is this?

581
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,530
Mrs. Feng's shoes

582
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
are imported from the UK.

583
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,800
The size is 5.

584
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,440
But the size of the shoes on Mrs. Feng's feet

585
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,100
is 4.

586
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,230
I think Mrs. Feng's shoe size is 4.

587
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,740
But sometimes she would feel comfortable

588
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,830
if she wore size 5.

589
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,570
Do stockings have size differences?

590
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,920
Of course.

591
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,500
What size of shoes do the size 8 stockings fit?

592
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,430
I wear size 10 stockings and size 6 shoes.

593
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,140
Size 8 should be smaller.

594
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,380
What?

595
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:51,980
Stand up.

596
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,570
No, I can't wear it.

597
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,580
Not at all.

598
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,090
I told you.

599
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,460
I wear size10 stockings.

600
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,890
This is my size.

601
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,100
What size are your shoes?

602
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,670
About nine inches.

603
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,480
What are you looking at?

604
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,100
What is it in UK size?

605
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,140
Size 4

606
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,020
in UK size.

607
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,380
Do you wear size 5 in daily life?

608
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,730
Size 5?

609
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,030
I don't wear high heels in size 5. They are not my fit.

610
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,490
If there are no size for other types of shoes,

611
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,370
size 5 will do.

612
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,690
I don't think you can wear a size 5.

613
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,340
Do you want to die?

614
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,530
Okay, change it.

615
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,250
Tell me, what do you want?

616
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,900
I want to see Shen Huatang.

617
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,550
You want her to wear stockings for you?

618
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,040
The victim found in Plain Lane

619
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,250
was Cheng Xiangjun.

620
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,750
Didn't you say it was Mrs. Feng?

621
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,070
The shoes and the scald on her wrist

622
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
can prove that she is not Cheng Xiangjun.

623
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,450
She is not her.

624
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,260
We were fooled by the murderer.

625
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,120
What do you mean?

626
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,350
Why did Mrs. Feng kill Cheng Xiangjun?

627
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,650
Do you remember what happened

628
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,500
when you met Shen Huatanga at the door?

629
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,540
The time when you saw Yu Daren.

630
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,930
There was a woman named Cheng Xiangjun.

631
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,040
Do you know her?

632
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,230
Cheng Xiangjun, it's her again.

633
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,310
You know her?

634
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,570
Isn't she the one who greeted you

635
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,030
that day?

636
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,670
Which one?

637
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,060
The one who was in front of our bank that day.

638
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,450
I don't remember.

639
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,220
Is there another Cheng Xiangjun?

640
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,220
Probably.

641
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,870
I'll go and get Shen Huatang.

642
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,530
Help me get something from your aunt.

643
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,820
What?

644
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,430
It's a prescription for permanent youth.

645
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,700
Do you have any findings?

646
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,310
I just went back to the police station.

647
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,920
Chen Qingshan will be executed the day after tomorrow.

648
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,390
Moly, Li Chengyan, and Mrs. Feng.

649
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,190
Their lives are all on him.

650
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,930
Didn't Sergeant Bao promise to give us three days?

651
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,840
Yes.

652
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,380
Yesterday, today, tomorrow.

653
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,610
Three days.

654
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,630
The execution is on the day after tomorrow.

655
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,060
Yesterday should not be counted.

656
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,850
You should be happy that it's not tomorrow.

657
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,480
Chen Qingshan is an honest man.

658
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,340
And he didn't kill those people.

659
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,570
Why will he be the scapegoat?

660
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,440
It's not as simple as you think.

661
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,640
After investigation,

662
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,240
Feng Chengchu is proved to be an agent.

663
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,010
He has worked for the Beiyang Government.

664
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
After the leaders know about it,

665
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,670
they don't want to investigate further.

666
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,810
At this time, Chen Qingshan came and did them a favor.

667
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,840
They are all happy about it.

668
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,980
He's unlucky.

669
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,520
You just watch them do this?

670
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,290
What can I do?

671
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,680
What can I do?

672
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,600
After all, Chen Qingshan is an attempted murderer.

673
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Besides,

674
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,440
we can't find any new evidence.

675
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,770
I don't want to talk to you.

676
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,380
Just kidding.

677
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,460
Here's the thing.

678
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,370
The leaders kept it secret

679
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,620
and don't allow anyone to talk about it.

680
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,100
They even don't allow anyone to catch Feng Chengchu.

681
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,350
Do you know why?

682
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,620
Zhao Qiansun died.

683
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,280
What?

684
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,760
Just a few leaders know about this.

685
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,710
How did he die?

686
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,190
He was killed by a professional killer.

687
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,550
The killer didn't leave any trace.

688
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,650
For the gems?

689
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,670
Most likely.

690
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,870
When the body was found,

691
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,250
there was nothing.

692
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,460
Do you know where the gems are?

693
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,500
How could we know that?

694
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,320
He is dead and the stuff is gone.

695
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,350
No clue at all.

696
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,390
As long as the gems haven't been exchanged into money,

697
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,810
it's a pile of stones.

698
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,650
Keep an eye on the exchange channels,

699
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,720
and there will be clues sooner or later.

700
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,800
It's easier said than done.

701
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
All gems look the same.

702
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,740
How could we investigate it?

703
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,300
How can all gems be the same?

704
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,640
The cutting facets are different and the fire is different.

705
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,500
Not to mention the purity or the color.

706
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,080
You could say that

707
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,340
there are no two same gems in the world.

708
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,710
Be quiet now.

709
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,310
Situ, Shen Huatang is here.

710
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,390
Chen Qingshan didn't say anything bad

711
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,070
about you.

712
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
Does he need to say anything?

713
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,630
He tried to kill Yu

714
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,240
and it already made me a bad person.

715
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,770
Although Yu didn't say anything,

716
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,130
he must hate me.

717
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,930
You made him think that

718
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,680
your relationship would be better

719
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,280
and eventually made things worse.

720
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,270
And you are just enjoying

721
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,210
the love of him.

722
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,730
Mr. Situ,

723
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,120
I don't know

724
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,100
why you are thinking of me like this.

725
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,350
It's rude to refuse someone bluntly.

726
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,300
It will hurt the person who loves you.

727
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,470
He proposed to you

728
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,250
and you looked down upon his poor family,

729
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,770
but you never refused him.

730
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,500
Your so-called manners

731
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,770
is not to avoid

732
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,180
hurting those who love you,

733
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,620
but to make yourself feel better

734
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,970
by claiming to be moral.

735
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,170
So, you had to let your stepfather

736
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,420
to be the bad guy.

737
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,780
In Chen Qingshan's heart,

738
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,470
you love him as he loves you.

739
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,890
But you can't be together

740
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,130
because of

741
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,690
your evil stepfather.

742
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,110
In this way, another man

743
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,440
kept you in his heart forever.

744
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,190
Unfortunately,

745
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,120
he will never know that

746
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,150
you had looked down upon him

747
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,000
since the beginning.

748
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,340
I don't know

749
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,900
why you think so.

750
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,960
In another way,

751
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,140
if I ask Mr. Luo

752
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,690
to marry a poor girl,

753
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,010
will you agree?

754
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:16,850
Yes, I will.

755
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,910
I have everything.

756
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:18,720
Fine.

757
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,570
What if I ask Miss Zhou to marry

758
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,980
a poor man?

759
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,060
I will not allow it.

760
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,620
Why does Jingxuan marry someone who has nothing?

761
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,310
So you never approve of

762
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,770
the marriage between your mother and Yu Daren.

763
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,080
This is my personal affair.

764
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,080
I don't need others to judge me.

765
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,420
Mr. Situ,

766
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
if you invite me here

767
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,770
just to gossip about

768
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,350
my family.

769
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,870
I'm sorry.

770
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,310
Excuse me.

771
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,210
There's something you may not know.

772
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,430
Strychnine can't cause chronic poisoning.

773
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,260
If the patient follows the doctor's order,

774
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,570
strychnine won't cause chronic poisoning.

775
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,070
But your mother did die of strychnine.

776
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,330
That means it was a murder.

777
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,530
It was not an accident.

778
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,110
I checked the file.

779
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,580
Your brother Shen Huarong asked the police to close the case.

780
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,560
But your brother studied medicine.

781
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,699
He must know that.

782
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,030
What do you mean?

783
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,170
You want to say that my brother killed my mother?

784
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,659
How much did Chen Qingshan give you

785
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,889
to defend him?

786
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
You want money, right?

787
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,400
I'll give you the money. Can you shut up?

788
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,530
Miss Shen, I know you love your mother.

789
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,320
Don't you want to know the truth?

790
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,199
Trust me.

791
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,630
Situ Yan won't be bribed by anyone.

792
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,250
He will only find the truth.

793
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,050
Situ helped me

794
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,179
find the clues when my father was murdered.

795
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,380
And he solved the case.

796
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:58,070
Huatang, trust us.

797
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,020
We mean no harm.

798
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,080
What do you want to know?

799
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,180
Tell me the beginning of the case

800
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,410
and everything that happened to your mother.

801
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,930
I can tell you what happened.

802
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,420
But you have to promise

803
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,600
you won't disturb my family,

804
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,820
my brother and my sister-in-law.

805
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,660
Okay.

806
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,410
This case

807
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,980
is an old story in Harbin.

808
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,230
One morning three years ago,

809
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,090
we found my mother

810
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,390
died in her bed.

811
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,510
That was something

812
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,050
that I can never forget in my life.

813
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Because it's the end of the season,

814
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,760
Yu spent the whole night checking the accounts in the bank

815
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,600
and didn't come back.

816
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,000
But after the incident, a doctor reported

817
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,160
that Yu went to buy strychnine.

818
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,020
[Last Will]

819
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,570
Plus, in my mother's will,

820
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,310
she left most of her properties

821
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,400
to Yu Daren.

822
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,080
The police,

823
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,470
my brother and I

824
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,280
all thought he was the murderer.

825
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,860
But he's not.

826
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,350
That day,

827
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,460
we witnessed the trial.

828
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,410
How do you say I killed my wife?

829
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,270
You married Shen Baifeng

830
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,460
with bad intentions.

831
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,130
We've investigated it.

832
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,930
Shen Baifeng left you most of her properties

833
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,850
in her will.

834
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,110
Once she dies,

835
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,060
you'll be the biggest beneficiary.

836
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,330
Fine.

837
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,900
If you insist,

838
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,910
please show me the evidence.

839
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,430
We've checked.

840
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,670
Before the incident,

841
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,610
you went to the hospital to buy strychnine.

842
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,350
The doctor in the hospital

843
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,940
recognized you right away.

844
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,130
Officer.

845
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,130
You said I killed my wife

846
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,550
to get her properties.

847
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,020
Then you said I went to the hospital to buy strychnine

848
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,230
and let the doctor recognize me.

849
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,290
Is there something wrong with my mind?

850
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,380
Or is there something wrong with your mind?

851
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,790
I've told you.

852
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,260
I was checking accounts in the bank.

853
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,140
At the end of every season,

854
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,020
I will be very busy.

855
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,080
I don't have time to go other places.

856
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,900
If you don't believe me,

857
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,010
you can go to the bank

858
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,790
and ask everyone.

859
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,750
It's him, but it doesn't seem like him.

860
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,270
Is it him or not?

861
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,710
It's likely to be him.

862
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,000
What do you mean?

863
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,730
Is it him or not?

864
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,880
What do you mean by likely?

865
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,710
Mr. Yu wore a hat that day.

866
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,510
I didn't see his face.

867
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,040
He seemed to be Mr. Yu.

868
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,660
But now it seems that

869
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,620
Mr. Yu should be a little thinner that day.

870
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,890
Is it because he was standing that day,

871
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,210
so you think he should be thinner?

872
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
It's possible.

873
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,580
Do you know how to solve the case?

874
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,860
I told you he's the murderer.

875
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,560
You can just arrest him.

876
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,730
No one will want to kill my mother.

877
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,440
Could it be...

878
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,850
Could it be something wrong

879
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,690
with the beauty medicine our mother took?

880
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,580
It contains the composition of strychnine.

881
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,210
I've persuaded her to stop taking it.

882
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,690
What beauty medicine?

883
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,920
It's the medicine containing strychnine.

884
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,370
My mother didn't listen to me.

885
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,810
She's already taken two or three courses of treatment.

886
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,000
How about this?

887
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,820
We will take this back

888
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,990
and give it to the doctor.

889
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,000
Okay.

890
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,150
A few days later,

891
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,400
the police said that the medicine contained strychnine.

892
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,230
So the case was closed.

893
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,600
I admit

894
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,880
I did have a prejudice against Yu Daren.

895
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,570
He is so much younger than my mother.

896
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,670
He has nothing other than being young.

897
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,710
My brother and I were against their marriage.

898
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,450
But my mother was infatuated with him.

899
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,830
She fell deeply in love

900
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,090
with this young and talented man,

901
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,600
and insisted on being with him.

902
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,460
Now,

903
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,150
my mother passed away three years ago.

904
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,370
Yu really devoted himself

905
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,680
to the bank.

906
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,460
He treats us well.

907
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,900
So,

908
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,090
we might wrong him.

909
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,510
Your brother agreed to give up the investigation

910
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,210
and closed the case with beauty medicine poisoning.

911
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,590
Yes.

912
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,890
Do you remember what happened the day before your mother died?

913
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,990
Of course I do.

914
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,960
It was engraved in my mind.

915
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,250
I can't accept my brother and the police's

916
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,500
conclusion.

917
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,100
But I don't know who the murderer is.

918
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,240
I'm sorry.

919
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,250
The day before my mother died

920
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,380
was my birthday.

921
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,420
The power went out that day,

922
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,080
so we went home late.

923
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,590
The next morning,

924
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,640
my mother had a fight with my sister-in-law.

925
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,290
It was loud.

926
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,460
Really?

927
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,050
Then what did you put in the cabinet?

928
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,170
Don't be suspicious

929
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,340
at home.

930
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,420
Huarong doesn't want to go home because of you.

931
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:42,710
Because of me?

932
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,130
It's obvious that he has someone else in his heart.

933
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,650
Don't you know

934
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,480
what I've been going through these years?

935
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,400
Come on, it's early in the morning.

936
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,480
He is with those sluts out there.

937
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,360
It's fine.

938
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,770
Now,

939
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,690
he almost brings his childhood crush

940
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,770
to my bed.

941
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,770
Just because he's your son,

942
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,290
so you are covering him like this?

943
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,040
I...

944
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,370
Don't you know how I treat you

945
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,490
all these years?

946
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,930
I treat you

947
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,410
like my daughter.

948
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,340
Do you know it?

949
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,480
I know.

950
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,460
The Shen family could get the achievement today

951
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,460
because of me.

952
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,420
If your son divorced me,

953
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,690
my father won't forgive you.

954
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,250
So you'd better show me the evidence

955
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,570
and make it clear.

956
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,260
What evidence?

957
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,900
It was not about Huarong I was talking to Yantong.

958
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,250
Shut up. It's early in the morning.

959
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,610
You've known that my brother has someone else in his heart

960
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,290
since you got married.

961
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,790
No man will completely forget

962
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,690
his love history

963
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,730
before he got married.

964
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,890
Your whole family is against me, right?

965
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,210
Yes.

966
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,720
I'm an outsider.

967
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,890
So it's useless for me

968
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,980
to talk to you.

969
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,550
Why are you messing around here?

970
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,800
I'm telling the truth.

971
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,950
My brother is a man.

972
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,480
He could marry as many as women he wants.

973
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,240
You are so noisy.

974
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,620
What was your mother hiding?

975
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
A love letter.

976
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,270
My sister-in-law said

977
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,750
it said

978
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,610
"if the love between us can last forever,

979
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,860
why do we need to stay together night and day" on it.

980
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,410
It was probably written by my brother

981
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,980
to his lover.

982
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,540
Then my mother saw it

983
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,030
and wanted to hide it

984
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,530
from my sister-in-law.

985
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,880
Unexpectedly,

986
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,570
she was caught in the act.

987
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,460
Your mother didn't show her the letter?
