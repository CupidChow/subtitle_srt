1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,000
Where was he assassinated?

3
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,759
On the way to the train station.

4
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,000
Did the kidnapper inform the Japanese Consulate?

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,759
Kondo's driver is very suspicious.

6
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,680
He ran away after the incident.

7
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,640
We couldn't find him anywhere.

8
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,320
He probably fled to escape punishment.

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,280
I didn't expect that

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,720
they failed to assassinate him and came to kidnap him.

11
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,000
Please tell me more details

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
about the assassination.

13
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,840
As planned,

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
we departed from Langsu Road.

15
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,600
But when we're getting to the roulette,

16
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,840
the driver Jin Yanping

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
suddenly turned the car into Sitiao Road.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,560
After Consul Kondo was assassinated near Spring Park,

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,960
the driver drove away immediately.

20
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,320
Then Wang Chaowei took the consul

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,360
for a simple bandage,

22
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,840
and they met us on the Langsu Road.

23
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,560
How long has the consul been in China?

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
A year.

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,720
How long has the driver been working for him?

26
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,400
About

27
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,360
a month.

28
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,080
What about Wang Chaowei?

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,560
He studied in Japan.

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,520
He's been working at the Japanese Consulate since he came back.

31
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,600
Consul Kondo likes him very much

32
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,960
and hired him as translator as soon as he came.

33
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,880
He has been working for the Japanese for a long time.

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,720
He's not likely to be disloyal.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
Are they all from Fengtian?

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,079
Wang Chaowei was born and raised in Fengtian.

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,600
But some of his family died and some escaped

38
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,880
Now there are only two aunts living in Fengtian.

39
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,800
One is teaching at Chunri Elementary School,

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,600
and the other lives in Xiaodongguan.

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Jin Yanping is from the countryside.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's alone.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
It's easier to bribe him.

44
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Change lane.

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,720
Assassination.

46
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,920
Shoot.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,040
Consul was injured.

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,040
The driver ran away.

49
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,240
How is the consul?

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,400
Not serious.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,200
Wang Chaowei said

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,840
the criminal broke the window

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
with a shotgun.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,240
It's the glass that cut Consul Kondo's face.

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,440
Don't move!

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,159
Sir.

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,360
Run!

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,760
Shotgun?

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Bandits?

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
Maybe they want to disguise as bandits.

61
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,800
At this critical moment,

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
you should know

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,920
the consequences of assassinating the consul.

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Where did he get treatment?

65
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Have you checked?

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
The consul said he's fine.

67
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,480
I can't ask more.

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,640
Consul Kondo.

69
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
Are you okay?

70
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,120
Take me to the train station.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
Take me to the train station.

72
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,760
Why don't you take a rest first?

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,520
I said take me to the train station.

74
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
I said

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,240
take me to the train station.

76
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,840
Okay.

77
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,840
Okay.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,640
Where's the driver?

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
He ran away.

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,920
Ran away?

81
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,800
We don't know Consul Kondo very well.

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,520
I don't know his temper.

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,640
So I can only adjust to him.

84
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't move.

85
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,120
Shoot me.

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,040
Come on.

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,760
Come on.

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,320
Mr. Luo.

89
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't bother.

90
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,200
If it explodes, all of us will...

91
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,680
Don't move.

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,440
Don't move!

93
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,440
How dare you point a gun at me?

94
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,320
Take her down.

95
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,280
Let's see who dares. Come on.

96
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,520
You two go first.

97
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,120
I'll hold them.

98
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,400
I know where the consul is.

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,360
General.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
Please give me two minutes.

101
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
They kidnapped the Japanese Consul

102
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,520
for evil intentions.

103
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,800
This is not within your control.

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,320
It's fine if you're wrong.

105
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,480
What if you're right?

106
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,480
You are the one who will be in trouble.

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680
I don't know who

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,520
planned this kidnapping.

109
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,000
But I can't let the country

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
get into trouble.

111
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
How were you forced to leave?

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Why did you come to Harbin?

113
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
Have you forgotten?

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,920
Look outside.

115
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,800
Those bastards.

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
How are you going to save

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
this corrupted country?

118
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,000
The corrupted one is not the country,

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,040
but the Beiyang Government,

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,680
the system born against the times.

121
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,720
We're looking for a change.

122
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,640
We're looking for a path

123
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,600
to grow independently from internal and external troubles.

124
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,800
But we can't grow

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
on the basis of war.

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
This is what every Chinese with conscience

127
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,960
doesn't want to see.

128
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,480
For institutional changes,

129
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,840
sacrifice is inevitable.

130
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,960
The establishment of a new institution

131
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,040
will always encounter the resistance from the old times.

132
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,240
It's true.

133
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,400
Sacrifice is inevitable.

134
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
But the sacrifice shouldn't be

135
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,200
of endless desperation and pain.

136
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,880
It shouldn't be

137
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,720
vengeful spirits killed by the invaders.

138
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,400
We should have endless yearning for tomorrow.

139
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,800
Burn ourselves

140
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,520
at the darkest time

141
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
and shine.

142
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Sacrifice

143
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,520
should be self-realised,

144
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
instead of letting others die.

145
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,040
You said Wang Chaowei's aunt is teaching here.

146
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,880
Yes.

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,640
Where does she live?

148
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Next to the school.

149
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,680
Consul Kondo is here.

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,880
How is that possible?

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,400
I sent Consul Kondo to the train myself.

152
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,120
You can send two people

153
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,920
to check the nearby hospitals.

154
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,560
If I'm not mistaken,

155
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080
there'll be no record of Consul Kondo.

156
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,280
Yes.

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,480
What does it have to do with the records?

158
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,520
Kondo can't be in Fengtian.

159
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,320
The person with gauze on his face

160
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,600
is not Consul Kondo at all.

161
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
He assassinatied

162
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,120
and shot the consul's face with a shotgun

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,920
so that the consul could be covered with gauze.

164
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,560
You don't know him well.

165
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,400
So as long as he doesn't talk much

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
and you don't contact him directly,

167
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,280
no one will find out

168
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,560
the person on the train is not the real consul.

169
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,840
How is that possible?

170
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,720
Can't his translator recognize him?

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,800
His translator...

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,640
He's loyal to the Japanese

173
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,840
doesn't mean he's loyal to Kondo.

174
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
The driver suddenly deviated from the original route

175
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
and disappeared.

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,480
You think he worked with others and

177
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,320
is the most suspicious.

178
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,720
But there is a fatal logical loophole.

179
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,640
If Jin Yanping is guilty,

180
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,680
why would he escape with risks

181
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,840
when the consul was assassinated?

182
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,040
So it's Wang Chaowei who lied.

183
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,760
Jin Yanping left the main road and drove into the alley

184
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,200
because Wang Chaowei

185
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,600
gave orders to him as Kondo.

186
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,800
Jin Yanping just worked in the Japanese Consulate

187
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,600
so he won't be suspicious.

188
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,200
So

189
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
he drove to the Spring Park.

190
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Turn left then.

191
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,440
What?

192
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,680
The consul told us

193
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,440
to go to the Spring Park first.

194
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,680
So turn left.

195
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,320
Okay.

196
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,640
What's wrong?

197
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,560
Nothing, sir.

198
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
Who are you?

199
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,760
Move.

200
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,160
They mentioned the shotgun

201
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,920
to explain the injury on the consul's face.

202
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,840
He just got injured

203
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
and his Chinese is poor.

204
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,360
But with a familiar translator,

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,320
people won't suspect.

206
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,880
When the train arrived in Harbin,

207
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,960
Wang Chaowei and the fake Kondo left

208
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
and threw the car away

209
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,920
to create a feint that

210
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,600
Kondo was kidnapped in Harbin.

211
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
In that case,

212
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
no matter how we investigate,

213
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,360
Kondokawa will never appear again.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,640
Report!

215
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,280
We've checked.

216
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,200
The hospitals and clinics nearby

217
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,840
didn't treat the Japanese Consul.

218
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,600
Hurry!

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,960
Consul Kondo is in danger.

220
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:07,960
Move.

221
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Who are you?

222
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
Tell me what you want.

223
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,840
Bastard.

224
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
I'm the Japanese Consul.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
You want to die?

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
You are not Chinese.

227
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,280
Who are you?

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
How dare you do this to me!

229
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,960
Don't think you can be safe.

230
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,120
Nurse.

231
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
How's the consul's injury?

232
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,840
Just a scratch.

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
Nothing serious.

234
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,760
I heard you found me.

235
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,320
Yes, sir.

236
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,480
I know

237
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,800
we plan to hold responsible for the failure of protection.

238
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,440
I can't go to the consulate with you.

240
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,080
However,

241
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,720
as long as you take out this letter,

242
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
they won't be able to hold responsible for it.

243
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,920
Report!

244
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
What did the kidnapper say?

245
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,760
He took poison.

246
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,400
Poison?

247
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,320
What poison?

248
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
It's said that it's the castor bean.

249
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
I don't even know that's poisonous.

250
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,320
Castor beans again?

251
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,880
Can you tell me why?

252
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't want this incident

253
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,800
cause any conflicts.

254
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,840
Detective.

255
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,640
I'll leave Fengtian as soon as possible.

256
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,240
Do you think it'll work

257
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,720
to tie that trash on me?

258
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,680
Lu, listen.

259
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,160
Apologize immediately.

260
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,680
You.

261
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,040
You have such a good role model.

262
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,080
Can't you learn from the model?

263
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,360
Are you talking about me?

264
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Don't flatter yourself.

265
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,920
What are you doing?

266
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
Thank you for

267
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,360
taking care of Shaochuan. Detective.

268
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
Don't change the subject.

269
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,400
I'm asking you to apologize.

270
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
Alright, let's move on.

271
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,400
We also found something.

272
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,760
Wang Chaowei's aunt

273
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,280
is actually a Japanese.

274
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,120
She has been acting in the name of Chinese.

275
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
This kidnapping

276
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
was a big play by them.

277
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,200
I was too rash back then.

278
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,760
Can I say sorry

279
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,200
to the Zhou family?

280
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,960
If you say sorry,

281
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,840
can Fang Huaijin be resurrected?

282
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,320
I hope you can be more careful in the future.

283
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,680
I'm old.

284
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,960
These things

285
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,640
depend on you youngsters.

286
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,160
Officer Zhang,

287
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,800
I have another question for you.

288
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,120
Are you mocking me?

289
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,680
Save it.

290
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,080
I've heard too much.

291
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,120
Have you heard of

292
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,280
a Japanese spy organization?

293
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,360
They usually use castor beans to eliminate dissidents.

294
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
As I said,

295
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,840
all crows are black.

296
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,800
If you want to be a white one,

297
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,320
you have to die.

298
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,240
Got it.

299
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,440
Hold on.

300
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,720
But I heard a word.

301
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,960
I don't know if it

302
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
has anything to do with

303
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,720
the organization you mentioned.

304
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,720
Oracle.

305
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,440
Li Yuanpu is dead.

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,000
Do you know?

307
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,360
Isn't he detained first?

308
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,240
How did he die?

309
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,319
He committed suicide.

310
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,480
I think he can't get over it.

311
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,040
He killed someone.

312
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,160
He had been keeping it in his heart for so many years.

313
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,359
But his junior found out about it.

314
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,560
If it were me, I would have fallen apart.

315
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe senior

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,520
is not that bad.

317
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,880
Oracle.

318
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,840
What does it mean?

319
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,720
What do you mean?

320
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,840
My teacher, Shen Jianxian,

321
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
your father,

322
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,920
and Xie Hua

323
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,600
all attended the banquet of

324
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
setting up the Lawyer Association.

325
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
But the purpose of setting up the association

326
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,360
is to withdraw the extraterritoriality.

327
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,600
Withdraw the extraterritoriality?

328
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,000
It's even about the country.

329
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
It's none of our business.

330
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,280
My teacher has an underlying disease.

331
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
So Madam and the police

332
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,240
think he died of a sudden.

333
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
They didn't dissect the body.

334
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,800
But my father was killed by Xie Hua.

335
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,560
You investigated it.

336
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,600
It's for certain.

337
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,320
Moly was also killed by Yu Daren.

338
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
But he also committed suicide

339
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,760
in prison by taking castor beans.

340
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,640
What do you think?

341
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,480
I don't know what happened before.

342
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,120
But if there is such an organization,

343
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,120
it's too powerful.

344
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,600
Situ.

345
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Mr. Luo. Miss Zhou.

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,080
You are finally back.

347
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,800
It's cold these days.

348
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,120
I asked Mr. He to prepare a pot.

349
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Let's eat lamb.

350
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,880
Go ahead.

351
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,200
I left in a hurry this time.

352
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
I'll go back to visit Madam first.

353
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,680
I'll go with you.

354
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,080
Let me ask you something.

355
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,640
Here.

356
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,120
Okay, I'm leaving.

357
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,840
Let's go.

358
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,640
You're finally back.

359
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,080
It's a long journey.

360
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,960
You must be tired.

361
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,400
Madam.

362
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,320
Actually,

363
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,960
I have a question for you.

364
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,200
Have you ever thought there's something wrong

365
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,840
with teacher's passing?

366
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
It's me.

367
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,200
It's all my fault.

368
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,120
How did Mr. Shen die?

369
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,680
Mr. Luo

370
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
advised to

371
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,480
borrow Mr. Du Heng's apartment

372
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,400
to raise funds for the Lawyer Association.

373
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,280
The guests that day

374
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,360
were all friends of

375
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,840
Mr. Luo and Mr. Shen.

376
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,440
Mr. Shen

377
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,840
had the heart disease.

378
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
No one expected that he would die

379
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,000
after several drinks.

380
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,400
That day,

381
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,360
Madam and Miss Zou were also there.

382
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,320
What's doubtful?

383
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,480
I don't think so.

384
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,440
But Mr. Du thought

385
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,160
something's wrong.

386
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,480
He and Miss Zou had investigated for a while.

387
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,600
But nothing was found.

388
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
They they just let it go.

389
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,200
Mr. Shen's funeral was quite grand.

390
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,120
Has Mr. Shen's body been dissected?

391
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,360
You have to ask Dr. Fang.

392
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,600
He worked on it.

393
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,400
Fang Jianqi?

394
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay, let's go.

395
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,920
Where are we going?

396
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,040
To see Dr. Fang,

397
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,240
figure the things out.

398
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,680
and wait for Situ's conclusion.

399
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,400
Are you hungry?

400
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,880
Let's go for barbecue.

401
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
I don't want to go out.

402
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,840
It's cold outside.

403
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,160
Why don't we cook something at home?

404
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,520
I'll cook noodles for you.

405
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
What do you have at home?

406
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,520
Tomatoes.

407
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,120
Eggs.

408
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,560
Tomato egg noodles.

409
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,800
You want to re-investigate Mr. Shen's death?

410
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,920
I don't know how to tell Madam.

411
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,920
You saw her reaction.

412
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,920
I really don't want to reveal the scar in her heart.

413
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
But this scar has been infected.

414
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,960
If we don't remove the slough,

415
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Mrs. Shen will never recover.

416
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,400
Previously,

417
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
you investigated my family's case.

418
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,080
I was very angry,

419
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
sad,

420
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,880
and painful after knowing it.

421
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,320
But think about it now,

422
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,960
I'm grateful.

423
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,560
I just told you

424
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,800
what I saw.

425
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,960
Don't take what I said

426
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,360
to heart.

427
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,400
I am

428
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,360
a sharp-tongued person.

429
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,200
Actually, I know

430
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,560
you and Luo Shaochuan went to Fengtian to investigate this case

431
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,200
because you treat me as your friend.

432
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,440
Otherwise, there're so many unjust cases

433
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,400
in Harbin

434
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,120
but you didn't investigate them

435
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,840
and reverse them.

436
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,600
I didn't expect you can cook.

437
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,320
Otherwise, how can I live alone in Beijing?

438
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,120
It's delicious.

439
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,600
This's for you.

440
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,560
What?

441
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,680
A small gift.

442
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,560
Why are you suddenly giving me a gift?

443
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,800
Why are you being so nice suddenly?

444
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,440
What do you want?

445
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,680
You helped me so much.

446
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,120
You're my assistant

447
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,320
but refused to get paid.

448
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,800
So I can only give you a small gift.

449
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,680
Being so nice suddenly?

450
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
You work as my assistant for free.

451
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Why?

452
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,680
Spinel.

453
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,400
It's not worth much.

454
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,680
If you don't like it, I...

455
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
You can't get back the gifts

456
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,960
you sent.

457
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,400
Put it on for me.

458
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,840
Situ, bad news.

459
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,320
What happened?

460
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,920
Mr. Luo took me to see Dr. Fang.

461
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
But something happened.

462
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,880
Are we almost there?

463
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,560
It's broken.

464
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,120
Why did you shake the flashlight?

465
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,600
Mr. Luo.

466
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,560
Why did you drive your car here?

467
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,400
Shut up.

468
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,520
I'll leave after asking Dr. Fang some questions.

469
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,360
Can't I get closer?

470
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Who are you?

471
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,040
My name is Jin Mantang.

472
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,600
Mr. Fang's casual labourer.

473
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,720
Master asked me to get a telegram.

474
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
I heard a car coming.

475
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,200
I just took a look.

476
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,560
I'm sorry for staring at you.

477
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,000
You could

478
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,240
just leave the car here.

479
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,920
When you and the two ladies leave,

480
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,320
I'll fix it for you.

481
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,680
Two ladies?

482
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,160
Miss Bai and Miss Zou.

483
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,480
Aren't you invited

484
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,040
to attend master's banquet?

485
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,800
Banquet?

486
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,400
This is a little gift for Jingxuan.

487
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,760
Dr. Fang is so generous.

488
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,600
It's not easy to buy this cleaning mud.

489
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,240
OK.

490
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,920
I'll take it for them.

491
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,240
Speaking of them,

492
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,520
a lot of lawsuits just occur in my mind.

493
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,600
Don't worry.

494
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,000
We don't need to be anxious.

495
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,680
In my opinion,

496
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,760
Jingxuan is still young.

497
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,520
No hurry.

498
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,720
She's not young.

499
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,520
Her mother gave birth to her

500
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,360
in her age.

501
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,400
She's not young.

502
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,280
Jingxuan is not your biological daughter?

503
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,080
My master passed away early.

504
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,640
There's no chance for me to have children.

505
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,560
My cousin

506
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,680
had been in poor health since she gave birth to Jingxuan.

507
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,880
She passed away

508
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,600
in less than two years.

509
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,760
I saw she look so lovely

510
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,200
so I raised her myself.

511
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,760
Mrs. Bai,

512
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,440
you take good care of yourself.

513
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Look at your hands.

514
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
Fair and clear.

515
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,880
You don't even have a mole.

516
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
Look at you.

517
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,760
Full of speckles.

518
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,480
As a doctor,

519
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,520
I don't care about that.

520
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,640
Mr. Luo.

521
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
Please.

522
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,560
You go in first.

523
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,880
This way, please.

524
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,040
Shaochuan?

525
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,080
When did you come back?

526
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,040
Why didn't you tell me?

527
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,920
I just came back today.

528
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,040
I heard you went to Fengtian.

529
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,760
Yes.

530
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,000
It's good that you're back.

531
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,920
Otherwise, when you were alone in Beijing,

532
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,720
I always worried about you.

533
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,040
Didn't you say

534
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,360
you would come back later?

535
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,880
That was my plan.

536
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,880
Why are you here?

537
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,280
I should ask you that.

538
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,240
Four characters.

539
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,160
Master.

540
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,120
I got the telegram.

541
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Mr. Luo said he wanted to see you.

542
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,560
Shaochuan is here?

543
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,120
Mr. Luo.

544
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
Mrs. Dr. Fang.

545
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,280
Mr. Luo wants to ask Dr. Fang about an old case.

546
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
What day is it today?

547
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,240
There are so many good things.

548
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,320
Can you play mahjong?

549
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,440
Play two rounds for me.

550
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
I'll go greet the rare guests.

551
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
You don't like socialization.

552
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,760
If Auntie asks you to come,

553
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,240
just reject her. Don't spoil her.

554
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,280
No.

555
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,120
I came here on my own.

556
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,480
I want to see Dr. Fang.

557
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,160
Dr. Fang?

558
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,000
Those who see Dr. Fang are dead.

559
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,560
I was wondering what brings Mr. Luo here.

560
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,280
So you came here to find your fiancee?

561
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,080
Just a coincidence.

562
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,560
Get some wine.

563
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,040
Yes.

564
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,880
I came here

565
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,720
for a few questions.

566
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,680
We'll leave after that.

567
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
Don't worry.

568
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Ask me after dinner.

569
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,840
You are our guest tonight.

570
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,280
Master,

571
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,080
the dinner is ready.

572
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,640
Please be seated.

573
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,360
Thank you.

574
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,840
Thank you.

575
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,920
For you.

576
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,480
Thank you.

577
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,800
Please.

578
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,640
I don't drink.

579
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,800
I want this wine.

580
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,280
OK.

581
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm very glad that

582
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,840
you would like to be here.

583
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,600
A few months ago,

584
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,280
we also got together.

585
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,520
But today...

586
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,760
Things are unpredictable.

587
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,440
Now we have

588
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,040
a few new friends.

589
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,280
Here.

590
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,920
I think

591
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,360
you don't need new friends.

592
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,520
What you need

593
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,640
is a girlfriend.

594
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
You can be the matchmaker for him.

595
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Does Dr. Fang need me to be his matchmaker?

596
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,840
I'm too old to love.

597
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
But Mr. Luo,

598
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,720
when is your wedding?

599
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,320
We can wait.

600
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,720
But someone

601
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,800
can't wait anymore.

602
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
Watch your mouth.

603
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,720
Come on.

604
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,560
Let's

605
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,520
cheers.

606
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,560
Wish us good health.

607
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,120
Wish couples be together.

608
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,280
Master.

609
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,200
Master!

610
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,080
Master, what's wrong?

611
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,760
Master!

612
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,440
Master!

613
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,640
Master! Master!

614
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,240
Dr. Fang! Dr. Fang!

615
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,440
I'll call the police.

616
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Stop!

617
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,360
Without my permission,

618
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,120
on one can leave.

619
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,280
Qiming.

620
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,320
Go get Bao and Situ.

621
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:09,600
OK.

622
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,320
That's what happened.

623
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,440
He died

624
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,040
before we asked him anything.

625
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,680
That means Dr. Fang's death

626
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,840
is exactly the same as my teacher's.

627
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,280
Mr. Luo has blocked the scene.

628
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,360
I'll inform Sergeant Bao.

629
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,480
Call Madam for me.

630
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,040
Now?

631
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,680
Yes.

632
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,840
Now.

633
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,240
I don't agree.

634
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,560
I really think teacher was murdered.

635
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,720
Don't you want to know who the murderer is?

636
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,880
I knew you were suspicious

637
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
when you asked me.

638
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,560
I'm responsible for his death.

639
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,360
I should leave him alone after he died.

640
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,400
Situ,

641
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,120
without your teacher,

642
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,600
you can figure out the cases.

643
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,840
Let him go, okay?

644
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,760
You don't mean to let him go.

645
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,840
You just don't want to let yourself go.

646
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,960
You want to use Mr. Shen's passing

647
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,719
to torture yourself forever.

648
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,719
After Siqi passed away,

649
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,679
you've been complaining and torturing Mr. Shen.

650
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,159
Until he died,

651
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,719
you realized that

652
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,280
you're not the only one who lost the child,

653
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,000
but also him.

654
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,960
So you want to get salvation from torturing yourself.

655
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,760
Madam.

656
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,199
Whenever you asked about my parents,

657
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,000
I avoided it anxiously.

658
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,520
Because people said my dad didn't love me and my mom

659
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,679
so my mom killed him.

660
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,440
I'm a murderer's daughter.

661
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
I've been avoiding this all these years

662
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,880
until...

663
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,120
until Situ found out the secret.

664
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,440
He unveiled the scar.

665
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,200
There was a pus inside.

666
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,080
After he removed the slough in my heart,

667
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,840
I realized

668
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,120
it's an unjust case.

669
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,640
Because of my escape,

670
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,680
my mother's injustices

671
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,880
couldn't be righted for so many years.

672
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,200
Madam.

673
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,360
Every murder case

674
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,720
is the victim's forced farewell

675
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
to this world.

676
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
The truth is

677
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,800
the only request for the living.

678
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,800
Mr. Shen is such a famous lawyer.

679
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,640
Do you really want to see

680
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,760
a lawyer's request

681
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,320
will be buried forever?

682
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,880
How is it?

683
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,240
It's a sign of poisoning.

684
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,440
Castor beans?

685
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,680
No.

686
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,560
It's nicotine.

687
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm sorry.

688
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,440
I didn't see you when I was in a hurry.

689
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,320
Are you okay?

690
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,760
You're so reckless.

691
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,720
Yes.

692
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,440
You're right.

693
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,160
I'm glad you're fine.

694
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,120
What's wrong? Are you okay?

695
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,840
I drove too fast.

696
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,200
It's OK.

697
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,960
Mr. Du.

698
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,560
Miss Zhou.

699
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,840
This is Mr. Du.

700
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,320
He is a friend of Mr. Shen and Dr. Fang.

701
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,920
I'm Situ Yan,

702
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
a student of Mr. Shen.

703
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,600
Nice to meet you.

704
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,000
Nice to meet you.

705
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,680
I think we met at Mr. Shen's funeral.

706
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,040
Right?

707
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,120
Time flies

708
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,720
when it comes to Mr. Shen.

709
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,000
By the way, Mr. Du,

710
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,960
they held the banquet

711
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,360
at your place.

712
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,200
Mr. Luo brought up the idea.

713
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
I prepared it with Dr. Fang.

714
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,800
What's wrong?

715
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,280
Dr. Fang was killed.

716
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,640
You mean Fang Jianqi and Mr. Shen

717
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,960
were murdered?

718
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,040
It depends on the autopsy result of Dr. Fang.

719
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040
I knew it.

720
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,240
You suspected it a long time ago?

721
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,320
Yes.

722
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,480
Think about it.

723
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,840
After all, it happened at my place.

724
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
I felt bad.

725
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
You just said

726
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,800
Nicotine was found at the scene.

727
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,360
But

728
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,720
we didn't find nicotine in the wine.

729
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,920
I did some research with Jingxuan.

730
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,400
Jingxuan?

731
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Jingxuan is a very kind girl.

732
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,160
Can you tell me

733
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,440
what you've investigated?

734
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,560
After all,

735
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm not very professional.

736
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,520
I just have some

737
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,960
theoretic experience.

738
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,400
Jingxuan and I had secrectly investigated some guests

739
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,600
who went to the banquet.

740
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,960
But in the end, we got nothing.

741
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,680
You're familiar with all the guests there.

742
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,280
Kind of.

743
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,080
Mr. Luo wanted to raise money for the Lawyer Association

744
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,400
and asked me to prepare for the dinner.

745
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,040
Many guests were invited.

746
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Most of them

747
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,560
have the same ambition and a strong family.

748
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,640
Dong Cixin.

749
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,880
She's a new writer

750
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,280
with sharp writing style.

751
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,560
She often writes ironical articles

752
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,800
about the Beiyang Government.

753
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,560
Dai Liming.

754
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,600
He was born in a noble family.

755
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,160
But later,

756
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,080
his family declined.

757
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,600
He's been drinking all these years.

758
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,440
He married Zheng Bai, the daughter of a businessman.

759
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,320
Zheng Bai,

760
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,000
Dai Liming's wife.

761
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,840
All these years,

762
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,480
the Dai family relied on her to maintain the family business.

763
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,720
It is said that the Zheng family has always supported the south.

764
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,800
-Bai Shanshan, -5 dots.

765
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,160
a famous social butterfly in Harbin.

766
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,520
After Mr. Luo passed away,

767
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,400
she became the legitimate hostess of the Luo family.

768
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,520
Zou Jingxuan.

769
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,640
You should be familiar with her.

770
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,680
Then I don't need to introduce.

771
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,120
Ding Meng,

772
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,200
the worker of the Fang family.

773
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,440
She's worked in the Fang family for many years.

774
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
I borrowed her for cooking.

775
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
I investigated all these people.

776
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,840
Then I went to Beijing.

777
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,840
You've been in Beijing for the past few months?

778
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,240
Yes.

779
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,600
My business is over there.

780
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,280
Zou Jingxuan went there too?

781
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,160
We often meet.

782
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,760
Situ, Miss Zhou.

783
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,400
Be careful.

784
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,120
Okay.

785
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,840
Be careful.

786
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,840
Shaochuan.

787
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,080
When can we leave?

788
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,000
Dr. Fang...

789
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,200
I'm afraid my mom can't stand it.

790
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,320
Everyone is here.

791
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,040
Auntie must be there too.

792
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,560
Everyone is equal in an investigation.

793
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,600
Find an empty room

794
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
and have a rest.

795
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,720
Situ.

796
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,200
Why are you back?

797
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,880
Everything is going well in Beijing.

798
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,080
Let's go to Bao

799
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,960
to know the situation.

800
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,920
Mowan.

801
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,840
Are you scared?

802
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,800
It's nicotine.

803
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,160
You're right.

804
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,040
Same as Mr. Shen?

805
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,920
We did it overnight.

806
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,720
But nicotine was not found

807
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,600
at the scene.

808
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,160
Again?

809
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,960
When can we leave?

810
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,800
Everyone at the scene

811
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,760
are suspected of murdering Shen Jianxian and Fang Jianqi.

812
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,240
So,

813
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,040
no one can leave

814
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,360
before we find the murderer.

815
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,480
We're just suspects,

816
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,520
not criminals.

817
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,360
You can't detain us?

818
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,000
If the murderer escaped because of this,

819
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,360
can you take the responsibility?

820
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,000
Everyone here

821
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,600
are all famous people in Harbin.

822
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,400
Can you take responsibility

823
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,280
of our loss?

824
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,040
I can.
