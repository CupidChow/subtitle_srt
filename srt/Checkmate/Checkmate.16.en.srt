Look at the friend you made.

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,850
[I know what you did to Shen Baifeng. Prepare 100,000 yuan.]

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,740
It must be Cheng Xiangjun.

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,240
This happened as soon as she came.

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,670
I'll go talk to her.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,600
We must put an end to this kind of matter once and for all.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,160
So,

23
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,860
you called Cheng Xiangjun

24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,050
to your secret place,

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,120
Mrs. Feng's house on Plain Lane.

26
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,680
This doesn't look like a house with a butler.

Help!

29
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,150
Then you put on the same clothes as Cheng Xiangjun.

30
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,000
As well as shoes.

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,020
Look in the mirror.

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,490
I really don't know

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,680
if you still knew the person in front of your eyes.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,920
Did you really accept yourself like this?

35
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,770
Then,

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you went around and did things in her name.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,210
The first stop was Jasmine Restaurant.

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,860
neither too local nor too foreign.

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,240
You checked in a small hotel nearby,

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,370
and managed to inform Li Chengyan

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,470
to meet you here at noon on the 16th

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
and recommended meat sauce spaghetti to him.

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,190
Give this letter to Mr. Li Chengyan.

47
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,570
Okay.

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,940
Excuse me, what's your name?

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
Cheng Xiangjun.

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,900
To be safe, we won't see each other for now.

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,890
Burn it after reading.

55
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,850
What a pity.

56
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,590
You haven't seen Cheng Xiangjun for a long time.

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,440
Several years in medical business

58
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,400
made her rich and generous.

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,840
But your impression of her

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,320
still remained a few years ago.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,270
This created

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,010
the two completely different images in others' minds.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,260
Miss Cheng is very nice

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
and generous.

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,790
She's very willing to tip us.

66
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,030
She's not short of money,

67
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,810
but she's so stingy to me.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You wanted the police to think that

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,490
Moly killed Li Chengyan

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
and committed suicide to escape punishment.

71
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,210
But you also knew that

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,880
it may not work out exactly as you planned.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,810
So there was a backup plan to the substitution trick.

74
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,140
You pretended to be Cheng Xiangjun and went back to Plain Lane,

75
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,670
and deliberately let people notice you.

76
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,110
By then, the police would analyze that

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,420
the victim must be Mrs. Feng.

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
And who they wanted to arrest

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
would be Cheng Xiangjun,

80
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,080
who had disappeared long ago.

81
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,890
How perfect.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,110
Unfortunately, man proposes, but God disposes.

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,280
You used a burn to distinguish yourself from Cheng Xiangjun.

84
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,560
So, Miss Li,

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
can I see your left wrist?

86
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,500
It's really you.

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,070
Actually, there's one thing I don't understand.

88
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,570
I can think of a way

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,150
to get Li Chengyan to the restaurant during that period.

90
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,680
But how could you be sure that

91
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,900
he would order spaghetti?

92
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,370
What if he wanted to try steak with bean sauce?

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,790
He must order spaghetti.

94
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,270
Because I've asked my man to buy out

95
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,210
all the steaks

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,810
in the market.

97
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,410
Zhao Xiaoling

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,930
was also sent away by me.

99
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,210
You were really meticulous.

100
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,760
They asked for it.

101
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,260
They deserved to die.

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,090
They deserved to die?

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,200
How did my mom treat you?

104
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,160
She even gave you the bank.

105
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,970
How could you do this to her?

106
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,010
How could you?

107
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,640
How?

108
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,470
Your mom was nice to me?

109
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,880
She was?

110
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,680
Do you know that

111
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,210
to Shen Baifeng,

112
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm just a dog.

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,190
Or not even as important as a dog.

114
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,010
You think

115
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,140
she left her money to me

116
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,620
because she loved me?

117
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,630
That's the trammel she used to control me.

118
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,650
When anything went wrong,

119
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,230
she would threaten me with modifying the will.

120
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,940
She beat me, scolded me,

121
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,340
and asked me to bark kneeling on the ground

122
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,660
to entertain her.

123
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,800
I wanted to bite her to death so badly.

124
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,460
So,

125
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,180
I devoted all my energy

126
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,930
to the development of the bank.

127
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,400
Zhongji Bank...

128
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,400
Zhongji Bank prospered because of me

129
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,400
and became the largest bank in Harbin.

130
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,880
So from this point of view,

131
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,710
everything should be mine in the first place.

132
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,090
What about Moly?

133
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,610
He was just a cook.

134
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,960
He was honest and diligent.

135
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,110
Did he deserve to die?

136
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,820
Didn't you say that

137
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,570
he's just a cook yourself?

138
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,320
As a cook,

139
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,030
it's his honor

140
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,610
to die for a banker.

141
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,460
You're wrong.

142
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,790
There is no inferiority or superiority when it comes to life.

143
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,630
What's inferior is your way of thinking.

144
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,990
Moly's cuisine

145
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,460
was much better than your filthy heart.

146
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,250
You,

147
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,760
and you,

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,270
come with me.

149
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,800
This time,

150
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,190
you're finally on the people's side.

151
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,990
Wrong.

152
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,730
I'm on the side of truth.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,440
Boy.

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
You are good.

155
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,630
I heard you just now.

156
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,840
Why are you here, Mr. He?

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,210
Are you so interested in this case?

158
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,690
Mr. He is Moly's friend.

159
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,880
Of course he cares about the case.

160
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,179
Mr. He,

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,890
the weird thing you mentioned,

162
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,659
that the steak was gone,

163
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,659
was really a clue.

164
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,490
Right?

165
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,530
I was just curious

166
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,260
why Feng Chengchu

167
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,700
suddenly got married.

168
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,450
Turns out it was fake.

169
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,380
Mr. He,

170
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,100
may I ask your name?

171
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,280
My name?

172
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,760
He Nitang.

173
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,600
Situ,

174
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,670
thank you.

175
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,710
If not for you,

176
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,240
my mother wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

177
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,460
Didn't you push the truth to me?

178
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,410
You just used my hands to find out the truth

179
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,630
and told the truth through my mouth.

180
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,770
Just like you used Chen Qingshan's hands

181
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,880
to kill Yu Daren.

182
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,600
As long as Yu Daren dies,

183
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,320
Zhongji Bank will be yours again.

184
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,920
That's why I should thank you more.

185
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,840
You also helped my brother and sister-in-law

186
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,000
to solve their grudges.

187
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,940
I like dealing with smart people.

188
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,080
But I don't want to

189
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,830
make friends with people who are much too smart.

190
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,810
Goodbye.

191
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,360
Bye.

192
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,000
You can't even ask those who write novels

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
to make up a case like this.

194
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,620
When Qiming posts this article,

195
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,650
our case-solving fee will be doubled again.

196
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,790
From the Orient Express till now,

197
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,230
many murderers of the cases I handled

198
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,530
are dead.

199
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,640
Don't feel guilty.

200
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,130
You didn't kill them.

201
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,080
The justice and truth you insist on

202
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,230
made them come to this.

203
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,720
Don't you think it's weird?

204
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,280
People are weird and incomprehensible.

205
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,850
All right.

206
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,520
Relax.

207
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,620
You've been too tense lately.

208
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,690
I have to go back now.

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
My aunt

210
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,800
asked me to make up for Jingxuan's welcome party.

211
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,270
If I don't go back, she'll nag me again.

212
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,020
Take care of yourself.

213
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,840
I'll take you to a bath next time.

214
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,590
You're back.

215
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,880
Come and have some hot tea.

216
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,940
If you need my help, just say it.

217
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,990
Thank you for

218
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:44,880
Mo's case.

219
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,200
Mo was also my friend.

220
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,610
I'm going to cook today

221
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,020
to treat you and Mrs. Shen using your place.

222
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,530
You won't poison us, will you?

223
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,880
I won't,

224
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,870
but I'm not sure if it can be well-done.

225
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,500
Here, have some nuts first.

226
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,910
The meal will be ready soon.

227
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,970
You're acting weird today.

228
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,970
Because I'm leaving.

229
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:35,760
You're leaving?

230
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,400
So soon?

231
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,690
What's so soon?

232
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,270
I mean

233
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,080
the school reopened so soon.

234
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,150
It's been a while since it reopened.

235
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,080
It's been a month.

236
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,680
Because of Mo's case,

237
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,520
I applied for a leave from the school

238
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,290
to be your assistant.

239
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,950
I'll pay you then.

240
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,840
I don't want money.

241
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,660
Didn't you say

242
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,240
Mo was our friend?

243
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,760
So,

244
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,000
won't your salary be deducted?

245
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,700
I'll teach more tutoring classes

246
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,660
to make up for it.

247
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,840
Tutoring?

248
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,700
Like what Shen Huatang did?

249
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,680
I'll go cook.

250
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,410
Mowan.

251
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,130
Why are you moving out?

252
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,520
You can go to school

253
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,460
and still live here.

254
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,170
Situ,

255
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,220
am I right?

256
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,480
What?

257
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,160
You don't want Mowan to stay here?

258
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,080
Auntie.

259
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,660
When are you going back to school?

260
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,620
I'll give you a ride.

261
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,940
You don't have to.

262
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,140
It's just a few miles away.

263
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,010
Don't bother, Detective Situ.

264
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,110
Once this case is published,

265
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,880
your place

266
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,410
will be swarming with visitors.

267
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,710
By the way,

268
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,810
Jasmine Restaurant sent an invitation here. Have a look.

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,130
How about you leave

270
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,340
after their opening ceremony?

271
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,820
Opening?

272
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,450
I've never had a meal cooked by He Wannian

273
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,990
since I came to Harbin.

274
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,310
But Mo told me before that

275
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,160
He Wannian used to be a chef.

276
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,550
He even went to Russia to learn cooking.

277
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,010
I wonder if he's

278
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,190
still that great now.

279
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,730
You're not from Harbin?

280
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,710
When did I say I'm from Harbin?

281
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,810
Then you are...

282
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm Chinese.

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,560
Look.

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,110
It's all my fault.

285
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,590
You've been here for so long,

286
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,380
but I didn't even ask about your family.

287
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,300
How about letting Situ accompany you to visit your parents?

288
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,790
No need.

289
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,370
Yu Daren.

290
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,360
Yu Daren.

291
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,840
Yu Daren is dead.

292
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,540
Yu Daren is dead.

293
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,950
Maybe it was a planned suicide.

294
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,410
Something happened again?

295
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,960
Yu Daren committed suicide in prison.

296
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,480
How?

297
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,680
Poisoned.

298
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,090
Ricinism.

299
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,380
This kind of poison is highly toxic and incurable.

300
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,240
The lethal dose of the extracted ricin

301
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,870
is only two milligrams.

302
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,120
He must have had the poison

303
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,740
mixed in the food last night.

304
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,550
He was completely dead when he was found.

305
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,700
I checked him carefully before he went into prison.

306
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,340
He couldn't have brought the poison in.

307
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,400
Two milligrams.

308
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,140
No one could find it if it was hidden in the nails.

309
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,880
All right.

310
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,050
Don't blame yourself too much.

311
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,880
As for Yu Daren and Li Yantong,

312
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
they should have been sentenced to death anyway

313
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,660
based on the crimes they committed.

314
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,860
The testimony was already recorded when we arrested them.

315
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:14,970
It's okay.

316
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,440
You were right.

317
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,630
Yu Daren committed suicide.

318
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,770
Take me to the scene.

319
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,350
Don't go.

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Bao has asked them to clean up the scene.

321
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,380
The body was also taken care of.

322
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,800
If you go now,

323
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,430
you'll only see such a small box with him in it.

324
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
When you told me yesterday,

325
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,380
I thought you were too tense.

326
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,030
I didn't expect it to turn out as you expected.

327
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,500
I was not kidding.

328
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,660
I have a feeling that someone else is behind this.

329
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,480
This case is so logical.

330
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,350
There's no way someone else could get involved.

331
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,690
How did Yu Daren die exactly?

332
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,780
Ricinism.

333
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,240
I think Bai Lu also died because of this.

334
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,640
But I'm not sure.

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,210
This name is so unusual.

336
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,589
I can remember it clearly if it was arsenic.

337
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,800
Ricin is much more poisonous than arsenic.

338
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,089
The lethal dose is very small.

339
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,099
Fang Jianqi said the same thing.

340
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,730
So you mean

341
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,089
the cases we encountered recently

342
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,530
are somehow related.

343
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,820
From Ma Shiying, my dad, Aunt Wei,

344
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,410
to the teacher, principal and secretary,

345
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,570
then to Moly, the owner of the tavern,

346
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,230
the banker and the nurse.

347
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,410
They have no connection whatsoever.

348
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,380
Unless there's really an organization.

349
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,870
What organization can it be?

350
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,130
I can't tell.

351
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,660
But I have a strange feeling that

352
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,550
maybe there are more cases like this

353
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,480
somewhere we don't know.

354
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,020
It's easy.

355
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,060
I'll check all the big cases

356
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,360
over the two years and look into them.

357
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,000
Thank you.

358
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,590
Mr. He.

359
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,250
Come closer.

360
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,980
Closer.

361
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,940
Here. One, two, three.

362
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,950
Thank you.

363
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,800
Thank you.

364
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,510
Come here.

365
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,030
Why is Jingxuan not here?

366
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,400
She went to Beijing.

367
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,000
She really went to do business.

368
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,170
I think Jingxuan will be in charge of your family

369
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,660
in the future.

370
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,480
You have to flatter her.

371
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,590
Otherwise, your allowance won't be as much as

372
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,030
your aunt's in the future.

373
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,450
Underestimating me, huh?

374
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,870
I'm not underestimating you.

375
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,560
You underestimated Jingxuan.

376
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,170
Let her behave.

377
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,440
She...

378
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,490
She was right.

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,770
Welcome.

380
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,650
Go ahead.

381
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,280
Welcome.

382
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,180
Sister, take care of her.

383
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,410
If Moly knew that He Wannian quit drinking,

384
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,120
and started cooking again,

385
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,130
he must be very happy.

386
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,550
The flowers are similar every year,

387
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,890
but the people are different.

388
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,970
The address hasn't changed and the decoration has not changed.

389
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,400
Unfortunately, no one will

390
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,370
bring me the bad-tasting soup

391
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,340
and ask me to compliment it again.

392
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,780
All good things must come to an end.

393
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,870
Who's gone is gone.

394
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,910
But that person's restaurant is still there.

395
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,920
It's a kind of legacy.

396
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,080
But I don't like things to end.

397
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,410
How about this?

398
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,880
You marry her.

399
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,410
This way, it won't come to an end

400
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,750
and you can save the assistant fee.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,920
It's a win-win.

402
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,620
The girls' school students are waiting for Ms. Zhou.

403
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,130
Don't talk nonsense.

404
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,880
Situ,

405
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,690
the reaction to my serial of Moly's case

406
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,730
was quite good.

407
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,040
So I want to end it

408
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,850
with the reopening of the restaurant.

409
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,380
It's also a comfort to Moly.

410
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,320
What do you think?

411
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,690
But don't worry.

412
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
No one will besiege you anymore.

413
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,880
I blurred your information.

414
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,340
He has Zhou Mowan.

415
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,400
This kind of trivia

416
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,910
won't get to him.

417
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,450
Ms. Zhou.

418
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,240
Thank you.

419
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,640
Coming.

420
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,000
Your gratin snails with bordelaise.

421
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,310
-More dishes? -Stop serving.

422
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,200
We can't have more.

423
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,770
Enjoy.

424
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,570
Thank you.

425
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,100
How is it?

426
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,480
Do you like it?

427
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,560
Come, sit and drink.

428
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,130
Your cooking skills are pretty good.

429
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,520
How long have you been learning it?

430
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Just so so.

431
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,810
I'll just drink water.

432
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,660
Didn't you quit drinking?

433
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,840
I'm happy today.

434
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,050
I'll make an exception.

435
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,210
He can quit tomorrow.

436
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,960
All right.

437
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,870
I'll stop here.

438
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:55,970
You guys go on.

439
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,880
I'll get back to work.

440
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,010
It's boring to drink like this.

441
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,710
Here.

442
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,050
Let's play the finger-guessing game.

443
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,670
Why don't you just tell me how much you want me to drink?

444
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,770
I don't know how to play.

445
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,730
So boring.

446
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,980
Let's do it.

447
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,270
Mr. Luo.

448
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,040
I don't play.

449
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,390
It's okay. I'll teach you.

450
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:26,980
Here.

451
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,030
This...

452
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,270
It's not that I don't know how,

453
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,200
but I don't want to.

454
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Why don't you do it if you know how?

455
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,840
Are you afraid of losing?

456
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,170
If you lose,

457
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,050
Situ Yan will drink for you.

458
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,490
Here.

459
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,120
I don't play.

460
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,300
And I never drink.

461
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,180
Have you ever seen me drink?

462
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:43,890
Enough.

463
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,360
Don't make it hard for him.

464
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,080
Everyone has been working so hard lately.

465
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,640
We should relax.

466
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,290
Also, Jin Qiming,

467
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,580
you usually call Situ Yan Situ,

468
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,450
but only call me Mr. Luo.

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,270
Why? You don't you treat me as your friend?

470
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,170
No, that's not what I meant.

471
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,830
But I take you as my friend.

472
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,200
I'll only let you know about all the cases.

473
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,410
You can write exclusive articles.

474
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,000
When there's any development to any case,

475
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,130
I'll let you know immediately.

476
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,830
I promised this much.

477
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,340
It's not too much

478
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,110
for you to have a drink with me, right?

479
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:18,840
Mr. Luo,

480
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,960
I really don't drink.

481
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,980
Don't force me, OK?

482
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,080
Why are you being such a bacchanal?

483
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,560
None of your business.

484
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,870
I'm happy today.

485
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Drink for me.

486
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,120
I really don't drink.

487
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,950
If I made you unhappy, Mr. Luo,

488
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,440
smash my camera.

489
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,110
Wait.

490
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,890
What are you doing? Making a scene?

491
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,570
I was too nice to you, wasn't I?

492
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,080
I've been so happy today. Why do you have to rain on my parade?

493
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,450
You want me to it, right?

494
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,560
You don't want it, right?

495
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,070
OK.

496
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,200
Luo Shaochuan.

497
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,720
Why do you always bully honest people?

498
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,820
Do you want to drink or play?

499
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,080
I'll do it with you.

500
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,720
Situ, stay out of this.

501
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,560
Mr. Luo, I'm sorry.

502
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,440
I don't drink because of my dad.

503
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,000
When I was young, my dad was a drinker and gambler.

504
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,400
He lost the whole family due to it.

505
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,760
Since young, I swore

506
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,880
I won't gamble

507
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,470
or drink.

508
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,850
I made everyone unhappy today.

509
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,080
Sorry.

510
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,560
I'll drink as a punishment.

512
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,410
It's okay.

513
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,630
It was all in my childhood.

514
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,610
From now on, in Harbin,

515
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,290
as long as we can survive, you can.

516
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,590
From now on,

517
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,230
you are our brother.

518
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,560
Your business

519
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,230
is our business.

520
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,880
Thank you for treating me as your brother.

521
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,940
You didn't even ask me why I was angry.

522
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,640
Why were you angry?

523
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,950
Little girl,

524
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,050
how dare she stole my thunder

525
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,240
disregarding the seniority?

526
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,930
Who was it?

527
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,500
In Harbin,

528
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,380
there's a woman even swankier than you?

529
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,120
Shen Huatang, the new head of Zhongji Bank.

530
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,090
She already stepped on me.

531
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,080
She did it,

532
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,910
so why do you come to me?

533
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,780
I can't marry her and let you tame her.

534
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,470
What are you talking about?

535
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,360
She stepped on me,

536
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,930
which means she stepped on our Luo family.

537
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,840
That's stepping on you.

538
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,890
Do you understand?

539
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,180
Auntie, how about this?

540
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,800
Leave the family alone.

541
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,210
This way, if she steps on you,

542
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,480
it has nothing to do with the Luo family.

543
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,770
-How can you talk to me like this? -Calm down. Calm down.

544
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,160
My Jingxuan is much prettier than her.

545
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,750
She's also single.

546
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,280
I'll ask Jingxuan to come back,

547
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,820
and I'll take her to more parties.

548
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,610
She must be more popular than Shen Huatang.

549
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,820
You told her the day before yesterday

550
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,580
that Jingxuan would be the future hostess of our Luo family.

551
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,730
Now you are sending her out?

552
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,230
I...

553
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,910
What do you mean?

554
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,800
Are you defending Jingxuan?

555
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,100
Do you miss her?

556
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,640
No.

557
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I just wanted to diss you.

558
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:09,760
Listen.

559
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,000
You are being a dog in the manger.

560
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,500
Be elegant.

561
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,090
You're not getting married,

562
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,470
and you're wasting Jingxuan's time.

563
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,840
Go send a telegram

564
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,600
to call her back.

565
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,020
I'm not going.

566
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,370
I want to be alone.

567
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,770
What are you talking about?

568
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,110
Young people can't be apart for too long.

569
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,730
Send a telegram to her.

570
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,940
Tell her I miss her, okay?

571
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,300
Go ahead.

572
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,300
Are you going or not?

573
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,760
Are you going or not?

574
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,250
-Are you going or not? -All right. All right.

575
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,320
I'll go now.

576
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,970
Bring me the receipt.

577
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,890
Don't try to lie to me.

578
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,370
I'll deduct your pocket money if you lie to me.

Isn't it your day off today?

582
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,140
Why are you here?

583
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,480
Didn't you ask us to investigate

584
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,560
the unsolved murder cases?

585

but there's no clue.

587

Keep investigating.

588
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,520
What is this?

589
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,270
Boss, it's the dossier of Fengtian you asked Sergeant Bao to transfer here.

590
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,090
The Reaper Zhang San's case.

591
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,470
That's too over.

592

you're reading a dossier, not a novel.

Too many details are missing.

597

Nothing.

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,400
Okay?

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,550
Good.

Why are you still here?

If you can come here, why can't I?

608

I'm here because...

609
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,330
Because I'm hungry.

610
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,620
It's useless to tell her that you are hungry.

611
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,530
You have to tell me.

Why are you eavesdropping on men talking?

behind my back?

628
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,000
If I did something shameful,

629
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,950
did I need to hide it from you?

630
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,820
Are you done packing?

631
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,910
I don't want to hear it.

632
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,630
I can stand wherever I want.

633
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,670
It's none of your business.

634

You know it?

You can tell as long as you are not blind.

644

Here's the thing.

645
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,660
There's a case in Zhou Mowan's family.

646
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,910
What case?

647
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:50,990
Murder.

648
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,730
To be exact, two murders.

649
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,950
Her mother killed her father

650
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,210
and was sentenced to death.

651
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,560
I saw this

652
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,640
in Fengtian's dossier.

653
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,020
Fengtian?

654
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,050
Her father was a famous artist.

655
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,050
After her mother was sentenced to death,

656
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,840
she didn't admit it till she died.

657

659
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,460
No.

660

You are talented.

661
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,850
Not at all.

662
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,230
Just casual drawing.

663

Please draw a few pictures for me.

664
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,990
I'm a music teacher.

665
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,360
You really can't draw?

666
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,960
No, I can't.

667
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,810
You used to be in Fengtian too.

668
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,520
I'm from Harbin.

669
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,090
You're not from Harbin?

670
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,950
When did I say I'm from Harbin?

671
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,310
Then you are...

672
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,780
I'm Chinese.

673
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,710
You are really talented in painting.

674
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,700
I just drew it casually.

675
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:43,950
How about

676
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,120
letting Situ accompany you to visit your parents?

677
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,770
No need.

678
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,170
Go on.

679
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,120
The dossier recorded it like this.

680
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,850
the evidence of Fang Huaijin's murder of Zhou Ze

681
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,460
is irrefutable.

682
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,460
I hereby declare

683
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,810
Fang Huaijin is convicted of murder

684
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,730
and sentenced to death.

685
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,770
I didn't kill anyone.

686
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,780
I didn't kill anyone.

687
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,110
I didn't kill anyone.

688
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,560
Huaijin.

689
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,750
If you said what I told you, you could have got a lighter sentence.

690
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,590
I didn't kill anyone.

691
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,900
I didn't kill anyone.

692
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,620
Something's not right.

693
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:58,940
What is it?

694
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,470
The lawyer of this case, Li Yuanpu,

695
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,150
is my senior.

696
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,200
Back in school,

697
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,790
I worked with him for a while.

698
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,440
He is upright and well-versed in law.

699
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,570
He was the student my teacher valued the most.

700
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,350
And it says

701
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,690
the evidence is irrefutable.

702
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,830
If that's the case,

703
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,360
he wouldn't have pleaded not guilty for her.

704
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,130
He's a lawyer.

705
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,370
What he pleads depends on the client's needs, right?

706
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,860
Other people may do that,

707
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,360
but he's not that kind of person.

708
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,650
If he really did

709
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,520
what he knew was impossible,

710
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,610
there must be something behind it.

711
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,830
Let's go.

712
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,290
I have a way to help you figure this out.

713
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,540
This is the way you talked about?

714
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,480
Don't you think

715
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,470
this is the most efficient way?

716
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,800
I suspect you asked me to come to Fengtian

717
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,650
to be your laborer.

718
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,530
Isn't it convenient?

719
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,880
Bao tried so hard

720
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,830
to get me these dossiers.

721
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,930
If I told him I don't need them anymore,

722
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,440
and asked him to get them back to Fengtian,

723
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,640
it would be too much trouble for him.

724
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,700
You've learnt not to trouble others?

725
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,680
I hope you can learn

726
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,470
not to trouble me next time as well.

727
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,700
We're a family.

728
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,950
I hope

729
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,590
you'd better not treat me as your family.

730
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,680
Here, have some coffee.

731
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,440
Excuse me.

732
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,850
You are?

733
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,580
Senior Li Yuanpu.

734
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,300
You are?

735
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,460
Situ Yan.

736
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,730
I'm Situ.

737
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,940
Situ Yan.

738
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,880
Long time no see.

739
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,090
Come on in.

740
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,070
This way.

741
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,429
Drink it while it's hot.

742
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,780
Why did you suddenly come to Fengtian?

743
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,040
Why didn't you send me a telegram first?

744
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,639
I was in a hurry.

745
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:36,659
Senior,

746
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,040
are you still a lawyer?

747
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,730
Yes.

748
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,560
What else can I do?

749
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,429
When our teacher established the lawyer association,

750
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,139
I said I would do my best.

751
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,850
Things are unpredictable.

752
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,280
Let's not talk about this.

753
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,600
I remember the last time I saw you,

754
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,940
it was on a party hosted by our teacher.

755
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,510
You were still a little boy back then.

756
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,790
I'm in Harbin now.

757
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,170
I'm staying at our teacher's place

758
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,680
to help him take care of his wife.

759
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,210
That's good.

760
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,500
Tell me if you need any help.

761
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,930
I'm in Fengtian,

762
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,780
but I still have some connections in Harbin.

763
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,620
Senior,

764
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,460
I won't stand on ceremony.

765
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,750
I'm here

766
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,950
to ask you about a case.

767
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,830
I knew you wouldn't come to me for nothing.

768
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:22,850
Go ahead.

769
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,250
Which case?

770
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,980
Do you remember Fang Huaijin's case?

771
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,780
Why do you ask about it?

772
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,520
I found it by chance.

773
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,100
According to the dossier,

774
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,480
your client had a clear motive

775
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,320
and timing.

776
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,790
You should have pleaded light sentence for her.

777
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,050
Why did you plead not guilty for her?

778
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,360
Fang Huaijin insisted on that.

779
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,540
So she hired you

780
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,830
so that she could guide you?

781
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,680
Actually, we were good friends.

782
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,430
I did give her my advise.

783
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,000
But she insisted

784
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,980
that Zhou Ze committed suicide.

785
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,210
How could Zhou Ze commit suicide?

786
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,540
That person was passionate about life,

787
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,470
especially about women in life.

788
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,010
So how could he commit suicide?

789
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,250
Besides, it was during that time.

790
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,150
What time?

791
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,040
I grew up with that couple.

792
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,160
During that time,

793
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,050
I had an appendicitis surgery

794
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,070
and was recovering at home.

795
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,240
So I spent a lot of time with Zhou Ze.

796
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,790
Although Fang Huaijin was worthy of sympathy,

797
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,910
she wasn't as fragile as she seemed.

798
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
What happened?

799
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,760
This involves the privacy of the person involved.

800
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,500
Their daughter Zhou Mowan

801
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,060
is our friend.

802
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,610
Then I'll tell you about

803
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,040
what happened during that time.

804
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,220
Well,

805
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,850
your room is so messy.

806
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,570
Can't you clean it up?

807
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,940
If you continue to stay in the studio,

808
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,790
mushrooms will grow in your hair.

809
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,910
I've never seen you paint a portrait before.

810
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,320
That's because I haven't met someone

811
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,280
who's worth painting.

812
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,310
Listen to me.

813
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,350
Don't let Fang Huaijin hear this.

814
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,250
I shouldn't have gotten married.

815
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,140
What I want is Danae,

816
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,020
Europa,

817
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,730
Olympia,

818
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,780
or Semeler.

819
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,720
Not a Hera

820
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,850
who bosses me around all day.

821
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,100
Yes.

822
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,000
No.

823
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,000
Let me tell you.

824
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,300
There must be something inside.

825
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,760
No means no.

826
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,570
None of them

827
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,950
can be my masterpiece.

828
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,990
Vodka.

829
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,660
Same for me.

830
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,190
When people look up at the moon,

831
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,180
they often forget about the six pence under their feet.

832
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,400
Because only the moon

833
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,880
needs to be admired.

834
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,320
When Zhou Ze met Ge Ai, it was like thunder causing fire.

835
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
At first,

836
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,720
Zhou Ze just took Ge Ai

837
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,260
as a model in the studio.

838
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,640
But a few days later,

839
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,770
he thought it was not enough.

840
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,070
So he took Ge Ai home.

841
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,220
At noon the day before the incident,

842
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,360
Ge Ai told Fang Huaijin everything.

843
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,650
Things totally got out of control

844
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,700
since then.

845
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,000
The decoration is really not Zhou Ze's style.

846
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,290
This is the work of a sculptor in Shanghai.

847
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,350
Zhou Ze and I like it very much.

848
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,470
We are going to

849
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,350
Shanghai for an exhibition at the end of the year.

850
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,770
This is not Zhou Ze's taste at all.

851
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,480
Most things in this house are not his style.

852
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,080
He doesn't like

853
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,880
most of the things you like.

854
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,470
For example, there are too many pieces of furniture

855
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,090
in this house.

856
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,820
There's no beauty at all.

857
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,390
When I move in,

858
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,250
I'll take all these rubbish away.

859
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,280
I'll also get rid of this

860
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
thick and stupid curtain.

861
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,680
Then the sunset

862
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
from the west window

863
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,070
can shine on the sofa I sit on.

864
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,930
Isn't it more beautiful?

865
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,290
This is Zhou Ze's ancestral house.

866
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,430
We won't sell it.

867
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,320
That's not what I meant.

868
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,940
You should know what I'm talking about.

869
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,780
I don't know.

870
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,970
Zhou Ze and I love each other.

871
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,140
This is not your home.

872
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,040
It's his.

873
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,720
After we get married,

874
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,450
of course I'll live here with him.

875
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,410
He won't take a concubine.

876
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,820
He promised me.

877
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,690
So he will divorce you.

878
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,500
And what you can do is to leave decently.

879
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,610
At least we can leave each other some dignity.

880
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,020
Young lady,

881
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,750
you think too much.

882
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,070
If you don't believe me,

883
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,510
just ask him.

884
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,240
Ge Ai said you want to divorce me

885
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,220
and marry her.

886
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,350
Is that so?

887
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,380
Keep your mouth shut from now on.

888
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,250
So it's true.

889
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,560
Fang Huaijin had always been meticulous.

890
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,600
This time was no exception.

891
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,410
After she calmed down,

892
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,440
we thought this incident was over

893
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,130
as usual.

894
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,620
But no one expected

895
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,970
she would steal morphine from my brother's lab

896
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,530
and try to find a chance to kill Zhou Ze.

897
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,690
Did anyone see it?

898
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,360
No.

899
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,290
The police found it in her coat in the closet

900
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
after the murder.

901
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,240
She used the chance of bringing wine to Zhou Ze

902
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,860
the next day

903
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,360
to put morphine in.

904
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,720
She brought wine to Zhou Ze?

905
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,540
They had another fight at lunch.
