00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,259
The way you bandage your wound

4
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,280
is exactly what I imagined a hero would do!

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,800
Heroine, I can see you were injured.

6
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,069
You shouldn't run outside for now.

7
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,220
Just hide in this place.

8
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,699
This house is bought by one of my friend

9
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,249
to hide from his wife.

10

It'll be my property for a while.

11

You can just stay here.

12
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,819
Heroine, I've been talking to you a long time.

13
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,530
At least, you shouldn't ignore me.

Okay, fine. I will leave you alone.

The condition of this courtyard is indeed a little shabby.

Do you think I'm annoying?

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,289
I didn't expect I'm a talkative person.

29
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,310
I don't usually act like this.

30
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,699
It's the first time that I have seen a chivalrous woman in my life,

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,800
so I was very excited.

32

If you need someone to help you,

33
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,659
just turn right after you walk out the door

Guard Geng had selected the location for Zhu Ji Restaurant.

00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,859
That was fast.

Sure.

45
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,030
As businessmen, we must make full use of every minute.

46
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,309
When we have a good idea, why not have a try?

So, Li Pin,

48

as well as our shareholders.

So, as first shareholders of the restaurant,

54

you can take part in our decision-making.

Sure, without Young Lady Nie's duck eggs,

56

I couldn't have made the preserved eggs.

57
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,899

if we are to be rewarded according to our contributions.

I can't.

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,970
It's for Master Qin. We must be careful with this.

168
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,859
Don't let anyone see it through.

169
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:12,199
Your Master, you send a worship to Master Qin every year when you go back to Jiangning.

170
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,829
But he never agrees to see you.

171
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:15,709
Master Qin had retried for many years.

172
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,869
He might not be able to go back to the capital despite the war between Jing and Liang.

173
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:21,370
Why take the trouble to do this, Your Master?

174
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,409
Master Qin took the blame for others in the court that year.

175
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,169
I owed him a favor.

176
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,470
Under such a circumstance,

177
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,789
it'll be only a matter of time before His Majesty asks him back.

178
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,950
We have to visit him more often.

179
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,330
Moreover,

180
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,649
we only have a chance now because he has few visitors.

181
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:43,190
If he goes back to his post in the future, a transport commissioner like me

182
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,650
is not qualified to visit him.

183
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,040
Show my care when he's powerful?

184
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,440
No, I want to show my care when he's in trouble.

185
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,330
You're considerate, Your Master.

186
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,650
[Qin's Manor]

187
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,290
Fine.

188
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,639
I'm so sorry. Commissioner Han, Master Qin went out.

189
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,620
Could you please pass on the worship to him?

190
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,209
I dare not decline your order.

191
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:33,019
But Master Qin said I can't accept any letters or gifts for him.

192
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm afraid you have to take it back.

193
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,169
Young friend, you must be in a good mood.

194
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,539
As a boss, you're eating porridge secretly

195
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:18,829
instead of looking after your business.

196
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:24,189
It's not like that. Master Kang, Master Qin. What brings you here?

197
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:27,530
Young friend, the restaurant has just opened and business is already booming.

198
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,139
We also want to join the crowd and taste your dishes.

199
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,920
Thanks for your support. Come here. Sit down, please.

200
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Come on. Please have seat. Have a seat.

201
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,759
I must make it clear that the restaurant isn't mine.

202
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,540
It belongs to Boss Nie. Please wait a moment.

203
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,370
Boss Nie, come on. We have two honored guests here.

204
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,840
Let me introduce them to you.

205
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,409
This is Master Kang. This is Master Qin.

206
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,589
Young Master Ning always talks about you.

207
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,750
You do have an impressive appearance.

208
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,589
Please have a chat first.

209
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,170
I'll go inside and prepare some drinks and dishes for you.

210
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,170
Okay. Okay.

211
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,900
Young friend, do you always

212
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,430
flatter us in front of your beautiful friend?

213
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,029
Please don't make fun of me.

214
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:15,979
There's nothing between me and Young Lady Nie. Nothing!

215
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:19,270
Hey, are the dishes ready?

216
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,080
These are the new dishes I invented. Please have a taste.

217
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,810
Master Kang, Master Qin, please.

218
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,980
Let me get it for you, Master Kang.

219
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,810
Master Qin, try it, too.

220
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,290
Young friend Ning, I heard that

221
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,260
the preserved egg is very popular in Jiangning.

222
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't expect it was made by you.

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,099
Young Master Ning, you have many secrets that we don't know.

224
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,300
What kind of secrets do I have?

225
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,819
It looks like amber. Looks refined.

226
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,300
Quite interesting.

227
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,000
Amazing.

228
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,610
I've tasted the delicacies all over the world.

229
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,590
But I have never tasted this.

230
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,040
Could you please give a name for it?

231
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,790
Master Qin, you first.

232
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,860
It tastes a little bit spicy.

233
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,359
Let's call it Jade Amber.

234
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,580
Such a good name!

235
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,640
This white tofu is as bright as daylight.

236
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,079
These black preserved eggs look like the passage of days.

237
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,330
How about we call it Lingering Drizzle?

238
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,290
- It's a great name.
-Great.
-Okay.

239
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,669
Your Master, you've visit Master Qin many times but he turned you down all the time.

240
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:49,659
We can't even send the worship to him.

241
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:52,689
It's the hardest to deal with the relationship with an acquaintance.

242
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:55,630
Moreover, is Master Qin a man who can be clung to easily?

243
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,400
You are already on good terms with Commandant Song,

244
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,189
which means you have the minister on your back.

245
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,209
Why were you still cold-shouldered by Master Qin's?

246
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,210
You know nothing.

247
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,959
The more friends you have, the better it will be for you in the officialdom.

248
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,730
[Zhu Ji Restaurant]

249
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,689
Zhu Ji Restaurant? Is it a new restaurant?

250
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,359
This is the Zhu Ji opened by Ning Yi.

251
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,689
I heard Su's first son sold Su's Cloth Store and started to make preserved eggs instead.

252
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:23,359
They try to take Wus orders by earning money from it.

253
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,800
What eggs?

254
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,780
How would Elder Master Su indulge him so much?

255
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,810
Such an ignorant man.

256
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,060
Master Qin?

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Master Kang?

258
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,350
Prince Consort Kang!

259
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,719
Here. Here, Master Qin,

260
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,840
Why… Why is Ning Yi with them?

261
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,659
That's impossible.

262
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:53,969
Well, we should leave.

263
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:56,020
Let me escort you out.

264
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,950
Hurry up.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
Young friend, I'm saying,

266
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,619
you have to entertain us again when we come here next time.

267
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,920
Master Kang, you're a Prince Consort.

268
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,689
This is just a small business. Yet you still want to eat preserved eggs on credit.

269
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,099
You shouldn't humiliate yourself.

270
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,800
Kid.

271
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,640
I said it's amazing when I came in.

272
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,990
It looks like amber and as elegant as the agate.

273
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,660
Refined and gorgeous.

274
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,430
This is the logo I designed especially for Zhu Ji.

275
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,050
What is logo?

276
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,150
The trademark for a restaurant.

277
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,719
The trademark should be pulled up with two ropes.

278
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:46,430
So I… Commissioner Han?

279
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,159
Isn't this De Cheng?

280
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,960
You know each other?

281
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,989
Master Qin. Master Kang.

282
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:58,099
Master Qin, don't you forget that my sister is Su Wen Xing's mother?

283
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,489
Oh, I'm completely senile.

284
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:03,390
Let's go.

285
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,000
Come in.

286
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,340
What do you want?

287
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,410
Give me the tea.

288
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,850
Please drink the tea.

289
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,800
My nephew-in-law is like my biological nephew.

290
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,789
We are a family. Don't be too polite to me.

291
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,750
A family?

292
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,820
Uncle?

293
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,149
You're so smart.

294
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,300
No wonder you can get close to Master Qin and Master Kang.

295
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,750
I'm here

296
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,620
to ask you for a favor.

297
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,190
Come here.

298
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,750
My good nephew, you are close to Master Qin and Master Kang.

299
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,899
Will you pass the worship to them for me?

300
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,609
Nephew. Do you know

301
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:37,480
Master Kang and Master Qin have a powerful background?

302
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,990
I do.

303
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,929
My nephew. Can you tell me how did you cling to…

304
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,840
How did you get to know them?

305
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,960
It's easy.

306
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,910
I played Go with Master Qin. And I won.

307
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,960
You won?

308
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,710
Master Qin's the best at Go in the court.

309
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,960
- Nephew, you…
- I was just lucky.

310
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,350
You were lucky.

311
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,600
This visiting letter…

312
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,690
Uncle, let me have a closer look at it.

313
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,900
This is valuable stuff.

314
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,910
Uncle, you have to take good care of it.

315
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,260
But I can pass the worship on for you.

316
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,550
Uncle, the tea isn't poisoned, right?

317
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,800
Nephew, you must be kidding.

318
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,870
Thanks for your help.

319
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,960
Uncle,

320
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,779
courtesy always demands reciprocity

321
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,060
in this world.

322
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,430
Uncle, I've done a big favor for you.

323
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:29,160
Would you like to give a promotion to your nephew?

324
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,109
No problem!

325
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,739
We're a family.

326
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,460
I will agree to everything you said.

327
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,459
Father, I heard the business of Zhu Ji Restaurant

328
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,259
opened by Ning Yi is blooming recently.

329
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,059
Seems like he gave up the cloth store completely

330
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,020
and turned to make preserved eggs.

331
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,829
They're just preserved eggs.

332
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,710
How much money can he earn?

333
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,259
If only we keep the silk we have

334
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,300
this couple will never stand up.

335
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,630
The Seal will still be ours sooner or later.

336
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,789
Young Master Wen Xing, Commandant Han asked to see you.

337
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,340
Uncle.

338
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,589
- Su Tan'er is here, too.
- What's up, uncle?

339
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:33,749
Wen Xing, give the silk from Jiangbei to your cousin.

340
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,829
Uncle, are you kidding me?

341
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,530
No, I'm not.

342
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,430
Tan'er, here's the thing.

343
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,870
The court will provide more tributary cloth to Jing.

344
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,941
As the transport commissioner, I can help you

345
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:48,430
when that day comes.

346
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,010
I've known about it.

347
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,160
But you already gave the order to someone else.

348
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,490
Why do you change your mind?

349
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,700
You…

350
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,200
It's a surprise.

351
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,830
It's a surprise for you and Ning Yi.

352
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,739
So, once it was settled,

353
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,779
I asked Wen Xing to buy the silk from Jiangbei.

354
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,020
Am I right? Am I right?

355
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,499
I'll give it to you and Ning Yi at the right time.

356
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,200
Uncle.

357
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,150
Tan'er is always careful.

358
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,020
As for her husband, he is a people person.

359
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,050
Everything will go well if I the business to you.

360
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,290
Uncle, I remember you used to look down upon my husband.

361
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,810
Why did you change your attitude suddenly?

362
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,050
His friends are just fair-weather.

363
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,389
If his friends are mercenary,

364
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,399
then everyone in this world wants to make an acquaintance of them.

365
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,340
Uncle, I…

366
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,259
It is settled.

367
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,660
I believe in you.

368
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,669
Wen Xing, discuss with your cousin

369
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,610
about the handover.

370
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,550
I'm leaving.

371

Uncle, Uncle!

374
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,109
Didn't we agree that

375
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,080
we'd do the tributary cloth business and earn money together?

376
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,840
Why did you change your mind suddenly?

377

Wen Xing.

378
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,160
I did it for your sake.

379

My dear nephew,

380
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,569
I advise you that you stop competing with Ning Yi.

381
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,949
Why should I?

382
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,670
Ning Li Heng is just a matrilocal husband.

383
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,600
A kid like you cannot compare to the man who talks jovially

384
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,160
with people like Qin Si Yuan and Kang Xian.

385
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,979
Let it go.

386
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
Don't ask for an insult.

387
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,100
Take it.

388
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,589
I'll return it to you.

389

[Da Chuan's Cloth Store]

391
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,629
Boss, we searched the Wu's Cloth Store.

392
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,340
Nothing has been found.

393
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,100
I know.

394
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,960
We even can't find a bolt of silk in the whole city.

395
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,920
What should we do?

396
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,840
Boss Xue, what're you worried about?

397
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,680

Boss Xue, do you know why I came here?

400
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,979
Boss Su, I'm honored by your graceful presence.

401
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,870
I think you must come here for the silk.

402
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,949
But I can't find a bolt of silk.

403
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,499
Even if I find it,

404
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,189
the price will be ten times of the market price.

405
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,730
I'm okay with Wus being the leader of this industry

406
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,020
But now he's pushing us over the edge.

407
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,350
Boss Su, this is not how business works.

408
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,160
Boss Xue, please calm down.

409
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,979
The Wus has a way

410
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,570
to pocket all the silk from Jiangnan.

411
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,630
Then we'll have a way

412
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,010
to make him spit it out.

413
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,290
I'd like to hear more.

414
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,679
I want to have a deal with you, Boss Xue.

415
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,160
I have a batch of silk from Jiangbei.

416
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,460
I want to sell it to you at a lower price than the market's.

[Contract]

418
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,330
Is everything alright with Young Master?

419
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,510
Young Master said everything is fine.

420
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,459
I heard the court will need more tributary cloth

421
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,629
due to the war in the north.

422
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,109
The price of silk is going to increase as well.

423
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,499
If I can't find a reliable supplier,

424
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,829
I'm afraid that my wife won't forgive me.

425
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,739
If you ask me who has the silk,

426
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,019
you'll know it by removing "Jiang" and a dot from the character "Hong".

427
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,189
Could you please tell me what you meant?

428
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,949
Removing "Jiang" and a dot from the character "Hong"

429
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,259
you will get the character "Wu".

430
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,349
I heard the court

431
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,349
will buy the tributary cloth with a higher offer.

432
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,699
We won't lose money this time.

433
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,189
When I heard of it,

434
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,119
I went to the cloth store right away and bought bolts of silk.

435
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,450
Otherwise, I wouldn't afford it.

436
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,630
The Wus has monopolized the silk from Jiangnan.

437
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,790
Only Da Chuan's Cloth Store has some in stock.

438
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,779
I heard Da Chuan's Cloth Store places a new order of silk recently.

439
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,220
You go and ask about it later

440
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,320
and check if it's true or not.

441
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,739
But I heard a batch of silk from the Jiangbei

442
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,149
will be released to the market soon.

443
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,829
Boss Xue means the highest bidder will get it.

444
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,909
Young Lady Yuan, is the information reliable?

445
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,559
All the silk merchants came here these days said so.

Could you please tell me if what you said is true?

447
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:02,930
Then we increase the offer. If we cooperate with each other,

448
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,349
we will definitely afford it.

449
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,979
The Wu's will not sell the silk from Jiangnan.

450
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,530
We can't let them buy the silk from Jiangbei.

It's said it was from Jiangbei.

Why didn't Xue Jin keep it instead of selling it?

No one knows who bought the silk from Jiangbei before.

make an illusion that he'll buy the silk

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,930
You came to the Wu's again today?

495
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,700
You knew the answer.

496
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,810
Su's Cloth Store was shut down.

497
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,429
We need to buy cloth.

498
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,699
Where else can we buy it if we don't come here?

499
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,899
You don't want to serve your regular customers anymore?

500
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,669
Manager Xi.

501
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,289
- Go back to work now.
- Okay.

502
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,300
Welcome.

503
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,580
Which kind of cloth do you like?

504
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,610
You can tell me.

505
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,131
This Ning Yi,

506
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,829
not only shut down the cloth store but also borrowed money from the underground money shop

507
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:00,989
in order to get the silk orders from Boss Xue,.

508
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,230
Manager Xi.

509
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,880
Meet me at Zhu Ji Restaurant. I have something to discuss with you.

510
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,680
Ning Yi.

511
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,390
Clerk, come on.

512
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,129
Why does Manager Xi leave here in a hurry without greeting us?

513
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,260
Where is he going?

514
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,500
You asked me here.

515
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,779
What do you want to talk about?

516
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,090
Take it easy, Manager Xi.

517
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,690
Have a seat.

518
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,859
Don't you want to see how to make these preserved eggs?

519
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:00,730
This is the business secret.

520
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,070
- If you're not the first-class manager…
- Enough.

521
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,449
Don't beat around the bush. I know what you want to say.

522
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:08,740
But Young Master Wu treats me well.

523
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,250
You don't need to waste time on me.

524
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,200
I didn't expect you would be such a loyal man.

525
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,299
You're right.

526
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,259
Wu Qi Hao treats you well.

527
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:24,380
But did Su Tan'er treat you badly all these years?

528
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,770
How shameless you are.

529
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,739
I really want to beat you up.

530
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,800
But it occurs to me that

531
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,830
you are going to hit the skids soon.

532
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,910
I can't punch you in the face.

533
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,910
Forget it.

534
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Manager Xi,

535
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,259
since you worked for

536
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,640
Su's family for so many years.

537
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,240
These preserved eggs will be given to you as a gift.

538
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:00,480
I'd better leave them to you matrilocal.

[Zhu Ji's Restaurant]

541
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,160
Young Boss.

542
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,880
Boss. Boss.

543
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,130
Please let me explain.

544
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,010
I'm wronged.

545
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,579
The gossip said

546
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,580
that Ning Yi bought Da Chuan's silk order

547
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,040
because he borrowed money from the underground money shop.

548
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,920
You really saved much time for them.

549
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,850
Don't listen to the gossip.

550
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,870
This is a trap.

551
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,090
Manager Xi, you'd better return to the Su's.

552
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,850
Come to me

553
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,349
when the smell of these preserved eggs is gone.

554
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,150
Let's go.

555
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,650
Boss!

556
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,180
Boss Xu, I'd like to buy it at a high price.

557
00:35:46,181 --> 00:35:48,560
Please leave it for me.

558
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,909
A high price?

559
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,699
- My price can be higher than you.
- You...

560
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,389
Boss Xue, If you sell the silk to me,

561
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,229
I…

562
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,460
The price will be decided by you.

563
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,730
Talking about your cloth store,

564
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,820
how long haven't you sold a bolt of cloth?

565
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,500
How dare you want to

566
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,780
do the tributary cloth business.

567
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,709
Boss Xue,

568
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,350
Boss Xue, we've been friends for many years. Sell the silk to me.

569
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,139
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone,

570
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,790
everyone, I'm sorry.

571
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,790
I've transferred all of my silk orders.

572
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,699
- Who did you sell it to?
- Sorry, everyone.

573
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,810
Everyone.

574
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,709
You…

575
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,370
The contract stipulates that

576
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,590
I shall not disclose the identity of the buyer.

577
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,510
What is it!

578
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,460
Please forgive me. Forgive me.

579
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,360
Boss Xue!

580
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,950
Boss Xue.

581
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,650
Boss Wu.

582
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,330
The person who bought this silk

583
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,230
is Ning Yi, right?

584
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,499
Ning Yi?

585
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,619
The matrilocal guy from Su's?

586
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,909
Where did he get the money?

587
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,910
In order to buy the silk from me,

588
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,360
Ning Yi borrowed money from underground money shop.

589
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,610
Moreover, I can't refuse Young Master Ning's offer.

590
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,020
Even Master Wu's offer

591
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,810
can't compete with his.

592
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,410
You're being ridiculous.

593
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,580
No one can

594
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,810
sell the tributary cloth so certainly like us.

595
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,970
Boss Xue, Ning Yi only gave you a deposit, right?

596
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,360
Young Master Wu, that's not right.

597
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,850
Young Master Ning paid all the bill.

598
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,490
Tell you the truth,

599
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,440
I'll ruin Ning Yi's tributary cloth business.

600
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,180
And he will break the contract with you.

601
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,080
What can you do then?

602
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,380
Boss Xue,

603
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,100
I can give you double

604
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,240
no matter how much he paid you.

[Li's Cloth Store]

606
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,579
Wu Qi Hao's order is too urgent.

607
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,019
But Boss sold it to him at its original price.

608
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,539
I think master will suffer a loss.

609
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,060
But Boss Wu has someone as his backup.

610
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,649
Didn't you know something happened in Xinmen Brothel?

611
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,829
Young Master Wu intended to send the beauty to kiss Commandant Song's boots.

612
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,060
But he offended the Commandant Song.

613
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,829
It's uncertain that the Wu's

614
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,920
will take over the tributary cloth business.

615
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,520
Seriously?

616
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,690
Who are you?

617

I'm Geng Zhi. I'm here to send a good news.

618

Our Young Master Ning Yi wants to see you.

00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,910
Young Master.

620
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,139
You want this silk

621
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,579
for the business of the tributary cloth, right?

622
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,349
I put up an announcement

623
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,850
to buy the silk at tenfold price.

624
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,019
But now, the tributary cloth business has increased greatly.

625
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,080
If you would like to break the contract with the Wu's,

626
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,869
I can not only pay the penalty to you,

627
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,080
but also increase

628
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,099
the price to 15 times of the original one.

629
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,370
15 times?

630
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,309
But I signed the contract with Young Master Wu.

631
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,350
As a businessman, I always keep my words,

Boss, you can't.

635
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,180
You have a contract with the Wu's family.

636
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,000
Young Master Ning, don't worry.

637
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,749
If I can cooperate with Young Master Ning,

638
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,060
it would be a huge honor to me.

639
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,349
Okay.

Please send my words to other silk merchants.

Okay.

I can buy all the silk they have.

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,240
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

660
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,270
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫
