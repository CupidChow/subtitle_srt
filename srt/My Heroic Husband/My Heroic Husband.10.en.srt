[Episode 10]

3
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,410
We are all out in public. Go on if you want to buy it.

4
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,100
If not, then get out of my face!

5
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,020
Otherwise, you'll have to taste my fists!

6
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,300
- You slag!
- Master, don't be angry!

7
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,200
Sir, don't be angry! My sister is bad-mannered.

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,229
She's such a vivacious girl.

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,440
May I know your name?

10
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm Yuan Jin'er from Xinmen Brothel!

11
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,800
If you want to look for troubles in the future, just come to me!

12
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,200
Don't go to my older sister!

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,100
I will go to you, for sure.

14
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,300
Jin'er, that was reckless.

15
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,200
You don't have to be so polite to someone like him!

16
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,100
My Lord, are you really interested in that Yuan Jin'er?

17
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,400
I heard that she's the most popular singer in Xinmen Brothel!

18
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,600
We haven't solved the tributary cloth matter.

19
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,300
Looks like we'll stay longer in Jiangning.

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
It'd be so much fun to have

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
such a shrewish girl as my company.

22
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
If I have a good time, I'll bring her back to the capital.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,800
If I'm tired of it, I'll just dump her.

24
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
My Lord, you are truly wise!

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,600
Jin'er, a civilian can't afford to fight an official,

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
but you just offended an official.

27
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,500
What are we going to do?

28
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Don't worry! I know how to handle him!

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,000
But now we should focus on

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,500
how we can sell the preserved eggs.

31
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
We've been standing here for so long,

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
yet the only one who

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
came to us was a shameless swinger.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,700
Don't worry.

35
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,000
I think it's still worth a try!

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Hello, everyone!

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,200
This is a snack we just invented.

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Please have a taste!

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Ma'am! Ma'am!

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
Please try it!

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
It's called Songhua egg.

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
It looks bad, but it's very tasty.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
You'll know how good it is after you taste it!

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Come on!

45
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,600
Judge things by their appearance. You're no exception!

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,300
We are here to help!

47
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,000
What's going on?

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
They are Young Master Ning's friends.

49
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
I think they must have come here to help us!

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Help us?

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Brother Ning asked us to help them sell this.

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,000
But it has a weird flavor.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Although it smells weird,

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,400
the aftertaste lingers.

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
If you add some other spices to it,

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,200
it may taste special.

57
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,460
♫ Buy paintings, words and books ♫

♫ Eating from East to West will empty my wallet ♫

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,600
Once upon a time,

60
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
there was a little tea house.

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,200
The owner was good at doing business, and his business was booming.

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,600
The owner was used to

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,000
throwing the tea residue into the stove ashes.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,200
And the ducks he bred happened

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,600
to like laying eggs in the stove ashes.

66
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,500
One day, when the owner was cleaning the stove,

67
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,800
he found a few duck eggs in the stove ashes.

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
He thought, "Oh, no!

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The eggs must be inedible now!"

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,800
But you know what?

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
What?

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
When he peeled the egg,

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
he found the egg white has become black and translucent

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,200
with some white patterns on the surface.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,700
And then he took a deep sniff of the egg.

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,000
The smell was so unique.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then he took a bite of it.

78
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,600
He was repulsed by the first bite,

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,900
but then the aftertaste

80
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,200
was so refreshing and tasty.

81
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,600
At that moment, a new folk snack was born!

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,400
This is the Songhua egg, also known as a preserved egg.

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,000
It appears black,

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but actually looks like a dark pearl.

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The aftertaste is sweet.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
You'll never forget its unique taste.

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,500
What he means is you'll find it

88
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,300
even more delicious with each bite you take.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,200
The appearance may look a little scary to you first,

90
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,800
but the aftertaste will definitely surprise you!

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Come on, everyone!

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
- Have a taste!
- Let me try.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Try it!

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
- Here! Try it! Come on!
- Come on!

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Come on, everyone!

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Try it! Give it a go!

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
Come on, let's go help them.

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
Come on! You can buy it here! Come here!

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
You can buy them to go!

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
We have enough for all of you!

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
This is yours.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,700
The net income for today is over 30 strings of cash.

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,200
It's not bad!

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
The money all belongs to Young Lady Nie,

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,960
though we've been busy all day for nothing.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Hey, as Ning's friend,

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
how could you say something like that?

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,100
I agree with what Brother Li said.

109
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,000
People can't be always profit-driven.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,700
I agree! You all did me a big favor today.

111
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,300
How about I teach you how to make preserved eggs?

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,200
♫ The mountains have seen many plants and flowers ♫

113
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,100
♫ Embroidered ribbon to tie the knot ♫

114
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,200
♫ The bright moonlight passed between the branches,
and the magpies on the branches flew away ♫

115
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,000
♫ After several times ♫

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
♫ I am in harmony with you ♫

♫ In the coming years, we'll hear the whispers of the swallows ♫

♫ The soft willow wind reflects the green ♫

124
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,500
Preserved egg in soup. Preserved egg porridge. Fried rice with preserved egg.

125
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Preserved egg with tofu.

126
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,800
These are the new recipes I invented. Everyone, please have a try.

♫ Smiling with you to watch these four seasons ♫

130
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
As I thought, it doesn't go well with bitter gourd.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why do I always have the most horrible one?

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Money is mere worldly possessions,

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,200
while friendship stays forever.

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm the only one who's single.

135
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Yet, I don't deserve a preserved egg.

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,500
What does it mean?

137
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000
Brother Ning has such a good recipe,

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
but he only gave it to Young Lady Nie.

139
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,500
What kind of friend is he?

140
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,500
- Shen Miao, speaking evil behind my back is really mean.
- Brother Ning…

141
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,600
Plus, who said that I didn't think about you guys?

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Take a seat.

143
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Young Lady Nie told me that she taught you

144
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
how to make preserved eggs.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,700
So I have a new plan now.

146
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm planning to start a franchise business,

147
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
called Zhu Ji.

148
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
All of you can join us.

149
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Join you?

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,600
As long as you pay the franchise fee,

151
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
you can sell our goods

152
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
at locations designated by us.

153
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,800
By then, the flagship store will make the eggs,

154
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,700
and you can buy the eggs at cost price.

155
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Then, we'll set a fixed selling price

156
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,000
in all stores.

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,200
We can buy two catties of duck eggs with 10 cash.

158
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,700
But we can sell one preserved egg at 10 cash.

159
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,600
We'll definitely have some profit.

160
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,100
Then, I can share my wife's burden.

161
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,700
I'm in!

162
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Co-Count me in!

163
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,400
Brother Pin, you always talk about saving money

164
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,100

Such being the case,

334
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
we can only empty the stock and

335
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,200
give all the cloth we have to Dachuan

336
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600

338
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,000
We have to close all our stores

and put them for sale.

340
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,500
Boss, you cannot do that!

341
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,600
We all know how much effort

342
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,800
you've devoted to the stores!

343
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,700
We finally get to where we are today after all the hardship–

344
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Maybe it will get better

345
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,700
if we stay for a little longer…

346
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,400
Maybe…

347
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600

348

are you really going to sell all the stores

423
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,880

All of a sudden, you want to

427
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,120
sell preserved eggs instead of cloth.

428
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,610
As a guard, I even feel upset hearing it,

Where did you get so much money?

435
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,500
I sold all the cloth stores.

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,530
You'll understand everything before long.

438
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,050
The Wu's even colluded with Commandant Song

439
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,490
and didn't allow us to sell preserved eggs on the main streets.

440

Isn't she Young Master Ning's mother-in-law?

Exactly.

Madam Su even became sick out of anger.

But Madam Su does give Young Master Ning a hard time.

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,740
Thanks for coming!

499
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,100
Everyone,

500
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,050
the total monthly income of all

501
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,130
Zhu's stalls

502
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,950
is 23,780 taels!

503
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,940
After deducting costs,

504
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,420
the net profit is 14,932 taels!

505
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,949
A-A-A small preserved egg business

506
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,180
can make such great profit?!

507
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,020
The profit is about 60%.

508
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,840
Now it's time.

509
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,030
It's-lt's time for what?

510
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,890
Young Master Ning, can't you just tell us all the story?

511
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,909
Why do you always cast a mist before our eyes?

512
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,119
I didn't mean to.

513
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,020
I just thought it's too tiring for Young Lady Nie

514
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,900
to take care of the stalls.

515
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,839
And it's not safe for a girl to go out in public every day.

516
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,260
Luckily, I'm going to use the money

517
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,879
to open a restaurant for Young Lady Nie.

518
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,660
Let's call it Zhu Ji Restaurant,

519
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,330
which will be our flagship store.

520
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,640
You can all invest and become our shareholders.

521
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,519
You're opening a restaurant to sell preserved eggs?

522
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,290
What if we lose money?

523
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,149
It's indeed possible.

524
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,810
Then, Gao Qiu, forget it!

525
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,669
I'll take my words back.

526
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,670
I'm taking my words back!

527
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:06,119
Brother Ning, I didn't mean it.

528
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,559
You're the one we trust most!

529
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,850
Yes! Definitely! Absolutely!

530
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,340
So we all approve it?

531
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,110
Yes. Great!

532
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,599
You're all very happy today!

533
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,519
I'd like to sing a song

534
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,799
to you all for a great success!

535
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,149
Good!

536
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,139
Here! Bottoms up!

537
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,389
A toast to the birth of Zhu!

538
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,090
Here! Bottoms up!

539
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,400
Thank you for helping me today, Commandant Song!

540
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,020
I will return your favor one day!

541
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,990
Here!

542
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,020
That Su Tan'er's matrilocal husband

543
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,320
wanted to buy silk at a high price.

544
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,039
When the silk merchants knew that we have your support,

545
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,669
they didn't dare make a sound.

546
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,780
Now, the Sus have shut down all their stores.

547
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,079
You mean that you told the others

548
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,530
that I'm dealing the tributary cloth with you?

549
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,090
Forget about it this time.

550
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,229
If you dare talk nonsense again

551
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,279
and put the higher-ups in trouble, your head

552
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,090
will no longer stay on your neck!

553
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,230
I got it.

554
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,800
♫ Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

555
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,020
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

556
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,300
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

557
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,630
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

558
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,950
Such beautiful singing!

559
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,810
It's Xinmen's best singer, Yuan Jin'er.

560
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:47,120
She can sing well and even has a lovely name!

561
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,980
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

562
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,760
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

563
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,450
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

564
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,280
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

565
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,150
Here, Commandant Song.

566
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,950
Let me fill your cup.

567
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,710
Does your neck still hurt?

568
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,839
Not anymore.

569
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I deserved it.

570
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,469
No wonder Jin'er is the best singer!

571
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,079
Good at both singing and playing guzheng.

572
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,149
If she keeps practicing regularly,

573
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,530
it'll just be a matter of time for her to be better than me.

574
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,559
It reminds me of something!

575
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,629
Sister, you know what?

576
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,470
When Young Master Ning first came here,

577
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,630
- he sang like…
- Jin'er!

578
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,360
Drink some wine. Come on!

579
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,759
Young Master Ning, you are here again!

580
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,079
Are you having a good time?

581
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,400
Sure! Of course!

582
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,000
Very good!

583
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,629
Thanks to Young Lady Jin'er!

584
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,700
Madam Yang.

585
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,890
- Thank you, Young Master Ning!
- You are welcome!

586
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:24,000
Jin'er, the guests next door want to invite you to sing a song for them.

587
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,290
Invite me?

588
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,320
It's obviously an order!

589
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,890
Then I'll leave now.

590
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,160
You guys enjoy yourselves.

591
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,850
Then we'll leave now.

592
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,839
Madam Yang, a loose thread.

593
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,460
Thank you!

594
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Young Master Ning, please come here more often!

595
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,060
Old Geng.

596
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,629
Old Geng!

597
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,989
Young Master!

598
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,290
Get the carriage ready and send Young Lady Yun Zhu home.

599
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,679
Yes.

600
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,109
Don't need to bother, Young Master Ning.

601
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,800
Boss Nie,

602
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,759
I can give you a ride home.

603
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,850
We can talk about the credit on the way back!

604
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,330
Boss Nie, his carriage is small. It won't be comfortable.

605
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,719
Let me walk you home!

606
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,840
You called her Boss instead of Young Lady when talking about credit! Get out.

607
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,560
Young Lady Nie, I can give you a ride if you want to talk about business.

608
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,790
When it comes to money, you suddenly speak normally.

609
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,680
No poems anymore?

610
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,109
Young Master Ning.

611
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,159
What?

612
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,910
Are you still doubtful about the investment?

613
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,930
Just forget about it!

614
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,780
Of course not! I don't dare!

615
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,480
Goodbye! See you!

616
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,420
See you! See you!

617
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,470
You should feel honored

618
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,690
that Commandant Song invited you.

619
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,359
You think I'd be interested to serve someone like him?

620
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,690
How dare you?!

621
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,750
You are just a sing-song girl!

622
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,620
How dare you be so disrespectful to Commandant Song?

623
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,000
Qi Ha, be nice!

624
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,640
Don't be rude to your future sister-in-law!

625
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,120
I like a tough girl like her!

626
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,920
It'd be so much fun to conquer her!

627
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,839
Your behaviors make me want to take you home tonight even more!

628
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,029
No way!

629
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,320
It's never going to happen!

630
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,440
[Preserved Egg Sculpture Design]

631
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,290
Let me out!

632
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,759
I will never marry you!

633
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,590
Let go of me!

634
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,440
Where are you going?

635
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,949
Didn't you hear what my Young Master said?

636
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,450
Let go!

637
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,989
Tell him to let go of me!

638
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,390
Stop!

639
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,429
Run now!

640
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,330
Ning Yi?!

641
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,070
Commandant Song,

642
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,450
sorry to have disturbed you!

643
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,150
Please go on!

644
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,280
Commandant Song,

645
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:48,030
aren't you being too friendly?

646
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:03,230
Young Master Ning, how dare you interfere in my personal life?

647
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,710
You want to go against me, right?

648
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,010
I'm wronged.

649
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,590
I was just making a joke with you.

650
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,230
Who are you?

651
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,509
Stop there!

652
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,210
Where are you going? Don't move!

653
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,110
Guards!

654
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,910
Go get them!

655
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,760
Let's go!

656
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,910
Get her!

657
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,910
- You go over there!
- Yes!

658
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,289
- The rest follow me!
- Yes.

659
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,620
Heroine!

660
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,320
It's a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding.

661
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,680
It's a misunderstanding. Heroine,

662
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,159
you are so tough!

663
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,989
You actually attempted to assassinate a court official in public!

664
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,890
I'm impressed!

665
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,069
The way you bind up your wound

666
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,110
is exactly like what a hero would do, in my cognition!

667
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,410
Heroine, I saw you are injured.

668
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,780
You should not get out now.

669
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,029
Just hide in this house.

670
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,509
This place was bought by one of my friends

671
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,960
to hide from his wife.

672
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,549
It's currently mine now.

673
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,650
You can stay here for a while.

674
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,989
I'm not a bad person.

675
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,429
You see I'm not a bad person.

676
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,270
I'm not one of Song Xian's people, either.

677
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,750
You want to kill him, which means you're my friend,

678
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,950
since we are both his enemies.

679
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,470
Heroine, I've talked to you for a long time.

680
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,180
Why don't you say something?

681
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,520
Are you deaf?

682
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,360
What? What's wrong?

683
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,360
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

684
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,070
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

685
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,790
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

686
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,400
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

687
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,710
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

688
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,380
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

689
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,230
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

690
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:57,240
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

691
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,300
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

692
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,620
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

693
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,540
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

694
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,010
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

695
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,980
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

696
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,330
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

697
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,420
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

698
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,800
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

699
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,790
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

700
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,220
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

701
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

702
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,480
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

703
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,640
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

704
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,840
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

705
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,880
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

706
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,800
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
