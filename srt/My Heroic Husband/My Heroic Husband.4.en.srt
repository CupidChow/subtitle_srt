Husbands should clean the house.

Wives don't need to get up early.

This is Su's matrilocal husband, Ning Yi.

The sin he has made was grave.

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,140
Truly, it's hard to speak about.

18

Everyone should take it as a warning.

I bet ten cash that he came here because of poor service to his wife.

42
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,499
Look at his skinny arms and legs.

43
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:43,350
He must be short in doing housework. Twenty cash.

44

Twenty cash?

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,800
I don't know what I have done, either.

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,270
I just went to Xinmen Brothel.

53
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,960
Xinmen Brothel?!

54
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,220
Did I violate the line of lust?

55
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,859
As a matrilocal husband, how dare you go to a brothel!

56
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,340
Didn't you violate the line of lust?!

57
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,219
I didn't do anything. Don't get me wrong. I'm interested in music.

58
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,630
You dare listen to songs?

59
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,259
No, no. I sang the songs.

60
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,269
The most beautiful girl spilled wine all over me after I sang.

61

How dare you drink wine with the most beautiful girl!

Don't… What?

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,559
Brother Ning, Brother Ning. Tell us more about the Xinmen Brothel.

Yeah, that's right.

65
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,170
Actually, it's no big deal.

66
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,629
The environment there is average. The service is kind of bad.

67
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,959
No booths. There are balconies only.

68
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,310
The minimum consumption is high and you can't have your own wine there.

69
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,969
Yeah, yeah. But I can't say that they have a bad attitude.

- Madame Yang...
- ...is great.

73
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,029
- What's more, the most beautiful girl is named…
-The most beautiful girl!

74
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,809
- Yuan Jin'er. Have you ever heard of her?
- Yuan Jin'er.

75
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:17,710
Yeah. She is pretty, but her singing skill is not that good.

76
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,320
- So why would I…
- Where's the noise from?

- You… The master asked you to study...

but you're here making noise. That's inappropriate.

Who is he?

80
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,789
He is the monitor of virtue in our School, Feng Yuan.

- Monitor?
- Mon…
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,569
Stop that. Master will ask you to stand in the corner if he comes back.

83
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,210
I won't be able to help you.

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,230
But… M-Master, I…

90
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,660
You… What?

91
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,189
As the monitor of virtue,

92
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,990
you wasted your time with these naughty guys,

93
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,530
and you dare defend yourself.

94
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,010
Go out!

95
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,410
Take a look at what you did!

96
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,189
Brother Ning, well…

97
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:40,789
What's wrong? Isn't he gone? Why are you still holding it?

98
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:43,480
Why should we accept such a penalty?

99
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,540
Don't just stand there. I'll cover for you if he blames us.

100
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,360
Your name is Li Pin, right?

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,330
and the monitor of virtue is called.....

102
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,270
Feng Yuan.

103
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,150
Feng Yuan.

104
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,650
You look older than the three of them.

105
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,869
Why did you still come here at such an old age?

106
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,729
I came here to learn something voluntarily.

107
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:20,810
I want to share my wife's burdens at home,

108
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,699
but these men psyche me out every day,

109
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,220
and I can't even go back to class now.

110
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,060
How would you come to this terrible place voluntarily?

111
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,650
Is there… anyone of you sent here by your wife like me?

112
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,339
- Why?
- I was unlucky to have forgotten my wife's birthday.

113
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,680
You deserve it. How could you forget your wife's birthday?

114
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,440
No, y–

115
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,349
- Well… Shen… Shen…
- Miao.

116
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:49,949
- Shen Miao.
- What about you?

117
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,009
I was born in a poor family.

118
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,840
After I failed the examination, I became eager for my harmonious union

119
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,320
and wanted to become a member of a noble family.

120
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,540
That didn't occur to me.

121
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,570
What do you mean?

122
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,969
Let me translate it for you.

123
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,469
Shen Miao hasn't married.

124
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,489
He flunked the examination for many years.

125
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:11,409
And then he was unable to live a poor life.

126
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:14,719
His families are familiar with our dean, so he was sent here.

127
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,190
He now studies hard and supports himself.

128
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,220
Waiting for a good family and to be a matrilocal husband.

129
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,120
You even wrote a poem for being matrilocal.

130
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,250
- That, that, that.... the one who sits besides, Gao…
- Brother Ning!

131
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,820
Can you tell me more about Xinmen Brothel?

132
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,959
Gao Qiu, he is not good at speaking and slow to react,

133
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,069
so his wife sent him here.

134
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,750
You can totally regard him as a fool.

135
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,330
He looks quite like a fool.

136
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,200
So… which means…

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,530
you guys didn't make very serious mistakes.

138
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,450
How could they send us here?

139
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,110
Because we are matrilocal husbands.

140
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,969
So what's wrong with being matrilocal husbands?

141
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,600
Were we born to be inferior to others?

142
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,300
We should have human rights.

143
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,540
Both husband and wife are equal no matter what.

144
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,800
They should help each other.

145
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,320
There is no lowliness and nobleness in marriage.

146
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,130
Brother Ning,

147
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,969
you just said what I've been afraid of speaking out about for many years.

148
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,600
I admire you.

149
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,820
Respect.

150
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,169
You don't have to.

151
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,410
I mean that you shouldn't be beaten or scolded by teachers,

152
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,609
even if you came here voluntarily.

153
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,140
We can't let him insult us.

154
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,219
You're right, Brother Ning. We have our own dignity.

155
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:35,149
Yes. We have our own dignity.

156
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,649
Yes. Right, we are matrilocal husbands with dignity.

157
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,449
Matrilocal husbands with dignity.

158
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,320
Be a matrilocal husband with dignity.

159
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,710
What are you doing?

160
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,040
What do you want?

161
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,139
We need to revolt. We need to fight back.

162
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:53,150
Revolt?

163
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,200
Just you?

164
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,930
The punishment of standing

165
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,140
is to make you reflect on your own sins,

166
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,850
but you are having a chat here.

167
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,350
How about I invite your wives to join you?

168
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,880
A group of useless losers.

169
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,610
Tell me who allowed you to put the pot down.

170
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,080
Mister, no need to ask them.

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,620
I told them to put them down.

172
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,740
You!

173
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,200
Put your hands out!

174
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,399
What? Are you going to beat me?

175
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,290
Put them out!

176
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,359
You… If you dare to be against me, I–

177
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,290
What-What are you doing?

178
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,179
We respect you so we call you teacher.

179
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,840
Hope you can respect us likewise.

180
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,579
We came here to learn instead of being punished or insulted by you.

181
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,929
The teacher who insults students is the least capable.

182
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,080
Yes, that's right.

183
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,080
You are a matrilocal husband.

184
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,799
What's wrong with being a matrilocal husband?

185
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,229
We have freedom of marriage. Being matrilocal is just a kind of form.

186
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,470
Yes, that's right.

187
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,280
Okay, your name is Ning Yi, right?

188
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,079
I will ask your wife to discipline you since I can't.

189
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,380
You don't have to. I will tell her myself when I go home tonight.

190
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,450
Take your belongings.

191
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,740
Goodbye.

192
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,360
Ning, Brother Ning!

193
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,490
Door is over there.

194
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,569
Bravo! Bravo! It's great. That's right.

195
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,949
I'm Number thirty-five.

196
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,910
Nonsense! Look at it. Isn't it number thirty-five?

197
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,630
I lined up for a few hours to take it.

198
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,819
But I lined up for a few hours, too. Boss Su stamped on it for me.

199
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,370
Boss Su also stamped on it for me, too.

200
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,600
- You liar. Mine is real. Yours is fake!
-Yours is the fake one!

201
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,489
Dear two guests, please calm down. Let me have a look.

202
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:18,750
Master, their numbers are the same,

203
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,409
and they are stamped with Master Su's seal. How could it be?

204
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,170
There is no doubt. She had the fake one!

205
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,419
Yours is fake! You must give us an explanation.

206
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,370
Maybe we wrote the same number on them because we were in a hurry to

207
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,679
meet the demands of so many guests on that day.

208
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,369
Please calm down.

209
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,879
Our store has a sufficient supply of Cloud Silk and Gauze.

210
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,870
Every one of you is guaranteed to get the cloth you reserved.

211
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,230
Er Hu, bring these two guests to take their cloth.

212
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,450
This way, please.

213
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,400
Boss,

214
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,209
it's just a bolt of cloth. No big deal.

215
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,500
Never mind, Manager Xi.

216
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,609
It's forgivable if I wrote them wrong at the time,

217
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,879
but it has been the third time we have had two guests with the same number.

218
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,320
If we overlook them again, our losses will get bigger.

219
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,120
[Qin Si Yuan - Wu Dynasty Right Prime Minister]

220
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,130
[Kang Xian - Wu Dynasty Emperor's son-in-law]

221
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,979
No, no, no. Let me think. Let me think.

222
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,330
Here.

223
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,750
Wrong.

224
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,450
Here.

225
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,259
Let me see. Let me see. Take it easy.

226
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,990
Let me see. Let me see.

227
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,490
It's inappropriate. It's wrong. It's wrong.

228
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,050
It's hard to tell who the winner is. How about we end in a tie?

229
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,369
Sure, it's better. It's a drawn game. A drawn game.

230
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:01,810
Let's play chess again.

231
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,209
No, no, no. No one can win against you in chess.

232
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,880
It's boring.

233
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,679
What kind of bird is this? Please follow me. Follow me.

234
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,950
Young friend, do you know how to play chess?

235
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,340
I'm not an expert, but I do know how to play.

236
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,770
Please, have a seat.

237
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,340
Okay.

238
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,070
You first, Ning Yi.

239
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,520
Right, White should go first at this time.

240
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,809
Here you are.

241
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,410
Please.

242
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,340
The opening is quite interesting.

243
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,650
A smart move.

244
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,100
Old Qin, we already have a winner.

245
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,729
He will win the game. Stop trying to preserve your fall.

246
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:48,010
Come on.

247
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,369
Thank you.

248
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:53,029
May I know from whom you learned that?

249
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,140
I didn't have any teacher.

250
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,880
When I'm free at home I find a chess manual to learn.

251
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,270
No wonder your chess road is flexible and hard to be predict.

252
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:11,160
I just think that playing chess is the same as business and battle.

253
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,770
It will be a blind alley if you let others know your moves.

254
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,530
Kid, it's the first time I saw Old Qin lose in chess.

255
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,830
You can be my friend now.

256
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,140
I regard you as my friend.

257
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,900
It's so easy to be your friend. Aren't you afraid that I'm a bad guy?

258
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,569
Our Lord Kang Xian is the dean of the School of Male Virtue.

259
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:38,459
He is the Emperor's son-in-law. You must not be offensive.

260
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,390
He is the biggest matrilocal husband of the Wu Dynasty.

261
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,429
I've been hiding my identity quite well, but you revealed it like that.

262
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,950
Young man, what's your name?

263
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,999
I'm… Ning Yi, and my courtesy name is Li Heng.

264
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:57,581
So, what kind of mistakes have you made

265
00:17:57,581 --> 00:18:00,400
and why were you sent to my School of Male Virtue?

266
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,220
Actually, it's not a serious mistake.

267
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,600
Forget it. It has a long story.

268
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,509
This Old Sir, I don't know your name.

269
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:13,470
My name is Qin Si Yuan.

270
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,639
Old Qin.

271
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,049
You must keep Old Qin's name in mind.

272
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:20,250
He is the Grandmaster of chess in the Wu Dynasty.

273
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,430
Yet he was defeated by you.

274
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,649
I'm flattered. I beat him by chance.

275
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:28,430
Young man, since you helped me beat Old Qin,

276
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,199
if you are in trouble some day, you can find me and I'll help you.

277
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,439
I'll keep it in my heart.

278
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:36,380
I mean it. Keep it in your heart.

279
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,880
Ning, are you interested in playing another chess game with me?

280
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,069
Sure. Please.

281
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:51,199
Young Master, Young Master. Something came up at the store. Please go back.

282
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,530
Old Qin, Old Kang,

283
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,389
something happened at my home. I need to go back to solve it.

284
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:07,179
How about we leave the chess game like this here and let's continue to play it after I'm done?

285
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,819
See you later. See you.

286
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,049
Calm down, please. Let me check it.

287
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:17,809
Take it easy.

288
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:20,900
Please calm down. We will deal with it.

289
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,530
You bought it here, too?

290
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,510
Everyone!

291
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,890
Everyone, everyone! Please calm down.

292
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,440
Do you mind me checking your receipt numbers?

293
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,279
Come here. One by one.

294
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,530
Boss, half of these receipts' numbers were fabricated.

295
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,399
Step aside. Step aside. Make room. Make room.

296
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,129
Someone in the store reported

297
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,449
that the shopkeeper fabricated the receipts and refused to redeem the product.

298
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:09,980
According to Wu's Law, these cases of live sale are fraud.

299
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,689
As prescribed by the Law, the cloth store shall be closed for cleanup and reorganization.

300
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,320
Search it.

301
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,800
Wait, wait, wait.

302
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,540
Your Worship, please wait.

303
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,320
Your Worship, someone tipped you off that our store fabricated the receipts.

304
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,370
I will accept the punishment if it's true.

305
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,409
But do justice to us, please.

306
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,159
These receipts were not fabricated by our store.

307
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,959
A fabricated receipt needs to be redeemed with more Cloud Silk and Gauze.

308
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,959
It is no good for our store at all.

309
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,030
Please do justice to us.

310
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,649
You come with us.

311
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,889
Take all the receipts back and check them.

312
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,559
No, those are our receipts.

313
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,279
Your Worship, I paid for it and got the ticket at the scene.

314
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,609
It's their problem.

315
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,919
Please do justice to us.

316
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,849
It's not easy for us civilians to buy a piece of cloth.

317
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,529
Please do justice to us.

318
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,860
Ask them to give us the Cloud Silk and Gauze.

319
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,130
Yes. Give it to us! Give it to us!

320
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,959
Excuse me. Excuse me.

321
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,529
Your Worship, Your Worship.

322
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,769
Please hold on a second.

323
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,799
Allow me to say a few words to my younger sister.

324
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,510
Wen Xing, why did you come here?

325
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,849
Someone in your store reported that you fabricated the receipts

326
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,409
to create a false scene that your business is booming.

327
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,889
I don't think it's reasonable, either.

328
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,159
According to the present situation,

329
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,559
if you don't distribute the product accordingly,

330
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,960
they will close the cloth store.

331
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,280
But I don't have enough Cloud Silk and Gauze in my warehouse now.

332
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,340
I have enough.

333
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,559
Tan'er, we swim or sink altogether.

334
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,319
No matter what, I won't just stand here and see

335
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
the new store get closed down.

336
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,559
Grandfather agrees that we can also sell

337
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,380
the Cloud Silk and Gauze you developed. How can I ignore you

338
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,319
when you're in trouble?

339
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,480
Wen Xing, are you willing to lend the Cloud Silk and Gauze in your warehouse to me?

340
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,850
Of course.

341
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,250
That would be great.

342
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,100
Thanks, Wen Xing.

343
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,009
But I have one condition,

344
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,560
we will take charge of this cloth store together.

345
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,160
What do you think?

346
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,510
Don't worry about it.

347
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,679
It's just for a while.

348
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,500
I will return the store to you when the business is well.

349
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,010
Refund. Refund.

350
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,130
How about we sign a contract?

351
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,730
Okay,

352
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,030
[Su's Cloth Store, Cloud Silk and Gauze, sold contract]

353
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,370
It's all due to Ning Yi's bad idea of redeeming the products by receipts.

354
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,369
It was still me who helped you.

355
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,649
After all, he is just an outsider.

356
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,450
You can't trust him.

357
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,609
Where did you come from?

358
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,830
None of your business.

359
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,390
It's time to catch the thief who has been acting for a long time.

360
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,179
Catch the thief? What do you mean?

361
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:58,249
Manager Xi, go get some water.

362
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,199
Yes.

363
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,900
Come here, too.

364
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,510
Hurry up.

365
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,080
Let me go.

366
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,840
Your Worship, please give me a receipt.

367
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,490
Everyone, please have a look at these.

368
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,730
My dear, it's still early to celebrate.

369
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,959
Today, we sent out plenty of receipts.

370
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,609
But what should we do if someone intentionally makes trouble

371
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,849
by fabricating fake receipts when the guests redeem the product?

372
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,010
We have to be prepared in advance.

373
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,830
Everyone have a look at these two receipts.

374
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,900
Your Worship,

375
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,890
when I made the receipts, I stamped my personal seal on it after it

376
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,990
was soaked in water.

377
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,649
When it was dry, my personal seal was gone.

378
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,920
My personal seal reappeared when it was soaked again.

379
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,060
The one which has personal seal on it is true.

380
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,130
The others are all fabricated.

381
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,280
The one who fabricated the receipts

382
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,159
might steal the seal of Su's Cloth Store.

383
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,529
As far as I'm concerned, Su's Cloth Store's seal

384
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,440
has always been in our hands.

385
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,950
So, the one who fabricated the receipts

386
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,120
should be the other one who has Su's Cloth Store seal?

387
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,080
Why are you all looking at me?

388
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,020
Why are you looking at me?

389
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,820
Young Master Su, follow us to the yamen.

390
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,279
Your Worship, Your Worship, Your Worship.

391
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,039
Wait, wait.

392
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,649
Your Worship, does your wife stay home every day

393
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,440
and never show up in public?

394
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,079
But my younger sister disobeys the doctrine of women.

395
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,279
Not only did she choose her own husband,

396
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,349
she also took part in a cloth store business, which doesn't suit women.

397
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:19,039
As her elder brother, I just wanted to give her a lesson.

398
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,559
It's our Su's family business.

399
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,530
It's none of your business.

400
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,060
Tan'er,

401
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,880
are you going to send your brother to yamen?

402
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,510
You'll be criticized by people if you do that.

403
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,280
They will say you, as a married woman,

404
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,430
framed your family members for the seal.

405
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,030
Do you have the courage to face others in the future?

406
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,060
Think about it,

407
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,260
will grandfather blame you?

408
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,199
Will the Sus hate you?

409
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,280
Why would grandfather blame her?

410
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,649
Why would the Sus hate her?

411
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,959
A great family should stop loss in time

412
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,769
if they want to develop continuously.

413
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:07,179
If it allows the man who talks about the advantage of gender to speak nonsense,

414
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,310
then it's better for the family to decline as early as possible.

415
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,649
Your Worship, not even the good judge can settle family affairs.

416
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,530
But what Su Wen Xing did is not technically family affairs.

417
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,109
It is called market disruption. I read Wu's Law.

418
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:22,239
At least, he will be sentenced to three years. Am I right?

419
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,519
- Ning Yi.
- Come.

420
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,769
- Ning Yi.
- Catch him.

421
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,109
Your Worship, Your Worship. It's not me. Seriously.

422
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,249
Your Worship.

423
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,069
It's him. It's him.

424
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:35,129
He reported that the cloth store fabricated receipts, which were actually done by himself.

425
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,439
He can get the cloth store's seal, too.

426
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,800
Young Master, it was you!

427
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,009
I have punished the domestic thief.

428
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,710
Take him away.

429
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,300
[Su Manor]

430
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,890
You b*stard!

431
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,199
How dare you frame your sister!

432
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,550
I will beat you to death.

433
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,199
Father, Father, it wasn't me.

434
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,199
Sun Er Hu did that.

435
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,580
You knew who did that.

436
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,279
Just admit it.

437
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,649
The public will know what happened even if you don't admit it.

438
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,710
Think it over carefully.

439
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,730
You can go to the family temple if you are still confused.

440
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,689
- Grandfath–
- You unfilial son. Admit your fault.

441
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:24,529
Sun Er Hu has been sent into the yamen.

442
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,280
I won't stop you if you want to go there.

443
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,529
Give me my weapon.

444
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,130
I'll beat this b*stard by myself.

445
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,530
Uncle, take it easy.

446
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,460
Don't be mad at him.

447
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,849
My wife's brother just wanted to get the seal.

448
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,580
It's understandable.

449
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,030
Moreover, he is in his early twenties.

450
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,150
He is still a child.

451
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,060
We are a family.

452
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,130
As his father, you may punish him.

453
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,490
But as a brother-in-law, I can't bear to see it.

454
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,220
Such being the case,

455
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,649
I'll forgive you this time.

456
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,950
Uncle, I picked up a gadget

457
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,430
before I came in.

458
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,910
It seems to be a wrapped cane, which has many hangnails.

459
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,129
It's too painful to grab it.

460
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,560
You don't need to be angry with him.

461
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,649
Just have a try.

462
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,680
Beat him with the stick five hundred times.

463
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,430
Don't hurt yourself.

464
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,599
- Father…
- You b*stard.

465
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,880
I didn't think your acting was so skillful.

466
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,039
Isn't that what you said?

467
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,679
I pretended to be at the end of my wits at first,

468
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,920
and let Su Wen Xing give himself away.

469
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,079
And then I managed to agree with him and sign the contract.

470
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,129
In the end, I enticed Su Wen Xing to hand out the cloth store's seal.

471
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,430
Although it sounds easy,

472
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,790
I didn't expect your acting skill to be flawless.

473
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,690
I like it.

474
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,679
- You like it?
- Yes.

475
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,679
Especially the way you made the anti-fake watermark.

476
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,280
Amazing.

477
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,250
I was planning to use some iodine on them.

478
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,100
But you're faster than me and came up with a way

479
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,009
which was easier than mine.

480
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,510
Nice.

481
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,310
Dear, you spoke about it again.

482
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,320
But since it happened,

483
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,159
Grandfather will not think brother can keep the seal safe.

484
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,369
Today, you helped me again.

485
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,639
Tell me. What do you want?

486
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,490
Well, I…

487
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:22,350
It seems that it's the first time that you called me like that.

488
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,870
Yes.

489
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,919
Didn't you see my mother?

490
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,959
She lives in there, and she is very close to us.

491
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,120
We have to act like a couple in front of her.

492
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,220
That makes sense.

493
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,410
But your mother must have good ears

494
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,890
so that she can hear you call me dear

495
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,920
at such a close distance.

496
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,680
Did you pretend

497
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,080
for the frogs?

498
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,191
Yes.

499
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:55,920
- It–
- Fine, fine.

500
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,670
I'll stop fooling you.

501
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,950
Dear, I do have a favor to ask you.

502
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,430
You don't want to go to the School of Male Virtue?

503
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,789
Dear, you're so smart. I really respect you.

504
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,150
That place is not for human beings.

505
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,400
If you don't want to go there,

506
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,609
you can do as your please.

507
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,799
Thanks, my dear.

508
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,300
Wait.

509
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,409
Although your personal life is beyond my reach, you mustn't be caught

510
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,060
by the second uncle.

511
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,560
Even you don't believe me?

512
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,570
My personal life–

513
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,440
I went to Xinmen Brothel because I planned something.

514
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,460
Something inappropriate?

515
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,860
I have no time to explain to you because you'll know it soon enough.

516
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,000
Old Geng!

517
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,179
Young master, have you forgiven me?

518
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,800
Not yet.

519
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,360
But for the sake that we're buddies,

520
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,679
if you do me a favor, I'll let bygones be bygones.

521
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,490
Young Master, what is it?

522
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,489
Take me to Xinmen Brothel again.

523
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,849
Do you still want to go to Xinmen Brothel?

524
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,650
Stop yelling.

525
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,770
I have something to do there,

526
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,150
to take the seal for your lady.

527
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,729
I drank too much last time.

528
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,270
I didn't do anything yet.

529
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,980
Young Master, shame on you.

530
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,199
I took my clothes off, but I still didn't do anything.

531
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,239
What about this time? What do you want to do?

532
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,199
And you told me to take the seal.

533
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,030
- You, you, you…
- Stop thinking too much about it.

534
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,570
Will you take me there or not?

535
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,450
Your Lordship.

536
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,980
Be careful.

537
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,529
Boss, please forgive me.

538
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,630
What are you doing? Please get up.

539
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,470
I didn't find that first uncle fabricated the ticket's number.

540
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,839
There was something wrong with Sun Er Hu. I didn't find it, either.

541
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,830
It's my fault.

542
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,650
Boss, please punish me.

543
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,529
Manager Xi, you've been working in Su's Cloth Store for many years.

544
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,319
You're been devoted and loyal.

545
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,650
You're the most trustworthy man for me.

546
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,319
This is my family affair.

547
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,540
How could you find it?

548
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,680
Please get up first.

549
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,440
I know you've been working hard all these years.

550
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,770
But you have a mild temper and you are straightforward.

551
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,959
So, you don't know about the importance of Plan B.

552
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,300
However, Young Master will help us in the cloth store in the future.

553
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,010
You can discuss it with him if you can't make a decision.

554
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,560
Don't think about it too much.

555
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,439
Everyone has his own strong points.

556
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,770
You're loyal.

557
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,960
It's the best of you.

558
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,100
Yes.

559
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,760
Off you go.

560
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,660
How's it going?

561
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,550
Xiao Chan, Xiao Chan.

562
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,050
Young Master.

563
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,389
I want to ask you about something.

564
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:15,769
Yes.

565
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,170
What kind of a person is His Lordship?

566
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,190
Young Master, why do you ask me about him suddenly?

567
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,390
Speaking of him,

568
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,460
he is kind of strange.

569
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,750
His family has a business, but he doesn't want it.

570
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,959
He's either studying at home, teaching at Yushan Academy,

571
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,529
or confining himself to his room for a whole day.

572
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,650
We don't know what he's doing.

573
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,810
Did he...

574
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,529
have a problem with me?

575
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,409
A problem?

576
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,160
It's more than that.

577
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,449
He looked down upon you before.

578
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,239
When he knew that you'd marry into our family,

579
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,969
he was too angry and didn't go out for three days.

580
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,210
I remember it clearly.

581
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,530
Young Master.

582
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,890
He looked down upon you before.

583
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,680
When he knew that you'd marry into our family,

584
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,650
he was too angry and didn't go out for three days.

585
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,800
Be careful.

586
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,559
The weather is hot.

587
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,969
He's concerned about you,

588
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,970
and asked me to take a mosquito repellent for you.

589
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,920
Young Master, are you alright?

590
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm fine.

591
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,910
Don't touch it.

592
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,810
It's a trap.

593
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,710
Young Master, please sit down.

594
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,280
Old Geng, I want to ask you about something.

595
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,650
Is Your Lordship a strange man?

596
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,410
Yes. Extremely strange.

597
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,760
He said something different from what he said before

598
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,280
when he asked me to find him in his room just now.

599
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,180
What did he say again?

600
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,410
Didn't you ask me to take you to Xinmen Brothel before?

601
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,929
He was so angry

602
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,270
and he didn't allow me to take you there.

603
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,689
I found it strange because he asked me to take you there before

604
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,999
and asked me to keep an eye on you,

605
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,610
saying that if you hatch a sinister plot,

606
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,970
I can punish you on the spot.

607
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,120
Punish me right there?

608
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,270
Is he a human being or not?

609
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,130
Aren't we matrilocal husbands human beings?

610
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,420
He asked you to take me to Xinmen Brothel,

611
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,580
and he'd have his men catch me.

612
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,420
Are you aware that that is called "entrapment"?

613
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,310
Entrapment?

614
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,130
He's never been in any trap,

615
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,519
but he is good at setting a trap.

616
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,460
Go away.

617
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,960
No–

618
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,130
- what are you doing, Young Master?
- Leave me alone.

619
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,759
What's urgent right now is that I have to go hide myself for a while.

620
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,420
Young Master, Young Master.

621
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,929
Young Master, are you mad at me?

622
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:04,929
I'm not.

623
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,599
- Young Master, please listen to my explanation.
- You don't need to explain.

624
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,279
I didn't betray you.

625
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,079
Young Master, please say something.

626
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,079
I didn't–

627
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,039
Let me help you.

628
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,560
Let go of it.

629
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,039
Old Geng, what's wrong with you?

630
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,940
Are you mad at me?

631
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,550
It's none of your business.

632
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,109
Listen, the situation is urgent now. I don't have time to explain.

633
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,130
You can't tell anyone that I'm going out.

634
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,841
For the reason that I wrote many novels for you.

635
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,070
He must be angry with me.

636
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,719
Your Lordship, Young Master ran away from home.

637
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,260
I see.

638
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,570
Young Master. Young Master!

639
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,940
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

640
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,700
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

641
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,320
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

642
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,960
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

643
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,350
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

644
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,920
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

645
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,830
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

646
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:33,720
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

647
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,040
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

648
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,130
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

649
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,080
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

650
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,550
