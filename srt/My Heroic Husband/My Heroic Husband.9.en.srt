[Episode 9]

3
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
These are our finest silk.

4
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,200
Have a look, Young Master.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,800
The silk must be enough for you.

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Look. It is bright and lustrous.

7
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,600
It feels nice in the hand, too.

8
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,900
It's soft and comfortable to wear.

9
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you, Boss Wu.

10
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Let's go.

11
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,200
I've bought all the silk in the regions south of the Qinhuai River.o

12
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
Within three days,

13
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,600
the Su Family will run out of all their material.

14
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,900
[Su's Cloth Store]

15
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Boss, those silk merchants we're familiar with

16
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
all gave their orders to the Wu Family.

17
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Nowadays, almost all the silk in regions south of the Qinhuai River

18
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
have been bought by the Wu Family.

19
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I knew it.

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
This Wu Qi Hao has known

21
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,000
the news about the tributary cloth, too.

22
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
He was quite fast.

23
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
I didn't expect that we can't even

24
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
buy a bolt of silk in Jiangning.

25
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,100
What should we do now?

26
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm incompetent.

27
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm sorry, Boss.

28
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm at my wit's end.

29
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't worry about it too much.

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,200
It is just Wu Qi Hao's trick.

31
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,500
It's more strange if we can buy the silk easily.

32
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Manager Xi, don't put so much stress on yourself.

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,500
We will take our time.

34
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,800
We should pay more attention to finding them since we can't.

35
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
How could you give up on it easily?

36
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,500
Yes, Boss.

37
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,100
I'll keep searching.

38
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,300
Tan'er,

39
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,000
I really think the message about

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
tributary cloth is unreliable.

41
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,000
It's not about the fact that we can't buy silk.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
It's about the message for the tributary cloth.

43
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
Sure,

44
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
I'll support you no matter what

45
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,900
if you're determined to do this business.

46
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Even though we might gain no profit in the end,

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
I already have a strategy.

48
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,800
At that time, we can

49
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
put up a stall and sell preserved eggs.

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I don't believe that

51
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,100
Wu Qi Hao is so omnipotent that he can stop the ducks from laying eggs.

52
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,200
The Su's Cloth Store passes on from generation to generation.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I won't ruin it in my hands.

54
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,600
It's okay you if don't want to help me,

55
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,100
but you shouldn't say something like that.

56
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,700
They must be Capricorns.

57
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
This way.

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,100
Young Master.

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
You're here.

60
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,300
You are very decisive.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
You're truly a clever man.

Boss.

64
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,200
How's it going? Do you have news about spare silk?

65
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,500
I got in touch with an old friend.

66
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
He has always been resourceful.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
He said that there is a personal supplier in the eastern market.

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
Although their charge is quite high,

69
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,200
this is the last resort to buy silk in Jiangning.

70
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
The price doesn't matter.

71
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
As long as we still have the straw to make bricks...

72
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
You're right, Boss.

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Then I'll take you there.

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
We can make a to-buy list today.

75
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,500
Let's go.

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,500
Miss, are you going out?

77
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,200
I'm going to check the goods in the eastern market with Manager Xi.

78
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll be back soon.

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,600
I saw the court advise that

80
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
the Jing Empire has won several battles repeatedly.

81
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,200
The tide of war in the North is getting clear.

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,600
It's time for you to show up.

83
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm afraid that there won't be much time left for us to play Go.

84
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,600
You're the emperor's son-in-law.

85
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,200
You can come to the capital

86
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
if you want to play Go with me.

87
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Why are you so reluctant?

88
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,700
I don't want to go there.

89
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,200
I don't feel comfortable there.

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,700
None of it compares to the singing birds and blooming flowers here.

91
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
You came at the right time.

92
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Come on.

93
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
You even bought yourself a chair.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
Not bad. Good job.

95
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Here.

96
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,600
Play Go with Master Qin.

97
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,100
Come on.

98
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
What's wrong?

99
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,600
What do you have on your mind?

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,800
Tell us.

101
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,100
Cheer me up.

102
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,100
Come on. You can tell us what's bothering you.

103
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,500
I'll share your burden.

104
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
No,

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
it's not your first time here.

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,600
You are quite interested every time.

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
You'd place your piece either on the corner or on the border.

108
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Why do you select the center today?

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Tell us.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,200
What are you thinking about?

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,000
Master Kang, you're as clever as a fox.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,300
I can't hide anything from you.

113
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
I was quite confused about something,

114
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,100
so I came here today.

115
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,400
I wanted to ask for your advice.

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,700
Please tell us.

117
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,600
Do you know about the tributary cloth?

118
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,800
You should know the situation of my family.

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
My wife,

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,600
she wants to become the supplier of the tributary cloth.

121
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
But when I thought about it,

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
I had a strong feeling that there must be

123
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,700
something wrong with it.

124
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,800
What's wrong with it?

125
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
Just think.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,500
The tributary cloth has always been supplied by the merchants appointed by royalty.

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,700
I don't know where the news came from

128
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,600
that the supply will be increased.

129
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,000
But the transport ministry hasn't had an open tender by now.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
As we can see that the business about tributary cloth this year

131
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,400
was under the table.

132
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,700
Do you think there is something strange here, too?

133
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
I don't know, either.

134
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,000
But here's what I think.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,900
The war in the North is a fight between Liang and Jing.

136
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,300
One is dead, while the other is injured.

137
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,200
We will reap the benefits directly

138
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
if we dispatch troops.

139
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
Why should we provide the tributary cloth?

140
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,400
They should give it to us instead.

141
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,600
But even I, as a shopkeeper,

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,800
can understand such a simple truth.

143
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,100
Will those ministers in the court fail to understand it?

144
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,800
So, I think

145
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,400
the situation of the tributary cloth is complicated.

146
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
You're clever.

147
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,200
Haven't you already seen it through?

148
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Go back home quickly

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
and tell the truth to your wife.

150
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,600
Well, so...

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,500
thank you very much.

152
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm going back home.

153
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
Hurry up.

154
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,130
I didn't expect that

155
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,090
this young friend has such foresight.

156
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,930
He happened to hold the same view as you.

157
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,369
Manager Xi, I contacted you before.

158
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:53,459
Today, Su's Cloth Store is coming to check the silk.

159
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,160
Yes, of course.

160
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,930
Miss, we are here.

161
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,870
I will greet my friend,

162
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,760
Please go inside first. I'll go meet you soon.

163
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,080
Miss Su, please follow me.

164
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Why are you here?

165
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,129
Young Master, you are back.

166
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,569
Lao Geng, what are you reading?

167
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,020
Reading a book.

168
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,370
You can eat while reading.

169
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,489
Thanks, Young Master.

170
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,100
Share it with Xiao Chan.

171
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,319
Is your Miss at home?

172
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,120
No.

173
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,929
She went to the eastern market with Manager Xi.

174
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,860
They said there is some new silk.

175
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,050
Silk?

176
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,550
There shouldn't be any spare silk

177
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,810
in Jiangning City.

178
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,130
How long have they left?

179
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,480
How long since they left?

180
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,659
It's been a few hours.

181
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,640
It's been a few hours.

182
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,250
Tan'er, have a seat.

183
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,760
You asked someone to lie to Manager Xi

184
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,140
in order to do this?

185
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,190
Why can't you be open and honest

186
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,230
if you truly want to cooperate with me?

187
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,640
If I invite you personally,

188
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,320
will you come?

189
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:17,559
Tan'er, I know you want to become the supplier of the tributary cloth.

190
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,489
So I bought up the tributary cloth

191
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,560
in Jiangning just for you.

192
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,929
Sorry,

193
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,730
I don't want to cooperate with you.

194
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,999
See you.

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Why?

196
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,319
The silk in the regions southof the river,

197
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,090
no matter spot goods or future goods, are all in my hands.

198
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,559
If you like,

199
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,910
I can give all of it to you.

200
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,660
I've told you I'm not interested.

201
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,729
What do you want?

202
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,879
Where else can you buy the silk

203
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,199
if you don't cooperate with me?

204
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
Who else do you expect to help you? Ning Yi?

205
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,749
He isn't that capable at all.

206
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,299
Unlike him, I can have people send you the silk

207
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,169
if I open my mouth.

208
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,189
Him? What can he do for you?

209
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:01,040
None of your business. Let go of me!

210
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,050
I won't.

211
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,050
What are you doing? What do you want?

212
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Why do you always want to kick me out?

213
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,520
Why do you think I'm not as good as Ning Yi?

214
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,820
Tan'er,

215
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,060
just be with me

216
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,310
if you want the tributary cloth business.

217
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,399
Let alone the tributary cloth business,

218
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,050
the world's cloth warehouses can be Wu and Su.

219
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,250
Wu Qi Hao, you're crazy.

220
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,439
Listen,

221
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,560
I've never like you.

222
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,150
Even if you bought up the silk from all over the world,

223
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,310
it doesn't mean that you are capable.

224
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,489
You just rely on the wealth and power of your family

225
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,809
and make use of your ancestor's glory.

226
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,710
You're nothing.

227
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,290
I'm the best businessman in Jiangning City.

228
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,970
I could write poems when I was young.

229
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,439
I gave up schooling and became a merchant

230
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,390
when I was fourteen. I rode the whirlwind.

231
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,199
Whenever people talked about Wu Qi Hao,

232
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,190
they'd say that he was promising and exceptional.

233
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,000
Even Prefect Xu praised me greatly.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,009
But why did everyone say Ning Yi is a change-maker after the Poetry Meeting?

235
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,320
The genius of Jiangning City is me. It's me.

236
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,390
You're really insane.

237
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,889
So crazy. Get out of the way.

238
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,280
Open the door.

239
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,820
Xi Jun Yu!

240
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,899
Open the door.

241
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:37,270
Manager Xi, open the door.

242
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,490
Xi Jun Yu!

243
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,590
Stop yelling.

244
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,220
He is now the Wu Family's manager.

245
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,079
Boss, you're shrewd.

246
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
You're right.

247
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,610
No matter how loyal I am to Su Tan'er,

248
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,880
I'm just a manager.

249
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,300
And now Ning Yi came out of nowhere.

250
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,660
I'll be elbowed out of the cloth store sooner or later.

251
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,040
Manager Xi, don't be so upset.

252
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,440
According to your capability,

253
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
you can be a manager everywhere.

254
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,240
But only Ning Yi

255
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,020
regards you as a shop clerk.

256
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,729
I can give you some shops to manage

257
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,130
after you work with me.

258
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,590
You can be the Boss.

259
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,320
Do you mean it?

260
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,030
But before that,

261
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,930
you should make a commitment

262
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,310
to show your loyalty to me.

263
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,630
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

264
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,700
Ning Yi doesn't know about the cloth, the silk,

265
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,950
nor even you.

266
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,380
We are the perfect match.

267
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,930
Did he help you

268
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,080
when you wanted the tributary cloth business?

269
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,830
Why did he allow you to come here alone today?

270
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,169
He can't even give you what you want.

271
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,310
He is not worthy of you.

272
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,690
Only we are a match made in heaven.

273
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,030
Why did you choose a matrilocal husband?

274
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,959
What are you doing?

275
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,519
Wu Qi Hao, you're crazy!

276
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,479
Let go of me! Let go of me!

277
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:34,190
I can do whatever Ning Yi did.

278
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,489
Let me go!

279
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,439
I can't let you go.

280
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,980
I will not let you go for the rest of my life.

281
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,670
What do you want, Wu Qi Hao?

282
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,729
Do you know all the girls

283
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,210
in Jiangning City want to marry me?

284
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,790
But I only like you.

285
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,990
This is your fortune.

286
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,920
I'll help you see that

287
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm better than Ning Yi.

288
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,400
Let go of me, Wu Qi Hao!

289
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,410
Tan'er.

290
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,020
Watch out.

291
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,430
What are you looking at? Hurry up.

292
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,170
Yes.

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Be careful!

294
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,959
You are dead.

295
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,760
You traitor who lived on us but helped others.

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,520
Lao Geng, take care of our Lady.

297
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,890
Listen to me.

298
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,480
Biluochun Tea is boiled by the Fusi Spring.

299
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,750
Commandant Song, please try it out.

300
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,219
The silk in the regions north of the river isn't enough.

301
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,919
Just give to the Su's.

302
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,740
Commandant Song, don't worry about it.

303
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,899
Something's wrong! Something's wrong!

304
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:55,249
Master, Young Master is...

305
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,679
he is almost beaten to death by the Su's matrilocal husband.

306
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,180
What?

307
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,510
Ning Yi, what are you doing?

308
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,709
I'm just an admirer ofTan'er. Is that a heinous crime?

309
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:20,660
Do you know the result if you kill me?

310
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,960
- No, no, don't kill me.
- Stop.

311
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,089
Father. Father, please help me. Don't! Don't!

312
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:32,079
Ning Yi, I'm Song Xian, Commandant of Wu Dynasty.

313
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,750
Do you want to kill him?

314
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,809
You can use this sword to kill him.

315
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,729
I am right here. If you kill him,

316
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,349
I'll bring you to justice and punish you by law.

317
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,490
Right, Ning Yi,

318
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,300
don't kill me.

319
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,179
Tan'er… Tan'er…

320
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,719
Tan'er,

321
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,280
why did you choose such a cowardly matrilocal husband?

322
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,600
What's wrong with me?

323
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,580
If the Su Family gets any type of silk,

324
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,809
then I'll admit I lost.

325
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,310
Enough!

326
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,020
The wind is rising.

327
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,360
Then the Wu Family will go broke now.

328
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,799
Tan'er, you know better than me what Wu Qi Hao is like.

329
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,750
You can't believe him when he said he had the goods.

330
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,800
I didn't know the seller was him.

331
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,650
In the whole of Jiangning City, you can't find any silk.

332
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,910
How could Xi Jun Yu find it?

333
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,329
And it's even somewhere in the eastern market.

334
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:37,330
The Wu Family warehouse is right in the eastern market.

335
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,950

to leave the tributary cloth business to him

498
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,010
in front of the public.

499
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,959
We must stabilize the inside before exploiting the outside.

500
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:05,149
If I were Song Xian, I would kick this stupid partner out first.

501
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:08,820
He came all the way to Jiangning from home in order to earn money.

502
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,440
He hasn't earned much money yet. Now, he gets himself in trouble.

503
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,540
It's not worthy.

504
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,410
[The Master of the Sword]

505
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,330
You'd better read your book.

506
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,060
"The Master of the Sword."

507
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,449
Why did you pay ten times the money to buy the silk bought by the Wu's?

508
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,959
But I failed.

509
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,279
Ten times?

510
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,939
Even if the tributary cloth is profitable, how can we increase the profit tenfold?

511
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,699
First of all, if they want to pay tribute to the Jing Empire,

512
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,710
they must need more than tenfold tributary cloth.

513
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,239
And then if the court can't buy enough cloth,

514
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,619
they will offer a higher price and benefit the people.

515
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,170
I've done the math carefully.

516
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,349
When the price of the silk increases to twenty-five times what it was,

517
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:18,999
by that time with the labors and logistics,

518
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,870
our cost will be much higher than profit.

519
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,700
The Wu Family has more capital than us.

520
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,989
Twenty-five times?

521
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:28,980
How can we compete with him?

522
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,600
What's more, the Commandant Song is behind him.

523
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,429
We might lose all the cloth stores to him if we compete with him.

524
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,789
Then we lose them all.

525
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:39,590
Are you crazy?

526
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,720
It sounds great.

Sister, will Ning Yi's way work?

529
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,480
Why did he ask us to sell these? It looks black and smells stinky.

530
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,180
We haven't sold any by now.

531
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,140
Even the beggars don't want to eat it.

532
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,790
The taste of the preserved eggs is nice.

533
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,110
But it's a pity that no one wants to try it.

534
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,200
What is it?

535
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,559
It's named Songhua eggs.

536
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,719
Do you want to try it?

537
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,889
No, thanks.

[Zhu's Preserved Eggs]

542
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,909
It's a pity to see such soft and beautiful hands touch these black things for a whole day.

543
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:24,660
How about you come back and have a good life with me?

544
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
I promise you'll be rich…

It hurts!

547
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,919
I wondered who would buy these black and ugly eggs.

548
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:36,689
So you just wanted to take advantage of her

Buy it if you want it or get out of my face if you don't,

551
