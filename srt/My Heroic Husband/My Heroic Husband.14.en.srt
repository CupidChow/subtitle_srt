00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,118
- Father.
- Wu Qihao.

5
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:54,079
- Father, calm down!
- Stay there!

6
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,299
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Father, Father!

7
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,399
- Stop there!
- Please calm down.

8
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,458
- Father.
- You ungrateful son!

9
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,359
- Father, Father, Father!
- I will kill you today!

10
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,679
Father, Father, please!

11
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,519
- Please, Father!
- Stay there!

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,958
Please don't, Father!

13
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,299
- Don't hit me!
- Stay!

14
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,879
Father, calm down! Calm down!

15
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,859
Brother Wu.

16
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:21,960
How have you been doing?

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,198
Brother Su, no more civilities.

18
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:29,479
I think we both know why you came here today.

19
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,699
Our Wu's situation is quite obvious.

20
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,259
I won't beat around the bush.

21
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,399
I'm afraid you can't, if you want your money back.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
But...

23
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,799
Brother Wu!

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,538
My son and I have given all our money to you!

25
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:51,038
Now that Commandant Song is dead,

26
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,779
there is no hope for the tributary cloth business.

27
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:57,879
You can't just toss us aside and ignore us!

28
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,618
We invested in Wu's because we trusted you.

29
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,279
Do you want to take our money and run away?

30
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,399
How dare you talk to my father like that!

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,638
Shut up!

32
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,939
Yes.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,998
Brother Su, let me tell you the truth.

34
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:13,198
This black sheep pawned my cloth stores behind my back.

35
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,999
We don't have any money for you now.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,599
Then, what are we supposed to do?

37
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
Although we don't have money,

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,020
I know someone who does.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,438
Is it enough?

40
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,938
Isn't it too little?

41
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:49,039
Seriously?

42
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,058
Add more.

43
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,599
You are so cruel indeed.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,159
This should be enough, right?

45
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,860
Almost.

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,300
Okay, that's it.

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,220
Look.

48
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,699
Guard Geng, are you okay?

49
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,759
I'm good, my Lady.

50
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,418
The paint you made is really waterproof.

51
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,799
The water is completely kept from the cloth.

52
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,198
Of course.

53
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,360
I have never failed.

54
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,619
If it goes well, the paint will be used on the clothes in the stores.

55
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,620
That's a good idea.

56
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,399
What did you put in the paint?

57
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,678
This is a business secret.

58
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,699
I can't tell anyone casually.

59
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,699
What business secret?

60
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,139
What does that mean?

61
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,899
It's something awesome anyway.

62
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:07,059
I can't tell others.

63
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:08,838
You don't want to tell me, right?

64
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,439
- How don't I want to tell you?
- I knew it! You just don't want to tell me.

65
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,978
I'm afraid of eavesdroppers.

66
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,600
We are a family. You can tell me.

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,100
Excuse me.

68
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,658
My clothes are wet. I'm afraid of getting a cold.

69
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,659
I'll go get changed.

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,418
Thank you, Lao Geng.

71
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:23,658
Thanks, Young Master.

72
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:24,858
You guys continue.

73
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,119
I can tell that you just don't want to tell me.

74
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,320
- I also can tell that…
- You asked me to splash the water.

75
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,318
That basin is so heavy.

76
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,850
You are so ruthless to splash the water

77
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,710
directly at Lao Geng's face.

78
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,978
Now you are starting to blame me for it?

79
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,579
You said that the water was not enough and added more.

80
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,778
But I meant more water at his body.

81
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:42,218
So, why didn't you help me?

82
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,398
You let me carry such a heavy basin alone!

83
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,198
Well, people can be careless sometimes.

84
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,079
You just don't want to tell me the formulation.

85
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,359
Brother Li Heng.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,279
Well, what are you studying this time?

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,699
Tan'er, I have something to discuss with you.

88
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,480
Cousin, you can discuss it with the one in charge.

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,500
Discuss with me.

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,159
You two can stop acting in front of me.

91
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,820
I came here for one thing.

92
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,778
Now our Second Uncle is in trouble.

93
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:25,218
Will you two help us or not?

94
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,019
No.

95
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,759
Tan'er!

96
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,660
Cousin, I'm married.

97
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,919
I should set my own family as priority.

98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,199
I can't always help a loser.

99
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,019
You two turned yourselves against ancestor's instructions

100
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,479
and even shut down all Su's Cloth Stores.

101
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,420
Now, you leave us in extreme misery.

102
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,778
- You are just…
- You just don't want to tell me. Now you admit it.

103
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,398
You wanted to have a guess in the first place.

104
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,719
Why is it my fault now?

105
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,318
I thought you didn't want to tell me.

106
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,518
You kept everything from me.

107
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,338
It's all because your cousin is right here.

108
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:19,919
Tan'er, I'm begging you.

109
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,198
Let Li Heng help me.

110
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,059
Just help me pay for the money.

111
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:26,480
After all, we are a family, right?

112
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,680
Zhu Ji is also part of Su's property.

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,599
That's right. Zhu Ji is part of Su's property.

114
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,339
I bought a share in the name of Tan'er.

115
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,600
But that's Tan'er's money.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,479
When did you do that?

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,719
I didn't know it at all.

118
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,418
I was planning to surprise you.

119
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:49,838
What surprise?

120
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,039
I can tell you just don't want to tell me.

121
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,838
It's not like that.

122
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,479
You don't want to tell me the formulation

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,699
nor did you tell me about the purchase.

124
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,878
I was planning to tell you on your birthday to make you happy.

125
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,039
That's an excuse!

126
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,078
Li Heng, please, I'm still here.

127
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
Sorry, Cousin.

128
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,359
We're a family.

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,319
So we shouldn't keep anything from each other.

130
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,399
Let's just be open and speak what's on our mind.

131
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,899
Okay.

132
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,919
Can you pay for the money?

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,238
Sure. Of course I can.

134
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,639
I have enough money.

135
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,479
But I can't give it to you.

136
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,880
Deliver my words to the person behind you.

137
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,280
Tell him to beg me in person.

138
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:53,739
Tan'er, didn't you want to know about the paint?

139
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,340
Let me tell you.

140
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,538
Why do I think cousin is kind of cute today?

141
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,000
He's just like a blockhead.

142
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,679
You did well today.

143
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,279
Keep going!

144
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,360
Don't be bullied by him again.

145
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,080
So, do I have to handle it alone?

146
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Well, you may have to.

147
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,058
You know Su Wenxing better than I do.

148
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:16,399
He'd never learn any lesson.

149
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,440
Although he humbly begged you today, he'll forget all of it tomorrow.

150
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
You worked hard.

151
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,060
Can't you face it with me together?

152
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,219
Open the door! Pay the money!
[Wu's Cloth Store]

153
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:42,760
Pay the money! Open the door! Open the door!

154
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,800
Young Master Wu, I'm just here to tell you that Ning Li Heng wants to see you in person.

155
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,080
Why am I being trapped with you here?

156
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,938
Why can't you shut up?

157
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,180
You!

158
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,319
Someone's inside!

159
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:59,099
Pay the money! Pay the money!

160
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,379
Where's my money?

161
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,199
You all wanted to cooperate with us!

162
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:14,639
Now you start to kicking us when we are weak.

163
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,059
You owe me money! Why are you still confident?!

164
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,100
Okay. We can talk!

165
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,020
Since you don't have any conscience, no one will cooperate with you.

166
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,040

I am just so kind.

00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,279
I'll take all the silk,

00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,659
no matter how much you have.

244
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,840
But,

245
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,559
I only offer 10% of the original price.

246
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,099
10%?

247
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,920
Are you pushing me over the edge?

If you are not willing to, just forget it.

249
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:03,398
Young Master Ning,

250
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:06,398
70%. What about 70%?

251
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:08,140
10%.

252
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,079
Brother Ning. 50%? 50%!

253
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,340
10%.

254
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:22,219
Li Heng, you can't be too heartless!

255
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:24,340
Cousin,

256
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,060
it's you who are begging me.

257
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,039
I'm not forcing you.

258
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,438
10% is fine. It's better than nothing. Say yes or he's leaving.

259
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,240
Young Master Ning!

260
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,439
10%.

261
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
10%, it is.

262
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,100
But can you please

263
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,860
tell me

264
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,120
how did you do all of this from the moment

265
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,200
you threatened to bankrupt my family?

266
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,280
Okay.

267
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,099
I never wanted to

268
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,459
fight for silk in the first place.

269
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,899
The reason why I bid up the price of silk with you

270
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:23,000
is just to lead you to the trap.

271
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,478
Silk

272
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:30,380
is not a kind of commodity that can be paid and delivered at the same time.

273
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,519
The price of future goods fluctuates.

274
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,358
When I anticipated its price was going to fall, I sold all of it.

275
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:43,358
When the frenzy was over, I'd buy it from you at a low price.

276
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:46,580
This is called short selling.

277
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:49,799
Silk is of a kind of futures, not spot goods.

278
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,139
You need to wait for a while before you get the silk.

279
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:56,878
During this period, if the price of silk shoots up,

280
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:58,719
silk merchants become excited.

281
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,999
So, you asked Manager Liao to put up the notice of buying silk

282
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,918
ten times the original price at the stores.

283
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:09,039
I just wanted to set up a trap for Wu Qi Hao.

284
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,279
I didn't want the silk at all.

285
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,838
Because it's still too early. We need a hedge against loss.

286
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,240
A hedge against loss?

287
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,638
So, we decided to sell preserved eggs and collected ready money.

288
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:25,659
You stopped silk merchants who wanted to breach the contract in the name of Song Xian.

289
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,318
While I closed all of our stores.

290
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:33,519
But you thought you stole all Su's customers and wiped us out,

291
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,980
we were forced to close stores.

292
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,159
Commandant Song issued a new document.

293
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,720
You thought that's not enough and wanted to push me over the edge.

294
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,999
But you neglected one thing.

295
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,919
Without the main street, we can still set up our stands in the alleys.

296
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,838
People living there

297
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,159
are more representative of the general public in Jiangning.

298
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,798
Our business went well and we have collected a lot of ready money.

299
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,399
Then I thought we could start the Zhu Ji Club to collect people's information

300
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,639
and analyze their preferences.

301
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,598
It looks like we're trying to sell more eggs.

302
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,320
But in fact, it's to bring an innovation to the cloth business.

303
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,239
Haven't you handed over the tributary cloth business to Wenxing?

304
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,999
Give it back to us.

305
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,040
I found an opportunity to make Commissioner Han change his mind.

306
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,920
- What do you want me for?
- Wenxing,

307
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,860
give all the silk you bought from Jiangbei to your cousin.

308
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,479
The orders from Wenxing are all handed to me.

309
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,199
But it's not my intention to get the silk.

310
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,920
I just wanted to bid up the price.

311
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,479
I have some silk from Jiangbei.

312
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,439
I want to sell it to you off the market price.

313
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,318
Luckily, Boss Xue also wanted to join in.

314
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,359
So we took this chance to sell all the silk to him.

315
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,838
I asked friends to spread the rumor that

316
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,798
the court is buying more tributary cloth.

317
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,358
All cloth store owners in Jiangning were eager to buy it.

318
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,240
But Boss Xue turned down all of them and waited for you.

319
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,999
But you didn't show up.

320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,160
I guessed Xi Junyu stopped you.

321
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,479
So, I asked a friend for a favor

322
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,400
to sow discord between Xi Junyu and you.

323
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,039
Later, you really bought Xue's silk at a high price.

324
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,999
But this move had provoked

325
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,240
the silk merchants who sold their silk at a normal price.

326
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,318
It was easy to incite them to breach the contracts with you.

327
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,639
You are too overconfident, so you'd definitely raise the praise.

328
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,239
In this case, you used up all of Wu's money.

329
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,239
Soon after, Boss Xue told me

330

00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,800
If you do as the book states,

496
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,580
the problems between you and your daughter will gone.

497
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:31,020
You can get this ahead there. Go ahead.

498
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,118
Your steamed buns.

499
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,279
Be careful.

500
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,820
Food's enough for you.

501
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,420
- Here, your steamed buns.
- You can get more if it's not enough.

502
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,360
You can get this ahead there.

503
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,960
- Here, hold it firmly.
- Thanks.

504
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,198
No hurry!

505
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,080
Please line up! It's enough for every one of you.

506
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,238
Now that the Sus have become the richest family in Jiangning,

507
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,558
they set up the food shed to help the poor.

508
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,038
They're truly a good example!

509
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,238
It's such a magnificent feat for the Elder Master

510
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,999
to hand over the seal to his granddaughter.

511
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,678
That's right.

512
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,558
Come on.

513
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,259
Hand these out, too.

514
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,580
Thanks.

515
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,580
You can get it over there.

516
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,660
Come on.

517
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,260
[Su Manor]

518
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,759
I suggest we get a bronze pot after we go back home.

519
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,638
And I will buy some mutton and beef slices.

520
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,718
You go grind the sesame into sauce.

521
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,558
Let's eat hot pot with it.

522
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,799
Grind sesame into sauce and eat hot pot?

523
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,700
You never tried that before, right?

524
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,040
Lady Su,

525
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,158
can we talk for a moment?

526
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,599
Xi Junyu, what's the trick this time?

527
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,500
Look out!

528
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,860
Don't move.

529
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,000
Get your hand out of your boot!

530
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:20,559
Drop it!

531
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,678
Let go of me! Don't move.

532
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,439
Don't hit him!

533
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,518
Come on.

534
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,179
Anyone wants to die?

535
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,560
Are you okay?

536
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,038
This is called blunderbuss.

537
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,638
Amazing, huh?

538
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,800
I don't care about it. I'm asking you!

539
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,180
I'm as good as this blunderbuss.

540
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,970
[See you in the bamboo forest in the northern suburbs]

541
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,059
The hero who saved us just now

542
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,019
is also your friend?

543
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,419
That was my Master.

544
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,518
Thank you for your help.

545
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,119
I really appreciate it.

546
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,199
What is this?

547
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,039
300 Moves of Practical Martial Arts.

548
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,200
Master, you are going to teach me martial arts?

549
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,158
Before I start learning this, shall we get new names?

550
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,518
I've got one for myself.

551
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,198
I'm Bloody Killer.

552
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:32,638
- Master, you are…
- Lu Hong Ti.

553
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,419
You got a name!

554
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:37,860
Lu Hong Ti?

555
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,139
Sounds delicious.

556
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:41,839
Cut the crap!

557
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,839
Yes, Master!

558
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,739
Then, let's begin.

559
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,240
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
 Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

560
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,930
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

561
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,620
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

562
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,140
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

563
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:00,650
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

564
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,210
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

565
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,000
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

566
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,960
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

567
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

568
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,320
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

569
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,430
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

570
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,660
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

571
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,880
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

572
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,190
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

573
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,240
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

574
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,490
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫

575
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,560
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

576
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,890
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

577
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,930
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

578
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,310
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫

579
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:04,320
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

580
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,600
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

581
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,600
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

582
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:18,690
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫
